However, briefly:1. SKOUSEN's BACKGROUNDI am the first person to request and obtain Skousen's FBI personnel file and related documents (1900+ pages). Skousen misrepresented his FBI experience. It was primarily administrative -- not investigative -- and he had very little exposure to internal security matters.[...]2. NAKED CAPITALIST (Review of Quigley's Tragedy and Hope)(a) Quigley's book contains no footnotes or bibliography. Consequently, there is no way to confirm the accuracy of anything he presents.(b) Skousen never contacted Quigley to ask him any questions or to request copies of any documents in his possession---even though he cites Quigley as an authoritative source.(c) Quigley explicitly described Skousen (and Gary Allen who also made comparable comments about Quigley's book) as intellectually dishonest in their use of material from Quigley's book.3. SKOUSEN ON JACOB SCHIFF / BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTIONThe claims made by Skousen (also repeated by Gary Allen in his book, None Dare Call it Conspiracy) about wealthy members of \\"the elite\\" who \\"financed\\" revolutions have been discredited by such scholars as Dr. Antony Sutton.The FBI's Central Research Section wrote an 11-page critique of Skousen's 3/71 article in Law and Order magazine entitled \\"Home Grown Subversion\\". This article repeats many of the assertions made by Skousen in Naked Capitalist.When J. Edgar Hoover learned that Skousen had written his article in Law and Order, Hoover handwrote an inquiry on an internal FBI memo, which asked if data in FBI investigative files could authenticate what Skousen presented.The Central Research Section took 2 weeks to check all of Skousen's references (there weren't very many) plus they checked all data contained in FBI files and in relevant Congressional hearings.I copy below a pertinent excerpt from the FBI review memo.Page 1: \\"Synopsis\\"\\"Purpose of memorandum is to answer Director's inquiry regarding article captioned as above in March 1971 issue of Law and Order magazine...We are circumspect with Skousen because of his efforts to capitalize on Bureau career to benefit his anticommunist activities. Article claims \`dynastic rich' (inheritors of wealth) subsidizing \`force of violent revolution' to help rich take over country for \`good' of humanity.Skousen's claim that Karl Marx turned to \`democratic socialism' as means to seize power not substantiated. Marx never renounced violence of class struggle or proletarian revolution. Skousen claim that wealthy class financed Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 not supported by research and his charge that Jacob Schiff of Kuhn, Loeb and Company gave $20 million for \` final triumph of Bolshevism' not validated.Skousen's allegations that tax exempt foundations have given money to civil rights groups and functionaries, including several militant black nationalists are generally valid but include inaccuracies. Several grants verified, as listed by Skousen, from Ford Foundation to organizations he alleges carry out \`policies and propaganda favoring a globalist strategy.' Skousen's reference to \`left-wing collectivists' seeking Federal constitutional convention is unsubstantiated. Only such effort known was made by late Senator Everett Dirksen who wanted amendment negating U.S. Supreme Court 1964 \`one man, one vote' ruling which calls for equal population in voting districts.\\"Page 3\\"Claims Regarding Financing The Russian Revolution\\"One especially dubious claim by Skousen is that scholars are beginning to discover that, wherever Communist revolutions have succeeded, it has been due to financial aid by some of the wealthiest people in the world. As evidence for this claim, Skousen maintains that several \`dynastic banking families' financed the Communist revolution in Russia.According to Skousen, Leon Trotsky, in his biography, refers to some of the \`loans' coming from British financiers as far back as 1907. Trotsky's book, \`My Life' (page 202) mentions only one such loan, that of 3000=2 0pounds by an \`English liberal' to help cover some expenses of the 1907 Bolshevik Party Congress in London. Trotsky states that years later the Soviet Government paid back the loan for which all Congress delegates had been cosigners.\\"Page 4: \\"British Subsidies\\"\\"By 1917, Skousen asserts, the major subsidies for \`the revolution' were being arranged by Sir George Buchanan, then British Ambassador to Russia and Lord Alfred Milner who was in Russia as a special representative. One source suggested by Skousen refers merely to \`private interviews' not further identified, as documentation for the above claim. A second source, citing hearsay, refers only to British aid to the March 1917 revolution that overthrew Czar Nicholas II but not to any aid of the Bolshevik Revolution of November 1917.\\"\\"Jacob Schiff\\"\\"Skousen charges that Jacob Schiff (1847-1920) of the New York investment banking firm, Kuhn, Loeb and Company, furnished the Communist leaders around $20 million for the \`final triumph of Bolshevism' in Russia. This figure is reportedly cited in the February 3, 1949 edition of the now defunct \`New York Journal American' by Jacob Schiff's grandson. According to his biographer, C.A. Adler, Jacob Schiff in his letters and speeches blamed the Russian Imperial government of Czar Nicholas II for anti-Jewish policies and practices and personally gave about $500,000 for relief of Jews in Russia prior to 1917. Schiff later was reportedly sympathetic to the Provisional Government, providing one million rubles for its \`liberty loan' in April 1917, but was strongly opposed to the Communists in Russia.Review of microfilm records of the February 3, 1949 New York Journal American failed to locate any article about Jacob Schiff and possible financing of the Bolsheviks as Skousen alleges. No evidence was found to substantiate Skousen's claim that between 1918 and 1922, Levin paid back 600 million rubles to Kuhn, Loeb and Company. It is noted that notorious anti-FBI critic, Dorothy Schiff of the New York Post, is a granddaughter of Jacob Schiff.\\"[NOTE: The reason why the Bureau could not find \\"any article about Jacob Schiff\\" in the 2/3/49 issue of the NY Journal American is because it was NOT an article! Gary Allen used this same reference on page 69 of his book, None Dare Call it Conspiracy. In reality, the \\"quote\\" appears in a society gossip column by an unknown person who wrote the gossip column under the pseudonym \\"Cholly Knickerbocker\\". This is what passes for \\"factual \\"evidence\\" in conspiracy circles and which people like Gary Allen and Cleon Skousen foist upon gullible and ill-informed people! Also see Dr. Antony Sutton's rebuttal of the claim regarding Schiff's support of the Bolsheviks in Appendix II of his 2001 book, WALL STREET AND THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION. Appendix II is captioned \\"THE JEWISH-CONSPIRACY THEORY OF THE BOLSHEVIK REVOLUTION\\".]Page 5:\\"Hearings Regarding Schiff, 1918Allegations that Jacob Schiff and other Jewish investment bankers helped to finance the Communist revolution in Russia have appeared in the past. In 1959, at the Director's instructions, such an allegation against Jacob Schiff was checked out in a review of the hearings conducted in December 1918 by a Subcommittee of the Committee of the Judiciary, United States Senate. Entitled \`Brewing and Liquor Interests and German Propaganda' the hearings also covered Russian and Bolshevik activities in this country and Europe prior to that time. The hearings absolved Kuhn, Loeb and Company of alleged pro-German sympathies and failed to bring out any information indicating that Jacob Schiff helped to finance the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. [FBI file 100-407194-6].Skousen's claim that other international bankers were involved in financing the Communist takeover apparently comes from a book, \`Czarism and Revolution' by Arsene de Goulevitch, a former Czarist Army officer who fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution. Goulevitch in turn attributes the information to a document published in Rostov, Russia, in 1919 which reportedly attributed the information to the archives of a high French Government office (not identified).From the same sources Skousen notes that Trotsky later (after 1917) married the daughter of one wealthy contributing banker named Jivotovsky. Trotsky's book. My Life, and all available biographies on Trotsky contain no references to the name Jivotovsky and indicate that Trotsky's second marriage, about 1904, lasted until his assassination in 1940 in Mexico City."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"In response to those trying to link Skousen to Carrol Quigely, do a little research. Like much of Skousen's work, \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" is really just a collection of half-formed ideas, personal biases and fear. The scholarhip of the book is shaky at best and the one scholar, Georgetown University historian Carroll Quigley, who Skousen claimed endorsed Skousen's ideas in the book, did everything he could to distance himself from Skousen.[...] to the 1971 issue of the journal Dialogue, where Quigely denounces Skousen's ideas and calls him dishonest.\\"Skousen's personal position,\\" Quigley wrote, \\"seems to me perilously close to the 'exclusive uniformity' which I see in Nazism and in the Radical Right in this country. In fact, his position has echoes of the original Nazi 25-point plan.\\""},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"Skousen misrepresents Quigley's own words on some key points in his attempt to push his (Skousen's) own agenda. Here is what Quigley says about the overthrow of Chiang Kai-Shek:-----Chiang Kai-shek was a man of considerable ability and experience, and may not himself have been involved in the corruption of his regime, but he was deeply involved personally with cliques and gangs of persons whose chief aims were to profit from their public positions and from their close associations with Chiang and to resist, by any means, efforts to reform or strengthen China which might reduce their opportunities for corruption. These relationships, in 1945, in some cases had continued for almost twenty years. American aid and the contributions of the Chinese themselves disappeared in the network of corrupt and mutually beneficial relationships which were spread throughout the system and which made it impossible for the Chiang regime to provide a decent living for the people of China or even to defend itself against possible enemies, internal or external. Arms and supplies from abroad were dissipated, vanishing in one way or another, sometimes forever; but on other occasions they turned up subsequently in the hands of guerillas or of the Communist enemies of Chiang's regime. An enormous and incompetent army drained from the peasants, at low prices, large requisitions which were sold, usually for private profit, at high prices into urban black markets. In the two years following the defeat of Japan, $1,432 million in American assistance to China vanished in one way or another, and at the end the Chinese Army and the Chiang regime was weaker than ever.------- Quigley, TRAGEDY & HOPE, pp. 905-6.Everything which Quigley states here about how the criminality of the Kuomintang brought about its overthrow can be studied in great detail in such works as Suzanne Pepper, CIVIL WAR IN CHINA. Skousen however misrepresents both the events in China, as well Quigley's textual comments about events in China, in order so as to mislead the reader into thinking that somehow Quigley has \\"admitted\\" that Mao was brought to power by a Wall Street conspiracy. It should be emphasized that even had Quigley made such an idiotic statement, it wouldn't count against the overwhelming historical evidence which shows that Chiang Kai-Shek was overthrown because he was totally out of touch with his own people. But Skousen actually misrepresents Quigley's own statements so that something like the above passage cited from Quigley's own text is hard to imagine if you gain your impressions of Quigley from Skousen. It's not an honest book by Skousen and shouldn't be mistaken for such. This was Skousen's own attempt to push his ideological agenda, no more, no less."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"I ordered this book and Tragedy and Hope, at the same time, thinking from reviews already posted here that it would be a good primer before delving into Quigley's Tragedy and Hope. I am sorry I did.Rather than give a fair summary of the book, it became quite clear early on that the author was using hand picked quotations from Tragedy and Hope, not so much to summarize it and compare it to Quigley's other works, but \\"to prove\\" prophecies depicted in the book of Revelation.In light of what is going on today on the world stage, it's pretty obvious there are some unsavory characters within or financial institutions and political machines to warrant grave concern over the future of this country, but I think it does not serve conservatives well to analyze the situation in a religious context. If anything, it hurt's, not helps an objective analysis of not only Quigley, but the politics that shape world events.Skousen calls for \\"conservatives\\" to infiltrate one of the parties and begin their own witch hunt that will influence public opinion. If you look at the state of the GOP right now, I'd say that is exactly what has happened. They have purged any group of people that doesn't see world events as they interpret it will unfold through Revelation.Granted there is much to worry about in regard to government being overly centralized and political corruption, but Skousen doesn't do anything in presenting his case that helps me alleviate these concerns.Fascism and communism are kissin' cousins and it seems to me Skousen leans a little more towards the \\"F\\" word.I will still read Quigley's book and decide for myself what it supposedly alludes to and/or reveals about our times, but The Naked Capitalist was not written in such a way where I can rely on it being a reliable \\"cliff notes\\"."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"\\"The Naked Capitalist\\" was written by W. Cleon Skousen as a sort of book report or summary of Dr. Carroll Quigley's 1300 + page tome \\"Tragedy and Hope - A History of the World in our Time. \\"W. Cleon Skousen, after passing the D.C. Bar exam, was hired by the FBI in the capacity of a special agent. W. Cleon Skousen spent 16 years in J. Edgar Hoover's Bureau before leaving to teach at BYU.Dr. Carroll Quigley was mostly known as professor of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University; however, Professor Quigley also taught at other ivy league schools and served on various boards and panels for the government including the U.S. Navy and Department of Defense.Dr. Quigley writes about a secret cabal of power brokers and investment bankers whose goal is a one world super state. Although the cabal started in England, it eventually was brought to the U.S. through J.P. Morgan and Rockefeller.The Rhodes -Milner Group, as in Cecil Rhodes and Lord Alfred Milner, is a secret society formed by Cecil Rhodes in the later part of the 19th century with the goal of world domination. This group is the group that Dr. Quigley is writing about. This cabal used a series of sub groups called the \\"Roundtables\\" to institute their will across the globe. Some of the organizations created by the cabal are:The Rhodes' Scholarship is one method of recruitment of new talent into the cabal.\\"The Council on Foreign Relations\\" in the U.S. and their Counterpart in Britain \\"The Institute on Royal Affairs\\"The following is a quote from Quigley's \\"Tragedy and Hope\\"\\"The powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences. The apex of the system was the Bank for International Settlements in Basle, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds' central banks which were themselves private corporations. The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralization of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury of all other economic groups.\\"After reading the above quote, it is easy to understand why Skousen called his book \\"The Naked Capitalist\\". In \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" Skousen methodically removes the cover built up by the Rhodes-Milner cabal and leaves their plans naked for all to see.I highly recommend reading \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" not only because the sheer length of \\"Tragedy and Hope\\" will deter some from obtaining knowledge of the true history of the twentieth century , but also because of the perspective of Skousen himself. Dr. Quigley wasn't opposed to the goals of the cabal, he just didn't believe it should be kept secret. Unlike Quigley, Skousen was totally opposed to these goals. \\"Tragedy and Hope\\" was published in 1966.

Conspiracies are not conducted in the bright sunlight for all to see, so any contemporaneous book attempting to expose them will most likely be shown to contain errors if scrutinized 40 years later.

Read his other reviews. According to himself, he is sifting through thousands of pages of documents searching for the nuggets that will debunk these \\"Conspiracy Theory\\" books, and save us from believing such kook theories. Perhaps Ernie would like us to believe that there are no more conspiracies attempting to grab power, to enslave the masses, or to rule the world. Sure there have been plenty of historical conspiracies, but as a world population, we have evolved past this. Human nature has changed! There are no more conspiracies anywhere in the world.

Cleon Skousen\\"A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, winks with his eyes, scrapes with his feet, points with his finger, with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. There are six things the Lord hates, seven of which are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood. A heart that devices wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and a man who sows discord among brothers.\\" Proverbs 6:12-19 RSVThe above verse if the first thing that came to my mind once I finished reading this fine book. Skousen in \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" is really describing the events from 1913 through the 1960's that will someday lead to The New World Order. There have been so many great reviews on this book on Amazon.com that I would encourage the reader to not only read this review but the others as well. Skousen's book is a summary of Dr. Caroll Quigley's (a professor of Bill Clinton, and an insider to the New World Order boys) Book \\"Tragedy and Hope\\" in which Quigley being an insider and allowed to review the CFR's (Council On Foreign Relations) documents for two years in which he decided to write a book since he felt that there was no way we could stop this socialist empire now. Here are some of the highlights from this book that stuck out to me:We were actually making post war plans to World War 2 a whole two years prior to entering the war (this is where we got the United Nations from).The international bankers financed two conservative candidates to split the vote so Woodrow Wilson would be elected to office. Woodrow Wilson signed into law the Federal Reserve which is actually a private banking system. This took the power of making money away from congress and gave it to a private bank. (Does anyone recall the bible verse that says, \\"The borrower is slave to the lender.\\")The international bankers are in Europe, the United States and setting up shop everywhere. Since they came into power they have set up communist government after communist government because it's easier to work with a dictator and get rich than it is with a free society.These bankers will usually finance both sides of a war, and have been linked to just about every war since they took power. They also make a lot of profit, and as Skousen points out their oil plants and businesses are conveniently not hurt even though thousands upon thousands may die for their gain.I enjoyed Skousen's ability to break down the Korean War and show how (with facts that are documented from sources in the back) Communists within the United States working in high positions of power were playing both sides. The plan was for the U.S. to fight for South Korea, oh but wait, we were supposed to lose. When our military was TOO good there were 100,000 Red Chinese waiting for them. Our military was not allowed to take our Chinese supply lines or to go in and take territory. I mean the communists in Washington had it all set up and we were supposed to lose. What right did our military have actually being good.The CFR (Council On Foreign Relations) is a front group by the international bankers (like the Royal Institute Of International Affairs is in Europe) . This council works for the international bankers and supports socialist causes.The builderberg group is a small group of elites that meet once a year and plan the direction of the world and it's propaganda for the next year. It is very secretive and if someone finds out your invited your invite is automatically revoked. Group made up of large corporate heads, political leaders, media elite, and the international bankers.Tax exempt foundations are influencing public policy and directly influencing our schools. They are pushing propaganda and dumbing down our society. These foundations oddly enough are places the big corporate big wigs and international bankers can stash their money and not get taxed.Bottom Line: I could go on and on.... Read the book it's only about 125 pages, but it is loaded with some of the most important information you could want or know about our government and the New World Order."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"This is the original book that exposed and documented the power wielded by the Council on Foreign Relations and other interrelated elite groups.

Then you realize that reading &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;, as confirmed in other reviews, is a daunting task for the first 7 or 8 hundred pages. Then it gets really interesting and we begin to see that Mr. Skousen has presented a very balanced review, and an explosive commentary, on the world as &quot;Hope&quot; portrays.I had the rare chance to hear W. Cleon Skousen speak about the time &quot;The Naked Capitalist&quot; was first published, and the 6 hours of audio tapes I got from those sessions filled in, nicely, the information outlined in his book about the implications of &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;.Once one reads &quot;The Naked Capitalist&quot; for the seventeenth time, one realizes that Mr. Skousen's comments about the events around the world, put in the context of the information contained in &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;, fit together extremely well.There is no way that this is all fiction, as contained in both books, as some reviewers have stated. Those reviewers' comments must be viewed with skepticism, as they are precisely the kinds of comments meant by the &quot;Power Bloc&quot;, as Skousen called it, to throw &quot;us little people&quot; off the trail of the truth. Too many of the people and events mentioned can be independently confirmed as having done or happened as both books state.If you REALLY want an eye-opening experience, just read the membership roster of the Council on Foreign Relations, and then ponder what Quigley exposed and Skousen discussed, about people who are, or were, members of the CFR. Its membership roster reads like a &quot;Who's Who&quot; in the world today."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"Despite the considerable reading that I do, it was most helpful to have this book as both a capstone to reading Quigley'sTragedy & Hope: A History of the World in Our Time, and as a form of Cliff's Notes.

General Butler was one of the most decorated Marines in history, and in his book he publicly denounces the role of the Marine Corps as an enforcer for the US banks. Then of course you haveConfessions of an Economic Hit Manwhich I judge to be 15% fluff and 85% raw gold substance.So there you have it--books like this are now entering the consciousness of the middle class, and with Lou Dobbs leading the pack, the middle class is beginning to rouse from its passive acceptance of elitist screw jobs on Congress, the White House, the economy, the military, and the poor. We *are* farm animals from whom profit is being harvested, and we will remain farm animals for so long as we fail to read and think and discuss and demand.I end by urging one and all to join Reuniting America, and demand Electoral Reform as the one non-negotiable expecation from the current Congress and before November 2008."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"This book continues to be a great reference on the elitist process.

However, if the elites can't instigate a popular conflict, they will keep lending these poor countries money at the American taxpayers' expense, and when they can't pay it back, or their economic bubble explodes, the elites own them.Skousen's book is ageless, and makes a great reading for the curious mind."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"\\"I think the Communist conspiracy is merely a branch of a much bigger conspiracy!\\"~ Dr. Bella Dodd; former member of the National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party.W. Cleon Skousen spent 16 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigations and was, for 4 years, the Chief of Police in Salt Lake City. Skousen was also a university professor for 7 years and spent a decade as the Editorial Director of \\"Law And Order\\", at the time, the nation's preeminent law enforcement magazine.In 1970, Skousen wrote \\"THE NAKED CAPITALIST\\", his extensive, book-length review of Dr. Carroll Quigley's infamous 1966, 1,300 page book \\"TRAGEDY AND HOPE: A HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN OUR TIME.\\" Quigley was a highly regarded professor of history at Georgetown University, a member of the editorial board of the periodical \\"Current History\\", and a great influence on the young Bill Clinton. (It should be remembered that during his first inaugural address, Bill Clinton publicly thanked Carroll Quigley for mentoring him.)Skousen's \\"THE NAKED CAPITALIST\\" begins by asking \\"WHY?: Why do some of the richest people in the world support Communism and Socialism? Why would they support what appears to be the pathway to their own destruction? Dr. Carroll Quigley of Harvard, Princeton and Georgetown universities states that he has been associated with many of these dynastic families of the super-rich. He therefore writes as an authority on the world's secret power structure. His answers to the above questions may astonish you.\\"The author then proceeds to examine in-depth the various facets of an Elite \\"Insiders\\" plan to gain global control - a complex plan that Quigley claimed to have knowledge of as a result of having been granted permission to study the secret papers of this Elite. And it is an agenda that Quigley supported.Skousen's book is a very straightforward account, a distillation of Quigley's massive tome that necessarily covers a large variety of interrelated topics such as: International banking and economic monopolies; the strange promotion of Communism and Socialism from U.S. Government departments; the linking of American presidents to Revolutionary movements abroad; the creation of the Federal Reserve System; the influence of John Ruskin on Fabian Socialists and the Feminist movement; the anti-American activities of supposedly \\"American\\" tax-exempt foundations; the goal behind the establishment of the Council on Foreign Relations, and more. This relatively slim volume is packed with shocking information gleaned from the publication of a respected and well-informed scholar on the \\"Inside\\" of American power.You may live in this country, but chances are you have no idea how this country really operates, and why so many seemingly nonsensical decisions are made year after year by U.S. government representatives in Washington D.C. who ought to know better. Well, don't assume that they DON'T know better! Don't accept the idea that they are incomprehensibly stupid AND that they just happened to rise to highly influential positions in government; that their errors in judgment are mere mistakes. Life rarely works that way. As President Franklin Roosevelt once said: \\"In politics nothing happens by accident. If it happened, you can bet it was planned that way.\\"W. Cleon Skousen's \\"THE NAKED CAPITALIST\\" will go a long way toward educating you about the world you live in. I recently created a 3-part Ammyland \\"So You'd Like To...\\" Guide titled, STOP BEING A \\"USEFUL IDIOT\\", and I quoted from Skousen's excellent examination of Quigley's book and recommended it (along with A. Ralph Epperson's equally excellentThe Unseen Hand\\" ) as an overview to the Elite's conspiracy. It is an ideal place to begin your journey to truth, and every \\"Loose Dog\\" (i.e., Neo-American Revolutionary resisting \\"The New World Order\\") should be familiar with it.Be advised that a number of editions of this title are available on this site, and if you don't mind an older, used copy, you might obtain \\"THE NAKED CAPITALIST\\" less expensively by reentering the title under the \\"Books\\" category and checking out the numerous other Product Pages for the various editions of Skousen's publication.

STOP BEING A USEFUL IDIOT\\", accessible by clicking on my name above and then scrolling down my Ammyland Profile Page to the \\"So You'd Like To...\\" Guide category located toward the bottom of the page.\\"Dr. Dodd said she first became aware of some mysterious super-leadership right after World War II when the U.S. Communist Party had difficulty getting instructions from Moscow on several vital matters requiring immediate attention. The American Communist hierarchy was told that any time they had an emergency of this kind they should contact any one of three designated persons at the Waldorf Towers. Dr. Dodd noted that whenever the Party obtained instructions from any of these three men, Moscow always ratified them. What puzzled Dr. Dodd was the fact that not one of these three contacts was a Russian. Nor were any of them Communists. In fact, all three were extremely wealthy American capitalists! Dr. Dodd said, \`I would certainly like to find out who is really running things.' \\" [~Page 1]"},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"Like others, I sought out, among other books, \\"Tragedy and Hope\\" by Dr. Quigley, Clinton's Foreign Service School professor at Georgetown to look up Skousen's references for myself after reading \\"The Naked Capitalist.\\" As it turns out, Quigley's book was just one source for Skousen.In the back of his book, Skousen describes the idealogical shift of the depression-era Democratic party the same way my liberal American government professor from an urban metropolitan university did in one of my class lectures several years ago.I was fascinated by Skousen's discussion on how tax-exempt foundations can be used to wield great influence in world affairs by destabilizing and indebting governemts on the one hand while encouraging the West to make charitable donations for \\"worthy causes\\" on the other. I couldn't help but noting the similarities between Skousen's take on tax-exempt foundations and the establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. After establishing their foundation, the \\"M\\" stock symbol on the NYSE was made available to Microsoft for the taking - Microsoft declined and elected to remain on the NASDAQ. (Macy's department stores have the NYSE \\"M\\" slot now). Also, after Bill Gates established his foundation and went abroad saying that computers couldn't solve the third world's problems (an odd sentiment for one of the world's foremost capitalists), the governemt antitrust suit against Microsoft fizzled into oblivion. Bill Gates acquiesced to \\"play ball\\" by using his excess fortune in the same way described in Skousen's book.When the issue of lowering inheritance taxes came up in the news a few years ago round about that same time, Bill Gates' father who headed up the Gates Foundation publicly spoke out against lowering the tax, reasoning that trillions of dollars stands to change hands over the next few years between boomers and their children; when aging boomers are faced with the choice of bequeathing their estate to their children and losing a substantial amount in taxes or bequeathing it to a tax-exempt foundation, they'd give it to a foundation. In essence, the inheritance tax helps ensure their continued existence.Is this the \\"noose around the neck\\" of the working class that Quigley alludes to in \\"Tragedy and Hope?\\"For further insight and corroboration, read \\"Phillip Dru: Administrator\\" by Edward Mandell \\"Colonel\\" House, one of FDR's top advisors and chief architect of the New Deal.For an entertaining and well-informed look at American and world affairs, watch the 1976 miniseries, \\"Captains and the Kings\\", starring Richard Jordan based on the Tayler Caldwell novel.Skousen isn't making this stuff up."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"\\"The Naked Capitalist\\", first published in 1970, is a review and critique of a much longer book, \\"Tragedy and Hope\\", first published in 1965. While the references are inevitably dated, this book contains insights that are essential for understanding our current situation. While I wholeheartedly recommend it, it important to take into account the book's context and point of view.This book must be understood as an attack from the right on \\"Tragedy and Hope\\" -- not the 21st century neocon right, but the old fashioned right that may be best thought of as a libertarian point of view these days. Mr. Skousen's approach is consistent with his conservative religious background (LDS) and his background in law enforcement (FBI and later Salt Lake City Chief of Police). Skousen's academic background is reflected in his exegesis of \\"Tragedy and Hope\\".I thought his defense of J. Edgar Hoover and Joe McCarthy was thought provoking, and not to be dismissed out of hand as most left-leaning people would tend to do. By illustrating the clear link between the Eastern Establishment and Communism, the author perhaps provides a better understanding of the criticism of corporate media as \\"Liberal\\". Corporate owned media did at times cover the issue of Communists in government in a way that tended to downplay the extent to which the government, particularly the State Department, was infiltrated by Communists, which could lead a right-wing or even a neutral observer to believe that the fourth estate had Communist sympathies.But that's only part of the story. The corporate owned media has also had a history of covering up the extent to which Fascism has infested USA finance, corporations and government. One example from the time span that Skousen focused on, but which he failed to mention, is the Fascist plot to overthrow the US government shortly after the start of FDR's first term. Jules Archer's recently re-printed book,The Plot to Seize the White House: The Shocking True Story of the Conspiracy to Overthrow FDR, tells this story persuasively. The earliest incarnation of the HUAC (House Committee on Un-American Activities), the Special Committee on Un-American Activities (1934-1937) actually investigated not only domestic Communist activities, but domestic Fascist activities as well, including the plot just mentioned. Contemporary press coverage of the Congressional hearings and the plot itself was shameful for the most part, particularly the coverage by Time magazine and the New York Times. They covered the story in a way similar to later coverage of UFO and Elvis sightings, poking fun at the very suggestion that such a plot could even exist.While I am grateful that Skousen wrote this unique review/critique of \\"Tragedy and Hope\\", I would urge readers to take \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" as a point of departure in their study of the power elite, not the final word. The plutocrats who run things behind the scenes take on many guises, using politicians and movements across the political spectrum to further their malevolent aims. They quite obviously used both Fascism and Communism simultaneously for a time and have moved on to other totalitarian movements, such as neoconservatism and various religious movements. Focusing excessively on these movements and philosophies only serves to distract us from discovering the actual puppet masters.I must finally express my disappointment with the inclusion of a vitriolic attack by Al Smith on FDR's New Deal policies in an appendix. Al Smith had preceded FDR both as Governor of New York, and as a Democratic presidential nominee. Smith lost the nomination in 1932 to FDR, who, unlike Smith in 1928, went on to win the election. There is the argument that while Smith had maintained his previous progressive beliefs, the Democratic Party under FDR had moved on to Socialist tendencies. (In other words, the Democratic party left him, he didn't leave the party.) However, if Skousen were to choose a disaffected Democrat to criticize the New Deal, he could not have picked a better example of a sellout, a turncoat, and perhaps even a traitor, than Al Smith. Smith was first of all a sore loser, and secondly had by that time become a 100% owned asset of the Eastern plutocrats, the very class that \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" rails against. Smith was a prominent member of the Liberty League which sponsored the Fascist plot against FDR I referred to above. I again refer toThe Plot to Seize the White House: The Shocking True Story of the Conspiracy to Overthrow FDRfor details.By suggesting that Al Smith was still the brown bowler wearing \\"Happy Warrior\\" in 1936 that he had been in the 1920s disingenuous to put it mildly."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"After nearly 40 years, \\"The Naked Capitalist\\" is still the authorative masterwork on the subject of who is really in control in this godforsaken world. (At least from the material point of view.) I had the incredulous fortune of finding this book in the belongings of a dead man. The title caught my eye and I knew that further study would be a must. To my wonder and amazement, the whole plot which I have been uncovering one piece at a time, is laid out in revealing detail within the pages of this book.To know that this information has been readily available to the public for nearly 40 years, and still so few have a clue, is quite irksome.It's all here. The formulation of the CFR, (The Council on Foreign Relations) the Federal Reserve, The Rockefellers, Morgans and their ilk. How the rich secretively support \\"communist\\" and \\"fascist\\" rule the world over, while convincing the sheeple that \\"freedom\\" and \\"democracy\\" are their aims.There are pictures of the Rothschilds and the story of the founding of the Bank of England in 1694. Details of how the election of 1912 was fixed to ensure Wilson's victory as opposed to Taft, (who wasn't hospitable to the elite's aims) by financing a third party candidate (Teddy Roosevelt) to split Taft's support base. There are the case studies of Cecil Rhodes and how he was influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin who in turn was influenced by Plato.Basically this is the story of the corporate takeover of the world by the banking elite, resulting in the fascist enslavement of the masses, the world over. This book does not ring with \\"sensasionalist\\" conspiracy rhetoric, it merely portrays the cold facts and allows the reader the ability to get their head around it.When Quigley wrote his mammoth text \\"Tragedy and Hope,\\" (which, for the uninitiated, this book is a review and commentary of) it was as an insider and advisor for the clandestine elite. Against many of their objections, he thought it time to unveil the true archtects of the governing world, so that credit could be given where credit was due. This is the egotistical nature of man that was evident in the final days of the Roman Empire as well. Heinous and treacherous as these beasts are, one can't help but agree with Quigley's assessment, as Skousen puts it, \\"...that it is now too late for the little people to turn the tide. In a spirit of kindness he (Quigley) is therefore urging them not to fight the noose which is already around their necks. He feels certain that those who do will only choke themselves to death. On the other hand, those who go along with the immense pressure which is beginning to be felt by all humanity will eventually find themselves in a man-made millenium of peace and prosperity. All through his book, Dr. Quigley assures us that we can trust these benevolent, well-meaning men who are secretly operating behind the scenes. THEY are the 'hope' of the world. All who resist them represent 'tragedy.' Hence, the title for his book.\\"Mr. Skousen warns us to put away the ideas that it is the Jews or the Catholics, or the 'communists' or the 'fascists' that are solely to blame for our misfortune. We must understand that those with money and power come from all backgrounds and share common interests of world domination and a never satisfied lust for wealth. They use a variety of fronts to carry out their aims, and they own all the major outlets of media so that they may concoct a reality which suits them best.Skousen has stated elsewhere that we haven't had an honest choice in presidential elections since 1932, as both sides have been owned by the corporate/banking elite since that time. (And at least one side for considerably longer than that.)So God Bless America and keep sending your kids off to guard the piles of wealth these bloodthirsty tycoons own. That is what freedom is all about, 'Chase Freedom,' the freedom to use your credit card. In light of Skousen's disclosures about the Rockefeller owned Chase-Manhatten, those commercials, heck, all these wretched corporate jingles, become black comedy of rarefied irony."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"If this book were written by anyone less credible, you'd have to pass it off as conspiracy theory nonsense. But Skousen is anything but a conspiracy theory nut. He is a very well respected scholar. So what makes this book so infuriating is to realize both political parties are being swayed towards collectivism and totalitarianism through the robber-barons' self-percieved notion of good for the world and their \\"generous\\" donations to non-profits that promote this communist agenda. Thus, the Naked Capitalist reveals the wealthy elite to be promoters of exactly what would destroy not them, but the vast middle class of America. Ever notice that Karl Marx was fighting against the Bourgesie and not the aristocracy? The Bourgesie is the middle class. The rich want us middle-classers to simply revert to the equitable poverty of socialism while they continue to live luxuriously at our expense. This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Naked Capitalist","review":"The Naked Capitalist is an excellent explanation of Tragedy & Hope by Bill Clinton's mentor, Carroll Quigley. He explains that the professor is proud of being a member of the global controlling society and that the controllers are proud of having duped us into believing the published propaganda. Quigley believes that we little people are so stupid and powerless that we should be grateful to the elite ones for their control."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians: Tips and Techniques from Conception Through Birth: How to Stay Sane and Take Care of Yourself","review":"In 12 chapters Rachel Pepper wants to take the future mother through her journey using her own pregnancy and research as a guide. Though \\"The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians\\" is obviously geared toward lesbians, does it provide enough information and honesty to be useful to all future mothers?Chapter 1 looks at all the issues you should think about before having a baby, and I'm not just talking about financial issues but also planning for the physical and emotional changes and arranging for a stable support system for the entire pregnancy and early months of the baby's life. Now, while it is true that some straight women do \\"discover\\" they are pregnant, increasing numbers are exercising control and planning a family before they have one. I think the planning steps that Pepper lists are great for all would-be mothers.Chapter 2 and chapter 3 seemed reversed to me. Chapter 2 is about testing and getting your body ready for a pregnancy. Chapter 3 is about how a lesbian might go about getting the necessary sperm to create a pregnancy. I suppose that it's good to learn whether or not you can get pregnant before you try, and thus some of chapter 2's information makes sense in this order. It just felt off to me when I got to the third chapter.It always seems when a woman wants to get pregnant that everything goes wrong, and when she doesn't want a baby, surprise! Chapter 4 offers 10 tips to help you cope with the fact that everything in that plan you made will not go smoothly. That fits well with chapter 5, which addresses the real possibility that even if all those tests say you should be able to get pregnant, it might not mean that you will, or that you will carry to full term. Several honest emotional situations are described in this chapter.The first trimester is discussed in chapter 6. I, for one, was thrilled by the honesty in this chapter. Guess what? It isn't all about glowing from the pregnancies; no, there are some really icky and some very wonderful things that will be happening to the body during this time.Chapter 7 says that the second trimester will be easier. If that is true, then the next stage of planning needs to happen now, and Pepper offers very real suggestions on what to start changing in your life and starting to think about the birth.There is a small section on what the non-pregnant partner may be going through, and if there is one thing I'd criticize about this book it is that this partner isn't given enough time. Pepper, like many others, found herself single again some time after the birth of her daughter. Perhaps she's too close to look back and assess what happened, but I think the non-pregnant partner really needs closer attention.Chapter 8 also spends a bit of time on the non-pregnant partner when it addresses how pregnancy can affect sex. Again, the focus is really on the birth mother here and not on the other person, who may still want or need sexual intimacy. Yes, the non-pregnant partner does need to be supportive, but their desires also require time as well, or they may well look elsewhere.Chapter 9 considers the massive, pun intended, changes during the third trimester. Pepper once more is excellent at bringing up the honest feelings and frustrations that a pregnant woman might feel. I wonder if some post-partum depression might be lessened if doctors and others could be this honest with all mothers-to-be?Birth is not like the television version, and Pepper gives us the full score in chapter 10. Yes, each woman and each birth is different, but there are commonalities we need to know about. I liked that the non-pregnant partner was discussed in this chapter, though again I think they require more space in the book overall.Chapter 11 looks at the first few months after the baby is born. It covers not only the physical and emotional changes but also the realities of trying to adapt to this new very vulnerable person now living with you. Pepper includes a bit on child care, but you'd probably want to take a class, talk to relatives and friends, or read other books to get the full story on how to care for the newborn.Chapter 12 isn't really a chapter so much as a list of resources. The books are probably still good, but magazines and websites change often. This chapter is complemented by two sample documents. One is a \\"donor\\" agreement for the baby's sire, and the other is a chart for keeping track of ovulation.I think that the raw honesty that Pepper provides in this book is truly wonderful. Often so much information about pregnancy and childbirth is watered down and romanticized or so shrouded in medical jargon that I wonder how women can make an informed choice to have a child. \\"The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians\\" gives us a much-needed view of what will happen and what could happen while you are pregnant and during the first few months after birth."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians: Tips and Techniques from Conception Through Birth: How to Stay Sane and Take Care of Yourself","review":"Rachel Pepper is to be commended for her information and stance against infant circumcision.

Morevi is a tale of high adventure and epic romance that does not waver towards the edge of its paper confines...it lives beyond, and to me such a thought is happy indeed. I am caught between holding the story in my hands (which I suspect shall be read again and again), and anticipating the next in the series with a mixture of fear and elation. I feel the obsession taking hold, the want of escape and the fleeting moment of a child's imagination relieving my travel-weary adult mind. To feel the innocence again! It is the greatest effect an author can achieve, in my opinion. There are some elements to which this story rhymes with my life experience, so ever closer to this tale did my heart bind.For a book that rekindles your inner child with fantasy and high adventure...and still nurtures the tale of a love between two souls in such detail...You need look no further."},{"Title":"Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana","review":"by Kassandra WashingtonMorevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana is an excellent book that challenges its readers with a fantastical tale by thrusting the reader into the depths of another world that is both mystical yet includes a tinge of the Far East. The writers' details reminiscent of the period and places succeed in immersing the reader into believable alternate worlds where Elf-folk and mortals coexist, and magic endures alongside the conventional weapons of man.The reader begins the journey in 1492, after the &quot;New World&quot; has been discovered and King Henry VIII's privateers roam the seas acquiring what bounty they may, commonly referred to as stealing in lands not of England, hence the name pirate is born. A lone ship &quot;The Deviant&quot;, accustomed to battle and desperate circumstance, is being pursued by three Spanish ships whose captains will surely pronounce a death sentence for each and every privateer captured. With the captain and first mate dead and ship heavily damaged, the navigator Rafe and a Moor, Nassir, rally the crew to embark on their only chance for survival; they must navigate the Graveyard of Lost Ships.The very name, Graveyard of Lost Ships, known also as the Rift, spoken in fear by every seaman; no ship was known to have tackled the Rift and survived, yet the young navigator convinced the crew, it was their only chance. As the ship's course deviates toward the Rift, the three Spanish captains opt not to follow. At first a brilliant light enticed the crew to believe that they would survive, just before the darkness of Hell descends upon them. Had they a choice, their resolve would have wavered. Alas, the crew of the Defiant discovers a portal to a new world, where new adventures, alliances, and an unlikely romance await.In the years to come, the Defiant finds itself navigating the Rift often, acquiring loot found only in this new world where Eyrie, Arathelle, and especially Morevi lay. It was a world where magic and potions were widely in practiced, though the most ancient and dark powers of these arts are forbidden, not that everyone obeys. In these lands, the defiant English possess a faster ship and the black powder. Ships and crews fall easily to their cannons, rifles, and guns. Captain Rafe's favorite ships to plunder belong to Morevi and carry the most exotic wares, silks and teas; though the warrior women who guard these ships are formidable foes. The privateer's success earned him a death sentence if ever his feet touched Morevi soil.Askana Moldarin, the First Queen of Morevi proved to be the most cunning and deadliest. Having ascended the throne during a rebellion that overthrew the King, ended the patriarch system, and purged hoards of men from the land, her country and matriarch was threatened by treason at home and threats abroad. Having no one she could trust, she meets with the privateer, Rafe, the most successful pillager of her merchant ships. Why? The young King of Eyrie, finding the new matriarch distasteful, yearned for the conquest and overthrow of the Morevian queen and sought to take her lands for himself. The Merchant Circle on behalf of the Eyrie often paid Captain Raft for the bounty he seized from Askana's ships. The Merchant Circle assumed Rafe would gladly join them in a plot to unseat the queen. Unfortunately, for Eyrie, Rafe was the only privateer to refuse their money for such an endeavor and because of that one fact, Queen Askana gambled that somewhere deep within this scoundrel's soul was a man of honor, who if given a chance, would choose valor over greed.A queen, a privateer captain, a couple of younglings from the Royal Guard and an unlikely assortment of pirates set out to discover who threatened the throne. An unexpected assassination attempt and deceit from an unlikely source force improvisation and send the motley crew sailing to the one person who may turn the tide of an uprising, King Henry VIII; though his vices bar initial negotiations, he proves to have a few surprises of his own.The Morevi's writing is superb and detailed down to the proper language of the time and the multitude of weaponry. The reader immediately recognizes elements of Morevi that are evocative of the orient and martial arts. The patriarch of England in contrast to the new matriarch of Morevi is vivid. At first it seems the two worlds are completely different, yet as the account progresses, the reader realizes that England and Morevi are extremes of a sort and that the best world is one in which there is an equalization of the power between men and women. Such a land is portrayed in the Elvin kingdom, which is the only domain to remain neutral and outside the conflict... though the elves are not infallible and if their uncharacteristic failure to fulfill an undesirable duty lets the more just cause prevail, well no one is perfect."},{"Title":"Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana","review":"This book pulled me into the action from the start. The characters are more true to life, the style of writing paints such a visual depiction of everything, there's very good fight scenes and just enough romance without going over the top.

With a variety of vividly portrayed settings you enter a world that is like no other you have ever seen, meeting there characters that you either love or love to loath.

And mythology, and the Asian mythology is one that is not used nearly as often or as well as I would like to see. Tee and Lisa took both to new heights in this book. The characters, especially Rafe and Askana, leap out of the pages, grab you by the throat and say, &quot;Listen to my story! No, forget that, come in here with us!&quot; It's a book that forces you to pay attention to it. The descriptions are dense without being overwhelming, and the scenery flows better than many movies I've seen lately.The best part is that Tee and Lisa seamlessly blend their stories together. Try as I may, I could not tell where one stopped and the other started. I've read other collaborations where the transitions were jarring and very irritating - there was none of that here.What more can I say?

He leads the crew of the aptly named Defiant to safety when they traverse through the dangerous Rift that takes them to Naruihm. However, that haven is short lived as Rafe realizes this is no longer the Atlantic.The threat is real and even her most trusted advisors are suspect as Queen Askana of Morevi struggles to regain the throne of the land locked country. Desperate for someone to trust and help her, Askana hires the outworlder Rafe as a mercenary to unmask the female noble spies working for her enemies. As Rafe and Askana skirmish with her dangerous foes, they also begin to fall in love with one another. However, a permanent relationship is doubtful for if they lose to her opponents they die and if they win she is a queen and he is a pirate.MOREVI: THE CHRONICLES OF RAFE AND ASKANA is a strong historical fantasy that connects the world of the last decade of the fifteen-century with that of another orb. The lead characters are heroic and seem real and the support cast augments the action. However, the key to the powerful story line is that Morevi and its neighboring nations seem genuine as history and culture are cleverly interwoven into the plot. Fans of sword and sorcery novels will gain plenty of pleasure from this fine work.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana","review":"What fun to read a book that doesn't take itself seriously! Entering into the world of Morevi is like jumping onto a pirate ship out of a 1940's movie. All the heroes are boldly heroic, the villains are black as pitch, and the action is daring and non-stop.At first, the sheer impracticality of the plans the characters concocted took me aback...until I recognized the spirit of fun that pervades the story and realized it was never meant to be realistic. It is, instead, the kind of grand adventure we all enjoyed as children but seldom see any more. After that, I found it to be great fun!The writing is a bit uneven in the early chapters. The authors soon find their stride, however, and the story takes over. The book has it all: action, intrigue, history, and, towards the end, a heartrending romance.All in all, a book you can really kick back and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana","review":"This review refers to MOREVI: Re-Mastered, Podiobook editionTee Morris' Morevi: Re-Mastered is one of the top fantasy novels I've listened to on [...]. I'd be hard pressed if I was forced to choose between it and Philippa Ballantine's Chasing the Bard.Tee Morris has created a fluff free epic that captures the best elements of Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl and Dangerous Liasons. Tee Morris takes the classic stereotype that stories featuring intrigue need to be paced sedately and tosses it out the window. Morevi blends high adventure and political plotting brilliantly.Morevi: Remastered features an ensemble cast of voice actors. If you are familiar with podiobook authors, odds are you will hear one of your favorites in this book. Tee Morris and Philippa Ballantine lead the cast magnificently. JC Hutchins, George Hrab, and Christiana Ellis are just a few of the other talented actors you will hear throughout the book. Given the raw amount of talent amassed here, it is unsurprising that the performances are top notch. Philippa really shines in the female lead.The overall sound in Morevi: Remastered is a mixed bag. This novel has the most professionally mixed sound effects that I can remember listening to. Many authors make the mistake of mixing sound levels too high. Tee doesn't do that, even with cannon fire. Yet the book also has some extremely unprofessional popping and a few lost words at certain points in the novel. It actually caused pain to my ears during chapters 7+8.Overall, I strongly recommend you give \\"Morevi: Remastered\\" a listen if you enjoy adventure, fantasy, or intrigue. If you're worried about the popping issue, buy the book. It's in print. You can go order it from Amazon.com right now. But I think you'll be missing out.

One of those books that can't be put down.Rafe (that's Captain Rafe mind you!) comes across as an excellent rake and privateer, with a crew of lads that would make other pirates envious. A fellow who always speaks his mind and with a trick up his sleeve, just in case things go bad, and they usually do.Askana (best be paying respect now!) has all the makings of being a good pirate, save that she is a queen. Intelligent, determined with just enough arrogance of royalty she is a full blown character in her own right and the verbal and physical fencing between her and Rafe are marvelously woven together.One of the things that I really like about this books is that it just keeps you wanting to read more. The plots and counter plots are fantastic.And one of the things that is really remarkable is that I can't tell where Tee's writing ends and where Lisa's begins, and vice versa.

The description of the Morevian culture is original and interesting. The authors succeeded in painting a picture of what the Morevi world is like. I am a bit disappointed though with a lack of originality in some parts, particularly when describing the Elves (well, I guess JRR Tolkien's influence shaped all our understanding of Elves and to deviate from it doesn't seem believable!) and Rafe's character (I would call him a stereotypical cliche'd male hero, i.e. like a menthos - tough on the outside but mushy deep down).Other than that, I enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Morevi: The Chronicles of Rafe and Askana","review":"Lisa Lee and Tee Morris have a well crafted first novel to share with the lucky reader.

I'm sure I know which one wrote which character but Mr. Morris and Ms. Lee have so successfully blended their writing styles that the story comes through as if written by only one person. Let me tell you from experience, that is really an accomplishment. What is also outstanding about this book is the fantasy motif that substitutes an Asian myth cycle for the Celtic one that is so common for books in this genre. Kipling would have been delighted.

Yes, it is a little more expensive for a paperback than most people want to spend. I know it was for me, but after meeting the author and hearing the story out of his mouth, I was willing to give it a shot, and it paid off. If it came in hardback I'd give away my copy and buy one in hardback.To be honest there is very little new or radically different as far as concepts or plot devices in this book, but the language of the authors, the amazing characters, and a great ending make this book more than the sum of its parts.

The book is pretty old, though, so I guess that's to be expected."},{"Title":"Hamlet's Enemy: Madness and Myth in Hamlet","review":"I always enjoy reading Hamlet scholarship. Part of my pleasure comes from the new insight always gained into the unbounded mysteries of the play. But, as much, if not more, pleasure often comes in observing the critics efforts to subtly twist the play to fit neatly into his or her own \\"theory.\\" And this book is enjoyable on both levels. It does provide rich psychological insight into and mythological context for the play. But it also shows some of the wonderful distortions the play seems to invite from all but the most hyper-vigilant critic.There is especially good reason to link psychoanalysis and Shakespeare. Freud paid clear homage to, and perhaps borrowed/shared much of his insight from/with Shakespeare. This book starts from that connection (Lidz is first a psychoanalyst), and it starts well. Lidz makes a sound case that Hamlet's madness had not been correctly considered in the past. In part, Lidz argues, this occurred because people naturally avoid issues regarding madness. The other distorting factor, Lidz notes, has been the desire of critics to fit Hamlet into a particular school of psychological thought, starting with the desire to label Hamlet a classic melancholic and including Freud's application of the Oedipal complex to Hamlet.Lidz next reviews the psychological development of Hamlet and his \\"madness\\" one act at a time, a sound approach. His analysis of Hamlet through the first three acts is compelling. For example, Lidz properly notes the significance of Hamlet's matricidal attitudes toward Gertrude, and does not let himself be swayed by the \\"pure\\" Freudian focus on Hamlet's oedipal conflicts around killing Claudius.But, starting with his analysis of the fourth act, Lidz really starts to waiver. He spends a lot of energy on describing how Ophelia's madness is a counter theme to Hamlet's madness. It becomes clear this observation is motivated by Lidz' desire to argue the need to extend certain elements of Freud's thinking. So, Lidz's analysis of Ophelia provides a way for Lidz to bring in an analysis of the \\"female\\" dynamic in the human psyche. But here, Lidz is committing the mistake he identified at the start - misreading the play to use it to buttress his own \\"theoretical model.\\" Hamlet is at the center of the play, and Ophelia's madness is simply not as well developed or as central to the play as Lidz argues.Then Lidz's tendency to wander really becomes a problem. Lidz spends the second third of the book describing some primal myths that may have formed the basis for the Hamlet story. The comparison between Hamlet, Orestes and Oedipus is wonderful, but Lidz's broad conclusions consistently outreach his evidence, and the connection between this part of the book and Hamlet's madness is never made.The third section is even farther away from the initial topic of Hamlet's madness. In the third section Lidz argues for ways in which Freudian theory should be expanded to included a broader analysis of the family dynamic, that is a dynamic beyond the oedipal relationships. Here, Lidz has to rely on his emphasis on Ophelia and does not use his analysis of Hamlet's madness at all.Again, the entertainment in Hamlet criticism is often two-fold. In this book we get a psychoanalytic perspective circa 1975 that shows how psychoanalytic theory had attempted to expand beyond Freud's preliminary thinking - including women and the family, and shifting the internal psychic energy that Freud posited to a more existential view of where human behavior comes from. Yet, much of the thinking is still locked into such a Freudian model; for example Lidz continually refers to the constricting role that society plays on the individuals' desires, straight from the thinking Freud proposed in \\"Society and Its Discontents.\\"The result is a book that is as much a Hamlet critique as a reflection on psychoanalytic thinking in the 1970's. Two for the price of one?"},{"Title":"Kids' Trips in Tokyo: A Family Guide to One-Day Outings","review":"We got this book right before moving to Tokyo for a year with our two year old daughter.

The \\"tours\\" are arranged geographically, so you can pick a few of several activities within an certain area. This book has pointed me to areas that I would not have found on my own and that are not found in the typical Tokyo tourist guidebooks. A nice feature is the index listing of activities that are best for rainy days and Mondays/New Year's Holidays (when some Tokyo locations are closed). While the book caters to Tokyo residents who have time to explore various areas, the tourist will find many locations listed that will have something appealing to the whole family.I disagree with a previous reviewer who claims the book has a the lack activities for boys. My active boys have enjoyed all the locations in this book that we have visited. In fact, it seems that the authors intentionally looked for places where the kids could run about.

Clarke's Mysterious World","review":"I am totally confused by this book's title. Ordinarily, one might expect a book called \\"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\\" to have been written by Arthur C. Clarke!, but on this occasion there are another two names on the book's cover which are shown separately from Clarke's. Some years ago, Clarke hosted two successful British television series' entitled Mysterious World and World of Strange Powers. This work appears to be the best-selling book which accompanied the former series.My problem with this book, however, is Clarke's attitude towards the world's mysteries and I get the firm impression that he thinks \\"Daddy knows best.\\" Put another way, Clarke is a most distinguished scientist and engineer. For him, therefore, all paranormal events have a perfectly reasonable and rational explanation - even if he does not yet have all the answers to hand.Take the many sightings of various Apemen around the world - Yeti, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Almas and Yowie - to name but some. People from different countries and even different continents have reported seeing similar creatures over hundreds of years. To me this suggests there really \\"is\\" something out there or the reports would have petered out a long time ago. Clarke, however, draws the opposite conclusion stating; \\"Personally, I would take reports of contemporary apemen more seriously if there were not so many of them.\\" Wrong!In short, it is because Clarke is a scientist that his mind appears to be totally closed to the possibility of any true mystery. For that reason, I would suggest his suitability for a book on this subject is questionable. His downbeat comments certainly spoil the enjoyment of the read.NM"},{"Title":"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World","review":"For me, this book was an introduction to many a strange thing, and to a better approach to the paranormal. For this book is neither a smug debunking of the kind that Carl Sagan or Richard Dawkins are so keen on, or the sensationalised tabloid trash of the kind you get repeated continually on cable TV...The book's attitude is summed up in the afterword by Arthur C. Clarke (who as some have cleverly deduced, didn't write this book) - some phenomena are much more plausible than others. This is a good thing, as all too often, there is a black and white approach, which seems to think that all of the so called paranormal is either real (to anyone with an \\"open mind\\") or the province of the gullible and ridiculous. So he says, quite rightly, that there's a better chance of \\"monsters\\" living in the deep ocean than in smaller lakes and lochs, which can be searched extensively.My favourite chapter by far, is the one on Tunguska Explosion. This is something everyone should read. Here you've got a genuine mystery, and it is published with some excellent pictures from the original expedition, interviews with the surviving members etc. The bits about ball lightning and sea monsters are superb. Some of the pieces have been debunked since, unfortunately, but at the same time, plenty of things have emerged since - for example, Roswell and Area 51 were not the big legends in the early 80s that they are now.Anyone who is looking for stuff on telepathy, poltergeists, ghosts etc will be disappointed. This is to be found in the sequel \\"World of Strange Powers\\".It's great to read a book like this - it talks about the odd things in our world, without getting stupid or trashy.

Written in a non-academic style it tells the story of how the allies crippled Germany's heavy water supply in Norway. It is a fascinating tale of a few heroes who risked, and sometimes gave, their lives to prevent Germany from developing the atomic bomb. Some interesting facts are also given regarding the development of a nuclear weapon. If German scientists had just developed a slightly different mind set they wouldn't have needed the heavy water, and could have built a bomb without it. Good rendering of a small but very important story of World War II."},{"Title":"Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler's Bomb","review":"As one of Mr. Kurzman's Norwegian sources for his research on this subject, I must say he has managed to put the heavy-water sabotage mission into a global perspective. We've seen far too many books on this and other Norwegian WW2 missions just dealing with the operation itself. About time a foreigner wrote about this, looking at international relations and history, while at the same time doing a great job on the local perspective. Well done Mr. Kurzman!"},{"Title":"Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler's Bomb","review":"Though history has shown that the Nazis were not nearly as close to developing the bomb as was then believed, it does not diminish the impact of this edge of your chair thriller! THe allies, both British and Americans, attempt a series of missions to blow up the German heavy water plant (heavy water is used to make nuclear reactors, a key element in building a nuclear bomb) that was located in Norweigan territory. British glider pilots are unsuccessful and captured and tortured by the Nazis, a second attempt is successful in bombing the plant but does not do enough damage. THe book chronicles these and other espionage efforts to destroy the plant and does so in a quick style that will keep you reading til finished. THis book would make an excellent action/adventure WWII thriller type movie and I hope someone buys the rights to it. AS many of you know, the author, Dan Kurzman has made a career of documenting WWII stories. He's a good storyteller, though not quite as good a writer. If you enjoy this book, then try his story of the sinking of the Indianapolis, the ship that carried parts of the Atomic bomb and saw a large number of its crewman get eaten by sharks. The book demonstrates that there are enough true to life thrillers out there, so why bother with fiction when you can read a thriller and learn something about history at the same time!"},{"Title":"Blood and Water: Sabotaging Hitler's Bomb","review":"This was a good book on the race between the U.S., Britain and Germany to build the first atomic bomb.

Initially, the officer corps of both countries continued as virtual copies of British military traditions on the subcontinent, including a strict adherence to the ideal of an 'officer and gentleman' physically and socioeconomically apart from mainstream society and above the 'dirty' world of politics. In the past half-century of independence, Indian officers have remained resolutely in their barracks as obedient tools of their democratically elected civilian masters. In contrast, their former comrades in Pakistan plotted a coup d'&eacute;tat as early as 1951 before ruling the country at the head of military-bureaucratic regimes from 1958-71 and again from 1977-88. The government continues to suffer undue attention from the military and, as recently as September 1995, over 30 armed forces' officers were arrested on charges of allegedly plotting to eliminate the army's high command and top politicians, declare martial law and impose Islamic law in the country. What factors have contributed to Pakistan's affinity for military rule?Saeed Shafqat's examination of the volatile nature of civil-military relations in Pakistan begins with an overview of developments from independence to the end of Ayub Khan's regime in 1969, concentrating on the ascendancy of the military-bureaucratic elite and its impact on the politics and economics of Pakistan. When the impressive economic growth of this period ended with the withdrawal of foreign aid following the disastrous 1965 Indo-Pak War, Ayub's administration was doomed. Yet the 'military hegemonic system' (p 49) remained in place to preside over the dismemberment of the country and the creation of Bangladesh until 'mass mobilization, regime confrontation and mass movement' (p 74) led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto at the head of the Pakistan People's Party resulted in the installation of a civilian regime. Unfortunately, explains Shaqat, personal, ideological and regional centre-state conflicts combined with the government's failure to 'produce conditions conducive to politics of bargaining, compromise and accommodation' (p 157) to preclude the consolidation of the democratic process. Indeed, despite following a classic 'carrot-and-stick' course of attempting to control the armed forces by appeasing their corporate demands while constricting their institutional role and responsibilities, Zulfikar's 'strategies and tactics conveyed the impression that, more than just civilian control of the military, he wanted to establish personal hegemony' (p 185). By 1977, worried officers had replaced his civilian administration with a military regime led by General Zia ul Haq who carefully and very successfully consolidated his personal and the armed forces' institutional power over the next decade via the skillful manipulation of powerful interests and actors on both sides of the civil-military divide. His 1988 death left Pakistan with a 'polarized and divided' (p 219) polity and a seemingly permanent hegemonic role for the military in politics; legacies which the subsequent civilian administrations have been grappling with ever since. For Shafqat, these efforts have not been a success:'in the past decade or so, Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif...had an opportunity to build organizational structure of the party and possibly democratize the process of leadership selection...instead...While in power both used party as an instrument for extending patronage and ventured to establish the dominant party model to strengthen personal rule...Both contributed little in developing any consensual framework for government-opposition relationship; both allowed and encouraged political confrontation, polarization, intolerance and authoritarian style of governance. Resultantly, military hegemony in Pakistan's politics has continued to persist...' (p 251).Overall, Civil-Military Relations in Pakistan is a straightforward and highly informative account of the country's civil-military machinations over the past 20 years or so. Shafqat's conclusion is damning: despite the repeated (if sporadic) return of elected civilian governments, the very nature, organisation and methods deployed by Pakistan's political elites and parties repeatedly have thwarted the replacement of authoritarian structures with true democratic alternatives. If, warns Shaqat, democratic norms and practices continue to fail to gain legitimacy, the military-bureaucratic regime will continue to be an alternative model of government.One final note: While this Westview Press edition is handsomely bound and typeset, and offers quality endnotes, it suffers from remarkably poor copy-editing. This includes the repeated lack of definite articles, indeterminate punctuation, the absense of capitalisation at the beginning of some sentences and, incredibly, spelling the name of the prime minister as 'Zufikar' on the cover but as 'Zulfikar' throughout the text! Furthermore, Civil-Military Relations in Pakistan contains no index, surely not the normal practice for a book with academic ambitions."},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"What if the Nazis had biological weapons that they were planning to use against the Allies during D-Day? What if the British had their own secret weapon that they were planning to use against the Germans? These and other questions are at the heart of \\"Midnight Plague,\\" a spy thriller by Gregg Keizer. The hero is Frank Brink, an American doctor who has conducted research on anthrax. However, his heart is not in destroying lives but in saving them.A complicated series of events brings Frank together with Alix, a Frenchwoman whose father died after rescuing a group of Jews who had deliberately been infected with plague. Alix is obsessed with Juniper, a Brit who has a hidden agenda that he is not revealing. Wollenstein is a calculating German scientist whose dreams of personal glory rest on the cruel experiments he is conducting using Jewish prisoners. He wants to spread plague among the Allies and come up with an antidote that will protect the Germans. Kirn is a German policeman whose loyalty to his country is shaken by the horrors he sees around him. The paths of these and other characters intersect at some point during the novel. Will the Nazis succeed in stopping the Allied invasion using their deadly weapon, or will Brink and his cohorts somehow stop them in time?\\"Midnight Plague\\" has an intriguing premise, but Keizer's convoluted plot and sluggish pacing undermine the effectiveness of his story. The characters are one-dimensional, the love story is tepid, the action scenes are implausible, and the plot is cluttered and incoherent. There are other better written and more exciting spy thrillers that I do recommend. Among them are Greg Rucka's \\"Private Wars,\\" Brad Thor's \\"Blowback,\\" and Stella Rimington's \\"At Risk.\\""},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"The deadline for D-Day is drawing near.A fishing boat comes aground onBritish shore with a boatful of dead passengers.It is discovered thatthey have died from a mysterious illness.Dr Frank Brink who has beenworking with the British on an antibiotic to thwart a biological by theAxis forces is sent to investigate.Dr. Brink interviews the survivingmember of the crew Alix and discovers that a dreaded biological weapon is being tested within the French lines.He suspects that it is pneumonic plague which has a one hundred percent death rate.Dr.Brink and Alix must infiltrate occupied France.They have to locate the laboratory where the disease is being tested.They must find this location because the invasion of Normandy is close at hand.He has to stop his German counterpart from releasing the biological terror upon theinvading Allied forces.Another part of his mission is to steat the antidote if possible.I found this book to be an exciting read just like the previous book \\"The Longest Night\\".Be sure to read this book."},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"Set in the days leading up to D-Day comes this historical thriller with a medical twist. Frank Brink, an American doctor, embarks on a mission to find a German lab that is rumored to be producing what the Allies fear is a horrific biological weapon. Their tipoff came from a French fishing boat found on a British coast, its hold filled with dead Jews --- and one surviving Frenchwoman named Alix Pilon.The English are very edgy, partly because it was their original idea to spray anthrax spores on the continent to infect their enemies. But Brink's German counterpart, Dr. Wollenstein, has been infecting the Jews with pneumonic plague, a deadly disease that leaves no one alive, in order to experiment with the effectiveness of his antidote. If Wollenstein can successfully create a vaccine to cure the plague, he will have no hesitation about dropping clouds of the Pasteurella pestis on the English and American soldiers coming ashore --- at the very least. He believes he can simply vaccinate his own German troops and wipe out everyone else. But it is a very ugly way to die, and his antidote must first be proven. Thus, he leaves behind himself a string of bodies blackened by the plague.Brink was working on his own serum for the Pasteurella pestis, but the impending threat of a possible biological attack on England sends him scurrying for the source lab the Germans have set up in France. Alix finds herself the American's unlikely ally. It was her father's fishing boat that held the unfortunate victims discovered aboard. For some reason, she blames herself and offers her help in tracking down the \\"devil\\" whose work is devising this nasty killer, in order to avenge her father's death. Alix and Brink work together while the clock counts down to June 6, 1944, and the body count mounts up.But roaming the French countryside in search of the pestis proves far more dangerous than Brink had feared. Rounding a curve can bring them face to face with a contingent of hostile Germans. Even though Brink speaks German, as well as French, his accent draws instant suspicion. And when he and Alix aren't being troubled by enemy soldiers along the way, they are by turns avoiding the sick and attempting to minister to their needs. Either threat could bring them the promise of great suffering and ultimate, if not instant, death.Stale from a steady diet of lab work, Brink worries that he no longer can save lives. And the problem is further complicated by the fact that many of the wounded they encounter are enemy personnel. His is a personal journey to reaffirm his worth, as they race against time to save the world from a cataclysmic devastation beyond imagination.Despite a distracting profusion of characters, the subject, with good solid writing behind it, will make MIDNIGHT PLAGUE a popular read for historical thriller fans. And the medical angle will draw in even more readers.--- Reviewed by Kate Ayers"},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"The book is not well written. I have several books on WWII and the Germans.

The long tedious descriptions of uninteresting characters serve only to break up the unemotional dialogue and by-the-number action pieces that pop up occasionally. The protagonist might be the least-interesting main character I've read about in quite some time, and the villains are even more boring than the protagonist. In a WW2 thriller there should be Nazis to root against, but the SS-members depicted here are not threatening.This is a great book to read when you're trying to induce sleep. If you want excitement, try Greg Iles \\"Rising Phoenix,\\" or even Keizer's first book."},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"Frank Brink is an American doctor, who is interested in the plague. When in early June 1944 a French fishing boat reaches the English shore with a load of Jews dying form the plague, the English military fears that the Germans will react to the invasion of Normandy by setting free a biological weapon based on the plague. Frank Brink is sent to France with a deadline plus two men from the Secret Service who appear to have their own orders plus the young woman who took the boat the England and remained free of the plague. Their adversaries are SS officers and doctors with big egos and no consciences whatsoever.In principle a very interesting theme around the use of infectious organisms for biological weapons, but the book somehow does not become interesting. the Germans (apart from one Kripo) are caricatures and so sadistic that it becomes gross, the perspective from which the story is told changes with every few pages and a few times when the author does not know how to solve all the problems that the main persons ran into, some bombs mysteriously appear and kill all the Germans, leaving the main characters unscathed. All in all this lead to a less-than-believable book, a missed chance..."},{"Title":"Midnight Plague","review":"It is only a matter of days before the Allies land on the beaches of Normandy and the Germans know it is coming though they don't know the correct day. American Doctor Frank Brink who once developed biological weapons is now trying to create antibiotics to counteract any act of bioterrorism that the Germans throw at them.The French Resistance rescues Jews who are then sent by boat to England. They don't know that the people they have saved have been contaminated with pneumonic plague which has a hundred percent kill rate. SS scientist Wollenstein bought the germs from the Asians and is using it on the Jews along with trying to create an antibiotic that will keep the Germans safe from the disease. His plan is to have the planes spray the germs over England. Brink is sent to stop him using any means available. A Resistance fighter guides Brink to Wollenstein's lab but there are other Germans who are willing to have what the doctor created in their hands. Brink fights with the various German factions, but also must quickly find the antibiotic because he and the beautiful Resistance fighter are infected and need the medicine immediately.Gregg Keizer has written a fantastic historical thriller that could be taken out of today's WMD headlines. The use of germ warfare goes back at least to medieval times and there is no reason to believe that countries will stop using it in the future. There is plenty of action in MIDNIGHT PLAGUE while the characters are symbols rather than three dimensional people. This doesn't take away from the enjoyment of reading this book because the stereotypes are easily recognizable and understandable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Angel in Hell","review":"I bought this book a few days ago after seeing advertisements from phantomoftheopera.com and i totally fell in love with it.

On more than one occasion I was amused to see an NCO's reaction to the book I was reading.Having been a member of the only military fighting force in the world that isn't too proud to make fun of itself, this book is easily one of the most memorable pieces of literature I had the pleasure of coming across during my enlistment. Will Stockdale, backwoods redneck/draftee, is the Huckleberry Finn (with a bit of Forrest Gump mixed in) of modern military fiction. One of the funniest dialogue exchanges occurs when Will and his pal Ben - a short bespectacled gent whose chief ambition (initially) is to bust into infantry - are talking about how horrible it would be if they got selected to go into the Air Force.&quot;...Will, do you know what they call men in the Air Force?&quot;&quot;No, I don't think I heered say.&quot;&quot;They call 'em...airmen. By dog, Will, don't you see? How'd you like to be called an airman?&quot;&quot;By God, I just don't think I'd stand for it...&quot;But Will and Ben's ambitions later tend to change when considering (among other things) the many decorations one may receive in the Air Force and how easily they can be acquired. It's especially humorous when Ben points out,&quot;I believe you stand just about as good a chance of getting [medals] in the Air Force as any place...Why, today, you can get a medal by just not doing anything wrong...&quot;It was at this point that I began to wonder in the other American military branches - or those of our allies - award their brave men and women the Good Conduct Medal (the recipient earns this by not getting demoted); the Longevity Medal (serve for a minimum of four years); and other awards and honors just for showing up. NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS - written by a former officer of the U.S. Army Air Corps - made it clear that some things in our military are just downright hilarious if you can look at them from the right perspective.Even if you don't have the military experience, this short, lighthearted, and reader-friendly book is sure to please as it brings to mind reminders of FORREST GUMP, GOMER PYLE, and...oh yeah...NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS (starring Andy Griffith as Will Stockdale)."},{"Title":"No Time for Sergeants","review":"I don't remember when I first read this book, but I do remember laughing out loud during certain parts (something I rarely ever do!)

With this book, John Alexander has done this large otherworldly population proud as he relates the stories of many of these Capitol Caspers, and he relates his stories from a source that had never occurred to me before.I generally look for ghost books that contain mostly stories of recent ghostly activity along with eyewitness accounts, and this book meets both of those requirements. Mr. Alexander has spent a great deal of time interviewing people who have come face to face with Washington's ghosts and he does an excellent job of relating their stories. He also relates the stories of some people who have obviously had some kind of encounter but who refuse to talk about it. He has been particularly efficient at interviewing guards who have worked the night shift at many of the government's most well known buildings and has come away with a vast array of chilling stories.The author didn't stop with interviews however for he mined a source that is often overlooked by those seeking eyewitness accounts of hauntings. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it seems that newspapers were just full of ghost stories. Reporters for these newspapers would go out and interview those who claimed to have seen, heard or smelled a ghost. There eyewitnesses are of course long gone but thanks to those reporters their stories remain. Mr. Alexander has undoubtedly labored over old newspapers for hours and hours for he has found accounts of DC haunts that go back well over a hundred years. Many of the haunted locations detailed in these stories no longer exist and although I really prefer stories of ongoing haunts these old stories must not be lost. Thanks to John Alexander they never will be.For the most part the author's writing style is very pleasant but the book does seem to drag a little on occasion. For example, the story about the Bladensburg dueling grounds seemed to go on and on with far too much history and far too few ghosts. This was the exception rather than the rule however and most of this book was highly enjoyable. There were even a few humorous moments such as the quip from Harry Truman as he wondered why anybody dead or alive would want to spend eternity in the White House. Truman by the way never hid his belief that the White House was haunted.Add together a pleasant writing style, wonderful pictures and illustrations and a lot of legwork and even more research and you get a very solid and enjoyable ghost book. Be sure to read this book before any trip to Washington so that you can look for spooks and also try to avoid the Demon Cat of the Capitol."},{"Title":"Ghosts: Washington's Most Famous Ghost Stories","review":"This is a book in which I have read too many times to count.

Nimtz argues that Marx (and Engels), contra the charges of Eurocentrism leveled by their opponents, actually placed the United States at the center of their analysis. He shows how the limitations of democracy in the United States helped lead Marx to the conclusion that emancipation had to go beyond the political. He also excavates Marx's significant writings on race in America, an endeavor which busts any number of stale myths that Marx didn't care about race. Finally, he draws Marx and Engels as dedicated political activists who, far from relying on \\"laws of history,\\" actively intervened into the struggles of their day.One of the most important of these struggles, as the pair saw it, was the Civil War in the United States. Given the exodus of German revolutionaries following the failure of 1848, there existed in the US a significant layer of communists who were followers of what was then called \\"the Marx party.\\" These communists became some of the most fervent advocates of abolition, helping to win the German American community away from the abstentionism promoted by earlier activists. Marx himself was actively involved in communications with his American comrades and help steer the party towards abolition. Once the Civil War began, Marx's American followers joined the Union army in great numbers. One, August Willich, was even promoted to Major General, the first and probably last time a communist has held such a position in American history.Overall, this is a tremendous work of mythbusting, written and argued clearly and packed with fascinating detail. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Houdini; the untold story","review":"This book is a reprint of Christopher's &quot;Houdini A Pictorial Life&quot; published in 1976.

He makes a convincing case for the legitimacy of these new letters, and offers a much more thorough analysis of the story, the characters, and the major events of the period than exists elsewhere.The author does a wonderful not only telling the story, but also putting it into historical context. This is a truly powerful story of unrequeited love that has fascinated historians and lay people alike for centuries, but it is also a very interesting history of a crucial period in Church history and in the history of Western Europe. The first whispers of the reformation are being heard, the Church is starting to punish heresy in very serious ways, and many of the social, religious, and educational institutions are being questioned. The modern reader might be particularly interested in the life that Heloise makes for herself: her career trajectory might come as a surprise to those who think that, except for the occasional queen, women were completely powerless in medieval European society.This book provides a very well researched and well written study of two people stuck in a situation that is much greater than either of them, and of the repurcussions that follow their affair. It offers a very interesting examination of the state of philisophy and religious thought of the period. I highly recomend it to anyone who is interested in medieval history, church history, or women's history... or to anyone who is interested in reading about the greatest love story of all time."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"James Burge's uptodate examination of the lives and letters of the twelfth century tragic lovers, Heloise and Abelard, is a superb piece of scholarship. With an examination of both the original attributed letters and the excerpts now identified as from their original love letters collated by Johannes de Vepria and first revealed by Constant Mews in 1999, Burge takes us through the known lives of the two ill-fated lovers whilst continually instructing the reader on twelfth century european monastic life and the firm secular power that the Church weilded through its canonical law.The story of Abelard and Heloise (he the greatest logiical philosopher of his age, she a brilliant classical scholar some ten years his junior) who fall in love whilst she studies under him in Paris, their subsequent hasty and secretive marriage, the birth of their child Astralabe, Aberlard's subsequent castration by Heloise envious uncle, Fulbert and their enforced separation to the Orders and literary reconciliation, has echoed down the ages.The Romeo and Juliet of its time, the erudite, first hand accounts of an altogether human love between two great intellectuals opens up the world of twelfth century europe to us in a way that is priceless. As Burge correctly comments fairly early in the text, the concept of the period being part of the medieval ages and pre-renaissance is farcical in the evidence of the Parisian centres of learning that Abelard founded and taught at.Drawing heavily on the texts, Burge gives us an insight into the personalities of both, showing Abelard as that brilliant, yet socially aggressive, scholar, Heloise as his intellectually equal, yet through what modern terms would denote as \`true love', utterly under his charming spell right to the end.The primary source material consists of eight letters, opening with a letter from Aberlard to an unknown correspondent in response to several meetings he has had, putting down what is almost an autobiography. The letter (or a copy) makes its way to Heloise who writes a reply, thus reopening communication between the two. Whilst the opening 200 pages refer heavily to the first letter of each, as Burge's biography catches up with Aberlard's abscondment from St Denis and sojourn near St Troyes at Paraclete then the remaining six letters come into force. Ableard's papal-acknowledged bestowal on Paraclete to Heloise to found her abbey means that the two came into contact and through the letters we are able to see Heloise 'force' Abelard to acknowledge that he is her first true love and her taking the veil was enforced by him upon her.Burge now continues to move through the later stages of Abelard's life, continuing to note his cyclic fortunes, waxing and waning with Stephen de Garlande until the latter finally fell from grace as Bernard de Clairvaux rose to European political pre-eminence and the former finally returned to Paris. In a change of style Burge spends several pages discussing the themes within the hymns of Abelard, a literary examination amongst the historical investigation before reverting to discussions of Abelard's fighting with Clairvaux and the famous Council of Sens where the latter's brilliant rhetoric won the minds of the 'jurors' rendering Abelard speechless. Abelard ended his days condemned for heretical discouse, eventually dying whilst under the hospitality of Abbot Peter and with his death so the story peters out quite quickly, a few pages remaining to briefly cover what little we know of the remaining third of Heloise's life, and some of the known actions of their son before even more quickly covering their escalation within the French national identity and final resting place in Paris together.Burge's work excels in bringing the story, the period and the nature of the philosophy to the reader in a manner that is both readable, informative and deeply stimulating. It is the kind of secondary text that would inspire a reader to go out and purchase the original texts of these brilliant twelfth cenutry lovers and read even further around the entires scope of twelfth century european religion, politics and philosophy. At the same time it does not lose its emotive discussion, humanising both of these people and making their tragic love story rise fresh to a new century of people. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"Shakespeare immortalized the fictional lovers Romeo and Juliet, but for historic doomed lovers, readers have always gone to the story of Heloise and Abelard. The letters between them, written in twelfth century France, are flirtatious, intellectual, dramatic, tragic, and erotic. The world for centuries has been fascinated by the eight letters exchanged by them when they were forced to be apart, but then a few years ago emerged a cache of letters they sent each other while they were also having passionate physical and intellectual exchanges. James Burge has drawn upon the letters old and new to produce _Heloise & Abelard: A New Biography: (HarperSanFrancisco) which is a genial guide to the classic story, a thoughtful and affecting work that explains the times, religion, and politics of a vastly different age. No American reader, however, will come away without thinking about the current influence of conservative or restrictive religious ideals, or of the continued desire of those in power to impose moral values.In 1115 Abelard was 36 years old, a teacher of logic and master of the Cathedral School at Notre Dame in Paris. Heloise was fifteen years younger when they met. She was the niece of a local Parisian canon named Fulbert, and she came to the attention of Abelard because of her learning and her desire to learn. She became Abelard's pupil, and then his mistress. Even though they spent a lot of time in personal tutorials, they wrote letters to each other. Abelard wrote, \\"Our desires left no stage of lovemaking untried, and if love could devise something new we welcomed it.\\" Heloise was consumed as well; this couple enjoyed their intellectual exchanges, enjoyed romance, but they really enjoyed sex. At least one time they made love in the refectory of a church. Years later, looking back on the torrid year and a half of their affair, Heloise wrote even as an abbess, \\"The lovers' pleasures that we enjoyed together were so sweet to me that they can never displease me.\\" When Fulbert found out about the affair, he threw Abelard out, and when Heloise became pregnant, he forced them to get married. It would seem that Fulbert would have been satisfied with the outcome he had engineered, but he was still enraged at the loss of his family's honor, and perhaps at the loss of Heloise as well. He sent his henchmen out to Abelard's house one night, and they castrated him. Abelard became a monk and made Heloise become a nun.He preceded her in death, when his body was taken back to the crypt of the little church of Heloise's abbey, and she was eventually buried there as well. The Paraclete did not survive the French Revolution, but the lovers' remains were brought back to Paris and became initial celebrity occupants of the newly formed P&eacute;re Lachaise cemetery. It may be that the graves of Oscar Wilde and Jim Morrison get more visits there now, but the Gothic Revival monument of Abelard and Heloise does not lack for flowers brought by those captivated by a romantic and frankly sexual story. Burge has been careful to set quotations from the letters in the circumstances of their times. There are, sadly, huge gaps in the story, years we do not know about and thoughts that even these prolific pen-pals kept to themselves; Burge has always indicated when he is making suppositions. He is particularly strong on church history and thought, especially contrasted with the words of Heloise who joined a religious to a sexual rapture. There can be no doubt that these two were serious thinkers and soundly Christian, but theirs was a strikingly modern faith that could accommodate desire and eroticism."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"The romance of Abelard and Heloise is almost as famous as Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet were fictitious. Abelard and Heloise, however, lived. In addition, both Abelard, a famous Medieval philosopher, and Heloise, the administrator of a large convent, had identities beyond their relationship.Many books about Abelard and Eloise have been written during the 900 years since their death. Their story is sad. The author, James Burge, demonstrates that their difficulties were partly due to the times but were also due to their personalities.The occasion for this excellent book is the remarkable recent discovery of 113 letters the lovers wrote to each other. James Burge uses these together with previously known letters and other records to construct biographies of each of the lovers. As we follow them through their lives, Burge describes 12th century philosophical and religious thought, Medieval educational institutions, places important to the couple, the economic situation of the times, Medieval architectural movements, clothing, food, and other details of life.The new and old letters provide a wealth of information about Abelard and Heloise. Burge uses them to flesh out their long dead bones. By the end of the book, I felt I knew these people, complete with their strengths and weaknesses. Other records describe people with whom the couple interacted. These interactions importantly elucidate the personalities of Abelard and Heloise.While he lived, Abelard was well known for winning philosophical disputations and for his teaching. The book is a bit disappointing in that we never watch Abelard either dispute an opponent or teach students. Perhaps surviving records do not give enough information to permit this. Without such \\"demonstrations\\", we don't know exactly what Abelard did in these situations that was so unusual.Heloise was a big surprise to me. She was no retiring, Medieval, uneducated miss. Today we would call her a Liberated Woman. She was brilliant and had a mind of her own. Had she lived today, she probably would have had an illustrious career as a writer. Her letters are outstanding. Her Latin vocabulary was immense and her choice of words and sentence structure (as translated) was original and vivid. Her writing is immediate and moving. At times her prose feels like poetry.This is an excellent book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"James Bruge's recent work on Heloise and Abelard must surely rate as one of the best to date on the moving and emotional story of this epic love affair torn from the pages of 900 years past. Although the story has been told countless times since Heloise and Abelard fell in love in Paris while Abelard pursued a teaching career at the recently started University of Paris, this new book offers not only superb writing and prose, but also an important \\"extra\\" which is not to be missed.As most people may know, the story of Heloise and Abelard's love is based solely on the eight existing documents written back and forth to each other back in the eleventh century (three written by Abelard, and five by Heloise). Due to some fortuitous circumstances, some good detective work, and a subsequent extensive critical review, a cache of some additional 113 letters from between the two were discovered only recently in the 1970's (the letters were embedded in another medieval work that sought to teach proper Latin writing form, and made use of the text of these letters to illustrate outstanding writing examples, but nevertheless did not cite the source authors). With the majority of the academic community now confirming the authenticity of these 113 \\"new\\" letters, Bruge is able for the first time to weave what these letters reveal into the greater narrative, address lingering questions, fill in gaps, and just generally build a much greater understanding of the lives of these two people who must certainly be considered two of the most famous persons of medieval Europe to have ever lived.It is certainly a story worth telling. What shines forth from these letters is, surprisingly, not Abelard's renowned logic or rhetorical skills, but Heloise's love, her consummate skill at expressing that love in some of the best Latin ever penned (and that must surely be rated as good as Cicero, or better), and her steadfast obedience to that love she possessed in spite of the most difficult circumstances. Yes, this is a book about two medieval individuals, is set in medieval times, and contains numerous historic references to the people and events of the period. To any medievalist, that's not only fine, but good. But this book, for all its references to medieval university structures, medieval church rules and practices, and the start of the gothic building movement, is really about none of these. Rather, it is about Heloise and Abelard, their love, and the cost that each of them paid for pursuing that love. It's Romeo and Juliet on steroids, and once one has read the story as Bruge tells it, it can be little mystery as to why this story has been repeatedly told for the past 900 years. It truly is a love story worth reading.Bruge's writing is clear and meaningful, and includes a few minor explanations that the non-medievalist will find helpful to help set the context of the writings. Thus the book is really a popular work, accessible to anyone. Nevertheless, Bruge has managed to keep the work \\"scholarly,\\" and the work can easily be used by any medievalist scholar who wishes to read more about the process of discovering and authenticating the new 133 letters. There is also a well-regulated smattering of historical signposts and indicators sprinkled throughout the work that help contextualize Heloise and Abelard's story, necessary because so many of the issues they faced were a direct result of the era in which they lived. On the way, we are introduced to Willam of Champeaux, Bernard of Clairvaux, Abbot Suger, Abelard's patrons, and others with whom Abelard tangled (the list of \\"offenedees\\" is both long and distinguished). We also learn of some of the regional areas in which Abelard travelled: a native of Brittany, he spent much time in Paris, but was also called to Sens to defend his positions, set up the Paraclete outside of Paris, and we also learn up front a little bit about how Paris was physically constructed at the time as opposed to the city's current incarnation. The book can certainly beef up your historical understandings of the period as you read the story itself.Looking for a great romance? Skip the front rack at the bookstore, and go directly to Bruge's \\"Heloise and Abelard.\\" And be prepared to be moved."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"Heloise and Abelard retells the story of what is generally regarded as one of the great love stories of the ages. Burge has the benefit of newly discovered letters that were exchanged between the lovers during their romance. Previously, historians had only an exchange of a few lengthy letters written some 15 years after the fact. Heloise and Abelard conduct an illicit affair, are caught by Heloise's uncle Fulbert, and the uncle eventually gets revenge by having Abelard castrated. The two lovers part ways, each going to live monastic religious existences, but Heloise never accepts this fate although she plays the part of abbess extremely well.Abelard's teaching at the monastery eventually leads to charges of heresy by Bernard of Clairvaux. The battle between these two giants of the medieval chruch is Abelard's \\"faith with reason versus faith without reason\\" of Bernard. Bernard wins and Abelard is condemned for heresy.The setting is 12th century \\"France' (although France did not quite exist yet) mainly in Paris and Brittany. Abelard is one the great philosophy teachers of the age, a master logician. Heloise is one of his more apt students. Abelard's unrelentingly antagonistic style of dialectics alienated his opponents. He seems not merely to have wanted to win his arguments, but to utterly destroy those who dared disagree with him. \\"Logic has made me hated by the world.\\" Abelard justly had an immensely high opinion of himself as a thinker. He would no doubt be chagrined to know that today his fame stems largely from his relationship with Heloise rather than his teachings.Abelard and Heloise conducted a most physically sensual love affair. Their love was no courtly romantic love. It was lusty and intense. On one occasion they even have sex in the church refectory! Even 15 years later as abbess of Argenteuil Heloise would write, \\"The name of wife may seem more sacred or more binding but sweeter for me will always be the word mistress, or, if you will permit me, that of concubine or whore.The name of mistress instead of wife would be dearer and more honourable for me, only love given freely, rather than the constriction of the marriage tie, is of significance to an ideal relationship.\\" At that point Abelard futilely encourages Heloise to turn her love to God.Burge annoyingly uses modern terms on occasion to get his point across and makes a few breathtakingly broad assertions that are not necessary to his tale (\\"all societies...tend to support the status quo\\"). On the whole, Burge tells the story in a captivating way with skillful use of the lovers own words and his own interpretations.The story appeals to modern readers, in my opinion, not just because of the steamy aspects of the affair or because the lovers are forced apart, or due to the brutal injury done to Abelard, but because of Heloise's modernity in her views of sex. She unabashedly expresses her enjoyment of sex and refuses to repent for it.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"What a story! Shakespeare did indeed have it right when saying, \\"The course of true love never did run smooth.\\"Heloise and Abelard hit not only some bumpy rapids, but some waterfalls and whirlpools. But their writing to each other is so incredibly beautiful, so poignant.It took me a while to work through this one, but it was worth it. An incredible love story from 900 years ago. If anyone ever says the Middle Ages were dull and stogy, give 'em this book to read. Though some places are in the original text the most part has been translated into modern English. Beautifully, moving, erotic and powerful...Heloise is remarkable. Usually when hearing about this couple, she comes second-- the wanton woman who mended her ways and became an abbess. Burge shows her true colors: intelligent, articulate, intellectual, sensuous, and tenacious at a time when women were not expected to be any of those things. Her letters rang with an honesty. She wasn't afraid to declare her love or to get on Abelard's case when his responses didn't live up to her expectationsAnd the other fascinating part of this book besides the glimpse into their relationship? It gave a window into their world, particularly that of the influence of the church and role of women in it, and the rise of intellectualism and the universities."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"In this book, James Burge uses two sets of letters of Heloise and Abelard to tell the story of their forbidden love. The first set of letters is the collection of eight letters, including Abelard's autobiography, that was discovered shortly after their deaths. The second set is a collection of fragments from 113 letters written during the time of Heloise and Abelard that were compiled in the fifteenth centruy and only recently identified as having probably been written by the two lovers.Who could not be fascinated by this tale of lovers who carried on a clandestine affair while Heloise was under the care of her Uncle Fulbert, a local canon? Their love affair is discovered, Heloise becomes pregnant and is sent to live with Abelard's family, then, after the baby is born, the two of them marry in a secret ceremony so as not to threaten Abelard's position in the church. Uncle Fulbert is still enraged by the insult to his family honor and in a vicious attack one night has Abelard castrated.Burge is an enthusiastic advocate for Heloise, and attempts to rectify her consignment to being an historical footnote, known only for being Abelard's lover. I am never quite convinced that he has the same enthusiasm for Abelard, as most of his descriptions of Abelard focus on the philosopher's arrogance and self-centeredness. In fact, although Burge claims that we have all the evidence necessary to say that Abelard truly loved Heloise, he does not quite convince me of this. I almost came away from this book with the impression that, while Heloise might have loved Abelard intensely, Abelard was more of a lothario who seduced his young student and then, cruelly consigned her to a nunnery, ignoring her later implacations that he at least acknowledge the love they shared.If Burge does not quite manage to make the case that Abelard truly loved Heloise, that is more due to his selection of and explication of the available evidence. He rhapsodizes over Heloise's writing, skills, and intellect; but the selections he gives us from Abelard's writing are more evidence of Abelard's ego than anything else.Burge does a good job of describing the atmosphere of the time during which the two lovers lived, and also describing the effect and implications of Abelard's teachings upon the Catholic Church. The book is readable, although definitely written in a scholarly style.I came away from it with a great deal of admiration for both Abelard and Heloise as individuals, and with sympathy for Heloise's love for Abelard. I just wish I had been able to gain the same sense of conviction for Abelard's love of Heloise."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"Heloise and Abelard was surprisingly good: very well-written, better than most scholarly historical books (Though as a fiction devotee, my experience is limited). It reminded me of How The Irish Saved Civilization, also a well-written and interesting book. Like that one, this one benefits greatly from the fact that the subject matter is fascinating: this is an incredible story.I love the idea of these two remarkable people finding each other and finding love together. I love that the both of them, despite their Medieval morals, were willing to break the rules to be together, to revel in their unique connection. It was fascinating to read parts of their letters to each other, the endearments they wrote, the things they said about their love; totally changed my opinion of the Middle Ages.That was another thing I liked about the book: the view it gave of the Middle Ages, which I don't know much about at all. This gave me a lot more respect for the monastic system as well as for the people, the scholars and philosophers of the time. I was utterly inspired by the idea that Abelard, a successful and famous philosopher, was able to forsake the role of dominant male and listen to his wife, and that from her inspiration, he became one of the foremost feminists of the era, right before the zealots turned all of Europe into a misogynistic theocracy that invented chastity belts and the Malleus Maleficarum.Overall, it's a wonderful story, wonderfully told. Because this was true love, and it's obvious in everything they did and everything they said. I love hearing about lovers that lived a thousand years ago, in a time that seemed so much against true love, when people thought more of alliance and reproduction when they married, and sex was such a meaningless pastime in between (Think \\"The Tudors\\"). And how can I not love a couple that is made up of a poet and a songwriting logician? Even if they did end badly -- though I have to say, the best part of reading this book was the suggestion by the author that the last few years of Abelard's life, before he was accused of heresy and his health failed, were spent in a peaceful friendship, living at the monastery he founded and which was run by Heloise, that they had at least a few years when they weren't torn up by passion as well as by danger, when they could walk together and talk together and just live in harmony. That was magic. I hope it's true."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"This biography is perfect for someone who is not a historian and who is encountering the couple for the first time. Burge tells the couple's story in a way that also tells of the time period while still remaining sympathetic to the lovers. While the book has been called scholarly by other reviewers, I can't help but question if this is simply because Burge quotes primary sources while writing a biography. Quoting and citing primary sources would seem to be to be a minimal requirement for a biography of anyone who is known through their letters. This is a very accessible work - in the way that cable and PBS history programs are accessible. That is, very little or no prior knowledge is required to appreciate the story."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"The story of Heloise and Abelard has intrigued generations over hundreds of years and James Burge has told the story simulaneously, in an erudite and very reader friendly manner. His translated excerpts from the actually letters exchanged by the lovers along with his descriptive commentary, combined with the historical back story, make his book a pleasure to read whether you are a general interest reader, or a medieval history enthusiast. His chronologic organization takes the reader through the events and developments of Abelard's life providing all the details the reader may want without bogging down with superfluous minutiae. Because Burge is a producer and director of documentaries for the BBC, one can only wonder why we haven't seen a film based on this book. Great reading!"},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. This is my introduction to Heloise and Abelard so I can't compare it to anything else, but James Burge's education, research and understanding recommends him. I enjoyed his clarity and analysis in trying to piece together the lives of these two. Yes, some was supposition because we can't know the whole story but he brought in the historical context, letters of others and used his knowledge and intelligence to reason his way through some of the unknowns and I think he did a pretty good job. The middle ages fascinates me as I know it does others and I learned something about the early 1100's. I came away not feeling like I really knew these two complicated people and though it's amazing that we have so much on them I'm just sorry that we know more about Abelard than Heloise. I would have liked to have an account of her life as an Abbess. What an amazing, intelligent, complicated woman with a real gift for writing. I liked the Appendix where Mr. Burge gave us some excerpts from their letters and put the Latin under the English translation because, while I don't know any Latin, I could see the beauty of her writing in the original language with its rhythm and rhyming tecniques. Next I will read her letters in entirety to get the flow."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"A very well-written biography with an excellent historical summary of the times and places. What I found most valuable was the very generous inclusion of the writings of Abelard and Heloise into the main body of the text."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"This book has helped me greatly with a Medieval Philosophy class I am taking. However, I sometimes find myself questioning its accuracy. At times the author seems to write his opinions rather than facts. Also, what I found most surprising is Burge claims Peter Abelard to be a nominalist (a believer that universals are simply words and not real). Truly it was Jean Roscelin, Abelard's teacher, who was a nominalist. While Abelard does owe some of the aspects of his viewpoint to Roscelin, Abelard attacked nominalism and his professor with his own belief called MODERATE REALISM (the belief that universals exist only in the mind but hold power because they refer to general and common concepts). OOPS. As for the writing itself, this book flows very nicely, and Burge does a wonderful job of incorporating quotes from the \\"first letters\\" and \\"lost letters\\" to paint before the reader a love story that is tragic, intense, and always touching."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"These days most people associate the Middle Ages with Middle Earth, i.e. a fantastical world that works well for metaphor but not reality. What's great about \\"Heloise and Abelard\\" is that it brings an outrageous tale from the middle ages into focus from a contemporary perspective. You get to you wrap your brain around the fact that the world portrayed in the lovers' letters once truly existed. And though I admit it's rather shallow to say so, your knowledge of this book can help you make quite a splash at dinner parties, provided no one there is squeamish about castration.My only complaint is that the book seems to focus heavily on Abelard, at the expense of Heloise. Granted, my knowledge of the pair is limited to this one volume, so it could just be that there's more material available to track Abelard's life. Still, I get the impression from Burge that Heloise's fame is greater and that scholars tend to be more fascinated by her than Abelard. Yet this book follows the trajectory of Abelard's life, beginning with his childhood and ending with his death, with only a little epilogue thereafter. Abelard is portrayed as a person in his own right, while Heloise exists only in relation to him. If I really wanted to justify this I could probably say that's what she would have wanted - after all, the way she eroticizes her submission to his will is one of the most fascinating things about her. Nevertheless, I don't get the impression that was Burge's intent, especially not after putting her name first in the title.Still, it's more than worthwhile to spend your time on \\"Heloise and Abelard\\" if you have any interest in medieval history and/or the history of religious thought. Though Burge's style sometimes reads like a senior seminar paper, he's generally accessible and brings a piece of history to life that is part Shakespeare, part tabloid fodder, and 100% worth knowing."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"One of history's greatest romances and, I must write, friendships comes alive through Burge's eloquent accounting of the lives, love, and circumstances of Heloise and Abelard. Burge is especially enabled through the relatively recent discovery of 113 letters between the pair. These letters, along with the eight original found letters, permit a luxurious look into not only a relationship, but into a time in history that bears remarkable similarity to our own.It was back in the 12th century. Abelard, a philosopher of rock-star fame and ambition, meets the intellectual and highly educated Heloise. He maneuvers his way into her household as her tutor, giving him a salary and the pair unfettered access under the guise of study time. Lust in the library leads to a surprise pregnancy, and the wrath of Heloise's guardian uncle Fulbert. The baby is born, and in typical rock star fashion, is given the unlikely name Astrolabe, which would be like someone today naming their child iPod. Oh, those philosophers, those artists. Dare I mention Apple Martin, or Moon Unit Zappa?Many historical studies end with the revenge of Fulbert, and the separation of Heloise and Abelard into cloistered worlds. But here, I think, is where the real romance begins. Their deep soul level relationship continues throughout their lives, with Abelard tilting at philosophic windmills and running afoul of rival clerics, and Heloise quietly, firmly, and steadily building her order of nuns all the while providing constant emotional, intellectual, and managerial support to Abelard. She's the Sharon to his Ozzie; the Linda to his Paul.At once a study in history, romantic legend, and the role of women in the 12th century, this book is a marvelous, highly digestible read that both delights and educates. I'm greatly looking forward to the forthcoming Dante and Beatrice volume."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"I do not want to give anything away and want to keep this simple.This book is incredibly insightful into the lives these two led, there is missing information and the occasional hiccup but other than that it is truly an inspirational account.There was a true threshold that had been a torment for the pair that pulled them back and forth from one extreme to the other."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"The tragic affair of Heloise and Abelard is one of the history's great romances. In the Twelfth Century, the Canon Fulbert castrated the young philosopher Peter Abelard for an illicit relationship with his niece Heloise. In the years following the castration, the two lovers continued to write each other as Heloise became an abbotess and Abelard continued to write philosophical and theological books. It's in a few surviving letters that we see glimpses of an extraordinary and passionate relationship -- a union that engulfed Heloise and Abelard, both romantically and intellectually.James Burge's biography explores Heloise and Abelard's story in the context of medieval culture, religion and politics. It's a fascinating topic - too bad the book is so terribly written. Burge frequently commits a cardinal biographic sin by speculating on the feelings and motivations of people nine hundred years in the past. He also makes a number of unnecessary references to contemporary culture in comparison to medieval Europe. The story of Heloise and Abelard deserves a compelling biography -- unfortunately, I was too distracted by Burge's writing to really enjoy this attempt."},{"Title":"Heloise & Abelard : A New Biography","review":"I read all the wonderful reviews of this book and purchased it. I have always been interested in their lives. But this book reads like a college textbook with so many extraneous details of not only them but everyone they ever came in contact with. Your head is so full of dates and important personages that you just want the story of Abelard and Heloise to be come forward and be told."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"This was a beautiful read. Perhaps the most similar in style of all Wharton's books to works by Henry James, this psychological exploration of human sexual relationships and their consequences is arresting, thought-provoking and fascinating. I highly recommend this book to disciplined readers."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"I have only recently really started getting interested in Wharton again- don't think I had read anything of her's since college. A year ago I read SUMMER, which is also quite good, very interesting. But this one- Wow! I don't have time or energy to go into details (and it would also be a review that went on for three pages!) but suffice it to say that this book is so intriguing, so beautifully written, and even (oddly) suspenseful. The whole effect is like riding the waves of a tide, never knowing where the book will take you next, and yet when you land in a new spot, it's just right. 4 primary characters (3 really) find themselves in a bizarre moral dilemma after an unexpected love affair. Don't want to do the \\"spoiler\\" thing, so I won't give details, but the characters are riveting and you are always changing your mind about which one is right or wrong, who's telling the truth, who's playing a game, who is in denial, who is lying through the teeth or indeed is he innocently just stating facts? I adored this book and even though the action is minimal- it's really a drawing room piece- you get quite a ride out of the thing as you watch these people tossed on a metaphorical reef and you don't know who will survive. After I finished it, I missed the characters so much, I wanted to know more about what happened to them afterwards- if only Wharton had written a \\"sequel.\\" There is, by the way, a strange and rather startling ending- still not sure how I react to this ending, but I ultimately think it just makes the book even more fascinating. - This book still stays with me, a week later and even after having started reading another new gripping novel. I think THE REEF would make a fabulous movie- wish someone would do it. Anyway- READ IT. (By the way, people say this is Jamesian- don't agree. James to me is far more staid and plodding. This book moves, really moves and delves into people quickly, deeply, intimately). (Last note- There is a horrendous introduction by Louis Auchincloss- just skip it entirely. It's dry and dull and even factually wrong- he makes a statement about when the primary couple gets engaged that is completely wrong and in fact is an important point in terms of the plot and how we judge the characters. So forget Auchincloss- he was not inspired by this book (as I am) and I certainly find him totally uninspiring)"},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"I must admit, despite being a HUGE Edith Wharton fan, this novel was, in the beginning, hard to delve into. But once the affair of Darrow and Sophie Viner is past, the novel beings to take on shape and the conflicts between Viner, Darrow, Anna Leath and her stepson Owen continue with the inexorability of a dance of changing partners but the same inexorable tune. Only with the final, subtly nasty last scene do we get a sense of where all the characters will end up.The novel centers around George Darrow, appropriately a diplomat. His ability to lie is second-nature--the first instinct of his seems to be to frame any uncomfortable situation in a fiction to suit his own purposes. His off-and-on again love is Anna Leath, who never seems to be able to make up her mind about him. She clearly loves him, yet puts him off again and again, first through a disastrous marriage and then later in the novel in a desultory engagement. Her desire to \\"know everything\\" is a shield for her indecision; her analytical and curious bent is a disguise for her indecision, and ultimately her undoing.Her stepson, the impetuous Owen is not drawn so finely--but he is essentially an unformed youth. And Sophie; an ingenue but..with the propensity to either be great or horrible. The last scene with her caricature of an older sister is a hint of how her own youthful personality may harden.There is a great deal of the use of rain as a symbol in this novel; it seems to drench and dampen the French landscape not with refreshing moisture, but a dreary, inexorable and uncomfortable wetness, trapping the characters in a submarine world of misty and indistinct motivations.The subtle storytelling--we read the shock of events in small gestures, is a delicacy we have grown away from, but it is stunning and skillful. And yet, in our open age of permissiveness, it is almost incomprehensible that a single, casual sexual liaison could have such a devastation on four lives. Yet..it does and this is the core of the novel. The four characters founder on a reef of fossilized society norms, and their own characters die as the coral do and form the skeleton of personality.While it is a bit slow to start and nowhere near as good as House of Mirth, The Age of Innocents or Custom of the Country, it is worth reading if you enjoy Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"You could say that \\"The Reef\\" has two themes -- that you have to risk great pain to experience great passion, and the questions of infidelity, love and class and how they clash.It also happens to be the brilliant Edith Wharton at her most contemplative, since the entire dramatic storyline takes place in a love square at a rural French chateau. While \\"The Reef\\" is a slow-moving affair, the hauntingly poetic prose that Wharton employs -- and the painful questions it raises -- are worth immersing your brain into.Charles Darrow has been reunited with his first love Anna, now a widow living in France. He plans to propose to her, but on the train receives a telegram telling him not to come until the thirtieth of the month. Angry and hurt (he's kind of a playboy brat), he salves his hurt feelings by escorting pretty Sophy Viner (Alicia Witt), a feisty young girl hoping to get a job on the stage, around Paris for awhile. Unsurprisingly, Sophy's vibrant personality leads to a brief affair.A few months later, Charles and Anna have made up their differences, and their romance is back on track. But when Charles arrives at Anna's mother-in-law's chateau, he learns that her daughter's new governess is none other than Sophy. To make this whole scenario even more surreal, Charles' ex-lover is now engaged to Anna's stepson -- and both Anna and the stepson are unaware of what happened. But though Sophy and Charles try to keep their shared past a secret, the truth threatens to ruin all four of them.Yeah, it sounds a bit like a soap opera in period dress. It's only because of Wharton's skill that, instead of a cheap tawdry story, \\"The Reef\\" becomes a languid, sun-washed study of sexual double-standards, class, and repressed emotion. The entire novel is awash in a seemingly endless sea of contemplations -- many of the characters linger for pages over their pasts, their conflicted feelings, and the secrets they hide from one another.But it's also a study of tough relationship questions -- should infidelity be forgiven, and at what stage of a possible relationship does it become infidelity? And if someone wrongs you, can you trust them again?It's also beautifully written -- Wharton's slow, stately prose is filled with exquisite turns of phrase and beautifully evocative images. Even the most mundane places painted with words as if on a canvas (\\"The sun lay pleasantly on its brown walls, on the scattered books and flowers in old porcelain vases\\"). Much of the narrative is wrapped up in the slowly shifting inner feelings, tiny gestures and veiled comments of the characters, so that half of the most important confrontations seem to happen in a sort of code.Charles is a rather flawed male lead -- he's weak, flirtatious and easily upset, and seems to regard Anna postponing their meeting as being more inconsiderate than his affair with someone else. The women's roles are far more compelling, though. Anna is a strong, wealthy woman who is trying to uncork her own intense feelings so she can fully appreciate life, and Sophy is her polar opposite -- a vibrant, joyous young girl who lacks the resources to enjoy life as she wishes.A lesser author would have crashed on \\"The Reef,\\" but in Edith Wharton's hands it becomes a powerful, vaguely tragic love quadrangle. Definitely worth reading, though it slows to a crawl at times."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"I love Edith Wharton and have read many of her books, but this one is just BORING. It goes on and on and nothing ever happens. If the people in it could just be honest with each other instead of lying to try to avoid confronting difficulties the story would have been a lot better and a lot shorter. It is agonizing to read."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"The Reef by Edith Wharton, with an introduction by Louis Auchincloss. Recommended.In his introduction to The Reef, Louis Auchincloss notes that modern readers may not appreciate a moral climate in which a woman opposes her stepson's engagement to a girl who has had an affair with the man the woman is about to marry. The Reef, however, is as concerned with morality as with class.On his way to France to see his beloved, the widowed Anna Leath, George Darrow receives a telegram telling him not to come \\"till thirtieth\\" due to \\"unexpected obstacle.\\" As time passes and he doesn't receive an explanation for the delay, he experiences growing feelings of disappointment and humiliation. At one point, he imagines the umbrellas and elbows of his fellow travelers saying, \\"She doesn't want you, doesn't want you, doesn't want you.\\"As he waits undetermined as to whether to go back to London or to press forward, he encounters Sophy Viner, a recently unemployed servant of a woman whose dinners he once attended. She is on her way to Paris to look up old friends and to pursue a theatrical career. Darrow, who feels sorry for himself and the loss he thinks he is about to suffer, finds himself manipulating Sophy into staying with him to attend the theatre and finally into a short liaison. He is unaware that she has fallen in love with him and his kindness in her hour of uncertainty.A year later, Anna Leath eagerly anticipates Darrow's arrival, for they are to be married and begin an overseas stint as part of his diplomatic career. She is also excited because her stepson, Owen Leath, wants to do something that they know will upset his aristocratic, old-fashioned grandmother; he wants to marry Anna's daughter's governess, who is none other than Sophy Viner.Darrow and Sophy's secret is safe with one another, yet Darrow is faced by the uncomfortable fact that the ignorant Anna wants him to support Owen's choice of a woman he knows to be unsuitable but whom he pities. He tries to convince Sophy that Owen is not right for her. \\"You'd rather I didn't marry any friend of yours,\\" she says \\"not as a question, but as a mere dispassionate statement of fact.\\" Darrow's lack of feeling and poor conduct make Sophy an undesirable wife for Owen. She is a painful reminder that both of them have broken social conventions.Auchincloss calls Sophy a \\"fallen woman\\" in the context of the times, but this is too simplistic. The real issue with Sophy, both before and after Anna finds out about her relationship with Darrow, is her class and lack of social background. After all, in The House of Mirth, extramarital liaisons are commonplace, understood, and accepted if they are discreet and do not upset the social balance. Within the correct parameters, such affairs become a comfortable topic of gossip and speculation.Once Anna has finally divined that there has been something between Darrow and Sophy beyond the casual acquaintance previously admitted, he acknowledges it by saying simply, \\"She has given me up.\\" This does not refer to Sophy's feelings, but to her expectations. Sophy has learned that, in the world she inhabits, the Darrows seek temporary solace from the Sophys, but permanence and stability from the Annas.The issue that Anna keeps returning to is not that Darrow has deeper feelings for Sophy, but that Sophy has been there before, whether it is to the theatre with Darrow or in Darrow's arms--. True, the liaison happened while he was on his way to Anna and she is bothered by that, but it does not dwell so much in her thoughts as that the kiss he places on her neck has also landed on Sophy's-and that Sophy has been even more intimate with him than she has. Anna asks Darrow, \\"Do such things happen to men often?\\" (phrased passively, as though Darrow had been the pursued rather than the pursuer). \\"I don't know what happens to other men. Such a thing never happened to me . . .\\" The \\"thing\\" here is not the physical aspect of the relationship. Even the \\"fine\\" Anna knows that he has indulged because one of his relationships, with a mutual acquaintance named Kitty, drove her away from him in their youth. The fact is that this relationship is outside their social sphere and reflects a lack of discretion that may make him an unsuitable husband and stepparent.Sophy, with her finely tuned perceptions, her delicacy, her generosity, and her genuine feelings (Darrow assures Anna that she is no adventuress, which Anna wants her to be), does not deserve her fate. She goes off to India to return to the service of Mrs. Murrett. In one of the weaknesses of The Reef, Anna's encounter with Sophy's fat, frowsy, common sister and her equally common lover, Jimmy Brance, puts the noble Sophy in her proper place for both Anna and the reader.The Reef is in shallower waters than The House of Mirth or The Age of Innocence, and its structure is weakened by a forced reliance on dialogue. A large part of the final third consists of various characters talking to Anna in her room, coming and going what may as well be a revolving door. Sophy's fate further weakens the drama. Yet, who but Wharton could write, \\"Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and fears\\"? Such elegant prose and insights alone distinguish The Reef.(As an aside, it would be interesting if, in the same fashion Jean Rhys gave Bertha Mason from Jane Eyre \\"a life,\\" a writer were to do the same for Sophy, whose viewpoint is never shown.)Diane L. Schirf, 7 July 2003."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"So, this is Edith Wharton! Miss Manners, you say----like watching a bunch of stiff English folks dance the minuet in an over-stuffed drawing room. Well, yeah, but! There's this thing she does with that drill. You, know, it's the way she uses it to penetrate the deepest recesses of her characters'minds, three, in particular. There's Darrow, the handsome man-of-the-world eligible bachelor. Upon first meeting, you'll wonder if there's any there there. Wharton's drill reveals all. There's also, the widow Anna, Darrow's intended. When Anna discovers that Darrow once had a dalliance with Sophy, her daughter's governess, she becomes, as the Italians say, outside of her self. Here, Wharton's drill work is akin to watching a colonoscopy on the brain. While she never really leaves her house, never raises her voice, never moves more than a few muscles of her exquisite face, what we see going on in her brain has more twists, turns, and switchbacks than the car chase scene in the French Connection. Next to Anna and Darrow, Sophy presents with quiet dignity. Yes, she has had this affair with Darrow. Yes, she is of a lower class. But, no, she is not sorry for what she did. And, she is not about to sell her soul for the bourgeoisie existence so valued by Anna and Darrow. She's the most honest of the Wharton characters, and the one most difficult to analyze. One wrong move with the Sophy character, and you could easily get pulp fiction. Instead, Miss Manners drills out a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"Yes, Wharton was just a tad mean and crude in writing the male counterpart of this book, but that's what makes this book so interesting. These characters had flaws! Actually flaws! I am so sick of reading books with perfect little characters with just one evil villian. This book shows you that no one is perfect, and everyone has a little evil in them.A charming, poetic, lyrical, and beautiful book to read. Wonderful descriptions, vivid images, lovely constructed sentences.The cover of THE REEF is also beautiful. The text and lay out enhances the story, the elegance of the past, the wrong and the right. The cover was also rather of a matte type of thing, not glossy, which reminds the reader of ceramic and the older days when they turn the pages and old the book open.Another lovely read by my favorite female author of the 20th century, Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"This is a very strange format for an Edith Wharton novel--no publication date, no biographical information, many typographical errors.

We see his boredom and disillusionment through his reactions to the mere sounds she is making in the next room.

The genteel, older Anna -- whose rich interior life and deep introspection separated her -- as a young girl -- from other young women of her time who understood how to connect, particularly to potential husbands. And yet, Anna's early inability to form meaningful relationships cause other mothers of her circle to consider Anna the model of all ladylike virtues. Anna believes marriage will free her, yet it confines her. As a widow, she reaches back to the unrealized love of her early life and seeks to overcome the inhibitions of her past. Contrast that to Sophy Viner, young, vibrant and utterly naive, without the protection of family or fortune. The happiest time of her life is a brief, unwitting affair with the gentleman who was Anna's early love and who is about to return to Anna. How these three characters' lives intersect, and how they each struggle with conscience, character and social entitlement (or lack thereof) results in a thoughtful commentary on men, women and society. Wharton's beautiful prose and vivid scenes of both domestic life and nature add to the reader's experience."},{"Title":"The Reef","review":"While \\"The Reef\\" is to my mind not on par with her other great works, it is nonetheless an entirely worthwhile read. The emotional drama is compelling, palpable, devastating. Altogether engrossing. The descriptive scenes are for the most part not as sharp as they might be, but the power of the novel lies in its dialogue-- in what is said, but more often what is not said. It concerns the inability to express in any meaningful fashion those things that most matter, the agony of non-expression as much as the agony of the primary feelings themselves. I enter, perhaps, too easily into the emotions of what are, after all, only fictional characters, but I was moved to tears by certain passages, on account of the emotional rawness that underlies the attempts to preserve decorum.

The Great Work of the title is an exhortation to all of us to embrace this philosophy of the love of others through care of the environment. The great age of 94 at which he died is a measure of the depth of wisdom of his message.Though the book contains warnings enough of the perils for humankind if we continue on our path of materialistic self-interest, overall this is a message of hope, of what we can become if we have the moral strength and courage to shift the focus of our existence from ourselves with our short-term goals to the continuing existence of life on the planet: \`We think of the Earth more as the background for economic purposes or as the object of scientific research rather than as a world of wonder, magnificence and mystery for the unending delight of the human mind and imagination.' A primary concern for humankind \`must be to recover an integral relation with the universe'.Like some other contemporary futurists Berry lays great emphasis on the importance of the role of education in schools and universities. The whole emphasis of education has become the acquisition of facts rather than to \`hear the voice of the rivers, the mountains, or the sea. . . We have disengaged from that profound interaction with our environment that is inherent in our nature' and which finds natural expression in the indigenous peoples of the world. \`The other-than-human world is not recognised as having any inherent rights or values . . . we have silenced too many of those wonderful voices of the universe that spoke to us of the grand mysteries of existence.'Sadly, some reviewers seem to regard awe and wonder at the majesty and mystery of the universe as a kind of pagan animism. This is an inspirational book for anyone who is sensitive to the plight of the planet and who wants to immerse themselves in the spiritual journey towards what another futurist, Frank Parkinson, called metanoia - a fundamental shift in our outlook on the world.Howard Jones is the author of The Tao of HolismGlobal Mind Change: The Promise of the 21st Century"},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"This book was recommended to me by a fellow Montessori teacher.

The low reviews are incomplete, probably because the reviewers don't care to expound... I'm guessing there would be several more negative reviews if this book didn't generate such a &quot;-bluh-&quot; feeling in the reader.I consider myself a pragmatic environmentalist... this book simply had no substance for me, nothing to grab onto. There are almost no anecdotes, just abstract talk about how people should remove themselves from the top rung of the evolutionary chain, and step down to the level of all other species (should dolphins and chimpanzees do the same?). Berry bemoans almost every aspect of organized human life (which implies some psychological issues in the author), but offers no suggested replacements or improvements. Even where he draws on the example of nature, his obvious selectivity makes no effort to find understanding in how humans may have diverged from our natural family. It's just one general, abstract gripe session after another.And this just goes on and on and on. I'm not a speed-reader, but after the first half, I found myself able to read a page every 7-8 seconds. It just looks the same, reads the same... check this book out from the library first, and see if you agree.If you want hope, if you want -tools-, if you want ideas, if you want a notion of how life could look, not just a summary of how it -shouldn't- look, I might recommend to you Dee Hock's &quot;Birth of the Chaordic Age&quot;... but definitely something other than &quot;The Great Work&quot;.

This book only reinforces the impression that environmentalists are self-righteous and out of touch with other humans as well as reality. Instead of referencing current events, or any statistics to support his sermonizing,Berry spends his space name dropping. It is painfully apparant that he is more interested in sounding erudite than remaining coherent. His attempts to sound erudite are undermined by his tendency to reuse words with inappropriate frequency. The book would have been far more effective as a one or two page pamphlet but unfortuantely it was drawn out to be 102 pages of repetition.

You may labor at times, but the fruit is abundant. You'll understand more clearly the deep causes in our cultural evolution that have put the Earth at risk. The solution is an immense undertaking, but Berry reminds us there's hope, and that we aren't alone. The human community, and more importantly, the larger life/Earth/Universe community, is available and at work, in us. How can it not be, when it was those communities from which we came? The developing universe, as Berry writes. When you adequately understand the causes of the problems, when you can identify them both outside and within, you move in a better direction. Berry provides an un-numbered, un-listed direction, one that is heard with more than the rational mind. Yet, he articulates better than I could have imagined. He gives an immense hope and guides toward that most important of all energies at this time, the psychic energy necessary for confronting and walking forward, for preparing oneself for real action, real work. That is a big thing. If you have wrung your hands at the seeming impossibility of correcting the wrongs done to the Earth, read this book. Berry doesn't give you concrete things to do, his words work into your creative area, your reflective mind, your spirit.The folks who reacted negatively in review of this book missed the point or had other expectations. They almost kept me from purchasing The Great Work. I'm glad I bought it. It's one of the two or three most important works I've read."},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"With the wealth of works statistically portraying the growing threats of climate change, it's almost refreshing to encounter someone seeking a \\"soft\\" approach. Berry recognises the obstructions in transforming a polluting and morally corrupting economy to a less harmful path. He points to a change in attitude we must all make to prevent catastrophe. Yet, it's not difficult, he argues, to reassert a more direct tie with Nature such as we enjoyed in our ancient past. What was once there, but lost, can be recovered. It merely takes some will.In Berry's view, the Cenozoic Era, used by geologists to encompass modern times, is coming to a close. Technology and the spread of humanity into nearly every environmental niche have changed conditions too drastically for the older appellation to continue. The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation over vast areas, huge fishing nets scooping up masses of sea life, and blindly occupying or modifying habitats has led to the extinction of countless species. What aspects of life characterised the Cenozoic are no longer there to give it definition. And there's worse to follow if we fail to heed his advice. Learn to do better, he cautions.Berry restrains his religious background and spiritual leanings to address the larger crisis of the Earth's survival. There are no lofty appeals to a \\"spiritual\\" aspect of the planet, but he's sharply critical of the materialist outlook that's destroying it. He insists we consider the Earth as an integrated system, which is a realistic view, given our current piecemeal exploitation practices. He urges a broader outlook from his readers. This requires entertaining some novel ideas and encounters with unexpected people. Indigenous peoples are a good source of wisdom in Berry's view. However, it's their knowledge he seeks, not the return to an aboriginal lifestyle.The application of knowledge to solve problems in our society is generally conceded to the universities. From this, Berry concludes that appeals to government or business are essentially wasted effort, unless they understand the impact of their policies. He suggests that instead of radical environmental protest to save species and habitat, it is the universities who must be enlisted in the cause. For one thing, the academic arena provides the means of acting as a feedback loop with each cycle increasing the information dividend. The new findings make their way to the public to support changes in policies. Although this is obviously not a rapid means of change, Berry finds it the most self-sustaining one. Once the process begins to unfold, we will be entering the Ecozoic Era with a firmer grasp of our impact on the planet. \\"The Great Work\\" is thus learning how to move from a human-centred to an Earth-centred set of values. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"This review is long, and my apologies, but this book is potent and spells-out what is one of the most important subjects of the 21st century- our drifting from physical reality and responsibilities and the need to wake-up and realize this dilemma and how we can accomplish that possible , but daunting task. Thomas Berry does this with eloquence and wisdom here and this is truly, a \\"Great Work\\"! Thank you, Mr. Berry!In his earlier book, \\"The Dream of the Earth\\", Thomas Berry so eloquently stated the need for humanity to realize what a beautiful foundational life-support gift we have in planet Earth and the need to treat it with the profound sense of respect and good stewardship it deserves and needs in to order to provide a healthy life-sustaining platform.An understanding of the dynamics of Earth's resource cycles and regulatory systems can teach us how to live sustainably and regeneratively- most importantly, carrying that understanding into the formation and dissemination of religion, politics and economy.We see God's handy-work, i.e., the blue prints and operating system for Earth through the dynamics of Nature's regenerative, life providing bounty and we then see what is required to maintain this perfect system. Indeed, we are entering the \\"Eco-zoic\\" faze of our existence- the realization and implementation of an ecologically sustainable reality.So how could Berry top that beautiful piece of work? Almost ten years after \\"The Dream\\", he comes out with \\"The Great Work\\", a powerful and compelling continuation of the earlier theme of a beautiful Earth with attentive humans at the helm and with proper stewardship, only now with an exacting historical dialogue of how the Earth formed, settled and eventually became a biological life-support system and where we, as humans have lost our original awe and respect of God's creation through the many distractions of living in a human only, \\"civilized\\" and complex material world, forgetting our interconnectedness to all life.This separation has culminated in an insane, parasitic and cancerous existence not only for us humans, but for all life on this planet. Isn't it curious that cancer of our bodies is one of our biggest worries and nemesis? Mass over-population, pollution, unsustainable resource use and habitat destruction have left us in a burn-out, dire mess. Our sense of economy is no \\"economy\\" at all, rather a predatory take all shark frenzy fully supported by governments through corporate purchase and manipulation and misguided \`human only' pseudo-religious zealotry.An un-Godly, reckless \\"Manifest Destiny\\" attitude of anthropocentric endeavors has been prevailing since the industrialization of our societies exploded on the human scene, blinding us with delusions of superiority, yet to the detriment of our shared and threatened environment.Exactly in the middle of this fine book, is a chapter called\\"Ethics and Ecology\\". Here, Berry relates our combined human sense of making like nothing is wrong on spaceship Earth (a closed-loop eco-system) with a parallel to the tragedy of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. A course was set and could not be deviated from, regardless of the warnings of known dangerous icebergs ahead. An attitude that the Titanic was a perfect, fool-proof and unsinkable human manifestation prevailed.The Titanic parallel underscores our misguided human notions that we can control Nature and that we are on a safe course in our activities on Earth. We see our creation of the Titanic (the micro), but not the big picture (the macro), i.e., Nature along with it's icebergs, etc., but especially, the need for our attention to it's requirements for a safe, healthy existence.As Berry states, our \\"extractive\\" (exploitive, parasitic) economies have become \\"terminal\\" economies (dead-end) and need to be reformulated to sustainable/regenerative economies for the continuation and enjoyment of life- only in a more sane and quality existence.For those that don't think it can be done, it would be educational to look at the turn-around of attitudes and subsequent successes of corporations that have been able to wake-up to what sustainable/regenerative/eco-friendly formats offer in terms of long lasting, profitable returns, let alone peace of mind. A good outline of that can be seen in the book, \\"Natural Capitalism\\" by Hawken and Lovins.Further, religions need to continue with their return to the inclusion of all Creation and away from the current deviation of anthropomorphism. Understanding the dynamics and importance of interconnectedness with all of God's Creation is a matter of survival now and should not be interpreted as \\"Nature Love\\" vs. \\"Biblical Dogma\\". It's all one reality. Berry gently opens our eyes to this!The consideration of an all-inclusive creation- man and nature in harmony instead of man vs. nature- both created by God to coexist, is also touched upon in the 'great work' of Chet Raymo's books \\"Skeptics and True Believers\\", sequealed by his \\"Climbing Brandon\\"- in a sermon by Saint Columbanus, there is in part: [Those who wish to know God, he says, \\"must first review the natural world.\\"]. Indeed, a good place to start!There is a good bibliography in \\"The Great Work\\" that provides a multitude of resources for further research and education on sustainable awareness and consciousness."},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"this is not a conventional review. its really an attempt to counter some of the ill informed negativity about this book that is starting to appear. This is such a great book that is upset me to read that someone was almost put off by the few negative reviews.Really I'm almost surprised there aren't more negative and aggressive reviews of this book considering it is so uncompromisingly critical of everything most people are (willingly or unwillingly) reliant upon right now - in western society at least. I can only assume its because the book has not yet reached the readership it deservesThe beauty of what has been written in the negative reviews on here, though, is that they perfectly illustrate the attitude Berry is concerned with. We have a christian who decries Berry's work as 'godless, biocentric, new age' highlighting berry's criticism of the orthodox Judeo-Christian tradition; of its role in the separation of 'spirit' and 'matter' resulting in a human mind isolated from its natural environment. And so, as proof, here we have someone is far more concerned about Berry's catholic credentials and adherence to an abstract theology than our continued adaption and survival on this planet.western science is by no means exempt from playing a part in this disconnection and alienation. Whilst orthodox religion has taken 'spirit' as the rime reality and abandoned the physical world around us as evil fallen or illusory science has gone in the other direction and taken the 'material world' as the only reality whilst abandoning spirit. Both are in a mess because 'matter' and 'spirit' are different aspects of one thing. they need to be together- so berry argues convincingly. And hence you get on the other side 'pragmatic environmentalists' who only want to know about practical action plans and statistic- they do not want to hear about the grand vision- that's just pompous'!Again Berry's point throughout is that the 'gazing at the stars in wonder' - the 'mythic' component is not a nice aesthetic luxury for us to have whilst we get on with the business of turning the wheels of the economy and being 'realistically hard headed'- or whilst we be 'practical environmentalists' and busy ourselves with installing passive solar heating panels. This 'wonderment' is a radically necessary adaptive behavior- a reconnection with reality in all its aspects - and Berry's warning is that if we do not manage to foster it amongst ourselves in a real and dynamic way then we have no future to speak of.That is a stark and frightening proposition and in many ways, none of us want to hear it because it is going to involve eating some humble pie. ie we don't want to hear that we are in that much trouble that we are about to terminate a geological era and we don't want to hear that we have become alienated and disconnected from reality (especially some environmentalists don't)So we have someone who argues that Berry's harsh and almost universal critique of modern industrial society means he must have 'psychological issues'. yes of course- that must be it! he can't cope with industrial society so he's trashing it! Even better is the assertion that Berry's position is 'anti human'. Which is to think that what makes us human is the achievements of industrial society rather than the quality of our lives and lived experience. That to criticize the industrial project of economic growth which has lasted for 200 years is to criticize the human which has been around for 100's of thousands of years. its a common and insidious tactic.Elsewhere there is unease that we are being asked to step down from our position on top of the evoutionary pile by Berry- an astonishing interpretation. 'should dolphins and chimpanzees also step down?' the reviewer rhetorically asks. No because dolphins are not causing the mass-scale degradation of their own habitat by devotion to an abstract ideal and (as far as we know) do not go around telling themselves how they are the 'top of the evolutionary pile'!Rather than filling up this concise work with facts and figures he gives extensive references to the direct sources (criticized in negative reviews as 'name dropping' and a 30 page bibliography of further reading (which includes works that are antagonistic towards his view). From there you will have enough facts and figures to last you a few decades. But no, some people want it all given to them and given to them in a book under 200 pages long where the focus is clearly stated as a summary of the general path of our way into the future- and inspiration for it.Of course Berry is well aware that there will be incredible opposition to the birth of this earth/universe-centered paradigm. Many people are still far too financially and emotionally attached to the dream of technological domination of the earth; with the human mind isolated, alienated but privileged above everything else. iIn fact all of us are essentially attached to it right now whether we like it or not.but the change is beginning to gather pace already. people are slowly beginning to re-connect everywhere in a multitude of ways. Depending on your level of thinking right now you will either see that as positive or as the threat of a new 'dangerous new ideology' because right now that will be the only way you can interpret what is happening."},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"This book starts off slow and builds. It starts out sounding like a sermon, preaching renewed intimacy with the natural world. Of course it is easier to describe that, than to actually suck the reader into that experience. Slowly, however, Berry passes beyond preaching. The book becomes a passionate documentary, exposing with careful accuracy the gaping holes in our ethics, our laws, and our cultures. He travels up and down planetary history and across civilizations, always sounding familiar with his vast element. The whole presentation is an example of what Berry preaches: life centered on the greater self of the living planet, with all things no longer revolving around humanity.--author of The Gardens of Their Dreams: Desertification and Culture in World History"},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"Thomas Berry (not to be confused with Wendell Berry) was a Catholic priest of the Passionist order and the president of the American Teilhard Association. However, his interpretations of both Christianity and Teilhard strike me as somewhat idiosyncratic. In fact, there is very little distinctively Christian about Berry's book \\"The Great Work\\". Nor is it particularly Teilhardist, although some influences are visible. Essentially, Berry was a Green pantheist, and his book will strike a familiar chord among deep ecologists, ecofeminists, some Neo-Pagans and perhaps some Buddhists. Indeed, Berry never mentions his formal Catholic identity in \\"The Great Work\\", although he does reference Teilhard a number of times.Berry doesn't explicitly deny the existence of a transcendent divine reality, but he doesn't seem to regard it as central. The universe is the only self-referential, self-explanatory object within the \\"phenomenal world\\". Indeed, the universe *is* the phenomenal world. Therefore, humans should relate to and commune with the universe, and all human ethics should be derived from the universe. Indeed, they should be subordinated to the \\"creation processes\\" of said universe. Berry is opposed to a religion which centres on the transcendent. \\"Creation processes\\" are more important than \\"redemption processes\\". We must stop to look upon the world as something imperfect we must seek release from, or radically change in our image. Instead, we should embrace it as it is.Berry sees the universe as poised between two forces, one expanding, creating and wild, the other opposing, limiting and contracting. (Coleridge?) None of the forces are consistently \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\", although Berry seems to prefer the expanding force of wildness. The universe is ever-evolving and presumably poised between the two forces in a somewhat uneasy manner. Berry admits that evil and suffering are part of the universe, but regards this as the inevitable by-product of the creative force.Further, the author argues that evolution is emergent and in some sense teleological. Humans are a natural part of the universe, in a sense its \\"highest\\" part. In humans, the universe finally becomes conscious and celebrates itself. Conversely, humans can find fulfilment only by communing with the rest of the universe. Thus, while Berry shares the progressive evolutionary perspective of Teilhard (and the hard-nosed attitude to the inevitability of evil and loss), he never follows his mentor all the way to the Omega Point. Teilhard's speculations about the noosphere and the Cosmic Christ sound anthropocentric in the extreme. In my opinion, Berry has problems squaring emergent evolution with deep ecology, according to which humans *aren't* fundamentally different from everything else. Indeed, if the universe is the only thing that exists (de facto), why reject a new, techno-utopian or otherwise super-transcendent phase of emergent evolution? Why stop at something resembling pre-modern society? Ray Kurzweil or Ken Wilber are more consistent believers in emergence as a fundamental property of the cosmos.One of Thomas Berry's fundamental notions is harmony. Everything in the universe has its proper place, and all living organisms have inherent value and rights. So have biota. Berry bemoans the fact that the U.S. constitution doesn't give nature rights and legal standing. But this, too, is contradictory since (of course) there cannot be harmony in a constantly evolving universe. There must of course be ecological balance, but this can be accomplished in several ways. Here's one example: when humans exterminated the great auks, the fish population in the northern Atlantic must have increased dramatically, making it possible to establish commercial fishing on a large scale. However, as long as there is no over-fishing, there is still an overall ecological balance. This might be tough for great auks, but so what? The universe doesn't seem to mind! Here is another example, more hypothetical this time: imagine that the reserves of oil won't peak until the year 2300. Imagine further that some form of carbon sequestration works, and that electricity can be generated from thorium reactors. Add genetic engineering to this spicy dish (perhaps algae can be made to produce oil?), and you get my point. Berry would oppose a super-artificial, super-technological civilization like this, but at least hypothetically, it could create some kind of balance with a (radically altered) environment. Sure, it will collapse one day, but hey, so did the dinosaurs, Neanderthals and Romans. Evolution, anyone?Thus, the inherent value Berry believes exist in every living organism (and the biosphere itself) cannot really be derived from his evolutionary perspective. Logically, Berry should have a static view of the universe, similar to that of Ren&eacute; Guenon and the Traditionalists. The author has problems accounting for the human species, which doesn't seem to have a \\"proper place\\" in the first place! However, if humans are natural products of evolution, then their exotic ability to change their environment is just as natural as the rest of the biosphere. Berry is opposed to the idea that we don't really belong here, that we are some kind of aliens (alien spirits?) trapped in a hostile world, but if we are natural, then an artificially created balance or harmony is neither more nor less desirable than the pre-modern or pre-human balance. It's neither good nor evil. It just is.Of course, \\"The Great Work\\" is right that our present civilization is unsustainable. That conclusion, however, can be reached on purely pragmatic grounds. The real question is how to justify the deep green ethics of the author, provided we believe they can and should be justified? Ironically, they can't be justified merely by pointing to the immanent \\"creation processes\\" of a material or panpsychist universe. These processes also include extinction events which doesn't affect the whole, and other things Berry would no doubt found unacceptable. Even Berry's philosophy needs a transcendental dimension (presumably some kind of deep ecology deity) to be consistent. But it's precisely this transcendental perspective that the author has rejected in an attempt to create an Earth-centred pantheism!Without transcendence, Thomas Berry is left with the wild evil and suffering of emergent evolution."},{"Title":"The Great Work : Our Way Into the Future","review":"Berry is a humanist, visionary, with much wisdom to impart. His writing is deep and well documented. But it is difficult to slog through each paragraph to get the meaning inherent in the words.

He views everything through the rose colored glasses of what he thinks is good."},{"Title":"The Rookie: A Season with Sidney Crosby and the New NHL","review":"An objective review of this book from me is impossible. But a fair one, the book more than deserves. Late in the text, Ms. Richer gives a speech, or at least an anecdote, some advice she was given as she wrote this book, on objectivity in writing: \\"But objectivity ... is not necessarily a worthy goal. To be objective in the literal sense would be to remove all emotion from the coverage, and sportswriting at its best can only be worthwhile by embracing and exposing emotion and all the things that fuel it. Fairness ... is the tone you want to strive for.\\" So I give Ms. Richer and her book a fair deal, but not an objective one, as I am emotionally attached to the subject matter.I lived in Pittsburgh for over 30 years and am a die-hard Penguin fan. I know the entire cast of characters in this book, what they look and sound like, including the indefatigueable Tom McMillan, Penguins Vice President of Communication, who is a major player in the story. I can hear Mike Lange's voice calling out the plays, and Phil Bourque's commentary, on the air or not. I can picture the Igloo (the Pens' home arena) with snow on it, or the rolling hills of Upper St. Clair (Ryan Malone's home neighborhood). From Molinari to Mario, Sewickley to the Steelhead Grill, whether you are from Pittsburgh or not, you too will settle into this story as if you were hearing it from a friend in your own neighborhood.Shawna Richer gained the enviable assignment of chronicling Sidney Crosby's first year in the NHL with the Pittsburgh Penguins. This is a significant season for two reasons - Sidney Crosby is not just another hockey player, and this wasn't just the mere beginning of another hockey season. Crosby, a native of Nova Scotia, was the most anticipated rookie since 1984, when Mario Lemieux was taken first overall (also) by the Penguins, the same draft in which Crosby's father was selected. The NHL was also making a debut of sorts. After an owners' lockout of the players had cancelled the previous season in its entirety, the revamped league was back for business.A new collective bargaining agreement had finally been reached by the owners and the player's union. The owners had conceded to revenue sharing which would allow small market teams to survive financially. The players conceded to a salary cap, which would allow owners to survive financially. The league would benefit from the parity that this arrangement breeds - all 32 teams able to compete with each other, year after year.League executives restructured and reinforced the rule book during the unfortunate lull. Their intent was to free the game from the stifling \\"clutch and grab\\" style of defensive hockey and allow for a faster, more skilled, offensive game. Showcase the league's more talented players. Give the old fans something to cheer about, and try to lure new fans to the speed and grace of the game. As a player with \\"once-in-a-generation\\" ability, 18 year old Sidney Crosby would be shouldered with the mantle of the \\"new NHL\\". From the time before he was even drafted, Crosby had been labeled as \\"The Next One\\", and after a full lost season, the league looked to him to win fans, old and new, to the game. Even though he didn't ask for it, the youngster understands his role and carries it out with a gentle passion as fierce as the one he brings to the ice.Ms. Richer tells the story well. The Pittsburgh Penguins, like most of the small market teams in the NHL, had been losing millions of dollars every year. Unable to pay premium salaries, one by one, their star players left or were traded. At the conclusion of the previous season, the Penguins had finished last overall. Under the new arrangements, the Penguins would be able to surround Crosby with veteran talent. And they did so, turning into a contender within a few weeks.The league literally took off and the fast, exciting pace of the games silenced every pre-season criticism of the rule changes. Crosby's season took off too, but had several unimaginable bumps. His coach was fired in December. There was a slight but sustained backlash from some fans and players against Crosby. In one six day span, both of his linemates retired, and the team was put up for sale by the owner, Lemieux. The same Mario Lemieux who was 1984's once-in-a-generation rookie was now, not only the team's owner, but one of the retiring linemates.Richer was there for everything and delivers each high and low in a straight, readable narrative. She quickly (p15) pays homage to Peter Gzowski's exemplary hockey book, The Game of Our Lives. (Anything written on the subject since 1981 should.) The Rookie is given a similar form by the author, announcing the time and venue of significant games, going through the Penguins roster with a short paragraph for each player, and weaving her experiences and inferences into the text.The book falls short of the insider's look and analysis I expected from the subtitle (A Season With Sidney Crosby and the New NHL). It seems like Ms. Richer is barely below the surface of Crosby the individual, the Penguins as a team, the \\"new\\" league as a whole, and Canada's reaction to all of the above. I, however, do not know what is acceptable to print about the inner workings of an NHL locker room, so it remains to accept Ms. Richer's coverage and interpretation of events.Even after the Penguins are disappointingly eliminated from playoff contention, Ms. Richer is able to keep the reader's interest with drama appropriate to the tale. How would Crosby handle playing on a loosing team? Would he be voted Rookie of the Year? Would he be able to achieve certain milestones like being named to the Canadian Olympic squad or reaching 80 points on the season? How would Sidney Crosby's first season and the \\"new\\" NHL turn out?

They never become dated because as new fish become available to the aquarist trade the books are updated. There is not a lot of literature on Freshwater Stingrays so this book is invaluable.They do not deal with the basics of fish keeping, there are many and varied books that do that.

It takes place in the Spanish Peaks/Greenhorn Mountain region of southern Colorado as the Territory prepares to become a state, during the Civil War. In addition to the tale of William Maltando, the story tells of the loss of property experienced by Confederate Southerners who traveled west to start again, as well as the losses incurred by Native Americans--losses that can never be replaced. It includes the adventures of a spunky young woman who risks her life more than once to right the wrong that was done to Will and his family. There is never a dull moment in this book and the characters will hang on with you when you have finished. It will take you back to the 1860's and what life was like then in southern Colorado. I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Roping the Wind","review":"Once in a great while I read a book that I don't want to end. Roping the Wind by A. Robert Hill is one of these novels. Even better than James A. Michener's, Centennial, native Coloradian Hill, has woven a great novel about a state that has mountains touching the sky! Toward the end of the Civil War, Colorado Territory became a place where a diversity of people gathered. The Native Americans who didn't become civilized (Apache, Two Feathers) were either dying out or being sent to rot on reservations (Leather Cape, a Comanche chief). Indian terrorists were slaughtering Whites (Ojos Calinete-Hot Eyes, and The infamous Espinosa Brother). People who owned Spanish land grants were losing their homes (William Maltando and his family). New people were coming into Colorado Territory. Deserters from the Confederate Army were hiding out in Colorado's wilderness (Jessie McComb). Politicians in Denver were trying to make laws for the soon to become a new state (U.S. Senator Stille and his beautiful daughter, Ruth, who pretended to try to keep Will Maltando from getting into her bloomers)! Priests tried to bring culture and morals into the new territory (defrocked Father Jon Cartier who painted the woman who caused his downfall -nude painting in the local saloon). Other characters are the Mexican Victoria, companion of Ruth, and Tom Tobin, who put a quick end to the Espinosa Brothers. And last of all of the new comers were Union soldiers who were coming to tame the wild and wooly Colorado (Colonel Salem Clark).The whole exciting and wonderful novel are summed up in these two paragraphs:&quot;I'm listening!&quot; Ruth replied while conjuring an impish grin on her lips and looking directly into Will's eyes. He looked at her, trying his best to make her understand what he was about to say was very important, &quot;My folks and I want you to know how much we appreciate what you done fer us an' that you're always gonna' be welcome here on Estancia de Santa Maria. We want you to know that! God, Ruth...I knowed I had just 'bout as much a chance gittin' this ranch back as I would have goin' out an' trying' ropin' the wind...But you did it!&quot;&quot;My father used to tell me, 'Ruth! Godammit! I believe if you made your mind up to go out and try roping the wind- I believe you could do it!&quot;Roping the Wind should put A. Robert Hill among the ranks of Western authors such as Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, and Larry McMurtry. Read the novel and I think you'll agree.

Robert Hill, tells one part of the story in this epic saga. As the book opens in Colorado Territory in 1864, the Maltando family is losing its ranch. Decendants of early of early Basque settlers from northern Spain, the Maltandos have ranched their land in southern Colorado for generations. But life is changing in the West.Newcomers in Denver are preparing Colorado for statehood and using the Guadallupe-Hildago Treaty of 1848 to push many of the early Spanish settlers off their land grant ranches. Against this backdrop, this epic story weaves much of the history of soutern Colorado into the lives of the Maltando family and friends. Disappointments surface, passions mount and the inevitable love story survives as history and fiction combine in a very Colorado story line.Readers will meet non-fiction characters such as Uncle Dick Wooten, Kit Carson, Leather Cape and Chief Ouray interacting with the fictional characters. Readers will also recognize locations that range from Walsenburg, then known as La Plaza de los Leones, to Central City and Black Hawk.Mona Neeley - EditorColorado Country Life Magazine"},{"Title":"Horizon Note (The Brittingham Prize in Poetry, Ronald Wallace, General Editor)","review":"The opening poem of Horizon Note introduces a spider who reappears at intervals throughout this book.

He describes an event that happened when he was only, I think, an infant. He has used family and other accounts of the last great epidemic of the Black Death to strike England. It is readable and instructive.To me, the most interesting part of the tale, is the 'knowledge' people had of this disease before knowledge of microbes and their transmission. Animals, especially dogs, cats and rats, were identified as possible transmission agents and were shot on sight. Infected people are quarantined in their homes along with their relatives. Although these homes were guarded by armed people, breakouts from quarantine were common. The disease spread and uninfected villages on the outskirts of London, themselves set out guards, preventing panicked refugees from entering and infecting their towns.

I gained a new perspective on the people who endured that year in London. The fears and the reality of the experience as related in these pages touched me as few books have."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"The Great Plague took place when Defoe was five years old. Therefore his account written many years afterwards is as much fiction as eye-witness reporting. Yet his first- person narrator collects statistics and provides a credible account of the horrifying effect of the plague upon the citizens of London.He relates the effects of the 'Plague' on various parts of the population and traces its develoment in time. One can sense in it how much Camus in writing his great work , \\" The Plague\\" is indebted to this work.In the concluding days as the Plague wanes Defoe reflects upon the citizens of the city and their new reality.This is the concluding section of the work, and gives an excellent feel of Defoe's language and narrative stance.\\"It was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all apprehensions, and that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head, or with a doth wrapt round his neck, or with his leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his groin, all which were frightful to the last degree, but the week before. But now the street was full of them, and these poor recovering creatures, give them their due, appeared very sensible of their unexpected deliverance; and I should wrong them very much if I should not acknowledge that I believe many of them were really thankful. But I must own that, for the generality of the people, it might too justly be said of them as was said of the children of Israel after their being delivered from the host of Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea, and looked back and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in the water: viz., that they sang His praise, but they soon forgot His works.I can go no farther here. I should be counted censorious, and perhaps unjust, if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting, whatever cause there was for it, upon the unthankfulness and return of all manner of wickedness among us, which I was so much an eye-witness of myself. I shall conclude the account of this calamitous year therefore with a coarse but sincere stanza of my own, which I placed at the end of my ordinary memorandums the same year they were written:-A dreadful plague in London wasIn the year sixty-five,Which swept an hundred thousand soulsAway; yet I alive!\\""},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"This first-person narrative provides a very scary look at London, waiting for the plague in 1865-66. Although not a participant in the actual event, Defoe presents newspaper and personal knowledge to portray the everyday lives of Londoners in this terrifying time. Telling of the exodus of the rich and the desperation of the poor who could not afford to leave, Defoe gives us a bit of a look into what it might have been like to live at this time and into what a force religion played in attitudes."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Fiction it might be, though apparently based on the diaries of his uncle Henry Foe (the H.F. who purportedly authors the account) Daniel Defoes \\"Journal of the Plague Year\\" is a fascinating account of the Bubonic plague that struck London in the year 1665.While essentially a work of fiction, the level of detail, the statistics, anecodotes and endless conjecturing give the work a strong semblance of veracity. The reader is compelled to read on through the terrifying details of a plague that in all probability took around 100,000 lives during the year that it raged. One of the interesting features of the book is the conflict between science and religion, is a continuous thread throughout. Defoes author H.F. writes in a profoundly religous tone, early on in the book a group of mocking aetheists who coarsely drink and curse their way through the plague are, each and everyone, struck down and deposited in the communal grave before two pages are out. At the same time there is a recognition of scientific attempts to understand and control the plague, the shutting up of houses is much discussed as well as the variety of \\"preventatives\\" that offer protection from infection. Much of the book is given over to a variety of speculations, and given the state of medical science at the time of writing a good many of the conjectures verge on the amusing. The author even tells of one theory, of small organisms in the blood, only to scoff at it while the modern reader may sense as good a description of bacteria as that age could furnish.A good deal of the facts are horrifying, whole families dying, the nightly horse and cart patrols to collect the dead for communal graves, people maddened by the infection running through the streets unhindered, the dying screams of those shut up in their homes to die. It is a puzzle at first where they find men to collect the dead and women to nurse the sick until later in the book the author contemplates the plight of the poor. It simply seems that if they did not take these jobs they would have starved to death as all other industry and employment had ground to a halt, the risk of dying of the plague seemed a better bet than the certainty of dying of starvation.Definitely an interesting book though some may find the grotesque grammer and lengthy sentences a little too much. The edition I purchased was from Dover classics and consisted of just the journal itself and I felt my ability to get the most from the book was undermined by not having the additional context that a good set of footnotes and introduction should provide."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"1.Defoe is fascinating biography subject:Ian Watt remarked that Defoe \\"was a hard man who led a hard life: raised as a Dissenter in the London of the Great Plague and Great Fire; enduring Newgate prison and the pillory in bankrupt middle age; working as a secret agent and a scandalous journalist until imprisoned again for debt and treason.

He was, after all, only five or six years old when it occured. But the narrative is utterly absorbing. Written by one of the greatest novelists of all time (he was Joyce's favorite English novelist), the narrative is vivid, moving, and sometimes hilarious. It is also remarkably contemporary. You meet quacks and prophets disturbingly similar to the no-nothings who dominate our own time. The descriptions of behavior, disease, fear, and denial are as fresh today, and as relevant, as they were when Defoe wrote the Journal. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Nowadays virtually nobody is very well conversent about the plague. After the grim glow of Bocaccio's introduction to his Decamerone (1348), Daniel Defoe gives us a total view of the devastating disaster of London (1665). A lesson of humility for every medical doctor and his patients"},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Daniel Defoe was born in 1660 at St Giles, Cripplegate (London). The plague struck London with an incredible fury in 1665. In 1722, Defoe published this historical-fiction, first-person account of that year (1665).The book is an incredible narrative of the anguish and grief suffered by the citizens of London both due to the plague and the government reaction to it. With the best intentions, the Lord Mayor of London declared that all infected persons (and families) be shut up in their houses, guarded by watchmen. This isolation led to incredible despair and lamentation that made a gloomy situation even gloomier. Defoe questions the effectiveness of the method for several reasons, the top two being: this led individuals and families to do their best to hide the plague, therefore shunning necessary medical treatment; and, by the time most could be \\"diagnosed\\" with the plague and shut up, it was too late, they had already been in contact with so many people about town that the shutting-in did little to mitigate or slow the spread of the contagion.Defoe does a wonderful job of describing how bleak the situation was, how many \\"conjurers\\" tried to exploit the poor with false medicines and talismans, how many mass graves were dug, and how many were starved when they fled London due to not being allowed admittance to other towns along the King's Highway.Unfortunately, the book is sheer drudgery to finish. While many phrases are incredibly moving and poetic (we draw in death when we breathe; grown stupid with insupportable sorrow), the entire account is very slow and tiresome. However, I believe I owe a tip of the cap to Defoe for this style. After all, it was Defoe who three years earlier had penned what is regarded by some (I have not yet read it) as the prototypical action-adventure book, Robinson Crusoe. I cannot imagine that Robinson Crusoe is a sluggish read and, therefore, I have to imagine that the style employed by Defoe in A Journal is a literary device to make the reader suffer along with the narrator. If so, touche!The one big issue I do take with Defoe, though, is that as a five-year old living through the plague, his writing about that year must have been based almost purely on his research into the plague (in whatever manner that research took place). Therefore, everything that Defoe writes can be considered as hearsay (as it can be most purely and non-negatively defined). Yet, throughout this \\"first-person-account\\" Defoe makes statements akin to the following:The last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some accounts which others have published since that shall be seen, wherein they say that the dead lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly false; at least, if it had been anywhere so, it must have been in houses where the living were gone from the dead (having found means, as I have observed, to escape) and where no notice was given to the officers. All which amounts to nothing at all in the case in hand; for this I am positive in, having myself been employed a little in the direction of that part of the parish in which I lived...But...Defoe was not actually employed...so, is he actually positive about this?Finally, for interest with regard to history, I would like to leave the reader with the following, and keep in mind 1756, Jeffrey Amherst, and smallpox:They were as much afraid of our goods as they were of our people; and indeed they had reason: for our woollen [sic] manufactures are as retentive of infection as human bodies, and if packed by persons infected, would receive the infection and be as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was infected...Oh, did I mention that Daniel Defoe served as a secret agent for William III between 1697 and 1701. Hmm...For more book reviews and suggestions, please visit: http://www.theunemploymentbenefits.com"},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"In this documentary novel, Defoe sketches poignantly the irrational behaviour of man under extreme circumstances, when death threatens behind every corner of the street.People turned to fortune-tellers, astrologers or conjurers who deluded them. They became the victims of \`doctors' selling \`infallible preventive pills'. They \`swarmed to a wicked generation of pretenders to magic and black art'.People were terrified by the force of their imagination and saw representations and appearances in clouds. Their impudence increased by using devilish blasphemous language.Others risked their lives by stealing and plundering without any regard to the danger of infection.Man behaved as a mad dog.The Government encouraged devotion, public prayers, fasting and humiliation to implore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgment. \`Many a penitent confession was made of crimes long concealed.'Innumerable religious sects and divisions fought for the souls of the condemned. It was \`altar against altar'. The discourses of the religious ministers were full of terror, prophesying evil tidings.Unfortunately, religion was not the solution: \`the best physic against the plague was to run away from it.' People who believed in predestination (\`tis the hand of God, there is no withstanding it') and stayed home, were infected too and died by thousands.For Swift \`there was no apparent extraordinary occasion for supernatural operation, it was really propagated by natural means.'The near view of death reconciled men of good principles one to another.But as the terror of infection abated, things all returned again to the course they were in before.More, after the plague, \`people, hardened by the danger they had been in, were more wicked and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities.'In this impressive panorama, worth a Breughel or a Hieronymus Bosch, the only weakness is the lack of some kind of plot.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"If you want to know about the Plague, Defoe's slightly fictionalized &#34;Journal&#34; is the way to go.

It is not Defore's real work, but a compilation of journals of various people and their experience during the second major London plague.The wbook can be considered as a textbook even today. The information on attempts on control the progress of the disease, the medical understanding on how it was transmitted and the progress in an individual can be a basis for understanding plague and like infectious diseases today.What I found riveting is the desperation at different levels of society. The poorest people were forced to carry the dead to burial in order to earn money for food thus exposing themselves to higher levels of contagion. Then there were the people who were shut up after finding that a member or two had the disease. The attempts and successes to get free and escape (or not) are described. Then too there are sections on religion and the attitude toward ministers and priests who elected to stay and pray with people and those that fled.Finally the reporting of the disease and the probable underreporting. All of this would be played out even today with a highly infectious disease especially in poor countries. The only advantages we have now is the ability to identify the virus and start a process to create a cure. However the spread of bad information and quack cures is very similar to what existed (or worse) because of the internet and the social process of passing on misinformation.I gave the book a four and considered a three rating for the following reasons:1) It is very hard to read. It has not been \\"translated\\" to modern English and the sentences are stilted and some of the words are very out-of-date or have changed meaning.2) It is repetitious because of the compiling of the journals into one. For example the lists of ill people (\\"bills\\" as they were called) are cited several times over and are very confusing. The point that they were not reliable was repeated several times.3) The progress of the disease from one place to another and from one month to another is confusing. A map and an organized timetable along with the journals would have greatly improved the work.I found myself skipping over many paragraphs because of the wording.In spite of this, if you are interested in plagues and the spread of major diseases from a social or psychological point of view, it is worth ploughing through to get a feeling of the horror of the numbers, the transmission of the disease and the reactions to the threat from both a community and personal point of view."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Loved this book when i read it 46 years ago,still found it a great american novel,things were different then,treasure island."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"A pretty good account of the plague and example of Defoe's journalism.

Writing this in 1722, Defoe casts himself into the role of his uncle whom he calls H.F. and who recounts the events in grisly detail but with magnanimous compassion. Aside from the prose, the book has a surprisingly modern edge in the way it combines facts about a sensationally dire historical event with \\"human interest\\" stories for personal appeal. It seems so factual that at times it's easy to forget that it's just a fictitious account of a real event.The plague (H.F. writes) arrives by way of carriers from the European mainland and spreads quickly through the unsanitary, crowded city despite official preventive measures; the symptoms being black bruises, or \\"tokens,\\" on the victims' bodies, resulting in fever, delirium, and usually death in a matter of days. The public effects of the plague are readily imaginable: dead-carts, mass burial pits, the stench of corpses not yet collected, enforced quarantines, efforts to escape to the countryside, paranoia and superstitions, quacks selling fake cures, etc. Through all these observations, H.F. remains a calm voice of reason in a city overtaken by panic and bedlam. By the time the plague has passed, purged partly by its own self-limiting behavior and partly by the Great Fire of the following year, the (notoriously inaccurate) Bills of Mortality indicate the total death toll to be about 68,000, but the actual number is probably more like 100,000 -- about a fifth of London's population.Like Defoe's famous survivalist sketch \\"Robinson Crusoe,\\" the book's palpable moralism is adequately camouflaged by the conviction of its narrative and the humanity of its narrator, a man who, like Crusoe, trusts God's providence to lead him through the hardships, come what may. What I like about this \\"Journal\\" is that its theme is more relevant than its narrow, dated subject matter suggests: levelheadedness in the face of catastrophe and the emergence of a stronger and wiser society."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"The Penguin edition restores Defoe's original punctuation, with capitals for nouns and colons for stops, so that the writing has the vitality, weight and elasticity that Defoe meant when he wrote it.To enjoy this book you need to read it as creative journalism rather than fiction otherwise it will seem dull, and Daniel Defoe is never dull. It can't satisfy as fiction because it isn't fiction. It doesn't have any of the benefits of fiction such as plot, author's whimsy, or character development. The Journal is based on the eyewitness experience of his uncle Henry Foe, which has been expanded by Defoe's own journalistic research after the event. He has simply taken the eyewitness experience of his uncle and created a masterpiece out of it for posterity.This technique began with his first book, The Storm, except that in that book the eyewitness accounts - perhaps spruced up by Defoe himself - and his own work were separated. In the Journal of the Plague Year these are blended together so that his book has the vividness of the eyewitness view of the events as well as all the talent and research that history would wish of an account of these events.By misclassifying the book as fiction (and by modernizing the punctuation) we have been degrading the book's value to history and to readers.I wish the typeface was bigger and printed blacker and this applies to the Modern Library edition too, as does the above review."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Defoe has pulled off something brilliant here. Although he was only 5 years old in 1665 (the year of the title), in 1720 he set down a narrative full of rich details blending fact and imagination. The thoroughness of his descriptions and the constant realism come close to convincing you that these are first-hand observations: but these are *not* first hand observations; his narrator is a fiction, recalling events he saw as an adult.The persuasiveness of Defoe's fiction comes from his specificity, and little comments suggesting the narrator has an additional life outside the Journal. He mentions not only the dead (and the increasing losses), but the quacks taking advantage of the gullible, the quarantining of infected houses, the marks on the doors, the efforts to escape from quarantined houses, the efforts of the mayor's offfice to limit the spread of infection, and the public pits where the bodies were thrown. And so on into the facets of everyday life. Through it all, his portrayal of the narrator also has a personal richness, a consistent first-person perspective; the conceit is reinforced by insertions such as &quot;what I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for private use, and desire it may not be made public on any account whatever.&quot; The narrator is a product of Defoe's imagination, of course, and similarly, any private meditations such a narrator would have. But Defoe has cleverly made the narrator real."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Daniel Defoe put a lot of research into his 'Journal of the Plague Year,' yet it doesn't read like a history report. Rather, this is a novel so realistic you can quite literally feel what it must have been like to have lived in London at the time of the plague. The facts as he knew them, both from reading and interviews with those who lived through it, are revealed to us throughout the narrative. You get every detail of the plague, from the symptoms to the hysteria to the steps the government took to help insure the safety of the people. 'Journal of the Plague Year' is a fascinating and imminently readable book."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"What I like best about DeFoe is that he is very readable and can hold your attention for hours. Sure, he can contradict himself at times and he does have a flair for repetition and while he is not above pointing out the obvious, DeFoe is extremely interesting. &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; contains all the things DeFoe is noted for including a sharp eye for detail and sly humour. I liked this book and recommend it mainly because much of what DeFoe observed about human nature in the early 18th century is still relevant today."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year is an interesting volume that blends fact and fiction quite indiscriminately, as the author intended. It is easy to forget it is fiction as it reads as fact (and it seems likely there are enough actual facts strewn throughout as to enhance this perception). Defoe was less concerned about these issues concerning fiction and non-fiction than modern readers and writers and it is fascinating to see an example of the early beginnings of novel writing. The style could frustate some readers (there is virtually no attempt at characters and only small strands of a narrative per se) but the descriptions of a town in crisis were both gripping and fascinating. An unique volume."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"This fictionalised journal (written decades after the event when Defoe was only 5 years old) argues its case better by a bald statement of facts, than by any elaborate literary devices. This reads like it is meant to be, a journal, bringing home the horrors of that awful time in a way that a second-hand description could never do.Having said that, this account IS second-hand; it is only Defoe's journalistic expertise, boyhood memories and down-to-earth style that make it so believable.BUT - anyone who reads this should not expect another Gulliver's Travels - it IS heavy going; it's not a book that one can curl up with & relax, you have to work for your entertainment.The main point that comes across is the constant religious undercurrent, which was, I guess, typical of the time (if not of Defoe) and the willingness to attach blame for anything unusual to outsiders, or God's will, rather than examine their own circumstances (so what's changed in 339 years!?). As one of the few records of that terrible year, this deserves a place on any amateur historian's bookshelf."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"This is one man's (fictional) account of the infamous Black Plague that came close to massacaring the entire population of London in 1665. Monthly reports were issued indicating the epidemic steadily increasing until close to 100,000 lives were eventually taken. Fear and desparation became rampant in London. Its Lord Mayor responded to the rapidly spreading infection by locking up everybody in their homes. Despite the posting of watchmen to prevent anyone from evading the strict quarantine, a number of people some how managed to escape.A common scene in London were carts towing away the dead; bodies piled up on top of one another were then dropped into multiple make shift graves. Someone who felt well one moment would often die the next. There was no way to predict who would die next. Whole families and a servant or two would die within a short time of each other.Commerce came virtually to a stand still as people became fearful of catching the plague from goods being sold. Eventually the horrible plague abated; people who abandoned their homes for rural areas started moving back to London. Life was getting back to normal again.What was particularly interesting about the book was Daniel Defoe's decision not to choose characters with whom the reader could directly identify with. No one in the account had a name. Nevertheless, this did not prevent me from feeling the intense sufferings of the victims nor the intense joy of the eventual survivors."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Thanks to 20th century medical and public health advances, we now know how to prevent, stem, and treat most infectious diseases. Though a few folks may still recall the flu epidemic of 1918, which cost 20 millions lives worldwide and a half million in the United States alone, for most of us living outside the Third World, fear of epidemic has become largely a thing of the past.But if you wish to glimpse daily life under the threat of impending death by disease (without actually being threatened by it), along with the accompanying grief, despair, depravity, kindness, and courage, Daniel Defoe's \\"A Journal of the Plague Year\\" can take you there.However, Defoe\`s classic work is neither a journal nor of the plague year. Rather, it consists of an odd and hardly chronological collection of anecdotes, statistics, and ruminations written by the author of Moll Flanders some fifty years after the Plague of 1665 (when he was but a child of four). While pretending to be a first person eyewitness account of the epidemic, the Journal is in fact convincingly realistic fiction. The author has wisely created a narrator and a literary vehicle that powerfully portrays 17th century London and the agonies of an epidemic that killed more than 100,000 in the city.Early on, Defoe establishes credibility for his fictional construct by quoting detailed figures (seemingly culled from official documents) on the growing death tolls as the Black Death spread across London. Further, throughout the book he documents the legal measures, such as quarantining households, and describes the medical endeavors to fight the disease and its spread. But more important, having once persuaded the reader of the authenticity of his tale, Defoe gets under the skin of the plague by showing the human suffering and drama it created.He accomplishes this through his fictional narrator, a bachelor merchant who saunters about London hearing cries of pain, listening to tales of death, observing grief-deranged survivors roaming the streets, and even visiting the mass graves where, under the cover of night, death carts dump their grisly loads.Also, we are privy to the deliberations of our moralistic but pragmatic narrator--on whether or not to flee London with his brother's family, on predestination and free will, on the quackery and skullduggery that fed on fear and ignorance. This imaginative character's active, intelligent, and detailed surveillance of the epidemic places us in the streets of London and creates a work of lasting vitality.Through him we see the people's susceptibility to omens, religious superstition, prophets of doom, and astrologers; to quacks, charlatans, and fortune-tellers. We glimpse the duplicity and cowardice of the government and ruling class, who frequently fled London to save their own skins while abandoning their servants to penury and possible infection. We view mountebanks fleecing desperate families, nurses murdering and robbing their lingering patients, and the sick taking their own lives to save themselves a last few hours of pain. But we also are shown acts of great kindness, courage, charity, and love, as well as human ingenuity in service of a will to survive in the face of seeming doom.Ultimately, the book is perhaps not so much about the plague as about human nature, of which Defoe is a keen observer, showing us that 17th century Londoners are not much different from ourselves. .But as gloomy as this subject matter may seem, he can present it with a light and often-humorous touch, as in his story of the drunken piper. The beggar had passed out on the street after given an uncustomarily large amount to drink. A second man, thinking the piper a corpse, laid a plague victim beside him for the death cart to retrieve. The piper did not revive until about to pushed into a mass grave. He called out, \\"Where am I?\\" The sexton replied, \\"Why you are in the dead-cart, and we are going to bury you.\\" The piper then asked, \\"But I ain't dead though, am I?\\"Defoe presents the enigmatic narrator as both deeply affected by the suffering and aloof. He roams about London and its environs with seemingly little concern for his own well-being, at times viewing the horrific scenes with passion and compassion, and at other moments from a distant, Archimedean point of intellectual detachment. Along the way we get the narrator's (and, we suspect, the author's) views on religion, criminal justice, public health measures, medicine, government, and economics.The pragmatism of Defoe's narrator shows through in his discussion of the last. Virtually all commerce came to a halt in the months when the plague ruled. Ships did not dock, shops closed, construction stopped, and economic life was put on hold while death profited. Defoe shows us the repercussions of this economic death--not only the hardship, the admirable efforts of certain government officials to help the needy, and the charity of many--but also how it helped stem the spread of the disease by reducing contact among people.In the end, it's Defoe's details that win out, making this fictional account read as the intimate first-person portrayal it purports to be: the 200,000 pet dogs and cats rounded up and slaughtered to help prevent the epidemic's spread; the infection and quick death of infants who fed at the breasts of their diseased mothers; the public whippings of those who stole from the dead; the excruciating pain of the swellings brought on by the bubonic plague and the perhaps even more painful attempts by physicians to break the tumors with hot irons. Such details as these, perhaps too realistically rendered for the squeamish, give \\"A Journal of the Plague Year\\" an irresistible authority.However, the whole conceit might have fallen flat had it not been crafted with such a deft, and I think, sly, touch. Defoe's language never flies toward hyperbole, but is grounded in seemingly careful observation--even when the narrator is deeply moved. Defoe's slyness is evident in his narrator often claiming faulty memory or lack of knowledge--\\"whether he lived or died I don't remember\\"--which augments the verisimilitude of his highly creative and still haunting work."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"I have long wanted to read this classic account of the Black Death in London. Couldn't believe all the typos, which a notice at the beginning attributes to OCR--the pages are scanned rather than typed. The publisher's excuse is they need to keep costs down. Like they couldn't find a graduate student in English or History who wanted to pick up a bit of money proofreading? I would rather pay more for a properly edited book."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"This story of the the effects of the Plague in London in 1665 should be required reading for all people of all civilized countries. Although it is fiction, he relied so heavily on documented history that his story stands up very well against modern day documentaries. It is also a gripping and easy to read book. How the Plague started, how its spread was covered up initially and why, how the government was forced to respond, what happened to the economy and the outlying regions - these things could happen any day in any year in any country.SARS broke out just after I finished the book and I was hooked watching it spread. Everything he said started happening from the house quarantines to its effect on the Chinese economy. Having DeFoe's book on my mind when all this was happening - and while we still didn't know what was causing SARS - had me glued to the CDC web site (it had come through the US and hit Canada and I live near a big international airport). This is a very real warning and will not lose its timeliness as long as people build cities and economies. He is not just describing what happened but giving us warning and ideas for how it can be handled better."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Since Daniel Defoe was only four years old in 1664, A Journal of the Plague Year is a novel rather than a journal. It was written as a pamphlet to warn people of what to expect and how best to defend themselves should another plague strike. What makes any book written in the distant past interesting is the glimpse it affords into the mentality of the people of the time. This was the plague that caused Isaac Newton leave London for the country, where he purportedly started the work that led to the invention of calculus and the laws of gravity. We can see the struggle between clear thinking and self-destructive superstition in the thoughts of Defoe's character.On the one hand he insists the plague is doubtless \\"stroke from Heaven, a messenger of His vengeance, and a loud call to repentance,\\" but in the next paragraph he understands that the plague arises from natural causes, propagated by natural means.\\" So he concludes that God is using natural causes to exact his vengeance, even though he also says he must be allowed to believe than all who got sick received it in the ordinary way of infection. So he speaks disparagingly of fatalistic Christians, and especially Moslems, who ignore simple safety precautions because they are convinced that only those whom God wishes to will get the plague. Though convinced that the plague is God's way of punishing the wicked, he acknowledges that it strikes the good and wicked alike, and the wicked were just as likely to survive as the good. When the plague finally ends, he is convinced that nothing but God could have ended it - not even the worst of people could have doubted this. He seems surprised by man's unthankfulness and the return of all manner of wickedness soon after the plague. Presumably, the average people of the time really felt that they deserved to die arbitrarily of an awful disease, and after living with the horror of seeing friends and family die agonizing deaths, that they should feel thankful that God had not done the same to them. Thankfully, science has put an end to this kind of superstition. True, some people still cling to this ugly notion of God, but while we can respect Defoe as an unusually intelligent man of his time, any writer with such ideas today would be happily dismissed as a crank.(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA BATTLES THE BEELZEBUBIAN BEASTS OF THE BIBLE)"},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Defoe, Daniel, A Journal of the Plague Year. 1722. Penguin Books, 1966.Now that we're all reading up on bird flu, the flu pandemic of 1918, and even the Black Plague, it seems appropriate to revisit Daniel Defoe's account of the London outbreak of 1665. The author cleverly spins a fictional world based on the real one which struck England when he was only five. Using real statistics and first or second hand accounts, he brings the reader full into that world with its constant terror, its bell-ringing nightly dead carts, the screams of the dying and their families, all of which teaches us something about the fragility of society as we know it. During the pestilence and for months afterward all foreign trade was stopped between Britain and other countries; shops were shut, factories closed, and the wretchedness of the poor, which was only partially relieved by charity--primarily private--increased immeasurably. Aside from total isolation, which was virtually impossible in a mercantile economy, there were only a few ways to avoid the sickness. One mentioned by Defoe was by a woman who doused herself from head to toe with vinegar. I used this method myself in Acapulco in 1951, to avoid being bitten by sand fleas, and it works.Defoe's narrator says that he fell ill for a few days before the pestilence reached its peak, but quickly recovered. He obviously gained immunity through this mild exposure. Samuel Pepys kept a diary during the 1660s, and casually mentions in one passage that he poured gin into his bathwater for its cooling effect. The gin, of course, killed any fleas that might have been around and Pepys survived unharmed and unaware of what had saved him from death.Vinegar and gin will not save us from the flu pandemic that is threatened. Face masks and strictly enforced quarantine (disapproved of by Defoe) seem to be the answer, as inoculation will not likely be timely or sufficiently available. Defoe's tale shakes the reader's confidence in government's ability to help its people in a crisis; if it cannot figure out what to do in a hurricane, what will happen when disaster strikes the entire country?Five stars."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

He tells of the shutting up and guarding of houses where anyone infected resides, imprisoning the entire household because of the illness of one; of the anger and despair of those shut-in, and of the strategies used to trick the watchmen and sometimes escape. He tells of the dead-carts and the great pits where the dead were thrown and buried. He meets a man whose wife and children are shut-in but he is not, and how he provides for them. He relates a story he was told of a group of uninfected people who fled the city and the difficulties they had with the distrust of others. He discusses the numbers dead, the sweep of the pestilence and the effects of it on England's trade with other countries.Note: There isn't any actual plot, in the sense of a character contending against difficulties and reaching some sort of resolution. The narrator is merely an observer, to whom nothing significant happens. The text has no chapter breaks or section breaks. The narrative rambles, is repetitive, and is only loosely structured. It is a fictional account of an actual event. Defoe was five years old in 1665.The book from which I read this novel is not the one under which this review is placed. The book I have is a volume in the Library of Essential Writers (not listed on amazon) and contains five of Defoe's novels. There is only a short biographical introduction, and nothing concerning the content of the novels, so I don't know whether Defoe's account of the plague is accurate in the details of its spread, the degree of its contagion, the measure of law enforced, the behavior of those infected, the caution and fright, or of anything else that would be discussed in a scholarly introduction to the novel."},{"Title":"A Journal Of The Plague Year","review":"I generally enjoy older books but this was very boring.

Thus, those who are looking for a how-to book will be dissatisfied, and those who are looking for an academic book will be dissatisfied.

Of these, I will say unhesitatingly that the last book has caught my attention the most, even though it has been roundly criticized by some people for a complicated plot and for various other things.Why do I recommend this book despite its flaws? Because of the love story of Sauscony and Jaibriol (and I wish there had been more of it!), and because of the attempt, however flawed, to combine various narratives into one grand overarching story of a family and couple's story set against grand interstellar intrigue and warfare.For those who come new to this series, the Skolians are descendants of people moved mysteriously off Earth at some earlier period, but moved across time and space. They come from different parts of Earth, and the resultant civilization they develop (their captors disappear, leaving them behind) draws from different Earth civilizations but is technologically far more advanced. At some point, this space civilization splits into two civilizations - the Skolians who depend on telepathy and empathy to control an interstellar and interplanetary form of communcation called the Web, and the Eubian Concord, led by the Aristos (short for Aristocrats) who use telepaths and empaths rather sadistically. These two civilizations are at war, with the Aristo aim being to destroy the leaders of the Skolians - a hereditary family, led by the Ruby Pharaoh. In this context, Earth discovers space travel and forms the Allied Worlds, only to discover that there are these two contending human civilizations before them.THE RADIANT SEAS is thus a story not only of a couple who are in love and who are trying to build a life together against tremendous odds, or of a ruling family trying to survive (in which each member has different traumas to overcome, and the expectations of their people to fulfill), but also a story of high politics - a tripolar (three-power) conflict in which each civilization believes that only one can emerge victorious. Most of the conflict, and it is bitter conflict, is between the Aristos (called the Traders) and the Skolians.The story is told in bits and parts, shifting from the personal experiences of the hero and heroine (and their relatives), to high politics - and showing where personal wishes interact with and sometimes conflict with high politics. If you enjoy reading this kind of a saga, you will enjoy THE RADIANT SEAS.If you find a fractured narrative, focusing on many many characters, hard to follow, you will definitely not like this novel. The list of characters at the start focuses on only some of the characters, and not all the important secondary characters at that.Some warnings should be issued however:1) There is a considerable age difference between the hero and heroine (and the opposite of what we see in QUANTUM ROSE). I find this typical of Asaro, and perhaps unavoidable given the longevity of her major characters. Some readers, especially the more conventional kind, may find this uncomfortable.2) Some of the technological (or SF) terms used are not well-explained. I would have loved to see a glossary of these terms such as IR at the back, for those of us not familiar with hard science. As someone with little science background, I found the photograph of the Klein bottle useful, even though I could not quite understand how an entire fleet could fit into one. An explanation similar to that offered at the end of THE QUANTUM ROSE would be useful.3) There are many many secondary characters in this book, of whom only a fraction are listed in the list of characters. Some people might find this book hard to follow not just because of this, but because they pop up in unexpected places (and yes, there are references to characters appearing in the other books). By the way, if you want to understand who is related to whom, you would be well advised to take a look at the back of QUANTUM ROSE which outlines the main imperial line.4) And yes, there is a lot of description of sex and torture on the part of the Aristos, although I personally found the sex more dominant in THE LAST HAWK, ASCENDANT SUN, and even THE QUANTUM ROSE. I don't feel...that the sex descriptions was necessarily gratuitous, although I could have wished to have seen less of it. I found it interesting that Asaro chose to describe what the Aristos did sexually to a slave Cirrus, rather than to one of the major characters, Althor. The torture scenes, as far as Althor was concerned, were important, even if unpleasant reading. Without that, we as readers would have little idea of what happens to a Rhon who falls into Aristo hands. Fortunately for my squeamish self, Asaro does not include details of what happened to other Rhons who are similarly unfortunate.I think that this novel would appeal most to those who are able to follow the kind of story written by Leo Tolstoy (the War and Peace comparison is irresistible, in terms of the scope of the novel and the numerous characters with their own stories). It would not appeal to those who are used to the more typical Asaro plotline which focuses strongly on one hero (or heroine) and his or her life experiences.Despite all its flaws, and there are many, I give this book a four (although it actually rates at a 4.5). For one, it kept me up and reading until 3 am (something that really means something). For another, it made me determined to acquire the rest of Asaro's books, which is a second plus. For a third, I simply like this kind of narrative strategy."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"I have liked Asaro's combination of hard SF with a touch of romance. She doesn't let me down in her here. The tension and contrast of the two societies, sort of mirror images of one another, is well done. She also realizes the difficulty of politcal compromises and the problems involved. I can't wait for her next novel!"},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"I love Catherine Asaro's range--she can do everything from narrowly focused, character-based stories to a vast, complicated epic like The Radiant Seas, where she expertly weaves multiple story lines together, without losing track of the individuals involved. All this plus good science (though admittedly some of it is over my liberal arts head.) I'm thoroughly hooked on the Skolian Empire and look forward to the next entry in Asaro's series."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Buy this book. After reading a short biography of Dr. Asaro, I purchased Primary Inversion, Catch the Lightning, The Last Hawk, and Radiant Sun. I had hopes that she might be another five-star writer of hard science fiction (i.e., in the same league as Benford, Bear, Clark, and many others). She is: compared to her peers, she rates five stars. She writes like a very smart (and nice) person who, after years of gorging on books, movies, and television, now presents us with a collage of intelligent scenes and characters, avoiding using formulae from a writer's workshop. This book should appeal to mostly everyone. It will NOT appeal to the reader who is seeking a novel with an unoriginal, stupid, poorly-crafted plot and uninteresting, simple characters. Try Catch the Lightning while you're at it."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Action, responsibility, family, romance, and more. I read all kinds of SF and I loved this book. Who cares if its hard SF or if the science is real, after 10 minutes I was hooked. It is more a story about duty and obligation vs doing what is right, and by whose standards. The main characters have to make choices and I was totally engaged in their thinking process. I read Asaro's Catch the Lightning first, it is the weakest of the Skolian series but I was interested enough to read The Radiant Seas which is the most thrilling. I recommend that you start with it and then go back to Primary Inversion which is more insightful. The Last Hawk was just okay, however, I anxiously await Asaro's next entry which I hope will pull all the family together. Asaro is a nice break from some of the more plodding, linguistic challenges &quot;serious&quot; SF writers sometimes feel the need to present."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"The Radiant Seas is the fourth installment in the Saga of the Skolian Empire and it takes off right with a bang where Primary Inversion left off.Soz and Jaibriol II are on Prism-the planet they live on in exile from both of their respective, warring Empires. The novel breaks its time focusing on Jaibriol and Soz on Prism, Ur Qox-Jaibriol's father-the Emporer of Eube, and Soz's family on Skolia.Soz and Jaibriol get to know each other, forge a relationship, build a house and start a family on Prism-which is what they eventually name the planet of their exile. They have both escaped their familial duties and never ending war by faking their deaths at the end of Primary Inversion. Their first born son-Jaibriol III (Jai) is followed by RocaLisa, Vitar and Kelric. They live an idyllic empathic-centered family filled with love, tenderness and support. Jai is about 16 when things change drastically over night. He has always realized that one day he will have to leave Prism, but he naively thinks he will find some wonderful woman, marry her and bring her back to live with his empathic family in total bliss. Sadly, as his mother is pregnant for the 5th time, his father is suddenly stolen by Eube who has managed to locate his father-now the Eubian Emporer-on Prism. Jai and his surviving siblings are taken to Earth where they are fostered by Seth Rockworth-the ex-husband of the Ruby Pharaoh, Dehya. As his father-Jaibriol II-assumes the Eubian throne as Emporer-under duress. His mother-Soz- returns to Skolia and assumes the role of Imperator left vacant by the death of her brother Kurj-who also killed Ur Qox-and the capture of her brother Althor by the Skolians.As Jaibriol and Soz are setting up house-keeping on Prism, Kurj is taking stock and evaluating his life. He begins to see and express-in a very limited way-how his pursuit of the Eubians at all costs, as well as his early childhood trauma-involving the death of his \\"father\\" and the abuse of his mother at the hands of his step-father as well as the revelation that his beloved grandfather was actually his genetic father- have served to shape him into a less than ideal person. He marries his true love, fathers a child on her, apologizes to his mother and then is capptured by the Eubian Emporer Qox. Kurj manages to kill himself and destroy his ship with the Eubian Emporer on it.Prior to Kurj's death, Althor-Soz's brother not Tina's husband from Catch The Lightening-finds some disturbing evidence that his sister Soz and Jaibriol II may not have died after all. He confronts his father and the truth of his sister's escape into exile with her Eubian husband is confirmed. Athor mourns for his sister and agrees to honor his father by keeping their secret. Then Althor is captured by the Eubians-they torture him for information which causes his brain to begin to erase all of the information it holds. It is harrowing to follow Althors decline, he eventually does not even know who he is-but before he slips that far he does give the information about Jaibriol II in exile on Prism.Meanwhile, Soz returns to Skolia, assumes her role as Imperator and is on a mission to rescue her husband, pick up her kids and return her family to the relative safety of their self-imposed exile on Prism. Soz has to hide the identity of her children and husband from her family-difficult to do in a family of empaths. Soz is ultimately who I enjoyed the most about this book. Her single-minded pursuit of her husband against staggering odds-all while not being able to share her turmoil with a single soul in her family-not even her own mother. I never doubted for one instant that Soz would rescue Jaibriol.This novel is fast-paced and enjoyable from begining to end. It is my favorite of the novels so far and is only passed or equaled by Moon Shadow's-the story of Jaibriol III's assumption of the Eubian Throne."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Of course someone with degrees in Chemical Physics is going to focus a good deal on the science in her fiction but sometimes the details can be distracting to those of us who don't have such degrees or a great love of heavy science. But Asaro's societies are still complex and well represented. There are actually three space-age societies: Skolian, Eubian, and Earth Allied. Only two of these, Skolian and Eubian, are dealt with in any great detail and they are almost polar opposites. Almost because both are really oliogarchies. Here the battle is between two races of &quot;improved&quot; humans -- one telepathic and one with almost no ability to feel at all. Allied Earth is somewhere in between and in fact, I get the feeling that Earth may be the big problem that hasn't reared its ugly head yet in the series."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Do not buy this book. After reading a short biography of Dr. Asaro, I purchased Primary Inversion, Catch the Lightning, The Last Hawk, and Radiant Seas. I had hoped that she might be another five-star writer of hard science fiction (i.e., in the same league as Benford, Bear, Clarke, and many others). She is not: compared to her betters, she only rates one star. She writes like a very smart fan who, after years of gorging on books, movies, and television, now presents us with a collage of her favorite scenes and characters, using formulae from a writer's workshop. This book should appeal mostly to lonely, powerless (perhaps abused) lost souls seeking to escape their painful lives with a few hours of adolescent narcissistic fantasy. It will NOT appeal to the reader who is seeking a novel with an original, intelligent, carefully-crafted plot and interesting, complex characters. Try Cryptonomicon, instead."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"This is the best book of the Skolians yet!

In this book, too many of the gorgeous characters (and everyone is simply gorgeous)tell each other what they already know. It's too scattered, too paint-by-numbers, right down to the bad, bold, beautiful Empress. At least we didn't have to see HER torture sessions or kinky sex. Nobody had any personality, not even Soz, who was so engaging in the first book. I hope Asaro's next is a linear tale, a form she does best."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"For fans of Catherine Asaro, THE RADIANT SEAS does not disappoint! In it is the continuing saga of the Skolian Empire. Although the blurb implies that much of the book is focused on Sauscony and Jaibriol, it's actually an epic of two empires struggling for power and the political intrigues involved.Asaro takes time to develop her characters and make them believable. She evokes the readers' emotions with introspective examinations of characters' decisions and actions, and the sacrifices that each of them makes. But she also keeps the action and plot moving along at a rapid pace. I literally could not put this book down and found myself wanting more when it ended. Fans of sci-fi, romance, and action novels will definitely want to read this once you finish with PRIMARY INVERSION."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"I would have thought this series would get better by book 3, but it just got worse.Imagine two inbred (literally inbred), moronic societies at war with each other for 400 years. Using idiotic technology, ignoring obvious avenues left and right, impossible from the logical, technological, and social perspective. They have a type of AI but no Von Neumann machines. A \\"psyberspace\\" (yes, it is exactly what it sounds like, and even more dumb than you think) but no understanding of computers or technology. Nanites but no nanite warfare. Extremely pathetic cyber technology. Hell, the main problem of the two civilizations could have been solved with either modern genetic engineering, or something that will be available within 50 years.I mean, couldn't the author have picked up Neuromancer before writing this book? Or at least watched Star Trek? The entire society described here makes absolutely no sense - an advanced technological society is impossible in a full slave system! Not to mention that this whole war could have been ended in a week with a set of weapons based on 1980's MIRV designs."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Sauscony Valdoria and Jaibriol Qox II, each the designated heir to their warring interstellar empires, had left the world they'd known behind to be together. The shocked world had witnessed their \\"deaths\\" and had grieved for them. Only a select few knew that they'd not died. Instead they had done the unthinkable, they had married aboard the ship that had carried them to sanctuary.Adapting to life on a deserted planet had not been easy, but love had gotten them through the worst of it. They had made a family, four beautiful children, who were the best of both of them. They were happy. Unfortunately Eden always comes seems to come with a serpent.Over the past fifteen years, the Eubians have not given up trying to gain access to the Skolweb, the one thing that gives their vastly outnumbered enemies, the Skolians, the edge in their war against them. The tide may be turning in their favor, as they've captured the new Skolian heir, Althor.When both Imperator Skolia and Emperor Qox are killed in battle, both sides are in need of leadership. Unfortunately the Eubians have discovered that Jaibriol still lives. They are determined to recover him and restore him to the throne. Though to the rest of the world the new Emperor appears to be in command, Jabriol is in truth and unwilling puppet, helpless to protect those he loves. His captors know the truth of his origins. He is vulnerable to torture.A new leader emerges among the Skolians as well. Having secreted the children safely on Earth, Soz will stop at nothing to get Jaibriol back.As with Ms. Asaro's other works, this story is rich in multi dimensional characters and unlikely heroes. We see Soz as a loving wife and mother as well as unstoppable warrior queen, and Jabriol as a man of courage, determined not to give his loved ones away no matter what he must suffer. We watch as Jabriol's \\"mother\\", is torn between unaccustomed emotion for a son and ingrained Highton doctrine. We empathize as one Skolian heir is broken, but still retains the essence of the man he has always been. We watch a child grow up overnight, to become a man who would have made his parents proud. In addition Ms. Asaro treats us to fascinating and believable technology, making this work the perfect blend of science fiction and romance. Bravo!--- Reviewed for PNR Reviews"},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"The Radiant Seas is not as incredible as its predecessor Primary Inversion, which I loved, but it was ok. For the most part, Asaro shows again that she is a skilled writer. It features fleshed out, interesting characters, an imaginative, well developed future universe with some interesting science/technology and a mostly smooth, pleasing writing style. So what's wrong with it? Well, the story is so big that a lot of things seem glossed over, for example the description of a space battle in the middle was cool but could have been better had it been explained with more depth. Also at the end a character we've barely met turns out to be the most important person in the book which I think mars the book's conclusion and makes it feel tacked on. And what is with the word \\"gentled\\"? As in, \\"his face/expression/voice etc gentled.\\" That was used literally dozens of times in the book and I found it mildly irritating after awhile. Still, overall the book was reasonably entertaining and I will checking out another of Asaro's books, probably The Last Hawk, at some point."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Good read--ties together several other books in the series if you have read them in random order."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Catherine Asaro's &quot;The Radiant Seas&quot; may be her finest work of fiction to date. It certainly kept me interested, and I read it in a single day. She does a splendid job in offering what may be some of the most realistic battles between opposing fleets of manned and unmanned interstellar warships. And those interested by romance may find most intriguing the saga between Sauscony and Jabriol, heirs to two rival interstellar empires founded by humans who left Earth mysteriously thousands of years ago. Yet I will caution readers that she leaves too many gaps in her fast-paced story, starting with her too terse description of &quot;psiberspace&quot; to the seemingly implausible acceptance of Jabriol as the new emperor of the Eubian Concord towards the end of the tale. Those who seek more eloquent tales from a literary perspective will certainly find other, perhaps more rewarding, accounts from the likes of Dan Simmons, Iain Banks and Gene Wolfe, yet they may agree with me that Asaro is certainly a writer worth reading."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Nothing beats a good Space Opera for me.

As a reader of perhaps a hundred books a year... Let me tell you that most blend into the huge &quot;Forgettable But Enjoyable&quot; category. This series does not. It combines fast-paced adventure, intrigue, science, tech, mind-power, human cultures, a bit of sex, romance and angst, and almost the proverbial kitchen sink, into a well-crafted tale that should satisfy even the most jaded tastes."},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"Must Read!The Radiant Seas begins where Primary Inversion left off--to the letter.

They watch the sun set, hand-in-hand, each hoping their lives together will work out now that they have chosen to strand themselves away from the machinations of their families who lead the Ruby Dynasty, the Skolian Imperialate and the Eubian Trade Empire.

(And, I absolutely LOVE novels by women writers!) I was hoping for a truly fine reading experience; unfortunately, although I did not hate this book, I came away feeling that I had wasted my time reading it.....while it is true that her novels are about relationships and romance, it is worth mentioning that the relationships are between truly screwed-up people (in whom I had NO interest). I found most of the relationships in this novel to be either sick or pathetically immature.Even so, I gave this novel three stars because the plot is somewhat interesting and moves well. ....Is this a novel about relationships? Sure, including relationships between torturers and tortured. I had absolutely no interest in reading about the relationship between the sadist and his victims, or the resulting emotional damage experienced by a victim of abuse. So, when you read that Ms. Asaro writes about relationships, realize that the sadomasochistic &#8220;relationship&#8221; is one of the them.Is this a novel about relationships? Sure, including a relationship between a grown up woman who is emotionally broken inside and a 19-year-old boy who is too inexperienced to know how screwed-up she is. In a Catherine Asaro novel there is typically some young, virginal, inexperienced character (who is alienated by those around him or her); and then there is the older, powerful (but broken), royal warrior who falls desperately in love with the young virgin. ....In this novel, Ms. Asaro SIGNIFICANTLY improved as a writer when she was writing about the main characters' lives during their exile. I imagine that she was drawing on her own relationship with her husband and child for this portion of the novel --- and she did a very good job. I only wish that she would write like that all the time.....I agree ...this book is little more than adolescent narcissistic fantasy.Ms. Asaro is a competent writer; but she is NOT an equal of five-star writers. Ms. Asaro has great potential. I would love to read a novel by her in which the characters are mature, real, and emotionally healthy. ........"},{"Title":"The Radiant Seas (Saga of the Skolian Empire)","review":"If you like sci-fi you'll love Catherine Asaro.

Sauscony and Jaibriol have married and are living in exile, by choice, with their children. From out of the blue Jaibriol is taken and compelled to be Highton Aristos ruler.

So in for a penny in for a pound am I. What the heck - I have them already anyways?I am glad I did give this a go in between NJO novels. It has a more old-school sci-fi feel with just a hint of what I might have once called the mushy stuff.Asaro still feels compelled to over-explain every minute details of tech that doesnt exist, but it seems to distract less from the story in this edition - or I just got used to it enough to semi-tune it out.I went into this wondering what it would be about - after the seeming desparity in characters from the 1st to the 2nd, but this tied it up well, and after getting through it, I amy very well give the ACTUAL #4 a go.

That kingdom Eube is ruled by anti-empaths who get pleasure torturing strong telepaths such as Soz and her husband. Jaibriol has lived his entire life hiding that fact from the anti-empaths.

To rescue Jaibriol, Soz must claim leadership of the Skolian Imperialate and become a warrior again. How she succeeds is the meat of the matter. When you read the book, you get the impression that it is a science fiction story featuring war between two rival interstellar empires. This is not a mistake. However what makes this book truly interesting is the human drama between Soz and Jaibriol; Soz and her brothers; Soz and her parents. I read the whole book in a single sitting.

Marrin describes in vivid detail the daily life of the Incas before the Spanish arrived. A warlike people, the Incas valued toughness, courage and obedience to authority. They were not strangers to capital punishment or torture. Like the Aztecs, they practiced ritual human sacrifice to appease the many gods they worshipped. Although their society was highly organized and technologically advanced, they were not prepared for warfare on European terms. When Pizarro arrived, he kidnapped their leader and held him for a ransom of silver and gold. Without their leader to give them instructions, the Incas were helpless to launch a rescue mission; they had been trained to obey orders, not to think for themselves. For many years the Incas made attempts to resist Spanish rule, but in the end, Spanish greed, weapons, cruelty and disease overtook them. A sorrowful yet valuable account of the Spanish impact on the New World."},{"Title":"Identification guide for ivory and ivory substitutes","review":"This identification guide was written by forensic scientists, for use by forensic scientists and wildlife enforcement officials.

Its former residents and their families remain 500 miles away. National Geographic staffers accompanied leaders of those displaced on a return visit.Fishing is now excellent, being unfished for many years and sheltered by the 17 vessels sunk during testing. The most severe contamination has been scraped up, and is sealed under a massive dome capped with 18\\" of concrete.Cesium 137 is the contaminant preventing their return; another 80-90 years are required before it decays to acceptable levels. The material is taken up into plants grown on the island. Some think applying fertilizer rich in potassium would prevent the problem and allow a return. Tests are occurring. Thyroid cancer and leukemia have been problems on nearby islands dusted with the fallout.\\"The War Within\\" tells of our immune system and its battles to protect us. Sometimes they mistake harmless invaders (eg. pollen) for deadly foes and mount an allergic reaction. Sometimes our own cells begin a proliferation of cancer and evade the immune system. Detailed explanations of the various types of immune system cells workings, and amazing electron microscope photos constitute most of the article material.\\"The Tea and Sugar Train\\" covers the lifeline in Australia's Outback through its 3.5 day, 1,050 mile route with about 50 cars.

The route includes the world's longest stretch of straight track - 310 miles.Most residents are railway workers. Outback railroad workers are generally misfits that wouldn't be hired by any other firm, and accepted by the railroad because nobody else would take the job. Antique electric fans provide the only cooling on the train. Every other week a bank van is attached, with a paymaster to distribute the payroll in cash, and to serve as a no-frills post office. The district engineer sends out three videotapes each week - TV reception is generally impossible.Almost every month a community-health team comes out, and each spring and fall the railway retail store sends a refitted lounge car with the latest clothes and appliances for sale. Most important are the retail \\"general store\\" car, and a freight car crammed with cases of beer.Other trains go right through the railroad camps. Two traveling community-service workers go out every two months, and a flying doctor conducts twice/month clinics."},{"Title":"Remnants Of The Night","review":"Somewhat unlike Morton's other books, this collection does not come up roses. At least, not all of the time. In \\"Love Changes Direction\\", Morton writes \\"I am not surprised at your leaving...for I never really caught you..and anyways, it is October..the time of the month when love changes direction...\\" This poem, like many others in this book, give his readers a look at the downside of love, the silent slope we travel by ourselves, through heartache, on our way to healing and redemption. In \\"Crumbcake and Coffee\\" (a longstanding favorite of mine, I've got it committed to memory, after one or two reads, you will too), Morton writes :\\" I'm way over here and you're way over there...If love is the game then they're not playing fair...\\" \\"Coffee\\" is a poem that speaks volumes (in only a page or two!) about the pain one feels when not with the one they love, the anxiety and slight pangs of anguish that come when two hearts are separated. In \\"Before You Go\\" (A poem I confess to reciting to more than a few lovers), Morton tells his love that he will \\"hold you close before you go...and pack the thoughts you ought to know...\\" In that poem, one hesistates as to what action to take:pulling out the tissues or pulling closer the one they care for.

It would be best kept for selective use in senior-level and graduate courses in solid-state physics where it would likely be an excellent text.

Bret states that Robert Stack won the oscar for Written on the Wind when in fact he lost to Anthony Quinn! How sloppy these mistakes are. In his plot description of The Mirror Crack'd he states that Elizabeth Taylor is playing Elizabeth the Great and Kim Novak Mary Queen of Scotts in the movie within the movie when in fact it is the other way around!If Mister Bret can't even get the most obvious facts straight so to speak how is one to take or trust all the gossip about the many loves and lovers of Rock? The book is readable and entertaining but disapointing due to so many mistakes. As was stated by a previous reviewer, this book is filled with many plot summaries of Hudson's films, love it or hate it, I for one like it in my film star bios but once again, sloppy and inconsistant. Bret goes into great depth about \\"Embryo\\",totally ignores \\"avalanche\\",and doesn't do \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" justice.David Bret has fifteen other biographies listed to his credit beware of this hack, I'm sure he has more on the way."},{"Title":"Rock Hudson His Story","review":"Balanced, straightforward biography of Hollywood's favorite leading man of the 1950's. The fact that he was both gay and promiscuous meant endless headaches for Hudson and his career managers during that most repressed of decades. The tension between big libido and big box-office underlay the actor's entire career, which author Bret tracks in pretty unsparing terms from early fan mags to coverup marriage to final tragic outing. The emerging portrait is generally favorable, particularly that of a generous on-screen professional, who at the same time could be a fickle and sometimes ungenerous lover off-screen. Names are named and there is a gossipy dimension for the curious. But the intimations remain pretty forthright without becoming catty or distasteful. Bret has handled this difficult but necessary aspect with understandable sensitivity. Still and all, he fails to clear up that murky veil drawn around Hudson's marriage to studio secretary Phyllis Gates, or the exact nature of his relationship with the controversial Marc Christian. So readers looking for resolution of these troubled phases of Hudson's personal life may be disappointed. My one real misgiving is with the plot synopses of Hudson's many films, big and small. Their inclusion in the text interrupts the flow and serves no discernable purpose other than padding the book's length (not that it needs padding). I found myself skipping entire pages as a result. Anyway, the biography comes across as an honest attempt to deal with the conflicted life of a movie legend, who, for better or worse, symbolizes an entire entertainment era."},{"Title":"Rock Hudson His Story","review":"I was hoping for a comprehensive biography of Rock Hudson. While it is an acceptable depiction of the actor's life, I was disappointed to see how the author padded with book with detailed information about the plots in Rock's movies. I don't need a rehash of movie plots; I wanted information on Rock himself, or if discussing his films, the backstory behind them. Anybody who is a fan of Rock already knows the story lines to his movies.The author does provide an interesting argument about how Rock contracted AIDS, believing it to be from blood transfusions when he had his open heart surgery, rather than from unprotected sex.If you want an overall general biography of Rock Hudson, this is a good choice, but not the ultimate Rock Hudson biography."},{"Title":"Rock Hudson His Story","review":"I've never had the pleasure of reviewing anything by David Bret before, but his new biography of the late film star Rock Hudson is one of the best biographies I've read in years. There are some figures for whom there can never be enough biographies to suit my taste, and I've read five or six or seven apiece on Kipling, Oscar Wilde, Hitchcock, Emily Dickinson, Custer and who knows how many more. To that list add the improbable name of Rock Hudson. Bret is a British journalist who seems remarkably free of Hollywood cant. He tells it like he sees it, and when he doesn't know something, he says so.Hudson was born Roy Scherer Jr in 1925, in Winnetka, and had what seems to be a difficult relationship with his family. Before long he had sort of drifted into acting, becoming the protege of the he-man director Raoul Walso, who directed him in several early pictures. Hudson also informed Walsh of his homosexuality, and the two of them apparently didn't think it would be much of a problem. Hudson did the Cary Grant-Randolph Scott thing at first, living openly with a lover or two on the fringes of Hollywood society, but as his parts and his fanbase grew bigger more censorious minds prevailed and Rock became a ladies man in the press, although hardly to his friends and intimates.As an actor Hudson was more of a star than anything else, but he was so great in all of his pictures that one hardly cares about his \\"skills.\\" After all, you don't pay money to see good acting, you buy your ticket to get close to your dreams. And Rock Hudson was the man of everyone's dreams, male or female, straight or gay, for a good ten years in a row, during which time he made several films for Douglas Sirk.Bret names names, and you will be startled, as I was, to find out exactly how many Hollywood leading men of the 1940s and 1950s were actually gay but hiding it. By the time the book was over my mind was reeling with all the names. On the set of AIR CADET, so Bret tells us, troubled leading lady Gail Russell was more troubled than usual when she found her new husband Guy Madison in bed with one of the cadets. The story of Hudson's \\"beard\\" romance with the equally troubled dacing star, Vera-Ellen, is a pathetic parable of Hollywood truths and illusions.Of course the charade eventually came to an end, first with Hudson's spectral illness which no one could identify, then with his accepting a romantic role on TV's DYNASTY which would require him to kiss Linda Evans, and then with his admission that he was gay and he had AIDS. Even after his death the glamor continued to evaporate as his onetime boyfriend, Marc Christian, sued the Hudson estate for concealing the fact that Hudson was seropositive. A parade of gross details followed on the stand, things that made one's heart sigh. I suppose in the end it doesn't matter. The pictures that he made will live forever and I predict that each year from now his stock as an actor will rise until the day comes when people will show him the respect they now give to, oh I don't know, that old fraud Spencer Tracy."},{"Title":"Rock Hudson His Story","review":"A friend recommended this author to me for his biography of Joan Crawdord.

All these made up English political society, not just for the great dukes and earls but also for the lesser peers and the gentry who formed the power base in the counties. The author thoroughly examines the English social structure, discussing what contemporaries meant when they talked of the nobility and analyzing in detail the territorial and familial policies of the great landholders. For instance, although William the Conqueror did not, as a matter of policy, dispossess the Anglo-Saxon nobility, that is, in fact, what had happened by the time of Domesday Book, twenty years later. By 1086, there were, at the top of society, about 170 great tenants-in-chief, men who held their land directly from the king, and enough of it to be described as barons. All but two of these men were Norman (or Breton, or Fleming). Among them, these 170 controlled about half the land of England. Another seventeen percent of the land was retained by William as his own demesne, and another quarter of the land was granted to the Church. The remaining eight percent was divided among all the other lesser tenants-in-chief and the minor royal officials. But even so, there were immense differences at the top, with Robert, count of Mortain (the king's brother), controlling a hundred times as much territory and income as, say, Robert of Aumale. In fact, about one-quarter of England was in the hands of ten men: Robert of Mortain, Odo of Bayeux (the king's other brother), William FitzOsbern, Roger de Montgomery, William de Warenne, Hugh d'Avranches, Eustace of Boulogne, Richard de Clare, Geoffrey of Coutances, and Geoffrey de Mandeville.Given-Wilson also probes the surprising fact that no really great noble dynasts emerged in England during the 12th century -- a family that might compare in wealth and status with the great peers of France or the dukes and margraves of Germany. (It was mostly a combination of geographical dispersion of landholdings and much greater social fluidity than that of the 14th century.) The author is also careful to provide examples of his points from a large number of noble families of interest to the genealogist. The historical maps detailing the manor holdings of the Nevils, Berkeleys, Clares, Montagues, Beauchamps, Percys, Cliffords, Fitzalans, Mowbrays, and Beauforts are enlightening and the notes and bibliography are very extensive."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I have read a very large number of books about the Camino de Santiago-- the pilgram road to St. James at Santiago de Campostela, Galicia, Spain.This one is particularly distracting because the writer has an overlay of non-Christian magical beliefs not to my taste."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"A Neo-Pagan BookThis is a neo-pagan book.

I bought two others at the same time. While I am very familiar with some of the terrain and locations that the book covers, I was, admittedly, surprised by the story. If you are in to symbols and mysterious rituals, this is a fine book and a good experience. If you want the \\"Santiago Experience,\\" you might want to think again. Overall, I enjoyed the story and the characters."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This is a reprint of one of Coelho's first books published previously as &quot;The Diary of a Magus&quot;. As with his other first person books, he weaves between the mundane world of sore feet and the transcendent. In the process he learns more about himself and grows as a person. He provides many meditational exercises that are simple and quite beneficial. Many are variations of ancient meditations found in Christian, Zen and other religious traditions.Pilgrimage as a spiritual exercise is found in many major religious traditions. It provides a concentrated spiritual experience in which a person is separated from the mundane world of bills, job and family. During that separation the pilgrim undergoes an experience of transformation--a symbolic death and resurrection. At the end of the pilgrimage the pilgrim is returned to the world of the mundane as a &quot;new person&quot;, with a deeper understanding of himself/herself and the world in which he/she lives. This classic process of transformation is apparent in Coelho's book. Indeed, an underlying theme of the book is that all of life can be understood as a pilgrimage--a sacred journey of transformation.I thought the book was excellent. It was a pleasure to follow Coelho on his pilgrimage and to be reminded of the same lessons that were shared with him by his guide on the journey. But then I've read everything of his that I can get ahold of in English translation and like it all."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Since I read this book I got the idea of doing the same CAMINO. Trough this book occidentals (as me) can understand that going only one way is not necesarily the only way to go. In the search of who you are and why you are here, there are many CAMINOS awaiting and teaching a lesson of life. Learning is one step after other. Learning how to defeat fear, and inner gosts is a CAMINO everybody got to do. Great book, and lessons behind a very well written story. Besides, is the story of Coelho during his pilgrimage to Compostela. I do recomend it!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I must say this book was partially responsible for my own pilgrimage by foot to Compostela in the early Summer of 2001 although, in my heart, I had already begun the journey a long time before.--Very well written.....uplifting...revealing....provocative...delightfully mystical.-"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Coelho is a master of the words and he doesn't fail to show that even in this book. His storytelling is flowing and never overwhelming or boring.Yet, I found this book a bit less miraculous than \\"The Alchimist\\". What can I say, that is my first love, thus I will compare everything I read from Coelho, with it.The search is as ancient as it is modern. The author writes so clearly of a pilgrimage that every human being makes, be it in Spain, or in Mecca, be it in a forgotten road in Albania. What one finds, is the lost self. \\"The Pilgrimage\\" is written in a style that makes it easy for the reader to find the same wisdom that the pilgrim finds, the artistry is fine and delicate, though the relief is more ridgid and stubborn. I guess it is that parallelism of physical and spiritual, pride and humility, flesh and soul.I enjoyed reading it, yet, Coelho, I want to read another \\"Alchimist\\" and this wasn't it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I enjoyed how Coelho was very sensitive to the fact that making such a journey is an individual one, and that for each of us, the road is unique. Of course, we are all inspired to make an attempt at such a quest with similar results, but must continue at our own pace, in our own time; and what me must do with our own sword if we ever were to find our way to it.Publishing a book reaches many souls for centuries to come. Conjouring and facing our devil can be a dangerous thing, and for the reader who might drop this book half way through, will leave with a power that gives strength to darkness. Coelho must be responsible for releasing this knowledge to those not ready to hear it. I hope his soul can carry such a battle, and his sword able to fight a force very dark for ages to come."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I recently read The Alchemist (my first exposure to Paulo Coelho). The Pilgramage is a much more intense, emotional and spiritually-direct book.Paulo's candidness in describing his physical and spiritual experience, and his encounters with the mystical realm of life, will inspire anyone who has a faith and knowledge of God."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"The setting is the famous ''Camino de Santiago'' across Northern Spain -- a journey which has inspired legions of pilgrims over a period of many centuries. The fantastic setting is only the beginning, however, as many a life-changing event have happened to those brave enough to make this lengthy pilgrimage and complete it. Paulo Coelho leaves the reader almost breathless at times with details of his own experiences along this historic path, from tentative beginning through to the surprising finish. Even for those hailing from other spiritual paths (i.e. non judeo-christian) this book will provide a thrill as the message of ''Fighting the Good Fight'' in search of what's important in life is one that speaks to all of us. Magnificently written!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Dear friends readers who just bought or want to buy this book, I think it is worth to read it even twice and have it in your home library. It can really change your view to life, peace, love, passion, belief...Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"While in Bermuda recently, waiting on a weather window to sail back home to North Carolina alone, a friend asked me what was the last book I finished. I said, \\"The Alchemist\\" and his eyes burst wide open. After a long smile, he stated, \\"You must read \\"The Pilgrimage\\" before you set sail for home. He didn't have a copy, but he did loan me his copy of \\"The Devil and Miss Prym\\" which I blew through in two nights while on my sailboat, the S/V Cuddy. The following day, I took the ferry over to Hamilton, Bermuda in search of a copy of \\"The Pilgrimage\\" and found the only one in a bookstore. That night, I read half of it...completely blown away by what I was reading...images in my mind...feelings my like what Paulo was experiencing in the story...I felt as if I was on a similar journey to Love. The suggestion of my friend has turned out to be one of the best suggestions anyone has ever given me. \\"The Pilgrimage\\" is one of the finest books I have ever read...I thought about the story often while alone at sea...on my journey to a place in my soul I thought I would never find. Thank you Paulo Coelho for sharing this story with us...you touched my soul...and my heart...Agape Love is understood in me.Peace to you,Greg Frucci"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"As with the Alchemist, Paulo Coelho takes you to a far away land in this incredible account of his journey on the actual Camino de Santiago which i had the pleasure of venturing on while actually reading the book.

SO GOOD."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Follow Mr. Coelho along the Camino de Santiago! It's his personal story on this old pilgrimage road and while sometimes it borders on unbelievable, it's inspiring! It seems that something special happens to everyone who walks this road. This book will honestly make you want to go on this religious pilgrimage! While I'm not overly religious, I love reading stories about people traveling to new places. And this book is so much fun to read because Paulo encounters all types of people and animals. If you're on the fence about this book, don't be.

After i read this book, i understood a little more about life. paulo Coelho describe many ways as if he has expericed this feeling that he showedin his words. He described them such good details and experesses in his writing. Once oyu start, you wil not stop reading the book. From my experience I could say that it affected on me in so many ways. The Chapter on &quot; Command and obedence &quot; I realized that it taught me things that never seemed important. when i was thirteen years old my life was a lmess i was out of control at that moment. I know that my family was helping me establish with my life and who I was. So i hope with few words it will get you to read this book.

One reviewer said that maybe something had been lost in translation-this may be a tactful way of saying that this book is actually tedious and vastly over rated.The setting is the camino but frankly could have been anywhere else as specific references seem to be lacking-and are probably irelevant to the story.I also found some of the mystical aspects just plain mumbo jumbo-maybe it's just me or maybe others did not like this book but are afraid to be critical of such a 'great' book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This book gave me insight into a powerful relationship with God instead of just a subservient one.

While reading through its pages, i was able to apply all the lessons that Coelho learned through his pilgrimage to my own daily life. It is interesting how we are all pilgrims in our daily lives, looking to fight the good fight. I highly recommended to people going through transitions in their lives.

I have read the Alchemist, Brida, and Down by the River Piedra... and found this book to be my second favourite so far (the Alchemist being #1 of course). I found this book very inspirational and it touches on almost every aspect of life. The writter is actually the main character and it is Paulo's own journey that we are also embarking on. I often found myself wondering, 'did this really happen to him?'. But whether it did or not is irrelevant, since it is the central message of \\"fighting the good fight\\" and all that we must be mindful of in doing so, that is really important! It was hard to put this book down and I loved reading every minute of it! I truly felt a connection with the writer and at the end of the book felt as though i too could fight my own \\"good fight\\"!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I feel Paolo lives his messages.Here is a man who not only writes about self discovery but actually lives it. He is also on a spiritual journey and doesn't shirk what he feels needs to be experienced in order to grow psychologically. There is then an authenticity to his books and what he is trying to convey. He certainly is another peaceful warrior just as Dan Millman is. there are many different ways of growing spiritually and Paolo's way is certainly dramatic!Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"For anyone who considers himself to be a seeker, I think The Pilgrimage should be required reading. If not for the hue and cry about the \\"magical\\" practices in this book, I would recommend giving it to 7th and 8th graders. Focusing as this books does on the path of self discovery and deeply looking within, I see it as a necessary and proper compliment to that which emphasizes looking without, so to speak. Yes, some of the criticism of this book points out that some people living/working along the road to Santiago were critical of this and that; yet, without intending to be disrespectful of such criticisms, I ask what is there in all of creation which hasn't been criticized for something by someone, somewhere? Probably nothing. For me, the journey of this book is challenging, frightening, enlightening and probably central to our, and each of us, \\"reason\\" for being."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This book is considered a companion to The Alchemistyet, for me, was more interesting, with incredible experiencesand a \\"must\\" for somebody in search of himself.The Way of Santiago is not for the faint of heart. Manyyears ago was probably common for the spiritual seeker of inward discoveries,but doing it from the beginning to the end, today, is simply extraordinary.Great book!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Took me a while as he developed his theme. Had read 'The Best Way--El Camino de Santiago',by Bill Walker, which was very entertaining. This is a very different book--much deeper, but worthwhile in the end. Now I'm ready for this August!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I have read this book three times and will certainly read it again. Coelho is my favouvrtie author and he never lets me down. Like The Alchemist, this book reads like a spiritual journey incorporating, soul searching, magic and the metaphysical and it is full of those gems of wisdom a lot of readers like to highlight and come back to time and time again."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I read this book and enjoyed it. I didn't understand all the Swords and Sorcers stuff or the Midevil magic. I do beleive that Mr. Coelho believes it and that's what counts. I plan on doing the Camino and hope my experiances are half as good as his were and that I get out of it what he did. There's only one way to find out. It's worth the time to read."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Real,imagined,or a bit of both...it is a journey worth taking with Paulo as he makes his way along the road to Santiago de Compostela.Bon voyage."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Whenever I read Paulo Coelho, I feel I ought to be embarking upon a journey. But every time it seems that the trip merely revisits itself and, in the end, I always feel I am back where I started. Now it is just possible that this might just be the point, if point there be.Surely, then, The Pilgrimage might have taken me somewhere. Obviously it is the story of a journey, and not just any journey. The author becomes a pilgrim and walks - well, almost - the length of the road to Santiago de Compostela. He starts in the French, nay French-Basque Pyrenees. He and his guide - I hesitate to use the word master, with a capital M, that Paulo Coelho employs - spend several days going round in circles. This surely is a premonition of what is to follow. In his eagerness to achieve an end, Paulo doesn't notice the lack of progress. His guide tells him he is too eager to reach his goal, that he should recognise the value of experience along the way. It's the only way to avoid self-deception. Perhaps that's the point. Paulo takes the advice he is offered and eventually spiritual revelations reveal themselves.The book lists several exercises for the reader to follow. You can find your Master, learn how to Breathe, feel your Blue Balls and utilise the Capital Letter, sometimes. And though I may have an idea about what Christianity might be, I declare no understanding whatsoever of what the Tradition might involve, despite the fact that it and the achievement of its apparently all-important Sword dominate the book. I was none the wiser at the end, but the advice offered that one should not sit on one's Sword will be remembered.Paulo Coelho is a gifted writer and devotees flock to read his books in their multiple millions. What they find there is, perhaps, what he found on his journey to Santiago, which is probably himself, themselves... The process is engaging and enjoyable. It is marginally informative, possible pretentious, but extremely well done. Like the writer, the reader is drawn to the end of the journey and is left, as happens with most things in life, precisely none the wiser, inhabiting the same persona, suffering the same limitations as at the outset. But then we are also perhaps ready to embark upon the next chapter in the ongoing story. Been there. Seen it. Done it. Will repeat. Sound advice."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This book is pure truth. The reality of human condition and the God question is perfectly illustrated here. These are examples, explanations and exercises for all my personal troubles. May none suffer from such trials.This book is a deeply moving account of Paulo's journey. Its chapters move through at a pace that reflects his passage through the Strange Road To SanTiago. The words and exercises are all relevant to the reader's experience - an experience of the Road To SanTiago via Paulo's lively notes.So we as readers also travel the Road and learn and live the journey. There are innumerable lessons in each chapter of this book. Lessons learnt through Paulo and his guide Petrus interactions, actions and reflections. Each chapter in this book has a purpose and each exercise shared generously by Paulo has a direction - in all taking us through the Strange Road via Paulo's words.So live the experience and take this pilgrimage, accept the magic and the miracles, and have faith in what you would question elsewhere - this Road is not traversed on blind belief but requires faith from the faithful."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"You have to be at least a little bit mystical in order to fully enjoy this book, which is full of mysteries and unexplainable events.This is the detailed experience of the writer in Spain, along the road to San Tiago, which pilgrims have traveled since the Middle Ages. But this story is a contemporary quest, and it has an interesting and exciting mix of ancient and modern, that in the end leads to learning and understanding the truth.It is the road that Paolo has to take in order to defend his sword and that will turn him into a Warrior of Light. He is accompanied by his spiritual guide, Petrus, with whom he will walk about 800 km over three months, during which time he will confront himself with his own fears, thoughts, doubts, and weaknesses. It is a pilgrimage that will explain to our main character (and implicitly to us) that our efforts in life are salutary and indispensable. But without results they amount to nothing.Also, the story shows that love makes us stronger and it is this strength that allows us to make the right decision at the right time.The search of truth is assimilated to a personal search for meaning, for the things that we need in life such as truth, love, joy of life, and spirituality.I think it will be a very pleasant lecture for everyone who enjoys this kind of story, and it will make you think a lot about your life and the meaningful things in your personal universe."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"First I want to say that it was great to read this book because I learned something new and its very important for me. This book is too diferent and the others books that I read because all the time gave advices but this book it was different because when I was reading and I finished each chapter I analyzed everything and the same time I remembered something important in my life. The best thing that I learned in this book is that we still our goals, we need to make effort, to have time and the principal faith in God and we are going to do it. Also, it was great to gave a opinion in different ways like love, death, enthusiasm, marriage, etc. I guess that we always need to express what we feel in everything I mean, we need to say everything that we think,want,etc."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"There is not much I can add to what has already been written save to say that I picked up the book on a whim - I liked the cover - whilst touring South India, and it turned out to be both a stimulating and comforting travel companion (even attempting a couple of the exercises, in rare secluded moments).However, the real reason for this review and what I find particularly interesting, is why it has taken cassie.nell (see below) nigh on a year to publish PC's confession? I too had had my doubts and have been very reassured by her note."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I have mixed emotions about Paulo publishing this book. As a mystic I regonize it as authentic. But as a mystic I rocognize the constant struggle between that which creates (commonly referred to as white magic) and that which destroys (commonly referred to as black magic). In the book many times Paulo was tempted to use black magic by taking a shortcut instead of traveling the route to enlightment. I fear the novice may use some of the exercises to their detriment. But to the spirit on the journey it is a very important work. This book is not for everybody."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I wrote a review of this book in Feb 1999. Since that time I have walked El Camino, October/November 1999. I must say that Coelho's book has prompted many Brazilians to make the adventurous trip. However, most of the refuge hospitaleros had criticism of the book, not only because of the mystical content, but because he did not finish the journey by walking. On the other hand, they also critize bicyclists. I still don't like the mystical part, but he has made people think about the journey and that is a positive point. It's also good for Spain in its attempt to promote culture."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I did not particularly care for the overly dramatic and spiritual presentation of the subject. I was looking for a more practical report on El Camino which would give me mileage between refuges and information about the towns and villages along the way."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"If you go to any book of Paulo Coelho in Amazon.com, you will see this &quot;reader from Lisbon&quot; making nasty comments. This is pure jealousy, from someone who is frustrated. If I read an author, and I don't like him, I don't read ALL his books. Don't pay attention to this anonymous reader. This book is excellent, Coelho is the best Brazilian writer ever."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Another of those \\"path to enlightenment\\" accounts (ala Shirley MacLaine, Lynn Andrews, Carlos Castenada) in which the candidate is put through a harrowing and confusing series of trials by his enigmatic spiritual guide. The recognition of life's great truths, which the pilgrim has actually known all along but refused to acknowledge, is the ultimate goal and the way to know oneself and the purpose of one's life. That's what this book is about, with little information about what it is like to walk this famous route or arrive at the cathedral destination.Described as dazzling and poetic, I wonder if something was lost in translation, as this reads in a somewhat sophomoric and clunky fashion. Books of this sort have their place, and for those who have not encountered any of them before, The Pilgrimage can open the mind."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Dear Readers, I read the book,&quot;The Pilgrimage,&quot; the book was great and very interesting. I imagine how Paulo felt when he traveled the road to Santiago de Compostela, many good and bad things happened to him. I think he was lucky to find a good guide such as Petrus. He could learn many things from Petrus. To me the most interesthing parts were the RAM exercises, I'm practicing these exercises and they're helping me to have control with myself. I give my congratilations to Paulo for his grand courage."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"See my previous review below. Reading the Pilgrimage inspired me to follow the same route, known as the Camino de Santiago this summer. (In fact I finished the 850kms yesterday and I am typing these words from an internet cafe in Santiago de Compostela)I was the 18th South African to have done the pilgrimage in the last decade or so - for the introduction to the camino I will always be grateful to Paulo Coehlo. I have had the time of my life and in a sense it was the first step of the greater pilgrimage of my life.I met many many Brazilians on my pilgrimage (after Spaniards it seems Brazilians are the most common pilgrims to encounter) and most of them said that Paulo did not really walk the camino - he did parts but mostly he drove in a landrover. This was &quot;confirmed&quot; by some of the Spanish hospitaleros who run the pilgrims refuges along the way.Not that I have a problem with that in itself - its just a book after all - I gues I just dont understand why, if in fact he did not walk all the way, he wrote the book in such an autobiographical manner?So if you are reading this Paulo, did you slog the 850kms or was it all bogus?"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"About 8 months ago, during a very bad \\"flu-experience\\", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Silly, very silly. The Pilgrimage is a ridiculous confection of half thought out semi spiritual nonsense. Paulo Coelho claims to have walked part of the route, catching a bus through the mountains of Galicia, in search of his 'sword' in the company of a male spiritual guide. He enjoyed plenty of out of body experiences and wrestled with a dog, which was of course the devil himself, not one of the thousands of wild dogs in Spain.This book will and does appeal to a large section of society, and if your bookshelves are groaning under the weight of dream interpretaion and past life exploration books, then take a look at your Feng Shui advice guide and throw them all out and replace them with a slim volume of the Pilgrimage, it has it all - even tranced out dancing in a castle. I wonder if Paulo paid the 4Euro entrance fee to join his fellow Knights Templar for that?"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Unlike other work by Coelho, this has to be one of the most tedius books I have ever read. I really don't know how it got so widely recognized. Emperors new clothes perhaps? It's tone is smug, patriachical and condescending and very very preachy. The exercises are trite and unnecessary. You would have to be a born again or live the fantasy life of a medieval Knight templar to find it engaging. It is self-serving, santimonious Christian-Missionary-flag-waving of the worst possible kind.....unless it is actually tongue in cheek Athiesm in which case...well served. If not, leave it on the altar...I mean shelf!"},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I think I read somewhere the author is Catholic. Can't be a very good one or know much about his faith. I got this book on kindle for my husband after we both watched The Way, hoping it would add to our knowledge and desire to make the pilgrimage. He didn't even finish reading it. It has numerous strange brain exercises the reader is asked to try (and even physical positions, like curling into a near fetal position, face down, arms extended by sides). The last straw was the request to imagine Satan, the devil, in your head...that was the last straw. Catholics do NOT invite Satan into their heads; it is nothing less than dabbling in the occult which is always detrimental to one's soul, and a good source for nightmares. It has nothing to do with prayer or meditation on higher things. Very sorry we spent the money on this book; I would not even give it away. Into the recycle bin it goes."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I read The Alchemist by the same author, which, i liked very much and so i was very excited to read more of his books. I read the Pilgrimage next and found it disappointing and lacking the surrealism and mysticism that made me crave for more. The story is interesting in that it's about the author's pilgrimage. I found it long and almost tedious to read through his journey, feelings, and thoughts. I was relieved to have finished it. The good thing about having read this book is it made me want to take the pilgrimage as well - not for any soul seraching purpose but for travel and adventure.

There is a brighter side to everything even though it's very hard to see."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I have read most of Paul Coelho's books. His books are not for those who are seeking a 'good read'.The act of reading his books including 'The Pilgrimage' is a soul searching act in itself. It becomes an act of self discovery. I read his books very slowly and try to experience every line. And it really does not matter what religion you are. His feelings are universal."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This book was just painful to finish. Pointless new age pseudo religious drivel. Coelho goes on a Catholic pilgrimage, wrestles with possessed dogs, hangs out with magicians and then dances around in castles pretending to be a knight Templar with his equally loony mates.This is supermarket spirituality at its very worst.

In this book, he chronicles his own experiences on the road to Santiago de Compostela in the region of Galicia known as Celtic Spain. The journey is rich with allegory reflecting how we must face our own fears in order to engage in what he calls \\"the good fight\\". The Pilgrimage is reminiscent of Carlos Casta&ntilde;eda's apprenticeship with his mentor Don Juan. Paulo's guide is the enigmatic Petrus, who teaches him to face his own limitations and to break him from the \\"modernist\\" notion that our busy work is more important than exploring our inner world. There is a sweet discovery about the book that brings presence to a wisdom that includes mystical exercises worthy of our attention."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I like this book because it has many lessons that could help us when we have a challenge. All the experiences that Paulo lived through the road showed us how to accomplish our goals, But the most important thing in what we should do when we succeed."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop. However, at the same time I thought it to be a strange tale, certainly not something I would expect from someone who would want to walk El Camino for religious purposes. Maybe I'm a sceptic, but the excercises struck me as too good to be true - I wonder if they would really work on someone who's trying to find some kind of inner peace. Anyways, I would recommend anyone to read it and maybe exchange ideas on it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"How could anyone take this book seriously? It is an insult to those who seek refuge in literature to find such a pastiche of old oriental tales, borrowed and destroyed by the shallow prose of its author. Dont buy it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"If you're looking for another Alchemist this is not the right book for you... it is about Mr. Coelho's personal experiences, it is written in the first-person, and it is more spiritual. But its events are so mind-boggling that you can see where the author's inspiration comes from for his literary masterpieces. It gives you a profound respect for Mr. Coelho and his achievements. It is NOT FICTION. It contains &quot;Meditation&quot; exercises at the end of nearly every chapter. The main aim in my opinion of this book is to remind us of the mystery of the world and that not everything is clear to us as humans, but that despite this, it remains our duty to fight for what we believe is right. Most importantly, this is not a self-help book nor does it spoon-feed you theories about life... DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS about its deeper meanings...but read it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I have read Brida, the Alchemist, The Valkyries and The Pilgramage which is the most outstanding (all of them are great).I thank Paulo Coelho very much for his messages. Just say, it is worth it to read it, but if you dare to believe, as I do, you can go further, if not, don't worry, it's in no way a boring book. I suggest you to take the Road to Santiago after reading it. This book has made me to change a lot, and I promise, it's being a great change. I strongly recommend this book for those who don't know what to do with their lives or are full of doubts about their future. This book is helping me to find my way and to look at the Road and pay more attention to myself and my inner soul. But it's not just to read it, it needs practice, faith, will and time. I think it pays off, because what really matters in life? what we have in the material world or what we can achieve in the spiritual and psycological world? This book deals with the latter.It's your choice. Good luck!."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"This was Coelho's first popular book, and as such denotes his evolving magical style. It is about his trip in the Santiago de COmpostela trek that goes from east to west across Spain. I found the travel perspective of the book to be fascinating, and since I read it I have thought many times about doing the trek myself.As for the personal revelation the author encounters in the trek, I foudn them interesting, not overwhelming. The lessons learned are presented in many different books aside form this one; what makes this book a little special, I believe, is that the story involves the reader in such a way that the lessons are driven effortlessly."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"\\"The Pilgrimage\\" is the third book I have read by Paulo Coelho, although it was his first. It was first published as \\"O Di&aacute;rio de um Mago\\" in 1987, and the first English translation was titled: \\"The Diary of a Magus\\" and was published in 1992. This is the tale of Paulo's own personal pilgrimage along the road to Santiago. After failing to earn his sword in his ordination as a Master of the Order of RAM, he is directed to take a pilgrimage to seek his sword there, as well as the wisdom he would need to use it.Despite being a more personal story, I didn't find it to be nearly as engaging of a narrative as \\"The Alchemist\\". Since I read the translations by Alan R. Clarke of both books, I tend to think that perhaps this is due to Coelho's improvement as a writer. That is not to say that this is not an interesting book. \\"The Pilgrimage\\" is still a good story, and for those who like Paulo Coelho, it is certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I agree that it is very mystical and that it might turn off some readers, however if people get past that, I think they will enjoy it. As for the criticism, that some reviewers have expressed over Paulo Coelho not finishing the Pilgrimage, I don't think that has any bearing on the book. He is talking of his own spiritual journey. The walk changed his life and I believe that is what he is trying to express in the book. If he inspires people to do the walk, then that is enough praise. I read this book over 5 years ago and am planning to do the walk this year, September of 2000."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I also walked El Camino, and was surprised to know that some (few) Brazilian pilgrims criticize Paulo Coelho's &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;. Every time that I asked if they read the book, they said that they did not. It seems that El Camino was becoming the property of a few choosen ones, and &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; made it popular all over the world. For me, this is an absolutelly fascinating book, but I understand why some reviews say about whether this is an accurate description of the journey. It is not. It is Paulo Coelho's experience, whether you like it or not. If you don't like, better buy a travel guide or write a book by yourself. And by the way, I believe that Coelho deserved the Golden Medal of Galicia that he received this year."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I read The Pilgrimage by Paulo Coelho soon after completing my own 800 km pilgrimage from St Jean Pied de Port in France to Santiago in the north-west of Spain.Readers who are looking for a factual, chronological, \\"travel book\\" of the Camino de Santiago de Compostela will be disappointed. There is only the vaguest chronology in the book. A few towns and important pilgrimage sites are mentioned. There is only a sketchy picture drawn of the terrain and countryside.But that is quite irrelevant. The Pilgrimage is a much more sophisticated account of the psychological and spiritual aspects of pilgrimage. In fact, the physical vagueness in the book complements the inner struggles of the pilgrim.The pilgrim in Coelho's book is on a quest for his sword so that he can complete his apprenticeship in the Tradition and be able to perform the deeds of his Master. The quest takes place on the road to Santiago and the pilgrim (with his spiritual guide) encounters magical tests that expand his psychological horizons.This resonated with me in the sense that the Camino finds the weak points in our bodies and characters and tests them. Reflective pilgrims gain personal insights, and, for many, their lives change in significant ways after completing the Camino. Coelho makes the same points by his use of magic to illustrate the inner transformation of his pilgrim.The book also includes meditative exercises that the pilgrim performed at critical times on his journey. While some of the exercises are a little unrealistic, such as the Cruelty Exercise of self-mortification, most of them can be performed by anyone, with resulting benefit. I wish I had read the book before my own pilgrimage so I could have done more in this respect.This was Coelho's first book and it shows to a large extent. It is uneven in quality and lacks the tightness of his later work, such as The Alchemist - which it resembles in its basic structure of an individual's quest for meaning."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I first read this book in the summer of 97 on my way back from a trip from Ottawa, I'd found it in the ottawa airport. Two years prior to that, I'd read The Alchemist and never really gave much thought to other books by Paulo Coelho, dispite the lasting and impowering effects The Alchemist had had on me. It had me hooked and only at 16, I was convinced and determined that I was going to walk the Camino. Five years later, last may, I finally achieved it. It was my moby dick, really the only thing I'd ever set my mind to doing. The book inspired me to take a journey of a life time. In doing so, I found so many more journey's I'd never imagined. I highly recommend that you read the book, and once you have, live the Camino for yourself."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"i have read many of coelhos works and until 4 weeks ago this was the only one i had not read.the story although lacking in the spirituality that books such as the alchemist i believe that it supplied the reader with a knowledege of coelho and makes us able to understand fully the purpose of his books. the story is simple. a man on a journey to find somthing that means a lot to him.this simplicity is backed up by beautifuly descriptive language and wonderfull imagery which took me into his journey in full. the emotions coelho creates in this book are wonderful too from fear and excitement at paulos fight with the dog to the sadness of paulos dissapointment that when he parts from petrus he has not yet succeded the book is helpful in showing the importance of the smaller things in life and how we should not forget our childhoods and the passions and spirituality they posess. i found the details of his RAM practices wonderful .overall an essential book for any coelho fan."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I discovered this book during my first journey on the road to Compostela in 1991. All the young Spaniards had a copy in their back pack. The author created a New Age delirium giving the path to Compostela an image of witchcraft and the occult. During my three journeys on the road to Compostela ( 91 95 96) I happened to have met some of the key characters the author mentions in this book, and they were very unhappy with the author's version of the Compostela experience as well as with the use of their life. I disliked how the pilgrim gives up the road for a bus ride at the end of the book, which is a &quot;sacrilage&quot; once you enter such an experience."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I always enjoy Coelho's books.

All of his books are highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"&quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; is disappointing fiction of tall tales, self-help tips, non-sequiturs, and mumbo-jumbo, a &quot;Twinkie&quot; for spiritual seekers. Coelho makes uses the camino de Santiago as a backdrop for &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; episodes that have only a spurious relation to this wonderful pilgrim road. The &quot;Tradition,&quot; mysterious links to orders of knights, encounters with devils and a devilish dog, excercises giving mysterious powers, and other fancies mark the narrator's journey on to find his magic sword. Coelho's quirks are legion and distracting. For example, the the road to Santiago becomes the &quot;Strange Road to Santiago,&quot; and Santiago becomes San Tiago. &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; merits the criticisms that I heard along the camino last year from Brazilians and French pilgrims. There's plenty of wonder and mystery in walking the road, as there is in everyday life, without having to resort to the literary posturing that characterizes this book. Read it and see if you can figure out why it sells so well."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"I must amend my previous review of this book. While the book is entertaining it expounds the idea that we must use forces outside ourselves (magic) to achieve what we want. Magic is strictly prohibited in the Bible, the Torah and the Koran. It is labeled a form of idolatry. For those searching for themselves I would recommend the reading of John Gray's \\"How to Get What You Want and Want What You Have.\\" God's speed in your journey."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"As anyone who reads newspapers know, Paulo Coelho will receive on the 25th of July, the day of St. James, the Golden Medal of Galicia, one of the most important awards of Spain. This award is due to his honest and sincere book, &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;, which lead several persons to walk through El Camino. The fact that he is honest enough to tell that he did the last 150 kms by bus, it is, in my opinion, something that we should praise instead of criticize. This book is far better than &quot;The Alchemist&quot; because it deals with the Good Fight. Please read this book first, if you are interested in Paulo COelho's work."},{"Title":"The Pilgrimage: A Contemporary Quest for Ancient Wisdom","review":"To whoever likes to read: I read &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot; Paulo Coelho's highly book.

This is one party kids & adults will want to read about over & over again, especially on those moonlit nights leading up to Halloween itself.

The costumes are varied, the food a bit unsettling, and then the clock strikes THIRTEEN!!! At thirteen the fun begins with a surprise, sure to give shivers as the party comes to an end!Everyone is getting ready for the masquerade party at the house at the end of Shivermore Street. It's an eerie night with a pea green moon. It's six o'clock as the party begins.Food consists of insect treats, as much as you want, if you're brave enough to try. From seven to eight a game of musical chairs is played until all the witches are out. From eight until nine, five vampires set to work carving five pumpkins so that by nine the jack o'lanterns are burning bright. Bobbing for apples isn't easy especially for werewolves who always miss the apples, even though they have GREAT BIG teeth. From ten to eleven the house on Shivermore Street is silent with a game of hide-and-go-seek as everyone hides from a little fat ghost. Then it's time for a game of limbo and what better way than using a broom. Unfortunatly for the mummies they lose their wrappings as they go and need to be re-rolled. A dance of do-si-do is in full swing as the clock strikes THIRTEEN!As the clock strikes thirteen everyone holds their breath and prepares to take off their mask. On the count of three the surprising twist is complete, not everyone is who you'd think. The guests, who came to the party at the beginning of the story, scream and run away from the party on Shivermore Street.For some added fun when reading this book, turn down the lights and play some spooky sounding music to get everyone in the mood."},{"Title":"Halloween Night on Shivermore Street","review":"The neighborhood children are excited. There's a Halloween party tonight on Shivermore Street, a haunted-looking house decorated with spider webs, candles and jack-o-lanterns. At six o'clock as directed, the children approach, ready for the party to begin. Every hour, before the clock strikes, there's something new to do: just before seven it's snack time, \\"sizzling spiders hot out of the pan... whipped cream-colored ants\\"; before eight it's musical chairs, six frantic witches scrambling for five seats when the music ends. And so it goes, hour after hour, each bringing a scarier game, werewolves bobbing for apples, vampires cutting out pumpkin faces, hide-and-seek in the dark of night.Beware! When the clock strikes twelve, it's time to take off the masks, everyone exposed. As the final chimes begin, all the partygoers gather for the unveiling. The children look around them, their eyes suddenly as big as saucers; it seems these party people are really scary monsters! With a shriek, the neighborhood kids run from the house on Shivermore Street and a Halloween party they'll never forget. In vivid Halloween colors, a pea green moon, a navy blue sky, goblins and ghouls eerie faces lit my orange candlelight, the fanciful illustrations are scary without being frightening, creepy and strange, spine-tingling. Page by page, the party accelerates, until the final countdown. Part of the revelry, the children have no idea what is happening until everyone is unmasked. This entertaining tale delighted my granddaughter as we read, hour by hour, deliciously building up to the midnight surprise.

The only problem I had with this book was that, even by FP's standards, this was an extremely dense read, and the names and titles were enough to make your head spin without careful attention to who-goes-where-and-why.Painter Knight is, of the three, the best blend of the two most attractive aspects of the universe--the romanticism of Stone Prince, and the politics of Granite Shield--but I think it makes a poor first read in the universe; too much is assumed, and the death of a major character 20 pages in (and of a family as prone to tempermentalism and misunderstanding as the DeMarians) tends to distract the reader from the action, which requires a clear head to follow.Finally, a word on the gender politics of the books; in this universe, bisexuality is the norm, unquestioned, and gay relationships are uncompromisingly as common as straight ones, with stigma attached to neither--very refreshing, especially when combined with the completely non-gender-bias of the universe. Many fantasy universes that preach gender equality have a &quot;aren't we liberal, look how liberal we are&quot; quality to them; FP doesn't even bother to justify her equality, and simply makes it a non-issue. It just *is,* and even titles such as Prince, Abbot, Knight, Duke, and so forth are non-gender specific; you're as likely to have Duke Kassandra as Prince Demnor, for example. When I finished these books, it took a minute to remember where I was, and how much our world is different from FP's, and when I did remember, I almost cried. We've got a long way to go.All in all: five stars, each and every one, each with different strengths and weaknesses. I thoroughly enjoyed all these books, and can't wait for the next one. Strongly recommended! :)"},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"I highly recomand the book to any fantasy reader and anyone else. This book is even better than the Stone Prince with complex characters and great storyline. The events are fast paced and ever fascinating.This book is about religious conflicts between the Essusian and the Triach which is the Living Flame housed in each of Aristok of Branion. The storyline begins at a time when of Essusian kings who, for the past 150 years, has denied the Living Flame inside them which gives them the right and power to rule Branion. The present monarch, Marsellus DeMarian is another DeMarian Aristok who has denied the Flame.So now, Llewellynne ap Rowena, the fighting Prince and a Seer in the neighboring kingdom of Gwyneth was given a vision by the Flame which instructs her bearing the first child of the Aristok, a child who is willing vassel of the Living Flame and who can lead the Triarctic forces back to victory in Branion.Thus, Llewllynne succeeds in her mission and gives birth to a son named Rhys, who grew up, together with his brother Llewen (Llewllynne's son with her husband) to wrestle back the power of the land."},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"Having read the first two books in the series, I was terribly disappointed with this one... I can't even get myself to finish it after two weeks, and I burned through the first two in a couple of days!A major issue for me, which other reviewers have also acknowleged, is the sheer volume of detail and data. Despite the chapter-by-chapter list of Dramatis Personae, I still found it frustrating to try and keep track of who was who. While true historical politics are certainly as convoluted and complex as events in The Granite Shield, I prefer to be able to get through a fantasy novel without having to refer to an appendix after every paragraph. In my opinion, the plot just got bogged down by too much information, making it a struggle to read.My second issue is simply that, at the mid-point of the book, I still have not developed any affinity for these characters. Maybe it's a side effect from the info overload discussed above, but I just cannot get attached to the characters in this book, whereas I felt connected to Simon (The Painter Knight) and Demnor and Kelahnus (The Stone Prince) from the very first page .Gripes aside, however, I remain appreciative of Patton's egalitarian society where gender and sexual orientation are complete non-issues. But for my money, The Stone Prince and The Painter Knight are much stronger works with stronger, more memorable characters."},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"If you've read other books in the Branion series and enjoyed them, then you're most likely going to enjoy this one, too (surprise!). You've got the Living Flame, Essus, the infamous &quot;gender-free&quot; society, hotheaded red-heads ... what more couldja want? :)The development of relationships in this book - and all Fiona Patton's Branion books - is appealing. In The Granite Shield, I'd say the most interesting (and most focused upon) is the relationship between the two main characters, a pair of (half-)brothers with intertwined destinies. Another fascinating feature in the series is the conflict/relationship between Essus and the Living Flame. In this particular book, you get an interesting vantage point into that relationship through the eyes of a powerful seer.As one reader noted, you probably won't see any great reason to choose one &quot;side&quot; over another ... and I think that's part of what Fiona Patton does very, very well. She doesn't give you a &quot;good guys triumphing over the bad guys&quot; plot - instead, you get what I'd call a more realistic view of conflict."},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"This book was awesome and the only reason why I didn't give it full marks was because the titles of the characters did get a little confusing and at times i found getting them all straight was very confusing. I noticed that once i got into the book it got easier to understand,but i think that i missed part of the magic of the book at first. Young Lyewen was an awesome character he kept his wits about him and his story was a really fascinating one to follow. Overall this book was great and i would recomend it to anyone who loves stories from medivial times!"},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal, it was more dense tha I had anticipated but very entertaining, with three-dimensional characters.My one problem was that, in all honesty, I didn't particularly see why I, as a reader, should be more in favor of Gwyneth over Branion, when Rhys didn't seem like a much more favorable choice than his father. The theocratic aspects were very interesting, but on a personal level, I thought that the main characters had something lacking. Ms. Patton's minor characters and adversaries were far more compelling. I found myself hoping for Drusus and Calliston to be victorious instead.Even so, I enjoyed the overall tone and feel of the book and look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"Granite Shield, The","review":"Fionna Patton has done an excellent job once again.

They exist just because--there's not much of a reason for such excessive detail. It's kind of like Stone Prince. Barely better. I had bought three of the Patton books because the covers looked interesting and the details, when skimmed, looked ok.

If, on the other hand, infinite summations of Bessel functions scare you then stay away and stick with one of those kiddie undergrad electronics textbooks like Microelectronic Circuits by Sedra and Smith which is packed with lots of useless, redundant stuff and enjoy throwing your back out everytime you have to bring that thing to school/work."},{"Title":"Communication circuits: analysis and design (Addison-Wesley series in electrical engineering)","review":"This was the text that i used in my university courses in Peru.It was absolutely important in my education and is nowadays a excelent book to check problems engaged with small signal!."},{"Title":"Clean Room Design: Minimizing Contamination Through Proper Design","review":"It covers a lot of information that I needed.

Bravo"},{"Title":"Essays in Pragmatism","review":"The only notion (hazy at best) I had of Pragmatism was from some recent reviews I'd read ofThe Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America, which got me curious about the concept. A few days later, I saw this book in a library book sale, and to be honest, I picked it up mostly due the effect of synchronicity. As a philosophy layman, I have little background to place this collection of James' essays into context, and though I understand that James' views didn't originate in a vacuum, and that Pragmatism itself has underwent sort of a modern revival in the past thirty years or so, I can only speak to the worth I found in this single volume. How James expanded on other's work, or in what regard modern thinkers hold him, I don't know, though through some online research, it appears that his ideas are still a springboard for a variety of Neo-pragmatists and Neo-Classical Pragmatists.Of the seven essays collected here (arranged chronologically), only the last two deal with Pragmatism by name, though all treat their subjects consistently with the idea that, \\"in the last analysis, philosophical beliefs - answers to ultimate questions - must square with the facts of human nature\\" (from the introduction by Alburey Castell, pg xiii). This idea of human nature as the arbiter of truth casts James as a solid humanist, which is what F.C.S. Schiller urged him to call his philosophy (again, from Castell's introduction), but James was already set on Pragmatism, presumably because of its association with practicality.James begins his arguments in 'The Sentiment of Rationality', where he posits that no philosophy, no matter how abstractly admirable, can ever hope to survive unless it meets the theoretical and practical 'needs' of the thinking man. In 'The Dilemma of Determinism', he discusses the arguments for free will and predestination, and in 'The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life', he addresses the sticky wickets created by accepting the idea of free will. 'The Will to Believe' is James' defense of man's right to believe in the infinite, and 'Conclusions on Varieties of Religious Experiences' expounds on this idea further, and includes a bit of James' personal belief on the matter. Lastly, 'What Pragmatism Means', and 'Pragmatism's Conception of Truth' are both explanations and defenses of the pragmatic method.This was a challenging book for me. James' turn of the century writing style had much to do with it, as did my inexperience with this type of inquiry. I found myself retrenching often, flipping back several pages at a time to reacquire the threads of the discussion, and often even resorting to reading out loud, to help decipher meaning through the rhythm of the words (surprisingly or not, this worked well for me through some of James' more archaic sentence structures). Regardless, I kept at it until I felt I grasped his point, which, in the end, I felt was not nearly as cognitively difficult to appreciate as was deciphering his delivery.Essentially, Pragmatism is a method, one that hopes to leapfrog over the roadblocks caused by metaphysics and by mutually exclusive ideas of truth that still satisfy the 'sentiments of rationality'. What would be the practical difference in our lives if we held to be true one or the other of these competing ideas? If none, then the argument is a waste of time. However, if one idea did have this difference, then the truth of the idea would be revealed during its application - as we verified it. Thus, there are no abstract Truths handed down from the ether - a truth 'happens' as we verify it. Truth is always in a state of 'becoming'.Regardless of what use Pragmatism has been put to since James' formulation, whether in sociology, jurisprudence, business practice or ethical considerations, the important thing for me to consider is that James' application of the Pragmatic method was confined to the cognitive, and for settling metaphysical debates. It may have seemed natural to transition from the theoretical to the material, but personally, I think there is a possibility for dangerous short-sightedness inherent in that process. Whether I'm right or wrong, intuitively, it does not seem a great leap to think of this uniquely American philosophy, formulated in the early years of the twentieth century, as one of the ingredients necessary to create what is popularly believed to be the American Century.One last irrelevancy: On the title page of this used copy was the following inscription. To Pete L. - In hopes that when reading this, you will achieve utter de-fascination. - G. Wondering about this 'found text' and the anonymous individuals it concerns gave me almost as much to think about as the essays themselves."},{"Title":"Essays in Pragmatism","review":"I am about to teach, once again, a course in religion and psychology -- since I have degrees in both. I want to avoid reading, once more, the many extreme Christian examples of religious experience in William James'sThe Varieties of Religious Experience. Through various recent experiences, and teaching experiences, I know that the book is widely misunderstood, or parts are taken out of context.Looking over my bookshelves, I came across a very old copy of this book, _Essays in Pragmatism_. The introduction covers many of the points needed to explain the history and background of the extraordinary contribution of William James. As his relatively unsung contemporaries in the systematic examination of religion, I will add William E.B. DuBoisThe Souls of Black Folk (Enriched Classics Series)and Evelyn UnderhillPractical Mysticism. Sigmund Freud is also roughly a contemporary of William James, and there may have been a reference to Freud'sThe Interpretation of Dreamsin William James's _Varieties_. What is useful in Freud, though, is covered in hisFive Lectures on Psycho-Analysis, where he details the Freudian defense mechanisms.This book has a nice balance of essays. I think the most important to the topic of religion and psychology is \\"The Will to Believe.\\" Then, rather than do all of Varieties we will concentrate on understanding the last two chapters of it, which are included here. Most young readers of Varieties seem to get swept away by the early chapters, which validate religious experiences they have had, or have wondered about. In contrast, James's point came at the ending of his book, and involves the ability to rationally examine cases chosen precisely because they were extreme, not because they were Christian.Essays in Pragmatism contains in one book two important elements that help delineate James and his thought; the separate \\"Essay on Pragmatism\\" comes as a bonus for those who think they know what pragmatism means.In short, this book serves as a good introduction to William James's thought, to his way of looking at religion, and to his philosophy of pragmatism."},{"Title":"Essays in Pragmatism","review":"Almost there...or was it my melancholic prof?James is an intellectual but the prof did some serious injustice to him.

But I had to, for this is one of my favorite fiction books. In other reviews I wrote that each Outlander book gets even better than the last, that may be true, but if I had to pick my favorite, it would be Armageddon Axis.I like this book very much because I identify with the characters, It wasnt a quick read, I really felt what the characters were going through. I know this is fiction, but when I read this book, Im always filled with Nostalgia because I have firsthand similar experiences with what Lakesh, Brigid, and Dian went through. Anyone who has ever been in a perfect loving relationship that was meant to be and would have lasted but didnt due to the surroundings will relate to this book.And besides that, it is action-filled and also the locations it takes place in are hauntingly chilling. Being in an extremly large and vast complex where everything has been run down and the only inhabitants are the people that had cyborg implants to survive 200 years and are insane, and walking down the corridors you feel as if someone is watching you... This novel was very good. And also it has a touch of humor in some places that adds to the excitment.This is one the best books I have ever read and continues to be. For when I have nothing to read, I'll pick this book out and read it again. And it always has the same impact of when I first read it. I never grow tired of it.Definately a must!!!"},{"Title":"Armageddon Axis","review":"Armageddon Axis is a prime example of why Outlanders is the best adventure series available.

However, with the success of the NEAR mission and with concerns over the cataclysmic effects of asteroid impacts making their way even into popular culture, they are of great interest today.The book lives up to the title, providing a very brief background on the birth of modern astronomy with Kepler and Galileo before getting to the discovery of the first asteroids. The first clue was the large gap between Mars and Jupiter, where astronomers in the 1700s began looking for a missing planet. By early in the next century, they'd found several, though they were all too small. And by the early 1900s, astronomers were getting a little tired of them, there were so many (about 2,000).Skipping up to modern times, we now have dedicated instruments that are all but swamping the system with findings: The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project, using automated techniques, found over 25,000 new asteroids in less than two years.Peebles also focuses on different categories of asteroids, since not all are found between Earth and Mars: some approach the Earth (sometimes unnervingly closely), while others, in the Kuiper Belt, are beyond the orbit of Neptune. The discovery of each of these classes is described in separate chapters as well as, when appropriate, the theory behind the formation of each and how it was developed.Two chapters serve as something of footnotes, one on the different sources of asteroid names (dead astronomers, Greek mythology, places, etc.), and the other on the controversy in San Diego over streetlighting. The latter seems somewhat out-of-place in this book, though the story is worth telling: basically, there was a great fight over whether the city should install streetlights with a low impact on the nearby Palomar Observatory or a higher impact. The former were disliked by some due to their orangish, unflattering lighting. To make a long story short, the astronomers win in the short-run but lose in the long-run as a new administration comes in and, at significant expense, votes to install the high-impact lighting. Peebles does not describe the resulting effects at Mt. Palomar, which is a great absence from the book and effectively undercuts much of his argument.The final chapters cover the potential for asteroid impacts, the discovery of Shoemaker-Levy 9 and its subsequent impact on Jupiter, and the possibility of defending against impacts.Some minor goofs: Minor Planet Center director Brian Marsden (one of the most significant figures in modern solar system astronomy) is referred to as &quot;Bruce Marsden&quot; once, and the NASA administrator during the Challenger disaster, James Beggs, is consistently referred to as &quot;Biggs.&quot;My only other criticism is that the recounting gets a little tedious at times: asteroid X is discovered, then asteroid Y, then asteroid Z, and so on. But that would be a little hard to avoid in this sort of history, and Peebles manages to provide enough background, covering theory, techniques, and historical circumstances, to stay out of that rut most of the time.It's an excellent book for those interested in the topic."},{"Title":"Asteroids: A History","review":"An outstanding introductory and reference work on the current thinking behind the asteroid phenomenon, including the controversies over naming, geological studies etc. Covers in some depth the main periods of asteroid discovery, from visual to photographic to automated. Also deals briefly with issues of asteroid origin; a very interesting discussion of the analysis of &quot;groups&quot; of asteroids, identified by similarities in their orbital elements, as well as interesting treatment of Jupiter's effects on sweeping out lanes in the asteroid belt. Excellent treatment of the NEA threat, from its inception up through the SL-9 impact.Quirky treatment of light pollution in the middle of the book, in the context of the naming phenomenon (an asteroid was named for the city of San Diego after a light pollution ordinance was passed, but later rescinded, though the asteroid kept its name). It was an interesting discussion, and a story that deserves to be told, but didn't belong in the middle of this book."},{"Title":"Asteroids: A History","review":"A very good book to anyone that desires to acquire a good glimmer about the subject of Near Earth Objects and their threat to our civilization.It covers all aspects from technical to politics and is a real tribute to many dedicated professionals and amateurs astronomers, geologist and others various scientists which are making history in asteroid and comets hunting. It also make me disapointed to know that the Southern hemisphere, were I live, is like a blind concerning the NEOs search effort.Only one aspect prevent me too score 5 stars: In my opinion, the too long discussion on chapter 8 about he streetlights issue of San Diego.A wonderful start book for anyone who intend to initiate in the NEOs study."},{"Title":"Asteroids: A History","review":"Although it's a little dry in places and could use some more illustrations and a few more photographs, the book does a decent job of introducing the reader to the history of asteroids, their discoverers, the implications for mass extinctions on earth, and the efforts being taken today to detect them and deflect them before they have a chance to make a bad impression."},{"Title":"Asteroids: A History","review":"As an amateur astronomer of 40 years one part of astronomy I am interested is asteroids, especially near Earth orbit asteroids. My main interest is Mars.Curtis Pebbles does a good job giving the history of asteroids starting from Ceres. He lists the asteroids discoveries and the names and designation of the asteroids. Many different types of names much I really don't care for. Discoveries started out with classical mythology names but soon after time various categories of names were allowed. Even girl friends names allowed, plants,animals, cities, countries, rulers etc. An asteroid was even auctioned off by the discoverer to be named for money. INMO that went too far.I would of liked a catalog or graph showing the asteroids by their orbits Near Earth, between Mars and Jupiter, asteroids beyond Jupiter etc. Also type of composition of asteroid and size. It would of made reference easier.Many scientists and astronomers are listed and bibliographical information is given. There are some nice black and white pictures about various asteroids as well as a picture of Dr Eugene Shoemaker. Shoemaker- Levy 9 crashing into Jupiter is spectacular. For me it was great to see the impacts of the various sections of the comet Shoemaker- Levy 9 smashing into Jupiter but chilling to realise if the Earth got hit by it, it would have been lights out for the human race.I was saddened to read about Gene shoemaker killed in a car wreck in Australia and his wife being badly injured. The world lost a great scientist and man. His wife was a great Comet finder and terrific helper.The first part of the book was OK as I would of rather had the asteroids listed differently. Only 3 stars. The latter part of the book got much better with interesting detail how with CCD cameras and better telescopes asteroid hunting became much easier than earlier visual observing only. Much is stressed on having a large amount of people helping to find asteroids rather than only a select view.The extinction of the dinosaurs is shown as a impact asteroid or comet event. Curtis Peebles shows the evidence that finally swayed many scientist to believe an impact rather than volcanic activity. Also the various time scales the Earth is due to be hit by different size asteroids is shown. The work and set up so far by various groups in asteroid detection world wide is shown and the need for an eventual asteroid deflection/destruction program to be eventually started as its not if the Earth is going to be hit by a huge asteroid with life extinction possible but when. Eventually we will have to have a system in place or face extinction.I would of given this book a 5 star rating if the asteroids discussed would of been arranged better for referencing.

Hansen's tale reveals a rare and authentic knowledge of Los Angeles and Southern California. He writes well about Dave Brandstetter, a rich, rich gay detective; Cecil Harris, Dave's young African-American lover; and all the aspects of L.A. that I love, including the cars, the rain, the slums, the food, and the people. This story, published in 1984, concerns the coverup of toxic waste dumping in the canyons, which really happened. How could anyone be so vile as to poison our awesome mountains?In the frame of a murder investigation, Hansen gives life to his characters -- real people, some of which you may recognize in their natural habitat. There are cameo appearances by the suave Jaguar salesman and the sweaty Culver City used-car peddler. Here are some people, too, that I hope you've never met -- the odd ones and the bad guys.You'll find, too, a few, I don't like this word, but here it is, subplots. A lot's going on and it's all intriguingly tied together. Good people, some almost saintly, live on these pages along with the other kind, who are driven by their fears or their greed. And did I mention the yummy food and the tempting drinks?Instead of hot babes, this mystery presents us with hot dudes, such as a young Irish ne'er-do-well and a suave, beautiful Latino detective.

Hansen writes classic hard-boiled PI novels which start out in prosaic fashion, but weave and wind to brutal and surprising conclusions. The writing is always spare and vivid, with shrewd characterization, snappy dialog, and 'atmosphere' you can smell, touch, and taste. One of the few writers who actually merits comparisons to Chandler and MacDonald, Hansen also set the gold standard for the sub-genre of 'gay mystery.' NIGHTWORK is one of my favorites for the interaction between Dave and Cecil, and the chiaroscuro of Dave's private life and the grim world he works in."},{"Title":"Nightwork","review":"&quot;Nightwork&quot; is the seventh Dave Brandstetter mystery by Joseph Hansen. The series is set in and around Los Angeles. Dave, a death-claims investigator is looking into the death of Paul Meyers, a truck driver.

Was it Silencio Ruiz, a gang leader who was sent to jail on Paul's testimony, and who vowed to kill him when he got out of prison? Was it Bruce Kilgore, a teacher, with whom Paul's wife Angela was having an affair? Does it have anything to do with Paul's nightwork? The plot and the characters are strong. Hansen is an excellent mystery writer. It's just too bad that there were only 12 of the Dave Brandstetter mysteries written."},{"Title":"Nightwork","review":"With a gift for lean, driven prose, during his lifetime Joseph Hansen (1923-2004) was regarded as one the finest authors working within the classic California private eye genre. His best-known works are a series of twelve novels written between 1970 and 1992 that feature insurance claims investigator Dave Brandstetter, a tough, no-nonsense detective--who also happens to be homosexual and is utterly unconcerned about that fact.Originally published in 1984, NIGHTWORK finds Brandstetter employed to investigate the death of Paul Meyers, an independent trucker whose firey death was first deemed an accidental crash but now looks very much like murder. Assisted by his lover and sometimes-associate Cecil, who is still recovering from bullet wounds received in the previous GRAVEDIGGER, Brandsetter is quickly involved in an unexpected array of witnesses and suspects: a faithless wife, an eccentric who spends his time watching his neighbors from a Victorian mansion, a black minister whose efforts at reaching out to gang members proves a miss-fire--and most particularly a mysterious woman known only as \\"Duchess\\" and a questionable detective named Smithers, who may or may not be involved in illegal toxic waste dumping.At one time The Los Angels Times described Hasen as \\"the most exciting and effective writer of the classic California private-eye novel working today\\"--and NIGHTWORK bears the statement out. Hansen's prose is lean but never sparse, his characters flawlessly created, his plots often a bit too plausible for comfort. He is also noted for his talent in evoking Los Angeles and its surrounding communities, and no where is that gift more beautifully on display than in this particular work. A strong-arm page turner indeed.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Nightwork","review":"'Nightwork' is yet another Brandstetter mystery by Joseph Hansen. Our favorite insurance investigator, Dave Brandstetter, this time chases down some nasty people involved with illegally hauling dangerous cargo in big rigs in response to the death of one of the truckers. Of course along the way we run into murder, a couple of bizarre characters, and a plot that never quite engaged this reader. The prose is fine but the characterizations have grown too soft as the Brandstetter series progressed. I also find the relationship between the lead character and his gay lover to be too cute, a little to much of forced side show. This sort of books pales compared to anything by the likes of Dennis Lehane or even Harlan Coben.Bottom line: a very forgettable book.

But then how many books about SBWII are there in this world? I am grateful for what the writer has done here and appreciate his enthusiasm and love for the subject. So if you're the type that doesn't mind carrying your CD collection around in a paper bag, you'll find nothing disturbing about this fanzine masquerading as an actual book. Strictly for the enthusiast, but the author's words deserve better packaging."},{"Title":"Fessor Mojo's Don't Start Me to Talkin'","review":"(portuguese) Esta &eacute; uma maravilhosa biografia sobre o maior gaitista do blues americano.

MADOC was large, confounding, mysterious, lyrical, and sui generis (really). Yet many readers/reviewers did not appreciate it. Since that work, Muldoon seemingly has tried to obtain such appreciation by offering more manageable fare--featuring topical themes, easy wit, sentiment, form, and rhyme (not to mention all those pretty names of Irish places). He has served up plates of warm apercus. If that is your thing--fine. He is terribly accomplished--his more recent poems, including those of Moy Sand and Gravel, sparkle with polish and panache.

It's actually a better place to start reading the \\"later\\" Muldoon, in fact. Domesticity has tamed a bit of the bravura evident in the arcane lore dazzling the other collections perhaps too much. Poems here like \\"Unapproved Road,\\" mixing Taureg with IRA in its 1950s failed \\"border campaign,\\" wittily contrast in a way that Muldoon warms to more and more as his work confronts his own hyphenating midlife identity into an American as much as an Irish poet. \\"Guns & Butter,\\" \\"Whitethorns,\\" \\"A Brief Course on Decommissioning\\" address the post-1998 events in the North of Ireland intelligently and without pandering. His children and wife now enter his work to round it out more vividly, and at least some of the shorter poems here continue the clarity sought in \\"Hay\\"'s briefer verses.The reason this collection loses a star is the last poem, as usual in his work a longer one: \\"At the Sign of the Black Horse.\\" The Irish navvy-Jewish mogul undercurrent never convinces, but seems layered over the parental concerns. Where Muldoon often swerves to avoid obstacles, here he seems to plow ahead, but ends up floundering a bit when taking more time to expand and concentrate his direction would've made for a better poetic quest into a very deserving subject of culture clash."},{"Title":"Pennell on estate, gift and income taxation","review":"Poetry is an art form that succeeds only if the reader can share with the poet a vision communicated by the poem.

But the basic story is the same.This is a charming narrative of a cruise in a well-built little sailboat, in waters of the Baltic countries, to places the author clearly knows and loves.Arthur Ransome later wrote a series of children's books focused on sailing. He would certainly have agreed with Kenneth Grahame's \\"Ratty\\" that \\"\\"There is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.\\" One might qualify that, noting that in Ransome's books, the sailing is rather more directed and purposeful - but he always communicates the sheer joy of being on the water in a craft that responds to the elements, at your direction (He was not a fan of engines of any kind - a sometimes necessary evil. Sailing was the thing.)\\"Racundra's First Cruise\\" was published in 1923. He had commissioned the building of Racundra, a thirty-foot ketch built for seaworthiness and comfort inside. With the \\"Ancient Mariner\\" - an old veteran of the days of sail in clipper ships - and \\"Cook\\" - probably the companion who was to become his second wife, but only identified by her unending task - he takes us through many sometimes tricky passages along the Baltic coast, visiting old cobblestoned towns and remote peasant villages.It is delightful to sink back into a time when the sea was still full of trading vessels under sail, though of course large and small steamers also abounded. Mentions of \\"during the war\\" refer of course to the Great War. Relics of older conflicts abound - Russian, Swedish, Latvian, Finnish, Estonian - and Ransome provides many interesting footnotes to their stories.My favorite encounter is that with the enigmatic man who lives alone, building a ship, in the forest. The ship is at first seen as \\"a golden hull in the shadows among those tall trees\\" then we see that \\"the upper planking was new, certainly, ruddy gold where the sun caught it, but lower down her hull was weathered\\"....\\"The keel, laid on great stones, was joined to them by moss. There was lichen upon it, and on the foot of the stern-post was a large, bright cluster of scarlet toadstools.\\"Enjoy."},{"Title":"Racundra's first cruise","review":"Great little book - takes you back to a different, simpler, world.

She'd said it herself many times. She'd raised her twins as a single mom and is now experiencing empty nest syndrome as her twins have gone off to college. Jenifer didn't need a man but she sure wanted to meet one \\"who'd be willing to explore the naughty and the unknown with her....\\" Just as she finished that thought, she glanced up from behind the check out counter of the Doolittle Public Library where she worked ever since high school summers and met eye to eye with Eric Hamilton. Eric is handsome, expressive, has a chiseled chin, deep-set dark eyes, strong nose, and full lips. He has a wicked gleam in his eyes and speaks with a low-pitched baritone voice. Eric is actually an undercover agent investigating a counterfeit money ring in which he believes Jenifer may be involved. Along the way to cracking the case, Eric and Jenifer manage to fall in love.Hailey has created characters that are believable and loveable. The love story is great and the ingenious undercover plot is intriguing. Both of these story elements run neck to neck in excitement and suspense. Hailey generously sprinkled Love: Undercover with humor that had me laughing out loud many times. Hailey has really surpassed herself with Love: Undercover. I highly recommend that you read Hailey North's Love: Undercover. You won't regret it and you'll feel better after reading it."},{"Title":"Love: Undercover","review":"Jenifer Janey Wright and Eric Hamilton begin the story pretending to be everything they aren't. He a simple investor just looking to invest in a run down old hotel, and she a librarian who insists time and time again she \\"doesn't need a man.\\" Once the romance is sparked, the story really comes together- from the cute family dialogues to the bb gun escapade that includes little old Mrs. Kirtley and her ear trumpet. All in all the book was a very sweet and simple romance. My reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because after finding out all he'd hidden from her throughout the course of the relatinoship, all it takes is a little explanation over the phone from him (which the reader does not get to hear) to get Jenifer to patiently wait for him to return to fetch her. I don't know about everyone else, but I like a little more grit in my main characters- It would've been nice to see her make him beg and plead a little bit before she forgave him. But all in all I think this one's well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Love: Undercover","review":"Jenifer is suffering from empty nest syndrome. Her fatherless twins have just gone off to college, and she thinks maybe she is ready to plunge into the dating pool.Enter undercover agent Eric Hamilton. He is investigating Jenifer because she happened to be photographed with two known counterfeiters. He is there to find out what she knows and how deep her involvement is. Soon, he realizes that she is a victim of circumstance, and he is soon sucked into fiber of the small town, as well as a romance with Jenifer.The interactions are hysterical; especially the family gatherings when Jenifer feels compelled to tell Eric that she does not need a man, only for her entire family to recite that part, as if it has been said many times before.The only thing that I did not like about the story is that Eric was her first partner since the conception of her twins. Enough of the born again virgin plot lines - it is so overused.The secondary romance with the uncle and her mother is also very sweet. I like that she showed a lot of emotion in how she dealt with the fact that her widowed mother was willing and able to take a chance at romance again. It is a good light suspense romantic novel."},{"Title":"Love: Undercover","review":"Love: Undercover is a funny, lighthearted romance.

He at first thinks the sexy little librarian is involved. As he gets to know Jenifer better he realizes she is a woman worth getting closer to for personal reasons.Hailey North writes with such sass, wit and steam.

Jenifer and Eric are solid leads. Their romance is not super hot, but it feels realistic (much more so than many romances). Jenifer is undestandably hesitant to embark upon an affair, and her journey into love is beautifully rendered. There's also a lovely thread about Eric finally coming to feel like he fits in.The mystery is woven seamlessly into the romance, and there are plenty of little details that add to the book's charm and realism. A warm, highly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Love: Undercover","review":"Love Undercover was a decent read. The author really took the time developing the characters and building a story around them. Though I could not really tell which was the main story or plot of the book. Was it the romance or the mystery? That really is all that made this book non-rereadable for. It was slow at times and I think with a better mystery aspect I would have personally liked it more. If you are looking for a real world romance though, then get this book. A lot of books don't actually give the main characters time to get to know each other before sleeping with each other, this one does. It was nice but a bit dragged out for me. LOL Over all though it was good."},{"Title":"Love: Undercover","review":"In Doolittle, Arkansas, librarian Jenifer Wright raises her twins by herself as the father dropped her the moment she mentioned pregnancy. However, she currently feels a bit lonely though surrounded by the love of her extended family because her darlings Autumn and Adam are away on college scholarships.FBI undercover agent Eric Hamilton arrives at the library allegedly seeking information for his Virginia based investment firm. In fact Eric is trying to find the connection between Jenifer and two money laundering thugs as he has a photo of the trio together. As he meets her family and gets to know Jenifer better, Eric falls in love with her and is willing to risk his life if necessary to keep her safe. Jenifer, who has not needed a man for years, reciprocates wondering if it might be empty nest syndrome.This is engaging romantic suspense with the emphasis on the former as the lead couple falls in love under the spot light and encouragement of her family. The story line contains neat tidbits to enhance the flavor for instance; Autumn has a track scholarship while Adam is on an academic scholarship. Tiny gems like that augment a fabulous tale even if the intrigue arrives late.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Wrecking Crew (Matt Helm Adventure, No 2)","review":"I started reading the Matt Helm novels in 1965, before Dean Martin, when THE DEVASTATORS was new on the shelves. That is a much better book however than the one being reviewed: THE WRECKING CREW. WRECKING CREW isn't a bad story, it contains the requisite action, femme fatale and Mac (my favorite character in spy fiction), the necessary base ingredients for any Helm outing. I've read every novel in the series at least twice except for final ones numbered 19 through 27 (once was enough), but in THE WRECKING CREW Eric's voice just doesn't sound right to me. It's off the way Robert B. Parker's is off when doing a Marlowe pastiche (which is not to say Parker didn't do a good Chandler impersonation, he did!).THE REMOVERS, the third in the series, reads more like the sequel to DEATH OF A CITIZEN than this second entry. My theory is DEATH OF A CITIZEN started life as a standalone book and Fawcett told Hamilton they wanted a series about Helm's shadow world. I can just imagine them ordering him to fire up the production line and crank 'em out. My belief is THE WRECKING CREW was either the current book Hamilton was writing or a reject from the past. He'd never written a series character before and just changed some names and called THE WRECKING CREW the second Helm volume before getting to work on THE REMOVERS.I give THE WRECKING CREW three stars, but measured only against the spectrum of the first 18 Helms, after THE TERRORIZERS #18 the series died despite nine more published works. Helm's suspenseful adventures thrived in a 140 to 190 page format. In the latter volumes Hamilton had to add 100 or 150 more pages to make a Helm book hefty enough for its $2.95 price tag. The longer stories became lugubrious with superfluous incident and detail that bowdlerized Hamilton's short-form suspense formula. A pity of Hamletic proportion.The only other discordant note than THE WRECKING CREW in the first 18 exploits of Matt Helm is THE SHADOWERS, a book that starts out great but stumbles to its knees and whimpers to an end. There are two other misfires in those initial 18 editions: THE RAVAGERS #8 had the usual Hamilton verve but lacked his usual punch despite a clever twist in Act III; THE RETALIATORS #17 is a fourth weak point, but only because Helm should have shot the maddening female lead in that one as fast as he could draw that five-chambered .38 S&W; snubnose he dislikes so much. These four books don't approach the zenith of the series: Citizen, Removers, Murderers' Row, Ambushers, Devastators, Betrayers, Menacers, Interlopers, Terminators or Terrorizers. Those ten books are the pillars of strength shoring up the Helm legend. The remaining four, Silencers, Poisoners, Intriguers and Intimidators, are excellent reads but not great like the aforementioned ten. They're two different words in my vocabulary. There's a lot of excellence in this world, but so very little greatness."},{"Title":"The Wrecking Crew (Matt Helm Adventure, No 2)","review":"Matt Helm is sent to Sweden to kill a mysterious Soviet agent. The only drawback is that until he finds the master spy, he's ordered not to use lethal methods to defend himself. Hamilton keeps the villain's identity hidden well while throwing several obstacles into his protagonist's path.

A lot like the Mickey Spillaine of the cloak and dagger set. The American answer to Bond, and a little quicker to get physical if the need calls for it.It has action from the beginning to end and a good plot line. No superhero like moves and is a fair chance he may get roughed up a bit along the way but very believable. I have just started rereading my own collection of his books and they are still excellent.Hollywood tried filming either two or three of Mr. Hamilton's books with Dean Martin as Matt Helm and as much as I like Dean Martin, it failed miserably. The movies are fun to watch if you like tongue in cheek humor with a lot of bedroom chuckles but don't expect to find them in the books. Could be compared to Casino Royale with Woody Allen and what Ian Fleming really wrote.I'll leave you with the hope you will try one because like a potato chip you will be back for more."},{"Title":"The Wrecking Crew (Matt Helm Adventure, No 2)","review":"This was my first Matt Helm book (but it is the second one that was written), and I came to it looking for something to replace the James Bond stuff that I have almost finished working my way through. At first, I was a little worried about some \\"hard-boiled detective\\" sort of language here and there, but there really isn't too much of that. Just as Ian Fleming sometimes incorporated some slang in ways that took me out of the story a little bit, Hamilton uses some expressions and styles that might or might not have been authentic at the time--but either way, it ends up helping me enjoy the reading experience as a sort of 'time-travel' thing; at least that is how people *wrote* back then. Apart from those occasional phrases, though, the prose is efficient and smoothly done. I don't mean to scare anybody off, I'm just saying it had me worried for the first few pages...Like in Bond novels, there are characters that should or shouldn't be trusted, and the protagonist has some tricks and techniques to help him through it all. But Matt Helm is different than James Bond. Helm (in this story, at least) seems just a little rougher to women maybe (and is divorced), less adoring of his boss, and there is the interesting question of which one of the two agents is more brutal or remorseless towards his enemies. Some of the best parts in this book are when Helm is thinking about what it means to do what he does.Anyhow, if you like Fleming's Bond, this book is quick-moving, interesting, and probably worth checking out if you keep in mind that it was written by an American, and is gonna be a little different. It has a lot of the same elements, but is a distinct reading experience."},{"Title":"The Wrecking Crew (Matt Helm Adventure, No 2)","review":"Mission Two: The Wrecking CrewMatt Helm series Reviews by Ujjwal DeyWell the first one is beaten to grit and grim by this second one in the series. A little longer at 176 pages, still an easy read for my weekend; this one brings Helm into a whole new line of action in espionage business.Now Matt Helm has had his refresher course in the covert groups training - the American Mordgruppe - The Wrecking Crew - an unknown, unspoken elite group of operatives who generally work alone to do what armies and clouts of bureaucrats can't achieve. The man is just right for the job. The trainers believe he is in no shape to be an operative and certainly past his prime. His bad new resume was certain to get him killed on a field mission. Mac agrees - he is just the man for this job.Matt Helm now has to play dumb; to act like a clumsy ancient World War trooper who can't call the shots in this peacetime covert warfare. As a photographer for an American magazine he lands up in Artic Europe to shoot innocent bland photos of mines for a girl who could be a double-agent or simply a fool in this foolish game. The girl in question has survived a bullet meant for her journalist husband who had the gall to write a tale describing a Russian agent - The Man No one Knows. Of course this deadly Russian operative has no sympathy for such breakthrough journalism, and now the supposed widow is carrying out her husband's journalistic inclinations.There is more than meets the eye and pretty women are lethal in more ways than one. Helm's contact in Sweden is shot dead in the face, double-crossed by her evil mysterious agent. Helm has to contend with getting bruised and bashed around to prove himself harmless to a variety of operatives - biding his time to get his orders.Yes, the men in Washington call off lethal action - no Government ordered assassination during peacetime - but that is not a restriction upon Helm's enemies. Matt Helm goes through unraveling intricacies in the players' cards, as a poker player who has to display ignorance of any known card game. As people show up dead around him, things come to light and when the final game is afoot - Matt has the aces up his sleeve to vindicate Mac's faith in him.The violence is as bad if not worse than the first book - which is a good thing in any gritty espionage thriller. The brief reflections on the first book events such as him carving up an old lady friend and his separation from his wife also come up very much accurately into the new plot. His handiness without a gun is seen very well in this story as essentially he has to go out there unarmed to convincingly play the role of an American photographer, even if the cover doesn't fool his targets.The geographical descriptions and accuracy in detail is wonderful and you can imagine yourself tracing his trail across the mountains and into wilderness in the Arctic. He has to \\"make the touch\\" - Group M speak for killing the target - similar to what mafia would say \\"making a hit\\". But he has to be patient enough to identify the mysterious Russian spy, wait for the go ahead from his Boss, and then make sure he does it cleanly - being in a friendly country during peacetime.Putting up a classy display of ineptness, we also get to read about all that he could have done as a master agent but doesn't to keep himself useful to the Russian agent - he is able to prove himself harmless on more than one occasion until finally its time for a showdown.Cars, guns, women's choice of clothes, all again feature in this sequel in Matt Helm's ponderings. There are women he trusts and they assuredly betray him and Helm is not one to be heartbroken or sentimental - he goes about his business with determination and calculation - even surprising his own Government's other operatives (of other departments) - who fall for his \\"clumsy\\" act. At the end Helm proves himself to be as cunning and ruthless as his Russian rival. The climax action with its cold-blooded moves sees Helm make his touch and save a damsel from distress as well. The last chapter adds more to Helm's personality and legend. His un-emotive demeanour at what could have been a tragic romantic scene ensures he is the man with a job he is good at.If you thought gadgets and expensive machinery with latest guns was the way an agent wins a war - you have watched too many James Bond movies. This book's account shows us in a believable and clinical clarity how a secret agent would go through with his mission in a foreign country. Matt Helm is no great fist-fighter but he knows how to fight and here we see him use more of the matter between his ears in contrast to the trigger in enemy hands.Extract: When you act like a nice guy, everyone examines your motives with a microscope. When you act like a conscienceless louse, they generally take you at face value.****"},{"Title":"Corel DRAW 9 Graphic Suite Manual de Uso con CD-ROM: Manuales Users, en Espanol / Spanish (PC Users; La Computacion Que Entienden Todos) (Spanish Edition)","review":"&Eacute;ste libro es excelente para principiantes, ya que cuenta con una gran variedad de ejemplos sencillos y explicaciones paso a paso.

Her skillful weaving of personal stories with the larger social context of the movement, and her analysis of the influence of Jewish notions of morality and social justice, make this an important addition of civil rights scholarship.

Amy Dru Stanley looks at the spread of contractarianism into household relations and finds not improvement but rather a different basis for wringing effort from subordinates to enrich and comfort their masters. Defenders of the south's peculiar institution used similar arguments with regard to labor, comparing the &quot;wage slaves&quot; in the north to the real slaves of the south, always in favor of the latter. Stanley's assessment is more nuanced, valuing individual freedom while remaining sensitive to the grinding hardships this freedom brought with it. The heart of her argument is her close analysis of the relations of dependency between slaves and masters and husbands and their wives and children. While the movement to free slaves had widespread support among many social groups, the movement to free wives, like today's movement to free children, was seen very differently. Indeed, slave emancipators held out the prospect to freedmen of being kings in their own castles, of holding their wives and children in bondage to themselves just as their white masters held their slaves and the members of their own families, to encourage them to leave their masters following emancipation. Yet for the freedmen, the money to be kings in their castles was lacking, and freedwomen had to labor as long and hard in freedom as they had in bondage to keep their poor households going. As a result, many resisted playing their assigned parts in the freedmen's family romance. Meanwhile, their poor white sisters faced similar economic constraints. Free labor during the era governed by the &quot;iron law of wages&quot; condemned workers' families to penury and, in extreme cases, pushed wives and daughters into prostitution as their only alternative to destitution. Stanley's informative discussion of the personal cost of commodification of labor to individuals and their families provides many opportunities to consider other results of this process on human existence."},{"Title":"Mallcity14","review":"This is a book everyone should read and is the first instalment of what Saunders' hints could be the beginning of an exciting series.Saunders' novel is purposely structured on a number of levels. Set in the \\"not to distant future\\", Saunders depicts the story of the coming of age of a teenage boy, who, after becoming frustrated with being forced to conform to the accepted way of life, leaves it all behind for the sanctuary of a village free from the burdens of modern consumerism. In the process he finds his first true love, gains an understanding of the world and develops a tolerance for the choices made by others.At the higher level, the world Saunders has created is cleverly disguised as the world we live in today. Saunders criticises society's plunge into consumerism, consumption driven debt cycles, status anxiety and the emergence of \\"people databases\\" and personal tagging devices. After reading this book you begin to realise that the actions of the characters are not too dissimilar to your own, to the point where you begin to analyse and trivialise your own behaviour.Saunders' novel not only provides a prediction of where the path of modern consumerism is leading us into the future, but leaves us with the question of who is really in control of democratic society - Governments or \\"the invisible hand\\" of the free market? Is it really that absurd to portray a society where your right to vote is determined on your ability to consumer?I can't wait for the sequel!!!Al Mal"},{"Title":"Mallcity14","review":"This is the most refreshingly different dystopia to be released in a long time, and should be read by all interested in the genre. Unlike other dystopias, this has not one distorted society, but two - an official opposition that is being used by the lords of society.The story starts in hyper-consumerist hyper-mercantilist Mallcity 14 where everyone is required to purchase as much as possible and go as far into debt as possible, where the only value is newness and everyone is bombarded with commercials and computer surveilance. The hero escapes during a computer glitch, and is brought to those who oppose Mallcity and the rampant consumerism.Some will notice what may be an anti-capitalist theme to the book, never noticing that this really isn't capitalism but a distorted type of monetarism. The alternative society is communal.As this dystopia was recently written you will notice many parallels to our current society, which is the way a dystopia is supposed to operate: extrapolation from current trends. That will be quite a refreshing change from 1984 or Brave New World."},{"Title":"Mallcity14","review":"I don't normally read books of this type, but a friend suggested I have a look at this one. I'm very glad that I did.In Mallcity 14, Shaun Saunders paints a picture of life on earth as it might be ... soon! In some ways very frightening and in others very enlightening. Frightening because Saunders shows what can ultimately happen with the end result of today's technological advances. And it's the insidious way that these things are slowly taking over our lives that's also quite scary - implanted chips in people, video surveillance and even thought transference! Enlightening because it shows how we can prevent the ultimate big brother society from happening.I also liked his underlying (well overt, actually) dig at our consumerism driven society with his Bureau of Consumer Confidence, where everything must be bought. Where will it end? Saunders' story of rebellion, told through the eyes of a teenage boy, provides some possible answers.This book could have quite easily been another doomsday purveyor. But Saunders with his fluid writing style, great sense of humour and ability to paint vivid, humane pictures, turns this book into an exciting future journey. A journey that you and I are already on and one that you should find out more about.Highly recommended.Bob Selden, author What To Do When You Become The Boss: How new managers become successful managers"},{"Title":"Mallcity14","review":"At first glance you think, well all well and good, Animal Farm type humor.

This dystopian foray can stand with those of the twentieth century, and could be considered Orwell for the new millennium. The book is short, but its plotting is deft. The theme of consumerism run amok is strangely timely, as capitalism lurches into a crisis that has not been seen for eighty years.Dystopian novels are not intended to be fun reading experiences, but unlike Winston Smith's coming to love Big Brother, Mallcity 14 ends on a note of hope, and I put it down not with the shudder that accompanied finishing 1984, but with a smile."},{"Title":"Discover Educational Toys for Children","review":"Parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles should use this book to help find age appropriate gifts and activities for children.

Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"What I would like to know is why the fact that black men do not go to church is such a bad thing. Is a black man supposed to be a bad man just because he will not believe in a lot of reactionary, medievil, superstitious nonsense? Maybe if we black people spent more time enriching our minds instead of posioning it with a lot of holy-rolling rubbish, we would be better off."},{"Title":"Adam! Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"I have been browsing Amazon searching for books for the church library I'm starting. The title of this book caught my attention since I'm adding titles that deal with the subject of African Americans and religion. I belong to a bi-racial church and this book seem to be along the lines of many other books on the topic of African Americans and religion that I am strongly considering buying for my library. However, I think the author should have taken a little more care with the title he's given his book. His title seems to suggest \\"most\\" black men don't go to church. I would like to have more insight into the thought process and the survey methods he used to come to this conclusion. I give this book 1 star (even without reading it) because I don't think the church-going African American males attending my church would appreciate a title that makes an inference about them without supporting evidence.I may eventually pick up this book because I myself am jumping to the conclusion without supporting evidence, but it seems to me a bit reckless to make such a strong statement without sound supporting evidence. From the reviews I'm reading, the author could hardly have done much research on this subject, especially if he wrote it in 5 days as one review suggests."},{"Title":"Adam! Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"In this book, Jawanza Kunjufu endeavors to discern why black men are not in church and how the church might bring them back. After giving some anecdotal evidence of the problem, statistical evidence of the plight of the black male in society, and a discussion of the success of black Islam, Kunjufu gets to the heart of the book. In chapter 5, Kunjufu reveals 21 reasons black men do not attend church based on a survey and interviews he performed. In chapter 6, he posits solutions to the 21 problems that keep black men out of the church. Finally, Kunjufu surveys some models of ministries to black men.Kunjufu never details exactly how he performed his survey--how he distributed the surveys in a balanced way, how many surveys he distributed, what kind of return he got, and so forth--and this might call his results into question. Nevertheless, the answers Kunjufu's respondents provide resonate strongly with the common sense of any churchgoer, especially to a man. The 21 reasons he cites as to why men do not attend church are themselves worth the price of the book. Most of these reasons cut across racial and socioeconomic lines as well. Kunjufu's list is indispensible for anyone doing evangelism among men of any color.Nevertheless, this golden core is barnacled by much worthless dross. Most of the solutions Kunjufu gives to the 21 problems are superficial. Many of them are apologetic arguments for church practices that the unchurched men deplore, but these arguments will not bring these men into the church.Further, the book is very sloppily edited, if edited at all. Kunjufu claims that the book was written in five days, and it shows. The organization is not tight, the formatting is not always consistent, there are numerous mechanical errors, and Kunjufu routinely gets carried off in a torrent of rhetorical questions that lead nowhere.Ultimately, this book is worth its low price for the responses of the men Kunjufu interviewed. But the same goal could have been accomplished with the edited publication of chapter 5 in a widely read magazine."},{"Title":"Adam! Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"This book opened my eyes as to why there are so few African-American men under the age of 50 in many inner city churches. It also gives some insights on how Orthodox Islam and The Nation of Islam are making inroads among young African-American Men. This book clearly shows that a African-American male can be Christ centered and Afro-centric at the same time."},{"Title":"Adam! Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"Maybe in its next printing author Kunjufu might consider changing the title to &quot;Adam, Where are you? Why Most MEN Don't Go to Church.&quot; This is not to suggest that he change a single iota of his prose; it might assure a wider readership and better sales. Even if he is concentrating primarily on the black man, Mr. Kunjufu's examination of the smaller male numbers in the church can apply to the mainstream, namely white, population. Perhaps a follow-up should be written to encompass the entire American public.The book offers suggestions that each contemporary church should consider in attempting to draw the men into the fold. Placing much of his emphasis on Afrocentric teachings and Bible passages, the author has written a thoughtful and dynamic work which should be in the library of every minister, parishioner, and other interested parties in the growth of the church."},{"Title":"Adam!

Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church","review":"This book addresses really well the importance of things like self-defense and self-reliance for Christian men. It addresses problems with men that affect all Christian churches in the West, not merely those in the black community. He deals with the successes and failures of other groups with men and has a meaningful way of incorporating those lessons into the church.He misses the final star, because, in my opinion, it is incorrect to describe the Gospel as either Afro-centric or Euro-centric. You'd have to call it Judeo-centric, since Jesus was a first century, Tanakh reading, Orthodox Jew. He wasn't \\"black\\" or \\"white\\", but, since he was a Middle Eastern Jew, probably looked like a modern Sephardic Jew."},{"Title":"Adam!

What a waste."},{"Title":"Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo","review":"The destruction of Yugoslavia is not the easiest of subjects to fully comprehend. Cohen's informative and excellently written narrative is the best place to start. Cohen does more than just describe the events, he attempts to get beneath the surface to understand the psychology behind the unspeakable atrocities committed during the various wars. The trajedy of Yugoslavia cannot be understood without a recounting of the atrocities committed there during World War II, atrocities that largely went unpunished. All of this and more are recounted by Cohen in his very readable account. It is must reading for anyone interested in recent European history."},{"Title":"Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo","review":"A big, passionate book by the New York Times correspondent, who has tried to pack everything into it: the Bosnian experience of the war (told through several family histories), the Western response and UN policy, and the historical background. Cohen argues well against the \`ethnic hatreds' doctrine, but tends to substitute World War II hatreds instead. However, his analysis of UN failure, including evidence drawn from minutes of a high-level meeting held before the fall of Srebrenica, will be of lasting importance"},{"Title":"Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo","review":"It is said that history repeats itself, but never so quickly and with such dismal sameness as in the former Yugoslavia. I purchased this book in hopes of gaining a greater understanding of the conflict there, and managed to start reading it just in time for the current round of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and NATO's (and the US's) disorganized response to it. The book is extremely well-written and structured in an interesting way, beginning with the story of one young man's decades-long search for his father, a Bosnian Muslim who faded from his family's knowledge in the chaos of World War II.The gut-wrenching conclusion to that first part of the book, so full of pathos that you can hardly believe it really happened (but know that it did) leads into the Bosnian war of the early 1990's, centering on the long and ugly death of the city of Sarajevo and the toll it took on several other families. Cohen pulls no punches in letting the reader know exactly how he feels about the UN's response to that conflict. I would certainly like to hear his take on the current situation there, which he all but predicted at the end of this book. I would recommend &quot;Hearts Grown Brutal&quot; to anyone who would like to sort out in their own minds what really happened in Bosnia and Sarajevo such a short few years ago. In light of today's headlines, the book certainly provides food for thought as to America's response and responsibilities in this area of the world."},{"Title":"Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Every page, every line tells the truth behind the Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian conflict. All wars are complex and difficult to comprehend but Mr. Cohen helps us understand what happened just a few years ago. An accurate and eye-opening account. Some of the atrocities committed are so heinous, so vile as to bring us right back to images of the Third Reich. This is a very important work by a man who knows what he is talking about."},{"Title":"Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo","review":"After a few hundred pages, when your ability to read about another Balkans family and their plight begins to wane, Cohen presents some new detail in an individual life that forces you to refocus on how the war crushed people so much like Americans and so very European that the &quot;ancient hatreds&quot; argument becomes sickening. To read about a 16-year-old girl's Tom Cruise poster and her death by shelling is to realize how much the West failed.

(Every combination of religion was represented, by the way.) Mr. Cohen tells the truth. With Kosovo (what a surprise) starting up again, it is important that a writer of Cohen's abilities lead us back to the reality of the war in Bosna and Hercegovina.

The chapters are short and easy to understand and the exercises are well paced."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"It was strange to see the great Machen criticized by one reviewer as being behind the times when the reviewer himself didn't even spell Koine correctly! This should provide adequate warning as to the validity of this criticism of Machen. As well, merely because today's colleges and seminaries teach in a certain way is no indication of its superiority over Machen's, especially since today's education in general is also most demonstrably moving progressively more rapidly into a dark ages eclipse of illiteracy, though how thankful I am for the shining exceptions. Only a very few decades ago no one would have dreamed of considering one educated even to the bachelor's level without a proficiency in Latin and Greek and a foreign language or two, whereas today even Ph. D. professors can't communicate in, much less master English! How ironic that so many of them then turn 'round and criticize &quot;religion&quot; as a bastion for the ignorant! John Paul II's mastery of at least a dozen tongues rather, is typical of a true approach of wisdom in this arena. Inability to think in more than one language (or even in one language!) is really an inability to think at all about anything, at least not credibly, since ordinary children, even when little, are readily multilingual, mostly because of their blessed lack of adult pride and vanity so inhibiting to linguistic progress.Machen supposedly being a hero to Evangelicals (whatever that is and whoever they are!) is scarcely relevant for those of us rather more interested in stemming the manifest woeful ignorance in Christ's Church, and then reaching out to minister in wisdom, understanding and love to those around us as was the case for the Church in the previous dark ages.Of course such ignorance is as well related to the folly of the various styles of the antiscientific religion of Darwinism, so fantastically based on proven lack of evidence but as profoundly corrupting the thought processes throughout a culture so intimidated as to generally fail to challenge the ignorant and bigoted hegemony so entrenched in the halls of &quot;education&quot; and government. For multitudes of examples see works by Phillip E. Johnson &amp; Michael J. Behe.These comments in favor of Machen of course can in no way denigrate Mounce's manifestly invaluable scholarly work, however popularity is no valid measuring stick of a certain pedagogy's validity. Many tout the supposed superiority of the inductive approach to language (touted by most language tools today) versus the supposed exclusively deductive approach used by most language tools of yesteryear, including those of Machen and the great A. T. Robertson, but such thinking strangely fails to recognize the manifest inclusion of inductive method subsumed in the data under consideration by the deductive process. To turn the argument 'round, a form of the inductive method is as well popular in the notorious &quot;whole language&quot; absurdity in the &quot;teaching&quot; in today's government schools showing some of the limits of its usefulness. Indeed the incompetence resulting is well illustrated by the icons of illiteracy (pun intended) ubiquitously present on Windows and Macintosh computers!The important matter at hand for a true teacher is not to bow to the idol of making things easier for students, but rather greatly to encourage these greatly beloved children of God that they nobly and heroically may rise to the challenge of great strides of learning of which they are no doubt eminently capable, and for whom Machen can certainly provide more than adequate equipping."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I just received this book from the United Kingdom.

However, I also firmly believe that anyone who studies Machen in addition to Mounce, say, after completing Mounce, will greatly profit by it. ~ I have!I also believe that if someone is inclined to learn Greek solely by the traditional method, they would probably do best if they went with Machen.The exercises in the book are a real help, especially the English to Greek, which tends to force the student to think in Greek in a way the Mounce system does not.I don't think that I, nor anyone else, can find anything bad to say about the Machen grammar. It's the old school method, but as learner-friendly as the old school method can get, and as I mentioned, a great \\"second opinion\\" to one's studies in Mounce's introductory grammar.I myself purchased a used, out of print edition (really cheap!), on ebay, but other used outlets or private sellers are circulating them as well(Amazon Marketplace, for instance). So, I cannot really speak to this new (very pricey!) edition. My older edition had no answer key for its exercises, though, and I had to scavenge around for one.

I own other Greek grammars, but Machen's is really all I need. If you buy this--and I highly recommend it--get Thompson's workbook too. As a combination they can't be beat.

Gresham Machen's introduction to NT Greek is still used in Seminaries today. Here is his own comments about this book:&quot;My schedule as a teacher at Princeton was rather a heavy one, and I do not regret the fact. There were some advanced courses to keep me alive, and I also had the job of teaching elementary Greek. This latter was never mere drudgery to me, as it is to some men. I have notions about it different from those that often prevail, and after fifteen years' experience I embodied them in my little textbook, New Testament Greek for Beginners. A teacher of language, it seems to me, or the writer of an elementary textbook, should never yield to the temptation of displaying his philological learning--I myself was greatly helped in my resistance to this temptation by having so little philological learning to display--but should ruthlessly sacrifice everything else to the impartation of a reading knowledge of the language. Philological discussion is very interesting and very important, but it should come later. It is not learning, but often mere pedantry, to discuss the detailed history of a language that one cannot read. The more general observance of that principle might have delayed, even if it could not have prevented, the sad disfavor into which the classics have fallen in our day.&quot;"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I studied Greek for over five years, but when I think Greek, the image of Machen's little blue book always comes to mind.

The text is old-school, but thorough. If you can handle having paradigms tossed at you in an entirely businesslike manner, and you can get someone to explain the subtleties of participles, then this is text can be a fast introduction.A word of warning: Machen follows the classical tradition of teaching grammar by aphorism in the exercises at the end of each chapter. The exercises tend to reflect Machen's worldview: that of an embattled evangelical feeling marginalized in an increasingly modernistic denomination. Example: &quot;If you do not receive our testimony, you will not be saved.&quot;"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I have to voice agreement with those who praise this as the best introduction but I wonder how much of our love for the book is because it has sat on our desks for so many years and along with our Liddell and Scott is the first place we go to check something!"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"Today times are changing, and because of this I can only say that so is the way koina Greek is taught in seminaries and bible colleges. Machen represents a hero to evangelicalism of the past. However, I truly believe that his grammer is out of date. I think that the leading tool for teaching NT Greek is William Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. There are probably less than 10% of colleges and seminaries that even still use Machen. If we are going to make Greek more easier to comprehend and attain, then other sources than Machen's ought to be used"},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"Machen's book, though dated (c.1923) is still in use in leading theological seminaries and the text chosen by the Newark (NJ) School of Theology for its first and second year NT Greek courses. Machen is a no-nonsense, no frills, dead serious introductory text, but a student who has completed it will be able to read NT Greek. Each of the 33 lessons concludes with 20 Greek to English sentences and 16 English to Greek sentences to be translated. At the end of the first year of Machen, I discovered that Zodhiates (AMG Publishers, Chattanooga, TN) has published keys to these exercises, together with cassettes covering all 33 lessons, and a workbook with its own key booklet for each lesson. Gresham taught NT Greek at Princeton Theological Seminary in the early 20's and was a fundamentalist preacher there of considerable renown. I recommend Machen's text without reservation for serious students of NT Greek."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I am a Lutheran pastor. Forty years ago I used Machen as the first year text by which I learned New Testament Greek. Over the years, I have used this text to teach a few interested persons New Testament Greek one-on-one. I tried another text once, but its arrangement of subjects seemed out of place. For me, the great feature of Machen is the numerous exercise sentences at the end of each chapter. Too many first year texts provide the students with too few exercise sentences by which they can practice what they have learned.It is not really a book for self-study. But, with the help of a teacher who has studied New Testament Greek, it is simply the best book available after its nearly 80 years in print. That alone speaks much in its behalf."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"The long ago departed J. Gresham Machen provided the academic world with the standard text for teaching Koine (common) Greek, often called New Testament Greek. This book is extremely well done, and after viewing two three separate Greek texts, this is the most detailed. He covers all the rules in Greek such as declensions, Present Actives, Participles, aorists, imperfects, Perfect tenses, subjunctives, etc. His vocabulary section in the back is great for the student as a quick reference or study tool for memorization. Further, as another reviewer noted, one can practice what they have learned in each chapter with Greek to English and English to Greek exercises. This is more difficult book than Mounce's text if one was trying to learn Greek alone. With a minor in Greek, I suggests one seek a teacher or someone with at least two years of Greek if using a book to learn Greek anyway."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"Machen's New Testament Greek for Beginners is concise and clear in what it teaches. It is no-nonsense and gets right to the point of each individual lesson. The chapters are fed to the student in small &quot;bite-size&quot; portions that are easily digested - not too much info in one sitting. The real benefit of this grammar, however, is in the exercises at the end of each chapter. The student is taught one or two new grammatical concepts per chapter, and then is asked to apply those concepts through numerous translations - first from Greek to English and then from English to Greek. It is the second set of exercises (English to Greek) that really cements the points of the lesson in one's mind - for one could scramble through translating from the Greek if they had to, but taking the English and writing the equivalent in Greek takes a clearer understanding of the concepts.Another benefit of the excercises in Machen is the fact that the sentences to be translated are not directly from the Bible. I started out my trek through Koine Greek with Mounce's grammar. He does not have the student translate from English to Greek because he states (and I'm paraphrasing) that &quot;we're not learning to write, we're learning to read&quot;. In addition, all of the exercises were passages from the Bible. If, as in my case, you have studied the Bible before moving on to Greek, many of the exercises to be translated will be familiar to you. It seemed that I could make it through the translation after the first few words because I had heard the English many times. This did not help because I was not forced to work through each word or phrase individually (because I knew what it said before I got to that point). Machen makes up his own sentences, having to do with the vocabulary words learned up to that point. There is no such thing as translating, &quot;For God so loved the world...&quot; and then not having to complete the exercise because you happen to know the rest of the verse. While Mounce provides much more explanation in his chapters, you can't beat Machen for practical exercises.It should be noted that the style of Machen is more &quot;academic&quot;, while Mounce is more &quot;contemporary&quot;."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I spent two semesters in college going through this book in a Classroom setting and found this work entirely helpful for the understanding of New Testament Greek. The method by which Machen divided up his Chapters allows the student to begin understanding (and writing) Greek sentences after only a few lessons whereas some grammars will go over every single Noun Ending and Rule before moving on to the Verbs and it could be fifteen lessons before the Student is able to understand even a basic sentence.There are a few problems with the text and those are mainly involving the way in which he describes some of the more difficult concepts. Without a knowledgeable person explaining Participles to the student, the novice would be hard-pressed to understand the complexity of the Participle in Greek and would flounder through Machen's descriptions of them. If the solitary student is trying to brush up on his Greek or has already learned one or more languages then he or she will have a much easier time grasping the more difficult concepts because they would be used to going through a grammar and learning ideas about a foreign language.The Lexicon in the Back (with the principle parts) is also a very helpful tool for the beginning student so the student does not have to flip through every single lesson trying to find the definition of a word given previously while working on a later lesson.Once the student has completely finished using Machen's book he or she will be able to, armed with only this grammar and a Lexicon, tackle a significant majority of the passages in the New Testament. While there are obviously some more difficult passages in the New Testament (Hebrews, etc) that will be a struggle for the beginning student this work will provide him or her with a very solid foundation to work from and will be an invaluable tool for the rest of the student's time spent in Greek."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I took four years of high school Greek and we used this book all the way through. I am now taking Greek in College and we are using Croy's book: A Primer of Biblical Greek. After using Croy's book for two semester's, I can say that I prefer Machen. He is very thorough and yet very clear in his presentation of beginning concepts. Machen's dictionary in the back is also invaluable for the beginning student. It is truly a great work."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I have used this book as a classbook, to teach Greek, since the late 1980's. Just as important, it has been a concise, reliable, and lucid reference, far exceeding any other grammatical reference books in my entire library. I continue to add new Greek references and study books, but this is the one I keep coming back to."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I am partial to Machen because I first learned Greek with his book, but the more I use this text to teach Greek to others, the more impressed I become. The genius is the organization and the exercises. No grammar does a better job of systematically leading one through Greek and the exercises are wonderful at reenforcing the vocabulary and paradigms. This book is great for reviewing or refreshing Greek and is perfect for teaching children, again because of the exercises.Machen's writing style is succinct if not eliptical, and this is the polar opposite to Mounce's user-friendly, wordy text, but its nice that it is small and you don't need a separate workbook. I would recommend that you buy both Machen and Mounce. The only reason I give it four stars is that no grammar is perfect and you really need to work through several. Machen is also to be honored for defending the faith against liberalism and he belongs in every Greco-phile's library."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"I have to say I found this more challenging than the text we used in my seminary classes (Hewett), but it is worth it if you have the motivation. Work through the whole grammar and you can sight-read koine Greek. Its tough and its grammar, but you can see hints of why Machen's Greek courses at Princeton in the 20s were so popular with the students. He is passionate about the language, its importance and its beauty."},{"Title":"New Testament Greek for beginners,","review":"There are some modest problems with Machen's grammar, but age is not one of them. I learned with this grammar and I still use it to teach introductory Koine. It is not an accident that so many Greek teachers learned with this grammar -- it covers all the material needed to read the NT competently. I personally would like to see MI verbs covered earlier in the lessons but this is a small matter that can be corrected by the instructor if they are so inclined. The grammar is well thought out as well. Lessons that are heavy and require a lot of work are followed by lighter lessons so the student is not overwhelmed. The exercises, though not directly from the NT, cover the grammatical points of the lesson and help the student understand the rules of grammar.My greatest trouble with Machen's grammar is that it assumes the student is well versed in English grammar. Sadly, most university students do not know what a subjunctive mood is or a superlative adjective etc. I am constantly needing to explain Machen's definitions to my students because they do not have the basic instruction in English to comprehend the Greek. This is not so much a fault of Machen's grammar as a telltale sign that classical learning is not valued in public education. My second problem is his constant use of archaic pronouns. Again, this is not so much about Machen being an 'archaic' book but that when the grammar was written, the KJV was pretty much the only version used in the churches. Ye, thee, thou, etc. would have seemed a very reasonable and dignified way of translating pronouns. Now it just sounds silly (for most of us anyway). Again, this can be corrected by the instructor.All round, Machen is a good grammar that covers the material. It does not offer a magic pill solution to learning a foreign language. If you use Machen you will need to work; however, the pay off is knowing Greek well."},{"Title":"Twelve","review":"The premise is great, and the book moves smoothly, but it put me to sleep after a couple of pages every time I picked it up. It took five attempts to finish it. The story offers kids a valuable lesson in raising their awareness about the world around them.

She had read the 2previous ALice books and loved them, so I wasn't really worried about the books content. How bad could it be, when it was about a girl in the 5th grade? Well, watch out, because if your child isstill uncomfortable about the topic of sex (which mine happens to be, even after many heart to hearts when she has questions)this book is going to freak your child out. It may also freak out some parents.I don't suggest that people stay away from this book,because like the other Alice books we've read it is well writtenand fun in most ways.

I was surprised by the reviews, but EXTREMELY ENLIGHTENED when I started reading the books myself. In this book, Alice does ask her dad how the sperm and egg get together, and he gives a very blunt explanation, using all the proper terminology, over dinner. He even goes on to say where a man and woman do this-in bed. Alice herself finds it a bit overwhelming, thinking about her dad, her friends' parents, and even a favorite teacher at school, doing what her dad so clearly describes. Kids probably love the book because it very clearly tells them things their parents don't feel comfortable having them know at this age. For a reason. I know my daughter well enough to have a sense for what is \\"age appropriate information\\". We do talk about things and I answer her questions accordingly, but sometimes, too much information just creates more confusion. I've looked at later books in the series and topics of masturbation and oral sex, and \\"going all the way\\" are all included. It seems the author has an agenda...

You know how hard it is to relate that experience to someone who wasn't there. So, you just keep your past to yourself. After all it was a long time ago, and no one really cares anyway.Besides, most of the best war stories have already been told by people who weren't even there. They all seem to remember the gorey details of ambushes and attacks, and they all will admit to being scared, and how they survived by the grace of god and a fighting spirit they didn't know they possessed. These heroes can still smell the odor of burning flesh and remember with graphic detail the missing body parts of their best friends. What they can not ever seem to remember; was the unit they were assigned to, or the fire support base they lived in, let alone what Corps area they were fighting in.Al Severs book Xin Loi, Viet Nam gives all those &quot;wanna bees&quot; a true and graphic experience of what it was really like in a real unit, with real people, at real places during his tours in Viet Nam.And for all the real people out there who want to read how somebody else did the same things you did.

Sad to say, the plates are poor quality.A pot bellied James Bowie is shown wearing a fireman's red bib front shirt. Sorry, these didn't exist in 1836. Sam Houston is shown as a white haired old man. In truth, Houston was in his prime during the Texas War. Crockett is shown wearing some un-identifiable fur cap, possibly a skunk. This is another area of debate. Travis looks more like Laurence Harvey from John Wayne's film. The Mexian soldiers fare little better. At least they are not shown wearing sombreros. Hannon does a poor job depicting weapons and his research is careless. If you can ignore the plates, get this book for Haythornthwaites writing.

The Texas revolution started and ended with naval actions.The plates are atrocious, especially the ones in color depicting the Texans at the Alamo. Another reviewer covered this adequately. Travis is depicted striking a pompously heroic pose. Bowie looks drunk and his right arm is too short and stiff with a hand severely crippled by advanced osteoarthritis. Sam Houston is depicted in color as an elderly curmudgeon pushing 70 when, in fact, he was a relatively young man at the time, as shown in a black and white engraving of the period on page 7.Too much attention is devoted to the Mexicans.

The very brief siege ends with a Mexican assault that wipes out the defenders. Santa Ana would pursue General Sam Houston's small Texan army to a decisive engagment at San Jacinto.The book is packed with period illustrations, modern photographs, color plates of soldiers in uniform, and sketches of the Alamo as it existed in 1836.

Some of the details on Santa Anna's crudely-armed but well-led Mexican Army, modeled on Napoleon's Grande Armee are very useful as well. The color plates, though not as glorious as some of Osprey's better-known illustrators, are not as bad as a previous reviewer stated and suit their purpose of capturing the colors and details of the uniforms and weapons.Overall, like most men-at-arms titles this is primarily a good short reference book on uniforms and organization for the topic, but also provides an adult-level introduction to the war itself."},{"Title":"The Alamo and the War of Texan Independence 1835-36 (Men-At-Arms Series, 173)","review":"This book, in its few pages, gives an excellent overview of the events leading up to and during the War of Texas Independence.

For context, my original review appears below:I was disappointed with the \\"secrets\\" contained in this book. I'm only a beginner and it didn't really tell me anything I didn't know or couldn't figure out for myself. Some of the lame advice included \\"use hotkeys,\\" \\"listen for the audio clues,\\" and \\"use combined arms.\\" Section on Diplomacy was weak and it didn't really mention how to handle a game against several computer opponents which always tend to gang up on you.

For all you single players, it has extensive campaign walkthroughs.Not a single page of strategy? Lol! I own this strategy guide and Prima's, and this one is BY FAR better. There are only three explanations for the people who wrote those phony, one-star reviews; they are complete newbies, they have never played the game before and have no clue what they are talking about, or they are authors of a rival strategy guide.Need the best strats for AOK?

I sampled both AOK books, this one written by Ensemble and some Zone-famous AOE players, and the other one written by Mark Walker. The Ensemble book is by far the better book. It's thicker than any strat guide I've ever seen for starters. Plus it thoroughly covers multi and single player. The other book covers single player, but doesn't really have the depth of multiplayer tactics the Ensemble book offers.I have no idea what is up with all the troll reviews. I can only assume big Mark Walker fans.Get this book if you really want to enjoy AOK to its fullest."},{"Title":"Ensemble Studios Official Strategies & Secrets to Microsoft's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings","review":"AOK is a complex game, and you won't be able to get all its nuances without help. This is the help you need. By giving insight into the AI of various units, you come away with winning strategies during single-player action. Insight into the strenghts and weaknesses of each unit prove absolutely indispensible to network play. And the sections on the making of the game give anyone with even an inkling towards game design a better idea about the process of creating one of the most solidly playable games on the market.Most strategy guides are either rehashes of the obvious, or so incredibly detailed they take much of the fun out of playing. This one strikes the right balance by giving you detailed information about the capabilities of the various units and empires, while never asserting a &quot;proper&quot; way to employ that information.If you want to get maximum enjoyment out of your software purchase, this is the guide that will get you there."},{"Title":"Ensemble Studios Official Strategies & Secrets to Microsoft's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings","review":"Having played AOK for about a year (mainly against the computer - some online) I thought I was an OK player. I had strategies that worked for me most of the time and I could generally hold my own against any civilization up through the moderate level of difficulty.With this book, I learned three strategy tips the in the first several chapters that immediately made the game more enjoyable and my efforts much more effective against the bad guys.There are tips sprinkled throughout the book from players who don't work for Ensemble Studios but who are very successful players. These tips were generally helpful as well, and gave some insight into some unorthodox strategies at times.Shortcuts and hot keys are emphasized and highlighted throughout the chapters. This guide will definitely have you practicing the use of hot keys more than ever (if you don't already).There is considerable information related to multi-player games as well, such as how to complement your partner and how to know what opposing forces can lend each other in terms of help. I am not sure what the &quot;hard-core&quot; multiplayer readers who rated this book poorly are looking for, but it gave me great insight into being a better team player.The book does not go into the minute detail of what steps you should takein what order, in every game and every scenario. Certain AOK websites have taken this process to the level of art, and maybe that is what some people are looking for. The book does, however, provide insight into Ensemble's mindset in designing the game and also gives the average-above average player a great boost in terms of knowledge.If you want to be sure that you are employing as many time-saving tips and shortcuts as you can, and you want to hear what tactics are employed by outstanding players, buy this book. If you are a highly rated Zone player, or can smoke the computer on the Hard difficulty level or above, you probably do not need this guide anyway."},{"Title":"Ensemble Studios Official Strategies & Secrets to Microsoft's Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings","review":"This is the best Strat Guide for aok.

The author is well versed in theater as well as psychology and offers an interesting array of tools and techniques that are fun as well as useful."},{"Title":"Vermilion Gate: A Family Story of Communist China","review":"There is a good book somewhere inside these 800 pages, another inside view of family and political life and strife in the top echelons of Communist Chinese society. Mu's devoted parents had impeccable revolutionary credentials, and she grew up in a privileged Beijing enclave. She is able to give us a participant's view of the total dislocation of this world during the cultural revolution, during which both her parents fell foul of factional infighting and suffered prolonged harassment, including torture and imprisonment. Mu was caught up in the Red Guard movement, but also fell from favour with her peers. However she was eventually able to join the army, recruited as a reluctant opera singer, then trained as an army doctor. Later still she worked for the State Family Planning Commission, and made and escaped from a disastrous marriage. Her parents' marriage also could not survive the personal strain of events,and fell apart in a spectacularly public and vicious dispute, with public figures - and the press -- taking sides to influence the outcome. Although parts are fascinating, much of the book is written in a flat declarative style - is it limited English, or poor writing, the consequence of an education consisting largely of political indoctrination, suited to assertive slogans? While parts are quite compelling, and the detail may well be useful to genuine students of Chinese history, I wished the editors had helped the writer summarise her material and produce a book at least half the size."},{"Title":"Vermilion Gate: A Family Story of Communist China","review":"This book -- together with Gao Anhua's \\"To the Edge of the Sky\\", Jung Chang's \\"Wild Swans\\" and Nien Cheng's \\"Life and death in Shanghai\\" -- shows what Mao's China really looked from the inside, as opposed to an illusionary, idealistic Western narrative that by and large went unchallenged from 1949 until the nineties, and is still influential to this very day. Mu Aiping in particular, as well as Gao Anhua, describe in physically painful detail how the brutal destructiveness of Mao's rule lead to the most depressing result -- families destroying themselves by their own hand in the end, after having endured hardships that drove their members to insanity.Mu, Gao and Chang share three traits: They all were brought up by parents that joined Mao's cause early, they all struggled with what they allegorically perceived as God eating his followers, and they all settled in Great Britain marrying British husbands. In describing the atrocities, they also unwittingly show that they managed to get away with their bare lives only because, at critically important junctions, they were able to invoke old party friendships, gaining access to officials or intimidating their foes. It is left to the readers to guess the fate of those millions of ordinary Chinese that were left at the mercy of Mao because their families meant nothing to either the Red Guards or the purged Communist party elite alike.In 1949, Mao brought about an era that, in part, was a giant leap forward for China (think women's rights, or ending the warlord's feuds). However, his sadistic lust for destruction was playing itself out from the very beginning, and it was all-encompassing. He made China a madhouse for thirty years and longer. Mu Aiping, Gao Anhua, Nien Cheng and Jung Chang show the world what that meant. Think Beirut or Baghdad, albeit a hundred times worse.To sum up this reader's judgment: Anyone who, having read those books, still clings to the notion that China is longing for yet another upheaval in the coming two decades or so is dead wrong.And anyone who would still keep hanging a Warhol rendering of Mao's, even in the attic, does not have a human heart, period."},{"Title":"Vermilion Gate: A Family Story of Communist China","review":"This is a very compelling read for anyone interested in memoirs and/or history. I, for one, came away with a much different perspective of the Cultural Revolution than I learned in my university courses. Yes, it is long, a criticism from another reader, and yet its length is part of its strength. One wonders how many times history was going to repeat itself under Mao.While it is a book about the rise of communism and how the cultural revolution took hold of China, it is also a story about a man and woman, their children, and the horrible toll that corruption in politics played in their lives."},{"Title":"WebSphere Studio Application Developer 5.0","review":"I was looking for a book about WebSphere Studio Application Developer 5. I read this negative review of the reader and it was a concern. However, this is the only book completely dedicated to WSAD 5 and it's context looks good, so I decided to take a risk and buy. I am glad I did it.Yes, the book examples use DB2 7.1 and WSAD 5.0 and the corresponding software currently available for download - DB2 8.1 and WSAD 5.1. However, I found absolutely no problems installing them both following the book and installation instructions and then developing all book examples.For BD2 8.2, I did not find any differences except this small one - you no longer need to pre-set DB2 for Java 2 (it is already set for this by default). There are some screens differences between WSAD 5.0 and WSAD 5.1, but they are minor and easy to handle (IBM simply rearranged some screens - moving some fields between screens). When I was developing the book examples, these changes were easy to handle.By reading the book and developing its examples, I learn a lot about WSAD 5. The book's style is &quot;step-by-step&quot; with a lot of explanations - which is very helpful and easy to follow. In addition, the book covers some advanced topics that I was unable to find elsewhere.The author of this negative book review considers this book and all other books (he purchased) completely useless.

The way this book is constructed, it is a good manual, because it starts with relatively simple material, and gradually increases a complexity. Appendixes are also very valuable, because they demonstrate how to deploy just developed and unit tested J2EE applications into WebSphere server. The book is also a good reference material.Especially I value the Part Three about J2EE messaging. People, who are experienced with J2EE will find this material helpful to learn about J2EE JMS and concrete MQ implementation, and opposite, people, like myself, having many years of experience working with MQ, to grasp J2EE JMS implementation with MQ.About myself: I work with IBM and BEA Middleware products for about 6 years.

In my opinion, if you are anywhere from novice to advanced user,this book will be of great value as a resource and a reference.Some of the chapters I especially thought are very well done are the Workbench,Database, EJB development, XML development, Messaging and J2EE Deployment.I highly recommend this fine book!"},{"Title":"WebSphere Studio Application Developer 5.0","review":"It took me two weeks time to finish reading the first seven chapters of the book.

The worst part is you have to build the whole thing before you find out it wont run. I hesitate to continue reading on because I dont want to waste time with non-functional code examples.

I had origionally decided to buy this book because of the good comments, at first I wished to believe that this is so and that this book was a good book, but it is not.This book has far too many errors that deteriorate it from having any value. not to mention it is out of date. I have installed db2 8.2 and WSAD 5.1.2, they do work up to chapter 7. Thats when the book supposedly gets interesting. I dont believe the other comment writers got past this chapter, atleast not with the later software.The corrections page on apress website only show 10% of the actual errors that reside in this book. Again , they are misleading. Even worse, the corrections page is full of errors.The Ordering of the chapters is wrong, ch5 should have been divided into 6 and 7, ch3 should not even exist. The book really starts at chapter 6, which makes you wonder what was in the previous chapters.The author of this book I believe is only a deployer and not a programmer, he has many bad programming practices and knows little about the fundamentals of programming.I only give this book two star, I dont wish this book on my worst enemy.

Well, I wasn't disappointed. Because this is a mystery with a fine, surprising ending, let me just say that I enjoyed the voice of the hardened, divorced, booze-loving protagonist, Luis Montez, a solo practitioner who finds his old friends from El Movimiento - the Chicano political movement - dying all around him. Throw in a beautiful, mysterious Chicana and things really start hopping. This short, tight novel will keep you guessing until the last pages. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Ballad of Rocky Ruiz","review":"While taking place in about 1990, the plot has as its foundation in an 1970 murder. The characters are former campus activists who have left Texas to make their lives in Denver. 60's campus activism is difficult to portray in fiction. Not many try.The plot works, but almost everything associated with \\"Teresa\\" from her mother's attitude towards her seeing Luis to the way she went about her mission in Denver is pretty farfetched.I liked some of the peripheral scenes better than some of the main story scenes -for instance, the portraits of Luis Montez with his family, \\"the Shark\\" and the nuances of his disciplinary hearing.While neither is pivotal to the story, I would have liked a more development of Rocky (he successfully made the kind of changes which today are so embedded that how they happened is forgotten) and ... something of Teresa's birth father, whom I kept expecting to be one of the college activist group.All in all, this is a good light mystery, and for readers not part of the Chicano community, a brief acquaintance with it."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Like the others in the Beaumont series, this was a quick read. The plot was entertaining. Just when you thought you knew who the killer was there was another slight twist.

Beaumont, Jance weaves a spellbinding trail that keeps the reader on edge and suspecting almost all of the characters in the story at one point or another; just as you are absolutely sure you know who did it -- you discover it wasn't them! Keeps you moving to the very last chapter.One of the finest mystery writers today; a wonderful charcter (literally and figuratively) in Beaumont!"},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"First I must say in response to an earlier review, no the villian is not revealed early on! I don't know how she knew, but I didn't know until the very end! This was a good book and a fast pace read. I'm not usually a big mystery reader, but I really like Jance's style and most of all I like J.P. Beaumont. He is a great main character."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"This novel was an airplane read for me--a solid three hour flight plus a few moments at the hotel the next morning to finish it up. The plotting and characterization were solid, but not particularly novel. The &quot;extras&quot; added to the plot are in the main eccentric and interesting, as good mystery cameo players should be. Ms. Jance's protagonist was somewhat disappointing--a suitable sleuth, but some of the backstory just didn't work for me in this one. I'd pick up another Jance if I were in the airport and needed a good read, but I wouldn't go out of my way to locate the rest of this series. What do you get when you cross a dash of Christie, a dash of Hammett, a trace of Paretsky, and a lot of those modern &quot;suburbanesque&quot; detectives....something readable, certainly, but not quite a top flight mystery. If you need a good read, it's here, but it's a flawed work, and the villain is obvious from way too early in."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"Payment in Kind was the first J.A. Jance book I had ever read. It was mildly enjoyable and held my attention, although honestly there's not a whole lot to recommend it. The murder itself is interesting, but there aren't any clues given for the reader to follow for themselves; there is no way to figure out the murderer, and I suppose that when I read a mystery novel, I like for there to be clues scattered about that I may or may not pick up on. Having said that, the story moved on at a decent pace, and although the writing was a bit cheesy at times (Jance seems to be straining for a \\"noir\\" feeling here, although she never achieves it), the book is an easy and mindless read. I may pick up another Jance book in the future, but even if I don't, I'm not sure that I'm missing all that much."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"Beau has become quite a favorite of mine. I've been reading several of his exploits - not necessarily in order, but I like him, and I enjoy her characters and getting acquainted with Seattle."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"Payment in Kind is not one of the best novels in J. A. Jance's Beaumont mystery series, to my way of thinking. I can't quite put my finger on why this is the case, but perhaps it has something to do with hashing over a time in my life and in the history of this country I would just as soon forget. There is an element to the story involving the VietNam War and Canada's role as a refuge for draft dodgers and conscientious objectors. I, too, escaped involvement in that war, in my case because I was in graduate school and had a military deferment. At any rate, Beau is on the trail of the perpetrator of a double murder in a school setting. He is partnered with Paul Kramer, an unceasing self-promoter who unceasingly gets under Beau's skin. His journalist nemesis, Maxwell Cole, has an oddly sympathetic role in this series entry. His old partner Ron Peters, stuck in a desk job in Media Relations because of his injuries, is finally able to get on the road, with Beau's help, to offer assistance in the investigation. Beau continues to try to stay off the sauce and is going through the AA program involving a long sequence of 90 meetings in as many days. The formerly omnipresent MacNaughton's is nowhere to be seen in this entry. I still think readers of this mystery series will enjoy Payment in Kind and I recommend it to her more persistent fans. In the meantime, I am off to try on the next in the series, Without Due Process."},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"Any JP book is a good ...book.Are you kidding get this and all the others, I love JP Beaumount!"},{"Title":"Payment in Kind","review":"Another great novel by J.

Jance book is a winner in my library. I love her writing style and this book does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"Dale Carnegie, the self-help course guru, was a big admirer of Abraham Lincoln. He set out to write a quick and easy to read summation of Honest Abe's private life, and succeeded.Few people had as much to overcome as the 16th president of the United States. Born into grinding poverty, losing his mother at an early age and having a father who did not value education, it would be easy for young Abraham to give up on life and be a failure. He didn't.Tragedy seemed to follow Lincoln at every turn. The love of his life died before he could marry her. A business failed. His wife was an absoulte shrew. All but one of his sons died in childhood. Little wonder he was prone to depression!Yet out of this mire of melancholy arose one of the greatest men of all time. Lincoln realized taking on the institution of slavery would likely result in his death. He did it, anyway; it was the right thing to do. And he changed history forever.Reading this book gives one a renewed appreciation of a man with unprecedented courage who led this nation through the crisis of the Civil War. His personality -- the sparkling wit, practical jokes, great sense of humor, as well as the depths of despair and the long-suffering patience with which he endured his marital mismatch -- is ably summed up by the founder of the famed motivational seminars. This brief biography showing how Lincoln overcame so much difficulty to become one of our greatest presidents is an inspirational tale that will stay with you long after you read the last page."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"I came home to visit my mom for Christmas after my dad passed away. When I was a kid, I often saw this book on the shelf but never bothered to read it. Now I felt as if I wanted to read a book so I picked up this one off the old shelf.When I used to think about Lincoln in school he was a president who made a famous speech after Gettysburg and emancipated the slaves. But I had never known his real life and love. For example, I had not known that Mary Todd was the witch from hell and how Lincoln emerged from obscurity and became the Republican nominee at the 1860 Chicago convention by a series of coincidences. I had not known the humor of Lincoln, how he loved to tell funny stories and was a huge fan of Shakespeare. And despite what you might have already learned about Lincoln, would you have ever guessed he was one of the most despised men of his day (by the elitist Northern press) during his presidency? His policies were called a disaster - The war was lost - The worst president of all time - a very close re-election - and so forth.In short, this book is written masterfully and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"I recieved this book (which is \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" and \\"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living\\" in one edition) as a gift from a Dale Carnegie Instructor (Thanks again Ron!). This has been quite possible the greatest gift anyone has given me. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody. Reading this book will increase your confidence and your skills incredibly. Not reading it would be a punishment to yourself, and you deserve better."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"Not really a bad book; quite readable and containing even obscure facts not easily found in the most erudite of Lincoln biographical works. So what's the problem? To my thinking, there are two primary issues, the first of which is in my title. Carnegie loses his compass at some point and it becomes difficult to discern whether he is focused on \\"Lincoln the Unknown\\" or on his wife (whom everybody generally acknowledges was not a run of the mill first lady). Her eccentricities are intertwined throughout the book, and the author does not necessarily make a case as to how these effect the life and presidency of her illustrious husband. Carnegie even wraps the work up with a summary of her life after Father Abraham, which hardly led her to a Promised Land.Secondly, my impression is that Carnegie has an intense admiration for the character of Lincoln (and what politically and historically savvy person doesn't?). The problem as I see it is that his judgment on Lincoln's life is clouded by his idolatry. Lincoln's flaws(and they are many, and sometimes major) are glossied over in a work that is less narrative than tributary.This said, I still think it is a good piece for every beginner to start with, and I plan on passing it on to my students."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"The book is all about the life and struggles of Abe Lincoln, on how he led a life of poverty to presidency. The book goes into not the history of the time but the relationships he created to the common everyday person he dealt with. I read the book and just devoured it. For people many times just see the person and not the struggles that created that persona for who we know and well loved."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"Best book I have ever read on Pres.

Lincoln's poverty-stricken childhood, his lackluster days as a lawyer, his love of poetry, his political career - it's all covered in great detail and conveyed in a very appealing and straightforward style. Carnegie's research and dedication towards this book are deservedly well-applauded. The story of how this very mortal man became so admired, so loved, and such an American icon is simply priceless.

THE BOOK IS A TESTAMENT TO LIVING WITH INTEGRITY."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"No need to have an interest in Lincoln to read and love this book. I surely wasn't interested in Lincoln when I read it. This book is perfect for anyone, from any background, with any perspective (business, investing, leadership, life, history, family, Dale Carnegie, and much more). I'm personally interested in business and investing, yet I loved this book.Whenever I'm nervous about the future of the US, I just read this book, then imagine living during the civil war and imagine where we are today. Nobody then could have imagined where the US would be 150 years later, just like we can't imagine where things will be in another 150 years. It's a reminder of how important faith is. Faith in people, society, and out future. To be pessimistic of our future is to not have faith in todays youth. They are hungry to put their their own mark on the world and do better than previous generations, just as their kids will also do one day. For me, the book was a reminder to be optimistic about investing for the long term.The other aspect I loved, was the human interaction perspective Dale gives the book. It's almost a continuation of his book How to Win Friends and Influence People, except only focused on a master of human interaction - Lincoln. Also, I didn't realize how much Lincoln failed. He failed at politics, business, and more. He spent 14 years, even while in congress, paying back debt from a failed grocery store. He set up a lecture once and no one attended. He failed to get elected a number of times. However, he remained committed to doing good. It's a true underdog story that is inspirational and uplifing.I cannot recommend this book enough. This is one of the few books that has potential to change your life."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"This is my most favorite book of all.

It was such an incredibley good read that I purchased a copy for my son! A +++++++++"},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"Dale Carnegie is famous for his books and classes on self-improvement, and no doubt he was the early master of what has now become an industry in its own. Some of Carnegie's methods are based on his close studies of Abraham Lincoln, whom he admired, and who emerged from the most modest origins imaginable at the time to become President of the United States, something that was usually reserved for people from renowned, wealthy and educated families.Carnegies focus was not so much on political impact or wartime strategy, but on Lincoln's private life and character. Therefore, his book can't be measured by scientific standards and would not necessarily be included in \\"serious\\" bibliographies. But it provides a unique insight on many aspects of this fascinating man, and it is as well a sometimes stunning picture of the time. The description of his election campaign just leave us speechless about how long a way the U.S. have gone, and how small and limited the financial frame of the time was.Doing the research for his book back in the 1910s and 20ies, Carnegie found many traces of Lincoln gone today, and he still met people who had known Lincoln personally. So, we get to know a lot of anecdotes that sum up to a colourful and sometimes unbelievable description of Lincoln and his time.But after all, this is a Carnegie book with his typical language from the 193ies, entertaining and lively, never boring. It was published in 1932, when the term \\"negro\\" was obviously not considered to be offensive, allthough it makes us swallow today reading it. Carnegie admits frankly that Lincoln himself was willing to stick to slavery to save the Union, and turned anti-slavery to win the war. He also reveals in many details that Lincoln's marriage must have been an ordeal to him, and you can almost see Carnegie shaking his head about Lincoln's wife all the time."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"This is the best book on Lincoln I have ever read. A true joy to read."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"I agree with Oceandweller who said he/she wished this book were still in print so he/she could send a copy to all his/her friends. This book is terrific right from page one until the very end. I bought this book used, I forget how much I paid. Whatever I paid, it was worth it. It's not often in one's lifetime that one comes across a book like this, both educational and entertaining. Dale Carnegie pulls you right into the story from the very first page and you just can't extricate yourself from then on until the book ends. Not only was the story so interesting, but Lincoln comes across as the wisest of men. \\"With malice towards none and charity for all...\\" these, his words, keep echoing in my mind. Though he fought the civil war, a terribly bloody war, he did this to save this great nation. His words and his sentiment must be what is meant by 'love your enemies'(St Luke 6:27). Lincoln had no church; he said, \\"When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion\\". But through his life he exemplies the best which man can aspire to. After reading this book, for me Lincoln stands head and shoulders above all the greatest men of whom I know something (there may be others like him but I haven't met or read about them). This book should be required reading in all the high schools - in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"I first read this book in early 1994. It left a lasting impression on me. The account of Abraham Lincoln's life is remarkably written by Dale Carnegie. This is not the story about the Lincoln that we learned about in school. Lincoln used his life struggles and applied them to his life to make him one of the greatest Presidents. Mr. Carnegie goes deep into the background to bring us a story of a young man and the trials that he went through to get to the White House. We can see the problems that Lincoln had while in the office of President. It would be hard to imagine what this country would be like if Lincoln had not been President because his foresight about this country and what he wanted to accomplish was remarkable. For example, the conflicts with staff and generals of the armies made Lincoln sometimes judge himself harshly. This book should be read by anyone who has an interest in Political Science or just wants to know more about the President. This is a very interesting book that I found hard to put down. I have read this many times and I cherish each moment that I spend reading the book."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"This is a thoroughly engrossing book. I could not put it down after finding it in my grandmother's collection of old books. It inspired me to become a better person and to strive for perfection and integrity in everything that I do. This book talks about the Lincoln that we were not taught about in history classes. I was impressed with the fact that Lincoln totally despised slavery. Especially after witnessing the treatment of a mulatto slave girl on the auction block by prospective buyers. His triumphs and failures make him seem much more human. Not only was he a great President, but a great human being as well. It illustrates the fact that the only true measure of real success is the ability to endure pain. If you can get your hands on this book, it is a must read."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"All I can say is, if you really want to get most out of your life, and wish to be able to tell your friends and family you had a great life at your last day, you should read this book."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"A lost love he mourned for his whole life, an extremely difficult wife, endless attempts to undermine his authority, constant personal sorrow - who knew? This book helped me understand and admire Lincoln the man, versus Lincoln the President. They are both likable characters."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"Mr. Carnegie did a fantastic job in providing a wonderful survey of Abraham Lincoln. President Lincoln had such depth of character, gained through the many trials of his life. Mr. Carnegie provided so many rich details about Lincoln and communicated them in his typical breezy fashion. The book was written for &quot;the average hurried citizen&quot; in 1932. The style is superb for even today's reader (in 1999). This is an excellent biography of one of history's greatest figures. The reader is treated to the experiences and people who formed Lincoln's thinking, to his enemies and friends, and to the millions of citizens who have been affected by his leadership in the past 135+years."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"The storytellers of other nations and cultures have to manufacture myths to give themselves heroes. Americans don't have to. Abraham Lincoln is inspiring because of his greatness, yet he is inspiring also because of his human frailties, which make his monumental achievements all the more fantastic. This book is a labor of love by Mr. Carnegie about his hero; it's his way of making his hero available to us all. I love particularly the introduction in which Mr. Carnegie tells his reasons for writing the book and his method of composing it. This is one of the best books I've ever read. All the wisdom and insight Mr. Carnegie ever collected in his \\"how to\\" books can be found more poignantly and abundantly here, because Lincoln exemplified everything that Mr. Carnegie ever taught. This book is what will keep Mr. Carnegie's name alive, long after his institute has folded and his \\"how to\\" books have gone out of print. In this book Mr. Carnegie captures the living reality of Lincoln: his wisdom, his virtues, his beautiful and unfettered English prose, his perserverance, his commitment to justice and liberty, his keen understanding of the paradoxical condition of mankind, his deep reverence, and his abiding love.This book also demonstrates that heroes don't just descend from Olympic heights to awe mankind with superhuman prowess; they are regular folks who face troubles, pains, and long-odds like the rest of us; but when most people act out of self-concern and a desire for ease and convenience, true heroes do what is RIGHT, in spite of the cost to themselves and the apparent futility of the task at hand. Lincoln was such a hero."},{"Title":"Lincoln, the unknown","review":"If you don't know anything about Lincoln this book is for you!The author, Carnegie, was enthralled with Lincoln and by the end of the book you will be too.The book does an excellent job portraying who Loncoln was from childhood to adult to Presidency.

How could any child, young or old, not be coaxed into the beauty of the Tempest story through such tactile painting?"},{"Title":"The Tempest","review":"The illustrations in this adaptation of Shakespeare's The Tempest are exquisite, a magical realism that tells the tale in simple terms: Prospero, the former Duke of Milan, and his baby daughter, Miranda, are abducted and cast upon the open sea in a boat. Thanks to a loyal friend, a bundle of provisions and books on the magic arts are secreted on the craft; Prospero is thereby able to guide the small boat to an island, where he makes a home for himself and his daughter. Twelve years later, Miranda is a young woman, Prospero determined to seek revenge on those who have wronged him. Indeed, as the perpetrators sail near the island, a terrible storm arises, crashing the vessel against the cliffs, Alonso, the King of Naples, his son and Prospero's brother, Antonio, surely doomed to a watery grave.Miranda begs her father to summon his spells and save the ship and its occupants. To the tender-hearted girl's surprise, Prospero admits that he has caused the tempest, bringing those who have harmed them into close proximity. As Prospero takes counsel from his magic sprites, Ariel, the wind spirit, Caliban and others, all on the vessel are saved, but separated \\"and the ship, though safe and sound upon the beach, is made invisible\\". As planned, Prospero brings his daughter and Prince Ferdinand together, keeping the others at bay while Miranda and her prince fall in love. Through the intervention of his spirits, Prospero orchestrates his revenge, which ends in forgiveness of his brother and the King and the happy marriage of his daughter and Prince Ferdinand. Prospero's lands are restored and his sprites released as father and daughter return to the place of their birth.The text is highlighted in parchment-like squares against the jewel-toned colors of Prospero's island, the deep green of the forest, the azure sky, the sapphire sea. Fairies mix with characters in this enchanted landscape, as Prospero resolves his fate and that of his daughter to everyone's advantage. Shakespeare's fascinating tale is written in a manner that appeals to young imaginations, balancing tragedy and humor, cameo illustrations sprinkled throughout the pages, a rich canvas of foibles and fancies in a world where people and fantasy coexist. This is the perfect pairing of author and illustrator, a book to delight children and adults alike.

I bought this book directly from the author at a local book festival, and on the surface the story concept seemed interesting to me. Unfortunately, the author's writing style is so rudimentary that it was very hard to read. I'm not sure who edited the final version of the book, but they did a very bad job. The timelines were inconsistent. They were supposed to be around 13 years old, and since Dustin's father was in the Gulf War, that means it's at least the 1990's, if not present day (the exact year was not made clear). If that's true, then how is it possible for Tao to be born in 1898, as his reading about his future indicates? Also, if the age is correct, it's not possible for Dustin to be 35 in 2010, as his reading indicates. These types of inconsistencies really ruin the story.The author is overdescriptive in places where it's unnecessary, which weighs down the story. He also cuts things short where there needs to be more. Some of the grammatical errors made it really hard to follow the narrative in many places. I will also say that there are parts that sounded, well, cheesy. The concept is still a good one, but I think the book needs to be reedited and rewritten in many places.If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time on this one. I'm sorry that I did."},{"Title":"The Storyteller","review":"If you don't understand the concept of space time continuum there is no way you'll get the concept of this book, but for those of us who do, I must say this is an interesting take on story writing as well as a good way to tell of the separate lives of the characters. I found the styles of the three different stories in this book very interesting because I've never read a book with such differing tales in one volume before.This was a very easy to read book and just all around entertaining. I think Erik did a good job with it. I would classify The Storyteller a YA piece with some very good mysterious qualities. I love a good mystery, why not three in the same book?J.

This book is so interesting to me. I read that it is this authors first work, and I can't wait for his next book in the series. My favorite story is about Tao and his advantures in the pyramids. Having visited Egypt some years ago, this book brought me back to that time, and I was enveloped in fantasic memories. Thank you for your inspiration Mr. Ekstrom and please get the next book out soon. My book club is already reading The Storyteller, and are yearning for more."},{"Title":"The Storyteller","review":"It has been quite some time since I have read a book of fiction. It is a trilogy of three children curious about their futures. Simple enough. The intriguing part of the whole story is that once you start reading each segment you almost forget the carnival, the tent and the children themselves. I really got lost in the moment of the characters. You ask yourself alot of questions \\"Who is this man Natas? I found myself looking for more at the end of the book. My favorite story is the third story, \\"The Worlds End\\". You can actually picture yourself underground in that bunker. Scary thought that this story brings to light how real it all can be. I will definitely be looking for more from this author. Also it is a book that I would recommend to the young adult crowd. My daughter is reading it and loves it already!!"},{"Title":"The Storyteller","review":"This book is so detailed and it brings you something new. Finally , not the same hum drum same old stuff that sits on the shelves. Pick up a copy today!"},{"Title":"The Storyteller","review":"I was looking around for a gardening book of all things at barnes and noble, and came across a copy of \\"The Storyteller\\". I picked it up and read the back and thought it may be interesting. As I sat at the cafe and had my coffee I began to thumb through it. I was there all afternoon and completed the book. All I can say is that I understand where the characters are going. I read some of the reviews on here and all but one I agreed with. This Imabookworm person didn't understand the concept. The fortune teller gave out past and future lives of these children. It wasn't a concept that Ima understood. Maybe you should read some more books. I also see from the reviews that this author will be putting out some more books in the series. I can't wait to see it. To all of those movie and TV producers out there, pick it up, run with it and don't look back. This is a winner for sure. It is fresh and beats the hell out of reality TV. That type of show needs to go and a show like the Storyteller needs to be on!! I reccommend this book to teens and adults alike. Forget Harry Potter, this is the new age of storytelling!!"},{"Title":"Appreciate Me Now and Avoid the Rush, Yet More Brilliant Thoughts","review":"This author is one of a kind: intelligent, understated, thoughtful, unique, inspired.

Certainly the best text for self-study. The problems are not too difficult yet they help you grasp concepts as well. They are also laid out as you go; so every so often while you read the text you encounter a problem and you do it as you go. It is much better than putting them in the back of the chapters, as most text do. It is better to lay the problems in the text so you are encouraged to do them as you learn the material. The material in the text is very well explained and contrary to the previous review, is very well-suited, and with sufficient rigor, for mathematics students. The fact that this book \\"can be grasped at the sophomore level\\" as the previous revewer claims (and I agree with) lends credence to the simplicity of presentation of the material. Some reviewers I suppose aren't satisfied unless they see a hyperdense conglomeration of gobbledygook which characterizes so many mathematics texts. I don't fall into that camp and if you don't either and at the same want to begin study in topology then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Topology of Surfaces","review":"I must say that this is by far the best topology text that I have seen. Very readable, easy to follow. The anecdotal comments are also amusing. I'm particularly fond of the Ham and Cheese Sandwich Theorem! Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Topology of Surfaces","review":"This is a very readable introduction to homology theory, replete with good illustrations and lucid writing. Kinsey does a great job of motivating and explaining her material. I only wish I could have had a text this readable when I was a student."},{"Title":"Topology of Surfaces","review":"Let me begin by saying that I only got through the chapter on triangulations. I used this book in an undergraduate topology course where the instructor was not the best at teaching topology. So, I had to self-study with this book.The first three chapters of the book are very well written. The theorems are proven in an intuitive manner that makes sense with some analysis background. Also, the exercises encourage, and at times force, the reader to really understand the topologies of the reals. The reader then is introduced to general topological spaces, including quotient and product topologies. This material is also very well written and relatively easy to understand, with some work by the reader.The chapter on triangulations and surfaces is very difficult to understand. In the first few chapters, I could tell that the casual language chosen by the author would eventually lead to trouble. The careful word choices necessary in a math book were missing in this chapter. Little details like \\"relative to\\" and \\"in\\" are left out, sometimes requiring hours of careful reading of definitions trying to figure out exactly what the author means. This, to me, in unacceptable. The book reads more like lecture notes and less like a text book. Fortunately, I also purchased Munkres' topology book and referred to that whenever I didn't understand the author's explanation, which was a lot in the last chapter I studied.Taking into account all the deficiencies with this book, I would still recommend it just for the first 3 chapters. These chapters are an excelent introduction to topology. I give this book 4 stars because it offers a good introduction to general topology. I also liked how the author put the exercises in the sections. This made it easy to see exactly what you should try to use in your proofs. I would also getting another, more theoretical, book to use as a reference if(when?) you get stuck by the author's poor choice of words."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"This book was perfect for me.A few years back I unfortunately had my gallbladder surgically removed before I knew about liver and gallbladder flushing.I flush very often now and am fully vegan. I have also learned how to pay attention to my bodies signals.This book describes in great detail the role of the liver, gallbladder, and other vital organs; how to cleanse them, and how to keep them in optimum health.It also has a detailed list of physical signs of organ dysfunction, and what organs the signs are connected to.I have passed many stones with the help of this book. I have learned many new (and very valuable) things about the human body that surprised me.I have more energy, better sleep.. I have also lost excess weight, received better clarity, and improved digestion and body functions. I also appear younger and more vibrant.You won't be disappointed with this book. =)"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"As a family we had done liver flush with a different method before coming against this book, and that method comsumes a total day but is really very tiresome on the body. When I found this book and read it, I decided immediately that I would try it. It is not a difficult method and best of all it works. My mom was getting sick all the time and once she could not even get out of the bed because she had severe stomach issues and she was showing the symptoms of a very bad cold. Nearly half of her eyes were ringed with smoky white color. She started the process and even after the first one she showed a great deal of progress. She was finding very difficult to do houseworks before the cleansing but she is way much better now. The smoky ring is gone completely. I also feel the positive effects of the flush on my activities and well being.I see many comments done by people who like to think that they know everything Mr Moritz share with us is misleading and he is pulling us in the wrong direction. This approach to the unknown or unexperienced is something I really cannot understand. Even today many \\"scientific minds\\" are standing against acupuncture, blaiming it to be sham. But does it work? Yes... I has been working for thousands of years. So why do people first tend to paint an alternative view as black? Well I hope that they try first the methods mentioned in his books then write their comments....I cannot say I read his every book. I read the liver flush books and sun light theraphy related one. I had severe allergy against sunlight, so much so that without sunglasses in a sunny day, I had many times did not notice big things before me such as traffic light (the big pipes, you know) or electricity related ones before coming nose to nose with them :) I tried the sunlight theraphy, it took some time like two months, but now I don't need to wear sunglasses to be able to walk in the sun. Most of the time I forget to take my sunglasses with me. A huge improvement for me.I told the liver flush method to a friend and she started doing it as well, against the mockery of her husband and sister-in-law. But in her second cleansing, her sister-in-law wanted to see what she discarded from her body. She told me that her sister-in-law told her to not to stop doing whatever she was doing, that she did not understand how this was possible but yes the things that got out of her body were pure and simple, not-modified or chemically nor shapewise changed gallbladder stones. By the way, she is a doctor. So I belive she knows her stuff.Anyway, I am quite happy that Mr Moritz shared with us his studies. As I said, I did not read all his books, so I don't know all his beliefs, but what I have read and applied worked for me and my family and friends...."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I have done about 8 flushes so far & passed several hundreds of stones each time, until the last one. You can actually notice the stones getting smaller with each cleanse. On the second & third cleanse, I passed out some stones almost the size of a quarter. Most of my chronic symptoms have disappeared and I have finally regained my health. I marvel at how many pounds of crap I have been carrying around in my liver all these years. My friends AND family have seen what a difference this has made to my health & have started doing the flush as well. That is 9 more healthy people!One of my friends was diagnosed with Gallstones & was scheduled for surgery in one month. For years, she suffered with stomach & back pains from gallstones. I convinced her to do the flush while waiting for surgery. I heard every excuse for why not to do it - what if it does not work, what if the stones get caught, etc, etc. Finally, she did it twice in that month & was able to completely recover without her surgery & no more pains!This is one of the best values for time & money. Your life may be slightly inconvenienced staying vegetarian on the cleanse, but at least you can still eat. You have just one day of any 'discomfort' to put up with. Not prohibitively expensive or difficult to do. The overall benefits & simplicity far outweigh any of the minor inconveniences. All it really requires is a strong commitment to make the time to do it & to follow the recommendations.Andreas Moritz has the best advise in the 'medical' field I have found on healing chronic conditions and the central role and importance of the liver!!! This is Cleansing & Healing at its best."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"My wife and myself found out about Andreas Moritz's work just 3 months ago, we applied the liver cleansing immediately with the expected results, offered the book in French and Greek to several friends, spread the word everywhere and read all his other books. However, it has been above all a life-transformation experience that continues and not just an operation of getting rid of liver stones.Friends in Greece talked to us over the phone about their peculiar experience, I started googling and 3 days later we received medical results requiring an important detoxination for both of us! We were given the method before the problem had appeared in front of us! Immediate application with the expected results, keeping track of hundreds of stones, knowing that it will be a regular exercise (3 flashes since then). Verification of the advice for a thorough colon cleansing afterwards as there were a few dozen of stones left there. We had followed in the past the complete 4-year courses of naturopathy in Paris, by passion - me being a physicist and engineer by education and profession - and it is amazing and sad for us that we were ignorant about it, wasting years of our health capital. The hydrotherapist, an MD herself, had heard about A. Moritz and was finally convinced to buy the book and apply it to herself. Same scenario with our family doctor who only vaguely knew about liver stones. Thank you whole heartly Andreas for being there. I urge you to buy as a reference the big, 500-page opus \\"Timely secrets of Health and Rejuvenation\\". It will really transform your life and motivate you towards more progress.Moreover, this experience was proven to become just the beginning for much more. Reading A. Moritz' all other books and talking to him on the phone, we discovered that he masters all other dimensions of a human being: psychological, energetic, spiritual. A warrantee that the synthesis one can draw from all that can be closer to the truth, as opposed to a patchwork of theories from different sources. Having ourselves studied and experienced thoroughly Dr Hamer's discoveries on the psyche-brain-body accurate relationships, also acknowledged by Andreas, we can only agree with his entire and innovative argumentation on the need to abandon the fear of cancer - or other important \\"diseases\\". One will revolutionize the vision of cancer and other important manifestations of our imbalance by studying the excellent \\"Cancer is not a disease\\".It is though the special books \\"Veil of Duality\\" and \\"It is time to come alive\\" where we discovered an Andreas seemingly far away from the liver cleansing method. Two inspiring books at the spiritual realm, being a condensation of innovative arguments of teachings one can only partly find by reading several sources. A strong insight of the real reasons of our psychological imbalances, which are the sources of our physical attitudes and problems and which may create ...the famous liver stones. A clear invitation to go back to the basics, to the real source, to ourselves, all by cleansing in parallel whatever is necessary.Our gratitude is extended by our wish for a great deal of energy to Andreas so that he could continue along this path for the benefit of us all.Ioannis - Annie AnastasiouBrussels"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"This book is excellent. The flush really works and it is so easy. Unlike lots of other cleanses - for colon, or candida etc, the liver cleanse isn't painful, no starving or going without. It is simple and VERY effective.

I have done a LOT of research on this subject and have read a lot of pros and cons about the liver flush but I have tried my first one and got results!!! I highly recommend this book.

He has compiled the comprehensive detailed account of how to keep clean inside and out. You should buy his book\\"Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation\\" and carry under your arm forever.This is the book that new parents should be given when they give birth. This is a manual to stay out of the drug surgery trap. He does not purport to know it all, he simple reports to you what he has learned from great teachers. Everyone knows that the United States is not for the people, by the people and of the people anymore. it is for profit only. There is zero incentive for our Medical Doctor's to keep you healthy. Furthermore there is zero incentive for Andreas to keep you healthy too. But, Andreas Moritz wants to keep you healthy and doesn't have billions of dollars as an incentive. Sure he makes a few bucks, but look what he risks. How would you like our ratty cartel government, The AMA, the American Money Association, and greedy Medical Doctor's after you?Some men and women actually want to help each other still and he is definitely a kind soul that still has the courage to do it.Support him because if you don't there is more at risk than you can fathom.Buy his books. They are life transforming!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I looked into this book on recommendation from my doctor. Even though I feel I am in relatively good shape, over the past three years I felt a decline in my energy. I have done 17 of these cleanses so far in about two years and I cannot tell you the difference this has made in my energy levels. Suffering from hypothyroidism ( which I'm in the process of reversing)it was getting tougher to get the energy to do all the things that I like to do ( Im now 41). I feel as if I am in my mid twenties now, and its amazing how I don't need to rely on coffee anymore! I now do cleanses about once every three months as a routine maintenance. The first few were tough to do, but they got easier to do as I went along. You do pass stones. You do see them. You do get a massive energy rush that lasts longer each time you do another cleanse. PLEASE do NOT listen to ANYONE that tells you this is a hoax. If you truly value your health, you will at LEAST look into this and don't let ANYONE who HASN'T done this cleanse tell you its garbage.IT REALLY WORKS!! Dr. Moritz does know what he is talking about!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"FIrst of all, I need to say that I am not skeptical in my belief that this flush works. I have basically memorized this book, and recommended it to a lot of my clients, all who have had success with it. I just finished my fifth cleanse as of this writing, and absolutely no stones have come out in the toilet, or during the post colonic!!! I am a very healthy 49 year old woman, with some minor but long standing health complaints. I was so hopeful to get some relief with this, and it has been extremely disappointing. You are probably thinking, \\"she didn't follow the cleanse to the letter?\\" Not true, I did it per his instructions to the letter. I even did the kidney cleanse , as he recommends that you should do that every 3 cleanses or so. Still no difference. I took Chanca Piedra drops and that did nothing as well. My colon is not toxic or blocked up, I eat an extremely clean diet, and don't drink or take drugs. I did the cleanses about every 4-6 weeks. I tried to contact Andreas Moritz, but he is impossible to get a hold of, even on the blog sites. My colon hydrotherapist is stumped, as she has never seen anyone not get results with this cleanse. SHe is also a cleanse coach, and knows quite a bit about this. There is one testimonial in his book written by a woman who did not start getting stones out until her third cleanse, due to densely structured bile ducts in the liver and gall bladder. I thought by the fourth one, I would for sure start to see a difference, but to no avail. None of my symptoms have gone away, and in fact I have developed an annoyingly new one. For those of you familiar with Chinese Medicine, you will understand. DIagnosis is done with the tongue and pulses, My tongue which never had looked red, is so red at the tip. My herbalist says it is heat from the liver, and the kidneys not being able to handle it, so I get this burning feeling in my bladder that feels like a bladder infection. Never had this before I started these flushes. My liver is doing something, but not what it should! The cleanse created a lot of heat in my liver that was not there before. Thank God I am taking herbs for that, but it is costly and painful. I am very disappointed that no one seems to know what the heck is going on. He really should have a means to deal with \\"problem cases\\" I doubt that I don't have stones. At this point, I am not sure that I will continue the flushes, as it really puts my body through the wringer, and is so disappointing when I have nothing to show for it except increasing symptoms."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush provides a step by step regime to rid the liver and gallbladder of stones with truely amazing results....As a natural therapist I know the immense importance of optimal liver function for good health.

That said, flushing can cause electrolyte imbalances, so use large amounts of seaweed, especially in the form of KELP AND DULSE... The day before each flush I take one TABLESPOON OF BOTH OF THESE every hour...then I flush my liver the next day.

I finally borrowed it from the library. I'm sure glad I did and didn't waste the money. I'd suggest you borrow it, too. What a hoax. Just the thought of apple juice, Epsom salt, virgin olive oil and fresh orange juice makes me sick.There are so many DISCLAIMERS in this book, let alone he has no medical background. Takes six days to prepare and drink specific concoctions, then the night you're ready to do this (at 10pm exactly) he says \\"stand next to your bed, drink the concoction\\", holding nostrils he suggests, and \\"don't take longer than 5 minutes to drink it down.\\" Then he says \\"LIE DOWN STRAIGHT AWAY! and lie perfectly still and do not talk for 20 minutes\\".Please allow me to share the \\"IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY\\" part to you: \\"... it is likely that, on their way out, some gallstones will be caught in the colon. They can quickly be removed through colonic irrigation. This should ideally be done on the 2nd or 3rd day after the liver flush. If gallstones remain in the colon, they can cause irritation, infection, headaches and abdominal discomfort, thyroid problems, etc. These stones can eventually become a source of toxemia in the body. If colonics are not available where you live, you can take a coffee enema followed by a water enema. This, however, does NOT guarantee that all the remaining stones will be removed. There is no real substitute for colonic irrigation with regard to liver flushing. Doing a colema-board enema, though, is the closest you can have to a professional colonic. If you settle for anything less than a colonic irrigation or colema enema, mix one level teaspoon of Epsom salts with one glass of warm water and drink it first thing in the morning on the day of any other chosen colon cleanse following the liver flush. On the importance of colon and kidney cleansing: Although the liver flush on its own can produce truly amazing results, it should ideally be done FOLLOWING a colon and kidney cleanse. Cleansing the colon ensures that the expelled gallstones are easily removed from the large intestine. There should be a kidney cleanse some time after the first 2-4 liver flushes, and then again after your liver has been completely cleaned out. And my favorite quote \\"if at any time during the night you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, do so\\".ARE YOU KIDDING ME? What choice do we have. I laughed out loud many times throughout the book and shared it with others. If you're looking for some humor, BORROW this book from your library. As a matter of fact, I live in a HUGE metropolitan city in Florida, and NO LIBRARY within 500 miles stocked it. They had to borrow it from Rowan Public Library in North Carolina. Please save your money. I gave it two stars for the humor aspect."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"My problem was basically a little too much fatty food and a little too much liquour. So I got this book (from Moritz's site), and the procedure looked fairly simple. It's been simpler than I thought!As preparation, a colon cleanse with only epsom salts (one of the methods Moritz recommends), then five days with a lot of apple juice (while eating normally). On the flush day (yesterday), some epsom salts, and the orange/lime/olive-oil concoction. That's about it.Today, I see I've passed about a hundred little green things. I have a friend who works at a hospital, and she'd like to get them analysed at the lab! The green things aren't anything I ate or drank, obviously.In a nutshell, it works. It's been just two hours, so I'm not feeling that much better (yet). The author does say it'll take a couple of days to feel the benefit, so I'm expecting to feel great soon.

It is an easy to follow, sensible account of the liver's function and problems that crop up in the liver because of gallstones.

I recommend her review:http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DGOIYAYU17QA/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R2DGOIYAYU17QAand I think she describes very clearly the process I have lived through. I have felt very well doing the flushes. Next week I will be doing my third flush. The first two released hundreds of stones. In total about 4 stones aprox 2 cm by 1 cm, stones which I suspect were from the gall bladder and scores of almond or hazelnut sized stones. Not to mention the hundreds of smaller stones. I have taken pictures of them and even kept them for anyone who is interested!The one or two days after the cleansing I really do feel much better, as if relieved. The biggest effect has been in my character in that I am generally calmer and less \\"billious\\". I am aware however that, seeing the amount of stones still left in the second flush, I must still do many more.What I appreciated the most from Andreas's book however, is the clear structure:- What are the symptoms of stones in the gall bladder and liver?- What diseases are directly caused by this problem?- How to solve the problem (the flush itself) and...- How to avoid having this problem... and the conciseness of all the explanations, with clear illustrations, examples. Very easy to read for what is actually quite a technical or at least specialists subject.I have been so impressed by this book that I am recommending it to everyone I know who takes the time to listen.Oscar Prat van Thiel"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"l came across Andreas MOritz's book about the Liver and Gallbladder Flush in the year 2004..... l did the liver and gallbladder cleanse twice a year ever since and my health has truly improved.... l have tried other liver cleanses but none were as powerful and efficient as his.....l have recommended his book to many of my friends and they feel the same way...... l am truly grateful for his book and the information available to me.....

Since that time I've done this flush many times, always with very good success and always feeling better afterwards. Now I do the flush 2-3 times a year. It is so simple, and gentle and inexpensive. My cholesterol dropped from nearly 200 to 176 after completing the flush my first few times. I'm sure there were several factors that contributed to that drop, but I know that the liver and gallbladder flushes were part of it!In a world where so many people are without health insurance, it is a great help to have such a resource for ongoing good health and well-being that doesn't cost and arm and a leg. This book is also packed with very important information about the systemic health challenges that can be created by an unhealthy liver. I recommend the book and the flush to friends all the time, whether they are very ill or just feeling not quite right.

I was looking for a thorough and deep but natural, non-medicinal approach to liver and gall bladder cleansing. My impetus for this is that I had developed certain health issues a few years ago and over time had been able to discern that the issue had to do with gallbladder/liver problems.I can say that my first experience with the liver flush has been nothing short of phenomenal. Following all the directions in the book to a tee, I found that the flush was not only exceptionally successful in terms of actually moving gallstones out of my body (I could not believe how many came out) but the process was also free of any pain or discomfort.The very welcome surprise for me is that I actually experienced a significant improvement in my health even before I did the flush just by closely following all of the pre-flush recommendations and preparations.The other thing I appreciated about the book is that is also has a wealth of very well written and accessible information and wisdom about the bodies' processes, how the liver affects the different systems of the body, how to do the flush and how to take care of the liver (and the body) on a long term basis. It was very clear to me from reading the book that the author (Andreas Moritz) is well in command of the subject matter and writes clearly, instructively and authoritatively.I cannot recommend this book enough and I hope to share the knowledge and wisdom contained in it with my friends and loved ones."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush is a book I never would have picked up had it not been for the testimony of a trusted friend who had begun to recover his sense of smell (lost 20 years before)after doing a single liver flush. Intrigued, I ordered the book and was impressed not only by Mr. Moritz's knowledge of the human body, but also by his genuine care for people. Here is a man who has no expensive gimmick to sell; instead he passes on his expertise about the workings of the liver and how its functions affect every part of the body. He also shares simple lifestype changes that reap huge health benefits: vegan diet, restorative sleep, getting sunshine, and the like. Incorporating these changes into my daily life and doing periodic liver cleanses have been greatly beneficial to me. I seldom become sick, take no medications, and have the stamina to get through the long days of my demanding job. Mr. Moritz's writes in an engaging manner that inspired and motivated me to take charge of my own health. After reading his book, I decided to try the liver flushes and dietary changes for a year. Four years later, I know I'll never go back to my old habits. I highly recommend this empowering book."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I am on my 20th flush. Hats off to Andreas for sharing his knowledge. I have watched my body go through wonderful transformations. I am now pain free. My back no longer hurts, my brain fog has GONE, my energy level has trippled, my skin is amazingly clear and smooth. I've released 30 pounds and kept it off. I have released over 3000 stones from doing the liver and gall bladder flush. The stones have come out in all different sizes ranging from the size of peas to the size of golf balls. All painless.

I was only interested in the regimen and what supported the efficacy of this regimen, not excerpts from his other book. I found this book repititious and redundant. So, why DID I pay $14 more than the OTHER version?I've had this book for several months, referred by one of my Canadian associates. He was taking the cleanse and was impressed by the results.However there are 2 books on this subject, with a $14 price difference. So, my question was: \\"What is the difference?\\"...and \\"Is the more expensive one better?\\"Since I only own THIS version, I can say that I thought it was a little expensive for what it offered...and that IF it would had stayed to the subject line, the book would have easily been 100 pages shorter. The editing could have been MUCH better, as many topics were repeated over and over. The continual referrence to his other books and to Ayurevedic as the basic to good health, well...I don't agree. I don't fit their model.New Age thinking also shows up in this book.There's even health and wellness advice that is just plain incorrect.Those are just a few things...including endorsement of products by mlm companies as 'the best' when, from personal knowledge, it if far from such (I'll spare you the horror story).BUT if we stick to the cleanse, it is worthwhile. The regimen is simple: apple juice for 6 days, followed by the purging/flushing stage using epsom salts, grapefruit and olive oil. The formula and the alternatives are in the book. I will also assume that THIS formula is in the CHEAPER version of this book. If I had to do it over again, THAT is what I would have purchased.Not much attention is paid to the kidney flush or its benefits. So be aware of that. This book is NOT the gospel but does do the job at describing a regimen to clean sludge and stones out of your liver and gallbladder.

The hardest part for me was finding a time period from 6 pm till 10 am the next day where I had no responsibilities. The six days of drinking 32 ounces of apple juice a day were not difficult, though I may substitute malic acid in future cleanses. I felt bloated by the sixth day. I had some trepidation about the actual cleanse, but it was easier to get down the epsom salt/water mix than I expected (though I would never order this drink in a restaurant!), and the grapefruit juice/olive oil mix wasn't bad tasting at all. I definitely felt things moving down from the gallbladder during the 20 minute lying down period after drinking the grapefruit juice/olive oil mix. Interestingly, I had no need to use the restroom after drinking the grapefruit juice/olive oil mix until the next morning's epsom salt drink. Then, out came hundreds of green flakes and some small stones for the next several hours. I had made an appointment for a colonic for the next day, which I will definitely continue to do for future flushes. My midback felt much better after the flush for several days (it made doing headstands easier), though it's sore again. I will continue doing the flush until there are no more gallstones. I look forward to other physical improvements."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"About a year ago I went to the doctor with pain in my stomache. I spent thousands of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I was sent from doctor to doctor because each doctor said it was someting that I needed a different specialist for. I had a lot of blood tests, MRIs, & ultra sounds done, even a barrium swallow. I got tired of waiting for results from the doctors so I did my reaserch on the internet and came up with the conclusion that I had gall stones. I had a recipie for a flush that a friend had given me a few years ago. So I tried that flush. I felt good afterwards for about a month, but after a month I was feeling worse than ever. What happened is I had a lot of toxins in my liver that had been flushed out into my body. I had the worst & weirdest pains all over my body. I did not realize you needed to prep for this flush. By reading this book(listening to it on audio tape) I realized everything I had done wrong with the first flush. I had results with the first flush, but the side effects were too great. I have now done three flushes following Andreas Moritz's book and I have had very few side effects. I am feeling better and better all the time. I was very reluctant to try another flush after the first one, but with some convincing of my chiropractor I bought the audio tapes of this book and decided to try it once more. With each flush I feel better. My first Andreas Moritz flush I had been experiencing a sinus infection that would not go away and after the flush my sinuses drained and the infection went away along with my ear pains. Just as a note do not save your stones to show your friends and family, they do not appreciate it. I really reccomend reading ths book before you try doing a flush. You do not want to make the same mistake I did.

I didn't realize that the flush would address so many chronic problems and pains! Now I'm ready to begin another flush--although the stones were greatly reduced by the third flush, I will definitely continue until there are no stones, and then begin to do \\"maintenance\\" flushes, a couple of times a year.Good fortune with this!

My symptoms disappeared after just one flush, which released hundreds of gall stones! I continued the cleanse as recommended until I was clear.

I read the book carefully, followed Mr. Moritz' instructions and was - right after I finished the described procedure - as astonished as all the others that already posted their 5 star reviews here on Amazon.com and also on Amazon.deI simply couldn't believe what left my body after I went through the procedure - I felt great and relieved when I got rid of hundreds of green and yellow \\"gallstones\\". Excellent I thought and started to search on the Internet for some more experiences people had. When I found an article on the german Wikipedia website I really was disappointed. What is written there is that the things our friend Mr. Moritz describes as gallstones are nothing else than dots / lumps that consist of split fatty acids contained in the olive oil mixed with the magnesium sulfate that one also has to take during the procedure. There is absolutely no proof that these dots are gallstones.I also found this article on the website of the well known german magazine \\"DER SPIEGEL\\":[...]The article confirms exactly what is written in the Wiki post.Dear Mr. Moritz: You are a cheater!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Finished my second flush this morning, and I'm pleased with the result, but bewildered as well. I realize now, based on the VISUAL EVIDENCE, that I've been carrying around these 'little passengers' for all this time. Thanks to the flush in this book, I'm managing to rid myself of them. I started off with a dull pressure just under the ribs and decided to give this a try. As mentioned in the book, the results of the first flush are short lived, as stones from the 'back' of the liver move forward. And, this flush was more successful than the first, as explained, the recuperative powers of the liver allow for subsequently more successful flushing. The only part which is the most bothersome is the 6 day prep. It's a dull life between the first and sixth day, but it's well worth it. As for the book . . . I still go back to it as a reference. In particular, the actual flush itself, in case I missed any minute detail."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I had to write my comments about this book.First, I borrowed it from a friend within the last two weeks and have just completed my first cleanse following the instructions by Andreas Moritz. I have done several liver/gallbladder cleanses in the past using similar but not exact techniques, always successfully, but never this successful. So I am not a newcomer to the cleanse, and I do have something to compare to. It has been a few years since I've done a liver/gallbladder cleanse, and have encountered events over that time that brought my level of health to a point where I began to think about the need to do a cleanse again -- it just seemed like the right time -- when a friend 'happened' to show me her new book.I find it troubling and dismaying to read such pronouncements as in several of the reviews by people who admit they have not even done the clean yet to see if it works! Opinions do not make facts. How can we pass judgment without trying something, as long as it is not dangerous?To the implication that apple juice, Epsom salts, virgin olive oil and orange juice signify quackery, I have news: apple juice, virgin olive oil, and orange juice are simple foods that man has used for thousands of years, and Epsom salts has a very long history of safe and very effective use as a colon cleanser. Yes, it tastes gross, but I put fresh lemon juice in mine and drank it with a straw inserted somewhat back in the mouth and drank it quickly and without breathing; I was able to get each glass down in one go. It was not pleasant; neither was it the end of the world. I simply rinsed my mouth and brushed my teeth afterwards, as recommended. I didn't feel nauseated or gag, and folks, it was over before I knew it. It could by no stretch of the imagination be classed as torture, just tasted very unpleasant, but nothing impossible to do. It lasted all of maybe one minute.To suggest that the six days of preparation and the flush itself (the olive oil and grapefruit juice part) is torture and worse even than cancer treatment itself (!!!).......I simply cannot find words for. The six days consists mainly of a certain amount of apple juice daily (unless you are diabetic or otherwise cannot tolerate large quantities of apple juice, in which case there are alternatives), and a simple diet and lifestyle. One can compare this 'extreme' form of 'torture' to cancer treatment??? I don't think so. I've watched a number of friends go through cancer treatment and I can guarantee you they would rather have been drinking apple juice, Epsom salts, and olive oil any day, as well as keep all their body parts, not to mention the physical and emotional agony that goes with such a serious disease. The prep for the cleanse does not involve fasting or other forms of deprivation, either. I felt strong and alert and had not a single pang of hunger. The most unconscionable thing of all is to make such suggestions without having done the flush onesself in order to be able to speak to the issue from a point of personal experience.Yes, I am a little hot and bothered about such snide remarks from people who have not even tried the flush. You know the old saying 'The proof is in the pudding'. I effortlessly, painlessly, passed 242 stones over about a 24-hour period at the end of the flush; I know because I counted the larger ones (they float and are bright green, very easy to see) over that time period because I wanted to know if this flush was going to be successful, and if so, how successful. My largest stones were the size of a small almond, some were the size of a raisin, some the size of a pea, and some were about the size of a grain of barley (those were the sizes I counted) with many, many more smaller than that but still easily seen, which were impossible to count because there were too many. There were probably some I couldn't see, as well.And, for the record, I have actually felt the stones travelling down the bile duct (not on this flush, but on my previous one), so he's not making that up. It is very unmistakable.....light but very discernable; it sort of tickles -- I remember giggling softly, and feeling excited that this was actually working. I didn't feel any movement this time, and I did wonder if that meant the flush was not going to be very effective. But now, on the other side of the flush, I know that you don't have to feel the movement in order for the stones to be released.From the get-go I felt well and in fact, my feeling of well-being only increased as the six days prep went by, and by the time the flush itself occurred, I felt the best I've felt in years. If one flush done by this method can produce not only flushing of stones to this degree of effectiveness, but also give such a profound feeling of lightness and vastly increased energy, of mental alertness, of deep and sound sleep, of physical strength and lessened back pain (major spinal surgery 21 years ago, living in intermittent chronic pain, with diminished lifestyle abilities), I will definitely be doing this again, on a regular basis. One year of painless and very effective investment in getting healthier doesn't seem like an unreasonable commitment. I look forward to seeing what further benefits may accrue.The book is easy-to-read, easy to understand, written in a non-strident manner, enough simple diagrams so one can picture what is happening in the body anatomically, and the pictures are there for all to see.I am not saying I agreed with every single word in the book; I didn't. But if we are talking effectiveness of this method for ridding the body of liver/gallbladder stones, this is the only book I'm using from now on. Whatever I might not have agreed with had nothing to do with the issue at hand.I gave the book 4 stars only because there didn't seem to be good source material/references to the medical literature which I would like to have seen some of the comments tied to. However, I have seen such info elsewhere, so I know it exists. Lacking its inclusion does not make the book any less true; it just would have strengthened its credibility. I have since seen and ordered Mr. Moritz' other book, The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse, which I believe is his newer book; it includes all the same information in a more condensed form (yet it is still complete), and the selling feature for me was that it does contain good reference material.For those who can keep an open, enquiring mind and give something that is safe and painless a try, you will probably be shocked and thrilled at the outcome (no pun intended) and how good you will probably start feeling very soon. Our bodies have such innate healing wisdom; when given the right assistance and support, they can bring us to a place of strength, health and joy.The ancient psalmist was right: truly, we are 'fearfully and wonderfully' made.Rachel Robinowitz"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I am on my fourth flush.

(I walked away from the sink and read a book...NO glasses!) Then after the next few flushes it got even better. I thought this was just a blessing happening to me...but that is the way of the cleanse.My husband after reading a bit of this book and also \\"Timeless Secrets of Health & Rejuvenation\\", started his flushes and had the same result. Those results were HIS discovery. You see, I never told him how much better my eyes were, I was afraid he would not believe me.

But if you continue to follow the lifestyle changes and keep up with your cleanses, you will see some fantastic results!)If it were another time, doing this cleanse might not be needed. Better food and air and water back then. However, as the world becomes more and more toxic, our bodies need us to listen to them and make good sound choices in all we do.We might not be able to control everything in our environment, but reading this book and the other books by Andreas will give you a fighting chance at a longer and healthier life.Get his book/s, it is one of the best investments into your future you can give you and your family!!!Have a blessed dayYours in good healthnieema"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"September of 2008 I was having gallbladder pain, I knew it, (family history of gallbladder removals). I did not want to have my gallbladder removed. Did you know how vital the gallbladder really is? You need to read this book before you get yours removed, be sure to do internet searches on why not to have it removed. Anyway, I had dull pain in my lower right, just under the rib cage for over a year maybe two. It was on and off pain. I also had back pain, neck pain and shoulder pain, on and off for at least 10 years. I never associated my back pain to the gallbladder but I guess that pain was a direct result of my congested liver and gallbladder. I also suffered from occasional heart burn. I also had brain fog, and memory issues. OK, anyway...so I went to see the doctor and I had the two tests to check my gallbladder, the ultra sound showed no stones and the HIDA scan showed a (14%) poor ejection rate of the gallbladder. My doctor suggested I should have it removed. But I refused, and told the surgeon I would be doing more research (being a health nut I usually make sure to study up on things before making these life changing decisions). I did my research and you should too. One important note is that it told me that most of the stones cannot be see by ultrasound, so do not be fooled you still have liver congested with stones that are basically congealed clumps of bile or organic matter (stones which are not calcified and therefore do not show up on scans). The process of the flush softens the gunk and it will widen the bile ducts, so it will expel them out of your liver and gallbladder painlessly. I followed the directions in this book for the liver and gallbladder flush last week and the results were instantaneous and amazing. I passed thousands of stones and gunk! I now have no pain what-so-ever. All back pain is gone, all stomach pain is gone. I truly believe this information has saved my gallbladder. I even have found that I feel calmer and do not get all worked up over stressful events, such as driving in traffic, my stomach is relaxed, and back too...and therefore I oddly enough notice a big difference. It seems to resolve so many other health issues I have had... I had not noticed I was having so many other things that the flush seemed to alleviate, just read the book and you will see. Please get this book you will be so glad you did and if you do the flush it will change your life forever, you will feel 20 years younger! Its so easy to do too, and the process is 100% painless! I am encouraging my entire family to do the flush! --------- Update--May 12th 2010. I have just completed my 18th flush since this all began in September 2008. My liver is finally free of all that gunk! Now I am on maintenance, just doing it spring and fall should be enough to keep it clean. Yes it can take a long while, stay committed! It is so worth it! This is the best way to easily change your lifestyle. After each flush you can see improvement in your health, after each flush I did - less and less stones and gunk came out! This is indeed real, it works. I am living proof. But you must stay on course. With the first flushes you might see the immediate results, like your back pain is gone for a few days but then it returns. This does not mean your flush did not work. It means more gunk has moved down into lower positions in the liver and will need to come out on each consecutive flush, eventually you will clean the whole liver out. I can see why some people would give up, the grapefruit mixture can taste... not so good, but you need to find the right brand of olive oil that tastes the best for you. I like Lucini brand. Drinking the Epsom salts can be difficult for some people but there are alternatives to try. Doing flushes transforms your eating habits, once you see these nasty globs come out, well it will instantly encourage you to think twice before putting bad fatty foods in your mouth. I dropped a few pounds, and have never been more fit (but this is not for weight loss, this cleans the liver and gall bladder, on the other hand you will naturally eat better and that could... for some, equal weight loss). Tip: Also if you have a minor gall bladder attack (pain under your right rib)here is a recipe that worked for me-- chopped beets mixed with flax seed oil and lemon juice, my pain was gone within the hour! The bigger book Andrea has written contains tons of good information to lead a healthy lifestyle I encourage you to read it. Timeless Secrets of Health and Rejuvenation. I own both books and have purchased copies for friends!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Both my daughter and I followed the instructions to do the flush, and it worked! We both passed many stones pain free. My daughter was scheduled to have her gallbladder out because her stones were too big to pass, but we were able to save it. This is a must read for anyone considering having their gallbladder removed. I was skeptical at first, but it really worked."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"This book is the most comprehensive I have found on the liver flush. Andreas explains in well-researched terms, our modern day illnesses and how they relate to our 'sick livers'. Our liver has been forgotten in our quest for wellness, and Andreas writes again and again on it being the most important organ in our body, and thus how important it is to keep it clean. The liver flush is so simple yet so effective. I believe it is the answer to many or all of our modern day illnesses. As a registered nurse working 20 years in emergency departments, I have witnessed the other side of what happens when we ignore our liver: such unnecessary interventions, surgery, drugs, etc. This book is now one of my main reference books."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I am definitively impressed the way Mr. Moritz explains the origin of many diseases. Personally I have had many skin problems for many years. After visiting many dermatologists, I arrived to the conclusion that they could not help me, at least to being totally cured. I always suspected that the origin of my problem was the functioning of my liver. Since then, I started to heal my liver and I started to notice important changes. Mr. Moritz only confirmed my hypothesis. Of course I will try his recommendation. I strongly recommend this book to anybody that want a real healing for her maladies."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I started this program very positive, hopeful and open. I followed all the instructions carefully and thoroughly. The night of the cleanse was the sickest I have been in a very, very long time. The Epsom salts made me extremely nauseous and the amount of diarrhea they create is dangerous. I at times barely made it back to bed before nearly passing out. I was dizzy, faint, had cold sweats, and had a great deal of pain over my liver and gallbladder. I slept on and off throughout the night. My nausea was better by the morning, and I did pass about 100 green things--not convinced these are stones. I have had a severe pain over my gallbladder and liver ever since. This pain got so bad, I had to go to the doctor and am scheduled for an ultrasound. I did research post-cleanse that I should have done before the cleanse--because I never would have tried it if I had read about this process and Mr. Moritz further. Many doctors, natural doctors included, warn about the dangers of trying this if there is any chance that you actually have gallstones. The oil and grapefruit create such a surge of bile, that you run the risk of having a stone block a bile duct, a life threatening situation.The book lists no warnings about potential dangers. Problems that might arise are listed as rare and most importantly, Mr. Moritz asserts that any illness from the flush is due to your not having followed his protocol to the letter. That means the method itself is perfect and absolutely fits every person. From a common sense view, there is no method that is absolutely full proof--there are always pros and cons. Because this book does not address the cons or potential negative outcomes, it is neither objective nor honest. A system which cannot truthfully analyze itself is afraid of finding something there.I wish this book had worked for me. I wish that I could post the amazing results that others here have posted. This is not a miracle cure for everyone for sure. I've set my health back, feel exhausted 6 days later, and had a fearful and painful weak.I tried to post a comment directly on Mr. Moritz's blog to explain what happened and seek some help, but not only did I get no response, my post never showed up among the many glowing reviews of this cleanse on his blog. To these other posts, he had responded within one day with many thanks.The power of suggestion, and the power of hope are extremely strong, and I wonder if they might be the basis of most of the cures listed under this cleanse. Those things are real--I don't believe this is. Please be careful before you try this, and research both the cleanse and Mr. Moritz carefully."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Everyone should read this book to understand how to clean the toxins from the liver. Every ailment under the sun can benefit from these routines. I was truly \\"amazed\\" and grateful that someone recommended this book to me. A friend who has mercury poisoning and used these methods to get well also got off of all of her asthma medicine. Another friend recently had her gallbladder removed (to \\"help\\" her) but she is now losing her hair, drying up, looking sullen and is sick all the time. She did not need surgery! She needed to cleanse her system and instead she is permanently worse off. For her sake, I would never tell her about this book because she will be devastated when she reads how simple it is to restore your health."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I followed the liver flush detailed in this book four times, and I adhered to the letter. I had very good results the first time. I pooped 200 green curds--the alleged \\"gallstones in the liver\\"--just as the author promised, I felt less liver congestion, and I became more sensitive to liver-unfriendly foods. I gave up chocolate, coffee, and sugary desserts quite easily, and began to eat much more sensibly. A lot of people commented that I looked more healthy and \\"clear.\\"So far so good. I continued the flush for the next two months, but noticed that I was feeling much more tired after the flushes--and I'm usually quite energetic. Natural health professionals I consulted warned that they'd seen monthly flushes like this one exhaust many people and even lead to serious illness. After one more flush had mixed results at best, I talked with an old friend, an experienced acupuncturist. Anthony had done this liver flush himself and taken the green curds into a laboratory to be tested. The result: They are not products of the liver, but waste from the small intestine (colonics don't wash this out). The reason for the strong green color is unclear; it could be due to the amount of bile that the epsom salts causes the gall bladder to excrete. But in any case, the chemical tests revealed that the \\"stones\\" are not gall or bile--they're food.The claim that this flush cleans gall-stones or bile-curds out of the liver may or may not be fraudulent; but in any case, it's FALSE. If you don't believe me, take the curds to a laboratory and find out for yourself.So why did I have the initial good results? It could well be that the apple juice, the epsom salts, and the colonics (which I'd never had before) did good things for my abdomen. Even the shock of the flush itself might have benefited my liver at that initial stage. Since several factors are involved in the flush, it would take controlled experiments to discover exactly what was effective. My guess is that flushing or fasting can be beneficial to most people. Anthony recommended that I do a regular juice or food cleanse in early spring and another in early autumn each year. He believes that four flushes in six months is far too much, especially in the case of somebody without a serious need and not under medical supervision. CAUTION: regular flushing is likely to be DANGEROUS!The case of the friend who introduced this book to me suggests that Anthony is right. Julie also had good initial results but became weaker with each passing month. Yes, she was more sensitive and \\"ethereal,\\" but that was largely because her energy level was getting lower. Now she's dealing with a recurrence of cancer and, in my opinion, seeking even more questionable therapies.Some of the Amazon reviews take skeptics to task for not being open-minded. I agree with that--I myself prefer alternative medicine--but openness also means being open to the possibility that \\"natural cure\\" claims may be false and/or fraudulent, and therefore need critical investigation and verification. At the very least, readers of this book should ask around and look into the potential downside before embarking on a regimen that will flush away their qi energy rather than toxins."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"This was a very helpful book, detailing a process that anyone can do at home without paying for a Dr. I have done 4 liver flushes so far and am very impressed with the results I have gotten.

Not just about the flush, ( which I've done many times and which worked very well, esp. in conjunction with colonics,)but it's the best explanation I've found, for a lay person,of how all the various organs and systems work individually and together, when they do, and how they work singlely and in concert, when they don't.Do you think that an organ that performs more than 400 functions should be allowed to do its job? The liver, along with the lungs, can heal itself with just a bit of help from us. It can be shut down by as much as 60% before any symptoms even appear.This book is a must for anyone who believes that our bodies are precious and for those who want to understand how to restore their health and how to stay out of the hospital!The protocols in this book are inexpensive, readilly available, and work.As for poison pen reviews, use your own judgement: Before there were pharmaceuticals there were herbs,seeds and vegetables, and before there was baby formula there was breast milk.

I like how the author explains the rationale behind the flush and think this purchase of this book was worth the money."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"The human body consists of many organs, each with a specific function and an important role in maintaining optimal health. Two organs that work together in several ways are the liver and gall bladder. The liver is the most critical of the two because, as many already know, gallbladders can be removed and often are removed to eliminate the problems associated with gallstones. But removing the gallbladder doesn't eliminate the cause of the illness. In many instances, these two organs need some simple cleansing and this is the main topic of The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush, a book written by Andreas Moritz, a practitioner of alternative medicine.Gallstones are a common ailment that inflicts millions of people each year and The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush spends considerable time talking about the important functions of both the liver and gallbladder; how they contribute to basic bodily activities, and how gallstones form. Many different activities can lead to the formation of gallstones. Most of them are dietary in nature, but there are other causes of gallstones and this book discusses many of these miscellaneous causes, such as stress, interrupted sleep, even excessive television viewing, with brief explanations on how these and other events lead to the formation of gallstones and blockage of the liver.Many people are familiar with gallstones and consider them an annoyance; a non- fatal though often painful irritation that can easily be remedied by removing the gallbladder. But is this always the best way to deal with the problems associated with gallstones? Author Andreas Moritz proposes instead that an individual cleanse the liver and gallbladder in order to lessen the likelihood of gallstones and/or to help treat the problem when gallstones are already a reality. A combination of apple juice, olive oil, and other ingredients helps to keep these vital organs clean and in top- functioning condition. Consuming a specific mixture on a periodic basis is all that is necessary to eliminate the build- up of toxins in these two organs and improve digestive and overall health.The rewards for flushing the liver and gallbladder on a regular basis are numerous and this book devotes several pages to some of these benefits, such as lessened pain, greater flexibility, better digestion, improved emotional health, etc. No two individuals will experience exactly the same positive effects, but those who follow the cleansing procedure and take care to improve their diet and make other lifestyle changes will enjoy the benefits to one degree or another. The author even includes a personal story about the benefits of the liver and gallbladder flush described in this book along with a section of frequently asked questions that should clear up any issues that readers have about this cleansing system.Gallstones will continue to be a problem for millions of people but simply removing the gallbladder isn't necessarily the best approach to ridding the body of the problems associated with gallstones because it doesn't eliminate the cause of the gallstones, which are usually diet and/or lifestyle related. The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush explains the causes of gallstones, the effects of different diseases, and the benefits from cleansing these organs using its simple process. A few simple treatments are often all it takes to clean out these important organs and place the body on the path toward better health."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I have completed several liver flushes as well as having researched other liver cleanse protocols. Andreas' is a comprehensive and well researched version of a powerful organ cleanse. This isn't the type of thing you just decide to do one day; it takes commitment, planning and preparation, including cleansing the colon and kidneys beforehand. I think the Author's heart is in the right place and that he is truly dedicated to healing."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I was introduced to the book and immediately felt compelled to do the flush.

While in the main, addressing the physical aspect which is ultimately what I was wishing to attain.

What is wonderful about the liver cleanse is that it addresses the actual cause of toxicity and corrects it - without resorting to drugs or surgery. I had done Dr Clark's liver cleanse in the past and found it to be amazingly rejuvenating. But I like Andreas's the best because he explains everything so clearly that it's easy to follow and understand why you're taking each step in the manner he suggests. One of the reviewers who apparently didn't actually try the cleanse ridiculed the idea of swallowing the oil and grapefruit juice at exactly 10pm. Despite already being aware that 10 o'clock is a very specific time that the liver naturally goes through its cleansing cycle, I drank mine at 10:05pm during one of the cleanses thinking that was close enough - but it wasn't! The cleanse worked, sort of, but far less effectively than when I followed instructions precisely to the minute. Someone else I know drank hers about 20 minutes late and it didn't work at all.Andreas also gives helpful suggestions for the pre-flush part of the cleanse during the first five days, which I hadn't got from previous nutritional writers but which make the cleanse much more effective. Nutritional is the operative word here. A couple of reviewers scoffed at Moritz's lack of medical credentials. The liver flush is not a medical procedure, it is a natural health cleanse; thus someone of Moritz's stature in the field of naturopathic health and nutrition is eminently more qualified to write on topics like this than most doctors, who might have a total of anywhere from two hours' training in nutrition to a weekend - if any at all, as most medical schools provide no nutrition classes whatsoever. Of course, some medical doctors practicing alternative and complementary medicine do have nutritional background, but only because they seek and find it outside their medical training.My only complaint about The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush is the lack of indexed and referenced material I would have wanted to read. As for the value of the book itself - its user-friendly directions and the profoundly beneficial results from doing the cleanse - it has certainly paid for itself many times over in my health. And there's really no price you can put on that.PS - I'm happy to read that the updated version of the book DOES have reference notes and index."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Thank you Andreas for putting this information out there.I have followed your instructions and passed tens of thousands of gallstones . My health and outlook has improved immensely. Your method and instructions are easy to follow and work well , all it takes is a little discipline.

I first tried this flush in 2007 and was astonished at the results I achieved just by doing it once. I literally felt like a new person; I had a clearer mind, my face cleared up, I didn't have urges to eat junk food, my energy level skyrocketed...should I keep going? After having this experience, I include the flush in my health regimen and follow the numerous tips on staying healthy provided in the book.I have recommended this book to about twenty people who did not have any side effects after completing it, unless you consider clear mind and healthy body side effects.Anybody who discredits this author's work, please do your research. These people are obviously those who celebrate the Big Pharma Industry and are not informed about the hundreds of thousands of people who die annually just in the U.S. due to FDA approved drugs. Forget apple and grapefruit juice, epsom salt, and olive oil because they're way too dangerous, right? Let's take Percocet, Ativan, Lipitor, and Ambien - side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions, may cause a severe allergic reaction, having no memory of activity engaged in while on the drug; and those are the light side effects. Let's not forget about the billion dollar chemotherapy industry, which claims that they're helping the individuals by treating them with toxic drugs that are breaking down their immune system, instead of building it up.If you are going to side with those discrediting Andreas Moritz's work, I ask you to do your homework first. His website is www.ener-chi.com and there are plenty of websites that support his findings.\\"Condemnation without investigation is the height of all ignorance\\"-Albert Einstein~Veronica B.[...]"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Andreas Moritz truly does an amazing job of throughly explaining the reasoning and purpose of the liver cleanse in an easily digestible format without being too overwhelming. There is nothing too hard about the cleanse and it really works! The worst part is drinking the epsom salts, but lemon really does a good job of cutting out the flavor and its done so quick. I've done other liver cleanses where I've had to starve for days and I didn't see the results that I've seen with this method. My first time I must have passed over a hundred little stones and some liver parasites!!!!!My friend, inflicted with Gilbert's syndrome, passed stones about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter his first go!WOW! We had those things in our bodies!?I feel great, energized, and my mind is clear. Ever since I've gone raw vegan I've seen a lot of great improvements in my health and mind. Now I've taken it to the next level and am recommending this book to all of my friends and loved ones.

It was obvious I had to go to the hospital. The doctor recomended an ultrasound to see what was the cause of this unbearable pain. They found out that the pain was caused by the gallstones in my gallbladder. He also recommended a surgery, but a friend of my wife told her to buy the book we are talking about in this review. I followed the simple instructions in the book and IT WORKED! I saw the stones after they came out. I haven't taken any pain pills since I did the Flush, I feel a lot better and it feels so good to live without that constant pain.

My wife, an amateur alternative medicine practitioner, has been using this book as her primary source for cleansing. She got hundreds of stones and is almost completely clean at the moment. She feels absolutely rejuvinated, hasn't been sick for several years now. I have only done some mild kidney cleanse, and I have been sick only once in last 8 years (common cold!). A friend of mine was told by \\"doctors\\" they would have to remove his gallbladder. He said he would rather die that let them do it and within a course of year and half CLEANED HIS GALLBLADDER AND LIVER ENTIRELY, using this amazing book. I think it really saved his life. Just recently I also met a young woman who confessed that this book saved her and her husbands life AND saved them thousands of dollars wasted on useless medication.

The directions for the flush itself are easy and cheap to follow. Your main investment is a few hours of your time sticking close to the bathroom for about half of your day off. I had a question and e-mailed the author, and he personally e-mailed me an answer. If you have been told you are facing gallbladder surgery, this would be a good book to read beforehand."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I did the flush and had little results. I passed maybe 7-10 very small green floater stones and then just silty slush - hence my 4 stars intead of 5. I was very dissapointed but after reading the book I'm sure my liver is pretty congested and that is the problem. I know for sure my GB is packed with stones - so the radiologist at Kaiser says. I was in terrible pain most of the month of April and finally am getting relief now. Not sure what is working best just glad I am out of pain and able to eat fairly normal. I just can't ignore the nearly 300 customer reviews here on Amazon and the book makes sense to me. As per the book, I ordered a parasite cleanse - \\"humaworm\\" and will be taking that then on to my second liver flush. I tried several hefty doses of wormwood and black walnut from the health food store to attempt to rid myself of any parasites and think I passed some but after reading the reviews on humaworm I realize I needed that. Anyway, my primary care physician says my GB not inflamed \\"thank you God\\" so I will be doing liver flushes for a while. If you called my voice mail it would say \\"sorry I am not available because I am doing THE FARKING AMAZING LIVER AND GB FLUSH FOREVER! My lame attempt to be funny. Will repost results from second flush as soon as possible.UPDATE 5/14/12Flush #2 a SUCCESS! I passed hundreds of stones mostly small but literally hundreds! I could not believe the amount of stones passed! Beginning the morning after drinking oil about 8:30 am then every 20 minutes or so for about 2 hours about 50 stones each time in the bathroom! Then passed stones up until about 5pm or so in smaller amounts. Too soon to tell if any marked difference in vitality but I will say the flushes do make you weak and lethargic so doing it over a weekend where you have little else to do is good. I ordered the Humaworm product but there was a problem with shipping so I did not even do the full 30-day parasite cleanse and it worked. I CONTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS TO THE ADDITIONAL SOFTENING OF THE STONES. I changed my rating to 5 stars!! I will be continuing with the flushes through out the year once per month until all stones are out. Anyway, I do hope to pass the stones in my gallbladder eventually. If you have passed those stones please comment here.I wanted to update again and say I felt very drained after the second flush so went and got a B12 shot and it helped.Update: 8/17/2012Just finished flush #4. Passed about 50 ish smallish stones but I promised to keep you guys updated on progress so I need to share this. My acupunture lady prescribed an herbal blend that I finally started taking 3 caps 3x per day = I know...that is like 9 pills a day right! I think that is sort of why I was resistant to it plus, I didn't really believe chinese herbs really worked. After taking them at this prescribed dosage for about 2 weeks ALL my symptoms have cleared! I suppose on teh last flush I could have released stones out of my actual gallbladder but I really have had more help and better results from these herbs than the flushes it seems. Here is what I am taking: Evergreen Collection Formulas - Dissolve GS. You can only get this from a acupunturist:( I pay her $23.00 per bottle. Hope this helps someone."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"1st of all, this book is a wealth of information. I think at some points, he is speculating a little bit. But all in all, you're no worse off by reading this book. He makes you more aware of the excessive amounts of protein in the American diet and how gallstones actually get formed.2nd of all, I've struck the mother load in my first attempt! I've lost count at around 150 this morning. 4 stones were about 1/2\\" in size. 10+ were around 1/4\\"-3/8\\". The side effect for me was a little bit of nausea at about 3:30AM. But I know if I didn't follow the regimen to the letter, it could have turned out much worse.The thing that drove me to this was necessity. I've been having a great deal of trouble digesting rich foods. I was never regular and Citrucel wasn't even helping. Based on what just passed into the toilet this morning and how good I'm already beginning to feel, I'd say I found the cause. The gallstones were preventing the bile pump from doing its job.I plan on doing this again in a month or so. My goal is to enjoy a good rack of ribs every now and then and not feel horrible the next day. But I will be eating healthier more often. More fruits and veggies so I don't have to go through this kind of misery again.Get this book. But don't skim through it. Read it cover to cover and follow the instructions to the letter! This includes getting colon hydrotherapy before and after your flushes. Those are expensive but your body is worth it!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I am a 51 year old male. I have been in general good health, however, I had been experiencing some creeping issues: Acid reflux almost every day, bloating, insomnia, brain fog, anxiety, mild depression, pain in my right shoulder, and intense spring time allergies have been the main complaints.I completed my third flush in as many months 24 hours ago. These are my impressions of the process so far:First of all, I do not consider the actual flush to be simple and painless. The 6 days of preparation are quite manageable, although I've started using malic acid instead of the apple juice, and the taste is pretty nasty. Not, however, as nasty as epsom salts. I find that part of the process to be beyond wretched. It's the nastiest tasting stuff I've ever encountered. By the time I have to take the fourth dose, I'm in utter dread, like a young child being force-fed castor oil. The worst part of the process, however, is the severe acid reflux that I start experiencing about two hours after taking the olive oil mixture. Waves of nausea and intense burning come over me, and I end up lying there, expecting to wake up in my own vomit (hasn't happened yet.) And of course there is the non-stop messy pooping. Actually, spraying is more like it. I never know when I'm done with a round. I'll sit there and after ten minutes, when I finally think I'm done, I get up off the can, and then literally a minute later, another wave is ready to evacuate. Obviously, sleep is difficult in these circumstances. Dehydration is also a problem. Seems like I'm up half the night either taking water in one end or releasing it from the other. By the time morning rolls around, I'm exhausted and I look like hell. Really. I actually appear to myself as a disfigured demon.So why did I continue with the torture after the first time? Because the payoff far exceeds the cost. It works! I've passed hundreds of stones so far. I'm not one to go wading through the toilet, but I believe that up until this most recent flush, I've only had the green floaters. This time, toward then end, I passed some beige floaters. My understanding is that these are older and calcified.I did my first flush at the peak of my allergy season. I had resorted to taking antihistamines and steroidal nose spray every day, even though I try my best to hold off. This season was pretty bad. After the first flush, however, the allergies completely disappeared for about 4 days, then they came back, but they were not as intense. The last week before my second flush, I had gone back to the allergy meds. Then after the second flush, the allergies were totally gone for two whole weeks, on the third week, there were two days that I took meds. So that was a dramatic improvement.Also, I've been sleeping better, the acid reflux subsided, and my shoulder pain improved. And I look marvelous. My eyes are brighter and my facial liver spots are definitely fading.Perhaps even more dramatic than my physical improvements are my mental/emotional improvements. My outlook has significantly improved. I've been less angry, more patient, less anxious and generally brighter mood.Finally, I feel spiritually renewed. I just feel more in harmony with the universe. I don't know how else to describe it. I feel more compassion toward all living creatures, which has caused me to completely cut out meat. The thought of factory farms is now horrifying to me, and I feel ashamed to have been a participant in that system.I intend to keep going until the stones are all gone. Seems like other people don't have as difficult a time with the process as I do. But my testimonial is that in spite of all the discomfort, I'm in it for the long haul. My deep experience in increased well-being is worth 15 hours a month of discomfort.

I bought it to find out how to do a \\"liver cleanse\\", which I figured was probably a good idea, and found out it was much more than that. It was absolutely essential! Turns out that every disease, without exception, is traceable to improper liver function and impaired bile production.

How does it get any better than that?"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I was very skeptical about this whole process. I followed the instructions almost to the letter. Day before flush had a colonic (not something I found to be particularly fun, but I figured I would bite the bullet for my health). No food after 1:30PM. Drank epsom salts at 6 and 8 then orange juice/lemon juice and olive oil at 10. I didn't feel a lot of action after drinking the salts... felt a little something happening in the area where my liver is, but nothing in my stomach or intestine area. An hour later, I vomited. I would dare to say I puked up all of the olive oil that I had previously ingested. I was certain at this point that I wouldn't pass anything the next day. I woke up at 6, drank the solution and again at 8 and immediately after finishing all of the epsom salts I went to the bathroom. Sure enough... I had passed about a hundred stones in my first round. Many more followed. I will definitely be doing more flushes to get rid of any more stones."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Everyone should read this book, if you can't afford the book get it from your local library. The cleanse itself isn't that costly, the items needed will be: Apple Juice, water, Epsom Salts, olive oil, & fresh grapefruit/citrus to juice/strain, a couple peaces of fruit for late morning on day 7. You'll need a total of 7 days. Day 1-6 are just prep days and don't really alter your day. But on the evening of the 6th day and the 7th day, they need to be a days you have at home to relax and stay close to a bathroom. I've did the cleanse twice now, plan to do it every 2 weeks until I feel I've maximized the effects of the cleanse then I'll do it 2x per year as the book suggests. The place I go for Colonic Irrigations/Colonics, states she's seen people transform before her eyes from doing this cleanse over a years time as they came to see her before and/or after the cleanse. **My back pain went away immediately after the 1st cleanse. I have more energy, and feel healthier in general. (I try to be healthy generally daily) #1 read the book completely before you start you need to understand the body, diseases, the do's & the don'ts, and things the author describes to do for certain people such as diabetics and things that can be supplemented in certain diseases, allergies, or just sensitivities to the items I mentioned above. I am in the medical field and I believe in alternative therapies more over most modern medicine, and this can prevent, reverse, or stop most disease processes. Of course if you have concerns you can and should consult your doctor, but if your doctor isn't open to your being proactive in treating yourself, maybe you need to find a doctor that is more open minded about CAM, Complimentary & Alternative Medicine.

Your liver makes stones from all this abuse and this flush removes them safely, easily, and effectively. It's easy to do and requires very little monetary investment. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Before doing the flush at the age of 69, I never had gall bladder pains but I could feel my liver that it was firm, not soft. I was lethargic and felt out of sorts. Doing the flush according to the detailed instructions, \\"gallstones\\" appeared floating in the toilet as predicted. There was mild discomfort the night and morning of the flush associated with taking Epsom salt and oil but never pain.Again, following instructions, I repeated this flush once a month until no more stones appeared. This took 15 times although one flush early on did not produce stones because I failed to follow an instruction when I forgot and ate barbecue the day of the flush.Having completed this, I now wake up easily, have more energy and find it easy to enjoy life. This has made the most improvement in my health in many years.

I chose to do the flush as presented in this book. I've done it several times, and my liver has been cleaned out, and several of the gallstones in my gallbladder have come out. I feel great, and have all my body parts intact. I did the flushes because of the gallstones, but it turned out that cleaning out my liver has had a huge effect on my health. I suffered from a severe chronic illness for 8 years. If your liver is congested, any medication you take will do good as the liver cannot process it.So, if you have gallstones and want an alternative to cutting out body parts, try the flush. If you want a good book that will explain the flush in detail, get this book. The author's knowledge of natural health methods is among the best I have come across."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I would like to share my experience with the last three flushes I have completed and slightly scrutinize the claim that the stones expelled are \\"soap stones.\\" I am doing these cleanses every three weeks.The results of my first cleanse were satisfactory. I had a hydrotherapy procedure on the day of the cleanse as recommended by the author and I fasted for that whole day. I drank the first Epsom salt solution at 6 p.m. and, as expected, this made me evacuate, although the evacuation was slightly clear since I had done a colonic that same day and I was fasting. The 8 p.m. solution had a similar outcome. Now on to the queen drink, the olive oil with grapefruit juice: I drank this at the time indicated (10:00 p.m.) and immediately lay down on the bed. In about a minute after drinking the solution I felt something in my liver area. I could actually feel some sort of sliding motion, like little marbles; it was not painful, but the sensation was there. I also heard some weird and loud noises in my stomach which prompted me to go evacuate, which I did. What came out was a brown-yellow evacuation with little brown stones that looked a lot like sesame seeds, some slightly bigger; I passed about 100 of these. I noticed that the smell was not pleasant, not horrible, but again, not pleasant. At this time I asked myself: Where are the nice green stones people were talking about?! All I see are brown little stones! Anyhow, in the morning, at about 5:45 a.m., not even after drinking the third Epsom solution, I evacuated again, and this time I evacuated some bright green stones (about 10) along with the aforementioned little brown stones. Nice! After drinking the third Epsom solution I evacuated more and again after taking the fourth solution. I passed a bunch of bright green stones during the whole time until about 5 p.m. when my evacuation yielded no more stones. It fits to say that the green stones had a very foul odor. I felt quite well during the whole time of the cleanse, since I am used to fasting. No headaches or anything the first time. I also want to mention that after the cleanse I did not do the recommended colonic but still felt okay, but that's my experience and I am sure other people might need it.The second time I was not so lucky. I did everything as indicated and again, after taking the olive oil solution I evacuated promptly. This time there were no stones, not even the little brown ones. Some evacuations followed all the way thorough the morning but was was coming out was only brown stones. In the later evacuations, starting at around 10 a.m., I passed bright green stones. Not as much as the first time, however. During this cleanse I actually felt flu-like symptoms starting during the night and prolonging for three days after the cleanse. I was sneezing and had slight headaches. Also, during those three days my nose was so runny that I had to carry a napkin everywhere I was. This, to me, felt a lot like detox symptoms.The third cleanse was the best of the three. I had a colonic done, as usual, and the first two Epsom solutions yielded a watery, clear, and odorless evacuation which was expected since I had fasted for about two days and had done a colonic that day. When I drank the olive oil solution again I felt some activity in my liver/stomach area similar to the first cleanse but this time I did not feel the urge to evacuate that night. I woke up at about 6 a.m. and evacuated but there were no stones, only clear odorless liquid. After the fourth Epsom drink I evacuated again but again no stones. It was not until about 11:00 a.m. that I felt the urge to evacuate again. This time I was actually surprised. I passed about 12 large green stones along with some brownish liquid. The smell, again, was bad. During the morning I expelled more of these greenish stones. These stones where bigger than the ones I expelled in the previous two cleanses, the largest being about .75 inches in diameter. I did not feel sick this time, all went okay after the cleanse.I want to touch a little bit on the claim that these are soap stones. As I already mentioned, when I drank the olive oil mixture during the first and third cleanse I could actually feel something like marbles in my liver area. If this cleanse did not work, why would I feel that? During the first cleanse I evacuated little brown stones right after taking the mixture, not even a minute into it. Also, mostly during the third cleanse, in the morning I evacuated these big greenish stones along with that yellowish liquid. I was pretty clean the night before, evacuating just clear odorless liquid from the Epsom drink. Where did these smelly stones and brown liquid came from then? If they were merely soap stones then I would suppose that they would not have smelled that bad. What was that yellowish liquid, if not stagnant bile? It surely smelled like it! And also, if they were soap bubbles, I would assume that the three cleanses I have done would of yielded similar amount of stones, since the solutions I drank where exactly the same and in the same quantities, but this was not the case, they all yielded very different amounts of stones. Why did I experience flu-like symptoms exactly beginning the night of the second cleanse? I rarely get a cold, the last one being about 3 years ago.I am a pretty healthy person with no health issues that I know of but after the cleanses I need less food to be satisfied and my skin is also better. I am not trying to persuade anyone to change their minds on this cleanse but merely sharing my experience so that those reading can decide for themselves if they want to proceed with it or not. In the end, if you want to know whether this cleanse works or not, you would be much better off trying it for yourself and then decide. It's cheap, safe, and pain-free, so what can you lose (except for some stones!)? On my side, I will continue with the cleanses.I wish you all a fortunate journey in your quest for better health."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"The author is honest, straight-forward, thorough, and knowledgeable in this field. I believe that religiously following his recommendations and instructions would be far more rewarding and much less expensive than blindly accepting the dreaded alternatives."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I was first introduced to this book in Jan of 2009. I did one cleanse and thought that would be it. However, shortly thereafter, I was participating in a Health Fair conducted for the First Responders of Flight 3407. Many people came to the Fair to support us, meet and thank those who responded that night. I told almost everyone of the Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush. I informed one woman, upon reading her eyes (iridology) that her liver might be a causative factor contributing to her thyroid condition (she subsequently admitted to a thyroid problem since 1992).Well, unlike most others, she purchased The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush by Andreas Moritz and did one. She subsequently called to setup another appointment whereupon she told me that her thyroid condition improved. I have done iridology for 6 years or so and have heard many amazing stories but this one was at the top.Since then she and I have done a liver/gallbladder flush every 3 weeks.

Simple.Michael SuttonRising Sun Yoga, DirectorThe Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"This book is written so well that I was able to understand the concept of how gallstones impact the body without being bogged down with a medical dictionary. This book does not waste time on providing indicators on whether you have gallstones on page six there is a natural non-invasive way to determine whether you have stones are not just by viewing the color of your stool.This book is rich with information,for instance, Chapter 1 conveys the role that gallstones play in certain disorders as well as diseases. Chapter 2 offers a comprehensive guide on determining whether you have stones using the skin, nose, eyes, the tongue, mouth, lips and teeth, hands, nails and feet. Chapter 5 provides guidelines on avoiding gallstones.The author offers his own experience with a gallbladder attack and how the recipes in the book are what \\"he considers the most effective\\". I have read this book about 10 months ago and still I am too chicken to try the flush. I purchased the liquid form of a herb mentioned in the book for apple juice intolerance. And will use this product to dissolve stones as mentioned in the vendor's website from Canada. This will take a year so the flush by all means will be the fastest way to get rid of the stones if you have them."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I'm 63 years old, and have completed 3 flushes, starting about 2 years ago. The first one rendered hundreds, (perhaps up to a thousandstones). My tolerance to apple juice (I purchase Knudson's organic)diminished to zero during my last flush and I could not complete it. However, I decided recently to try again, and after reviewing Moritz' instructions, realized I had forgotten I could dilute the juice. I'm glad to say it is working. I use equal parts of juice and water, (1/2 cup water to 1/2 cup juice, starting at about 7 or 8am each morning).I drink it slowly, and do not eat until after I have consumed the daily quart of juice. My first meal is about 4:30/5pm. I am so glad I did not give up. I have experienced much of the benefits the other 5 star reviewers describe; weight loss, great sense of well being, allergy and sinus relief. Although I do not embrace all his (new age) beliefs, there is much one can learn from this book. I also am challenged to do more flushes within a year because of what I've read in these reviews. I'm convinced there is even better health awaiting me as I do what it takes to keep my liver & gallbladder clean. I highly recommend this book. As others have said, the flush is inexpensive & easy compared to gallbladder surgery. My sister-n-law recommended this book to me. She avoided a hystorectomy and gallbladder surgery several years ago because of this flush. Some of the stones she passed were the size of golf balls."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Andreas Moritz never fails to hold my interest. i have another one of his books that is also fantastic. this book is very helpful and the flush really works!!! if you want to feel better and improve your health than you NEED to read this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I have just completed my 3rd cleanse according to the book by Andreas Moritz. Today I passed 24 marble sized gallstones, 6 of which were larger than a quarter.(March 28, 2010) I am completely amazed, and now I know why I had gallbladder pain. I am going to continue with the cleanses to get all the stones out that might be in my liver or gallbladder, but am here to say that it works. I am very happy that I was able to get rid of my gallstones in a natural, surgery free way. I am completely amazed that these stones were in my body and I was able to get them out.During the cleanse I felt pressure from the stones travelling down the bile duct, but no pain. Amazing considering that the stones I passed were as big as quarters, and the bile duct is as big as a straw. I recommend this book and this method for cleansing your body of gallstones, and I do think it is wise to buy the book and read it because it may not be the best solution for everyone, and there are things you may need to be cautious about. Definitely cheaper than gallbladder surgery.I have done much research on this subject before purchasing this book, and felt very confident that I had done my homework before I started my cleanses. I am truly a believer in this method as people would have had surgery for less gallstones than I passed today. When I was passing the large gallstones, I felt a bit of pressure as the stones travelled down the bile duct, but no pain. This is definetly something you want to be careful about, but if you follow his instructions exactly, you should also have good results.I have suffered from liver/gallbladder symptoms for over 10 years and this was the first thing I have done to effectively get rid of the stones. I am excited to keep going and see how many more I can get out of my gallbladder! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Last summer, around my 54th birthday, I had a terrible gall bladder \\"attack\\". I had purchased this book several years ago from my accupuncurist, but had not followed the advice. When my doctor informed me in the emergency room that I had Gall stones and needed to have my gall bladder removed, it was definitely a wake up call for me. I thought to myself \\"I need my gall bladder\\" or I wouldn't have it in the first place. Then I was told that I needed to wait for the surgery because my liver was a bit swollen. I was released from the hospital 4 days later. I had a conversation with my family and decided to re-read the liver and gall bladder book and see what that was all about. Well, I did the cleanse and was followed days later by my ever so supportive husband and then a few weeks later by my two adult semi-reluctant sons.I must admit that the anxiety leading up to the cleanse was oh so much worse than the cleanse itself. I won't say it was easy but it wasn't hard.My husband and I happened to have a rare moment alone while driving shortly after taking the cleanse and I said to him that I hated to brag about it but I felt so good, it was almost euphoric. He looked at me and smiled because we both knew how awful I felt and what a horrible bilious attitude I had before the cleanse. We have both done another and I am getting ready for my third one. The boys have done one cleanse each and my oldest son won the prize for the largest stone passed!I have highly recomended this cleanse to anyone who will listen to me because it has totally changed my life as well as my family.Anyone who falsely accuses Dr. Moritz should really try this cleanse, it may change their outlook on the whole picture.Therefore, I have read other books by Dr. Moritz and am really seeing how conditioned we are to believe certain things. I would put my trust in Dr. Moritz any day, because it is now 7 months since my hospitalization and my \\"surgeon\\" has yet to give me a call to schedule my surgery. I think that when she does, I'll pass! Thank you Dr. Moritz, keep on keepin' on. Pollyd"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"My doctor insisted on gallbladder removal. I didn't want to go through with it, but I needed serious help. I had 4 gallbladder attacks and everything I ate caused me pain. I have gone through 5 cleanses already, and I can feel a huge difference. No pain, I can eat! My arthritis and gout are gone too! I have more energy, feel happy and healthy. I was especially amazed by how easy and painless this process is. At first I was very scared to take that amount of oil since I had been experiencing such pain from anything I ate. No pain, no discomfort whatsoever. I have to laugh when I think how scared I was at first.I recommended this book to my mother who is in her 80's, my sister who has high cholesterol, and my best friend with liver pain and arthritis. They are people I love dearly, and that is precisely why I recommended them to follow this cleanse.I feel great respect for the medical profession, but doctors do not know everything. Take the helm of your own health!If you need an answer to a prayer, this is it. Thank you SO MUCH, Andreas!"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"I was up against it with a gallbladder that would not let me eat for up to 9 days sometimes. After a week of getting back into meditation this book appeared in my life through my Naturalpathic Doctor. I finally got up the courage to try it. Scared to death, but it worked. A bunch of little soft stones came out and I felt better immediately. I could eat whatever I wanted but of course have worked on eating way less animal foods ever since. I have gotten 3/4 of the way through the whole process of flushing all the stones out and the whole gallbladder problem keeps improving. Pretty amazing!I also have had amazing results from a phone consult from him when I had a terrible and scary chest and head cold just days before I going on a vacation. I was afraid I might have to go to the hospital cause my breathing was getting so blocked from congested lungs I assume. He said to flex my toes back a certain way and put pressure on the balls of my feet--something like that--, take some Vit. D ( short term) and put some Vicks salve on the bottom of my feet at night. There was some other herb he suggested but my husband could not find it, but the flexing thing, within literally seconds had diminished the difficulty of breathing by about 40-60% so I stopped panicking. It again, was amazing.I see that he is under attack for being a quack but I tell you first hand you he is not a quack and quite the opposite which is most probably why he is a threat to some. Sad, cause he has such grass roots knowledge of how to support your body to heal and get healthier.

The description of what to expect was excellent. I fell great emotionally and physically. I fell renewed and energized. I definitely will follow the recommendation of repeating the flush for several months. On internet you will find blogs saying that what comes out is just a bile from the liver mixed with the oil. I find that this is incorrect due to fact that I was not able to do the flush on six's day and extended the days of preparation. I noticed that the greenish, floating substance stared to come out on 8 th day of preparation diet. This is consistent with nutritionist M. Tombak who's recommendation I often follow. Tombak state that the flush could be accomplish with beats and apple juice only, but it takes longer. Dr Tombak's books were my health bible , now I will add Dr Moritz's book.

I feel more better and energetic."},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"My intent for this review is not to bash this book, but to encourage people to do some research before trying natural remedies on their body, especially if they could be dangerous. I have not read this book or performed this cleansing procedure so I rated it a neutral 3 stars. I was considering this natural cleanse until I found this article. After reading it, I wondered to myself, if this cleansing is so simple and it really works, then why didn't my GI doctor mention it when I asked about any alternative approaches to removing gallstones besides gallbladder removal. After running it by my doctor, he was in agreement with this article.[...]Dear Dr. Klaper,I was advised by my health practitioner to do a \\"gallbladder flush,\\" consisting of drinking 16 ounces of olive oil followed by a 1/2 pint of lemon juice. I have a family history of gallstones - do you feel this \\"gallbladder flush\\" would be a good idea?-- S.G.Dear S.G.:At the risk of offending some practitioners in the alternative healing community who believe in \\"gallbladder flushes,\\" I feel that such a technique is probably useless - and in some cases, hazardous.The oil/lemon juice combination has been used for over 200 years to convince people that they have cleansed their gallbladder of gallstones. If you were to ingest such a mixture, the following morning you would probably observe thick chips of whitish materials in your feces. Your health practitioner would likely believe that their therapy was effective and tell you that the whitish chips were \\"broken up gallstones.\\" In reality, both you and the practitioner would have witnessed a physiological parlor trick...As all first-year chemistry students learn, when you combine a fat with an acid, the fat turns into soap - a classic saponification reaction. The \\"broken up gallstones\\" in the feces are actually chips of olive oil soap, created in the intestine by the action of acid (the citric acid in the lemon juice) upon fat (the olive oil). To those unaware of the underlying chemistry, the appearance can look like a spectacular \\"cure,\\" when it is merely an illusion of a \\"gallbladder cleanse.\\" (Incidentally, this is probably where the term \\"snake oil\\" got its reputation, as this stunt has been employed by patent medicine purveyors since days of old. The \\"snake oil\\" that \\"broke up the gallstones\\" was really olive or similar oil - and those who perpetrated this \\"soapy\\" ruse were justifiably labeled \\"snake oil salesmen.\\")From the preceding, you can see why I believe that the \\"gallbladder flush\\" is without benefit to health. The element of risk - and even danger - enters when there are actual gallstones in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small sac on the undersurface of the liver, just below the lower front margin of the right rib cage. The gallbladder stores bile between meals and contracts in response to the presence of fat in our food as it leaves the stomach on its journey of digestion down the small intestine.Swallowing several ounces of pure olive oil at one sitting makes for a very large, fatty meal - and such a great load of fat could potentially trigger a sustained, severe contraction of the gallbladder. If there are actual stones contained inside the gallbladder, such a forceful contraction could result in an excruciating bout of right upper quadrant abdominal pain for the owner of the gallbladder - and a possible unplanned trip to the operating room for an emergency cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder).If you strongly believe that you suffer from gallstones, I would advise you to ask your physician about having an ultrasound scan of your gallbladder performed. This non-invasive scan, using sound waves to make a picture of the gallbladder and its contents, can verify whether your gallbladder really does contain stones. (Incidentally, the proper name for stones is \\"calculi.\\") If calculi are found, you should talk to your physician about possible causes and treatments. (Sometimes formation of gallstones is a sign of serious medical conditions that require therapy, such as obesity, diabetes, intestinal disease, excessively high levels of cholesterol in the blood, etc. These conditions need to be diagnosed and properly treated.) Whatever the cause, in this physician's opinion, swallowing several large gulps of olive oil in the presence of gallstones is not a smart idea - and may well be asking for trouble.One plan of action - or non-action - is to realize that you can live to a ripe old age with stones in your gallbladder. If they are not causing you any distress (\\"silent stones\\"), a low-fat, low-refined sugar diet might be all that you require to avoid painful gallstone attacks. Up to 30% of people with a painful gallstone episode never suffer another recurrence. Watchful waiting is an appropriate choice - especially after the diagnosis is first made - and if the only distress you feel from your gallstones is a small twinge of discomfort every year or two, that might be an acceptable price to pay to avoid surgery.There are oral medications capable of dissolving small gallstones. However, such a stone-dissolving regimen can be a prolonged process, requiring pills several times daily for months - and which has a 50% rate of the stones re-forming once the medicine has been discontinued. A faster method, requiring but 24 hours, involves placing a small tube into the gallbladder, and irrigating with stone-dissolving medications. Your physician can refer you to a specialist skilled in this technique.Finally, if your gallbladder has become a chronically inflamed, stone-filled, fibrotic little bag, causing frequent episodes of severe abdominal pain, you probably would be better off having it out. Fortunately, the \\"bad old days\\" of gallbladder surgery - with its lengthy, painful incision across the right upper quadrant of the abdomen - are essentially over. Surgically removing a gallbladder through a \\"keyhole\\" incision via a laparoscope has made this operation much less risk-filled and uncomfortable. In most cases, it requires only an overnight stay in the hospital. In some surgical centers, it has become a \\"daycare procedure,\\" allowing the person to sleep in their own bed at home the same evening of the surgery. Return to work in three to seven days following laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not unusual.(In case you are wondering, the digestive system functions quite well without a gallbladder. The bile, normally stored in the gallbladder between meals, is instead excreted steadily from the liver, through the common bile duct and into the intestine. In the gut, the bile does its work facilitating digestion of fats, and then is absorbed through the intestinal wall and returned, via the bloodstream, to the liver. There it is filtered from the blood and then excreted once again into the intestine - an \\"endless loop\\" system.)In summary, if you think that you have gallstones, find out for sure. If you do, pay attention to which foods seem to set off the painful episodes, avoid them as best you can, and you and your gallbladder - stones and all - may yet achieve peaceful coexistence. If that is not possible, seek a definitive medical or surgical treatment - but I strongly advise you to stay clear of \\"snake oil cures.\\"---end of article---For what it's worth......Star Elton"},{"Title":"The Amazing Liver & Gallbladder Flush","review":"Absolutely amazing information and it works!

This is the best commentary on 1st Corinthians ever produced."},{"Title":"The Book of 1 Corinthians: Christianity in a Hostile Culture (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"The Church at Corinth was far from the ideal model of a first-century apostolic church. It had been planted in one of the most difficult and challenging cities in the Roman world. The Greek word korinthiazomai (literally, \\"to act the Corinthian\\") in fact came to mean \\"to commit fornication.\\" It was to this burgeoning young church, with all of its potential and all of its problems, that Paul wrote his first letter to the Corinthians.The fundamental question Paul confronted wherever he carried the gospel was this: \\"How can those who have been called to belong to Christ be faithful to their new Lord while they must still belong, in so many ways, to this present age?\\" What church of any age has not struggled with this question?The challenges facing the new community of believers in Corinth were not unlike the challenges facing the twenty-first century church. The issues of church unity, sexual immorality, marriage, divorce, litigiousness, modesty, authority, spiritual gifts, and hope are issues every church deals with while confronting the day-to-day problems of modern-day Christians who still struggle to live clean in Corinth. As the great apostle speaks to them regarding matters of Christian faith, life, and ministry, so he speaks clearly and loudly to us with them. thus he would remind us of the gospel \\"by which . . .[we] are saved\\" (15:2). Then he would challenge our generation to be \\"stedfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord\\" (15:58).Dr. Daniel R.

LaVey does it, Webb does it, Flowers does it, and Shott does it as well. There's just one problem. When I read such proclamations from someone claims to be working on their own self-deification, and I find glaring grammatical errors, extremely awkward sentences, and the total abandonment of correct punctuation, it makes me wonder exactly how careful such an individual is with other areas of their life. Yes Ross, grooming is important, but so is the ability to facilitate coherent communication. The Dark Arts of Immortality is an absolutely necessary book for someone traversing the Left Hand Path, and it's full of thought provoking and useful information. It is clear that Shott knows what he is talking about and that he's been on the path for some time. That being said, the overall delivery of the information in the book stinks. One of two things is the case. The diction of the work is deliberately twisted to force the reader to untangle it in order to understand it and/or to force them away from it because of their own lack of intelligence if they don't (which is the answer that I'm sure you will get if someone pins him down on this subject; these guys love to think that their inability to write well is actually an obstacle to weed out the \\"stupid\\") or, the work suffers from hasty assembly and a lack of editing. My money is on the second one. So, if you are on the \\"via sinistrae\\" buy the book, use it and grow. Just be forewarned that even your high school English teacher would cringe at Shott's butchery of the English language."},{"Title":"The Dark Arts of Immortality: Transformation Through War, Sex, & Magic","review":"Mr Shott's work could be considered groundbreaking stuff. Not once in 25+ years of shelf shopping have I seen a book that melds together the concepts and ideals that 'Dark Arts' puts together. Personal transformation is certainly lacking in today's pagan movements. This book doesn't bother assisting you with yet one more convenient label to stick on yourself for the narrow-minded purpose of self-gratification. It tells you to get off your ass, think for yourself, DO for yourself and change yourself to that elevated True state of being that we should all be at and, yet, most of us are not. Buy this book.

Most of the book (more than half) consists of the author explaining and justifying why you should use his approach to magic. The last 1/3 is his \\"how-to\\" which breaks down to fight as much as you can, have as much sex as you can, and consider flagellating yourself so as to experience rapture.Some of his psychology is accurate. But for the most part this book was not helpful to me. It is dark. My intuitive reaction was that this is not the path (at least not for me).That said if you are a \\"HE-man\\", into combat, into kinky, have an affiliation to Norse mythology or are just dark yourself, this might be the book for you."},{"Title":"The Dark Arts of Immortality: Transformation Through War, Sex, & Magic","review":"Have you ever picked up a book and after a few minutes realized you had just found something that would CHANGE you forever?

Having a personal metaphysical library built over 13 years and which exceeds 300 volumes I can proudly say this new work by Ross G. H. Shott is solidly in the best of the best, the top 2%.It is truly is one of a kind. You're not going to find anything else like it out there. Earnest reader, you need THIS book.Its pages smolder with findings from the author's hard-won knowledge. And from them you will know that Shott is a daring spiritual seeker who will not be daunted. I have been fortunate enough to personally meet the author, and I can say without any hesitation that he is solid, centered, and real! Unlike many alleged occult experts, Ross G. H. Shott has spent years in deep study, practice, pain, and self-discipline to achieve a soundness of thought and practice which he has assimilated and refined -- and now released to us here in the real world of the 21st century!!!And whereas most authors find themselves too intimidated to ruthlessly pursue these arts, Shott has not only pursued, but mastered all three! And what lies beyond that? beyond such mastery? Well, The Dark Arts of Immortality shows you. How can its author do that? By his passionate and precise deployment of all three of these arts in the service of the greatest pursuit of human consciousness - the attainment of Immortality!!!If you've read this far then you already realize the value of this mighty text. But what are you going to DO about it? You're not the type to let this opportunity get past you...

The overall tone of the book lacked a cycle of good points mirrored with some scholastic understanding beyong modern interpretations of magickal systems that I usually look for. He was able to emphasize original ideas among the many quotes of accomplished masters, but Shott wanted to 'shoot' (pun intended![inside joke for those having already read it!]) all of his accumulated knowledge at me at one constant stream of regurgitated LHP philosophy with, again, an overabundant measure of quotes from LaVey, Flowers, etc. It just seemed to 'skim the surface' mostly and the recipe for attainment of the esoteric sort can be found in most Chaos Magic treatises and within LHP organization literature. I made the mistake of bypassing the homework one should normally embark upon about authors of books of this nature, as I was hungry for something new. This is the only book this guy's written, and it shows. His understanding of the origin LHP and RHP is skewed when drawn from Hindu Tantra's definition of the two. LHP tantra is not so much 'antinomian' but more the difference between performing the Pancha Makra, for instance, literally (LHP) or figuratively (RHP). Norse mythology does not appeal to me personally due to the extreme unlikelyhood of finding enthusiasts beyond neo-national socialist movements and wiccans... blah!... aside from Runa Raven publications and Stephen Flowers' cryptic writings. Nonetheless, it is a contribution to a cohesive western LHP philosophical system, and in that regard only, would I pescribe this book."},{"Title":"The Dark Arts of Immortality: Transformation Through War, Sex, & Magic","review":"I don't know anything about the occult and I'm about as mystic as a block of wood.

It isn't a large tomb, about a day of energized reading. All in all I found it entertaining but a bit too much of an overly quoted essay. Obviously a lot of time was spent finding good quotes; they make up maybe a third of the total text. The fact I was encouraged to drop and do some push-ups was entertaining and I like the stance of physical fitness locked within an occult model. I disagree perhaps with the idea that the Church of Satan is in any way a 'school' and that LaVey was quoted extensively in an antinominalist arena with the tenants of a promulgation of a post death 'soul' or ego. I didn't give it 4 stars though because I disagree with the author. I specifically rated it higher because I liked being challenged. I couldn't give it a full five stars though because it didn't really have a stabilized content in the way it sold itself. It has some facets of a \`system', but is more a philosophical presentation with suggestions. The author is obviously a runer and uses the philosophy of such as a backbone of the presentation while suggesting the reader find there own system to stick to.

For occultists who desire to live forever but don't have the werewithal to become vampires, this path offers an alternate path to unending life, one which I enjoyed studying and making use of in my daily life. I was a little put off, though, at the large amount of time spend describing why the author's methods work, and the relatively small amount of the method itself. A future edition might think about a little less boasting and a little more manual reference.

The problem is that the good and useful stuff is cleverly hidden amongst a substantial amount of useless psycho babble and egotism.I found my copy of The dark Arts of Immortality at a used book store for a few dollars, and generally speaking I think the book to be a worthy read (but needing better editing, as is typical with all too many books these days). Anyone who has an honest interest in having a well-rounded perspective of arcana, obscura and the elsewise occult should read this book, and then follow it with a dose of Franz Bardon, Nevill Drury, Ralph Metzner, Terence McKenna, Stanislav Grof, Frater U.D., and Manly P. Hall just for good measure. Too much Left Hand Path is as counter-productive as too much Right Hand Path, so I suggest that a would-be magus also explore paths of other colors entirely, especially the Psychoactive Green path to where the entheogens grow.Take all this, combine it with a knowledge of memes, a cup full of archetypes, two scoops of Information theory, a dash of Game theory, some diced egregore, a scoop of corporate metabolism (Paco Xander Nathan), and stir fry it all together with a little Milton Erickson and Richard Bandler thrown in for the hell of it. Salt and pepper it to taste with William Cooper (Behold A Pale Horse) and serve atop a bed of esoteric tarot (Robert V. O'Neal) and a side order of Meru Foundation torus knots - and Vola!

First of all, it takes place in the present time and &quot;real&quot; world: no dragons to fight or spaceships to fly. Second, it is based on genuinely creepy stuff ala &quot;Amityville Horror&quot; and &quot;The Exorcist&quot;: grotesque demons, fanatic cultists and dark rituals. The plot and story itself are scary: putting it in a gamebook with you in the middle elevates it to another level! Don't read this one alone, even with the lights on!"},{"Title":"House of Hades (Fighting Fantasy)","review":"I bought this book at a garage sale in NJ almost 20 years ago. I must have flipped through it thousands of times playing it. It is a great \\"choose your own adventure\\" book.It takes place at a derelict house in the remote English countryside where the occupants seem like a throwback to the 18th century, with supernatural and demonic forces lying in wait for you.I liked this book so much, that I went through the arduous process of typing out each page into an HTML editor and made a web-based game from it for my own use, so that instead of wearing down the book and having to flip through it constantly, I just sit at my computer and click the page links."},{"Title":"House of Hades (Fighting Fantasy)","review":"... So begins your adventure in House of Hades, Steve Jackon's excellent Fighting Fantasy horror gamebook. The entire adventure has you trying to survive the horrors of this vile mansion, desperate to find a way out. However, not all that you encounter will be evil... The gamebook is well written, with many encounters that are delightfully scary; so much so that there is a \\"FEAR\\" score to keep track of. Each time you get frightened, you add points to your fear score. If it reaches a certain amount (one roll of a die plus 6, determined before you begin), then you are frightened to death, and the adventure is over. All in all, House of Hades is one of the better Fighting Fantasy gamebooks. The ending even provides a surprise twist."},{"Title":"House of Hades (Fighting Fantasy)","review":"I bought this book back in the 1980s, when I was into the Fighting Fantasy series by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone. I own 12 of the books, and this is the worst one I've read (Ian Livingstone's books are generally better the Steve Jackson's). Reason: It's insanely difficult and poorly written, and obviously was not play-tested before publishing. The number of choices leading to inescapable death-traps in this book are way too frequent. The clues that should be present to help you defeat the game are too infrequent and too unhelpful. For example (WARNING! SPOILERS): you may learn that in order to defeat \\"The Master\\" (final boss), you need to find the \\"Kris Knife\\". So far, so good. But are there any clues about where to look for this item? No, not one. If you do manage to find it, it won't be because you skillfully pieced together clues and figured out where to find it. It will be because you got lucky. Weak, very weak.In addition, there is the totally unnecessary addition of a \\"Fear\\" trait, which adds yet another way for the game to kill you in a cheap and annoying way. Basically, your \\"Maximum Fear\\" value ranges between 7 and 12 (depending on your die roll when you generate a character). You gain Fear points every time something scary happens in the book, which is usually about 50% of all encounters. If your Fear value rises to its maximum, you are \\"frightened to death\\" and it's game over. It sounds like it would be a flavorful and fun addition to the game system, but when damn near everything scares you . . . well, let's just say that if you rolled a 7 as your maximum Fear value, there is no way you can win the game because the mandatory encounters that you need to have in order to defeat the game will push you well past the 7 Fear that will be fatal to you (the final boss battle increases your Fear value by 3 points, and there is no way to avoid this). As I said, it clearly wasn't play-tested.Also, the instructions encourage you to make a map as you play, so that if you die on the first play-through (which WILL happen, unless you are very, very lucky), you can go use the map on your subsequent play-throughs. Fair enough, except that the writing is in places so poor that I wasn't certain whether my character had exited through a door that hadn't been mentioned in the room description, whether I had gone back the way I came, or whether I had mysteriously teleported to the next location. All of which makes for a needlessly frustrating experience.IF you have a great deal of patience and don't mind committing yourself to several play-throughs in an attempt to beat the game, then go ahead and give it a try. Otherwise, I recommend passing this one up."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I am a fifteen-year old homosexal teengr living in north Texas, or what is sometimes called &quot;the Bible Belt.&quot; My parents are Christian, but they were not near as bad as Stuart Howell Miller's parents were. I was very pleased to find out he reacted the way he did towards his parents hostile and abusive threats. Stuart Howell Miller is definetely a pituresque portrayl of how God wants us to treat others- with love and respect, even if we don't agree with them. Because, above all, love is the most important thing."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I read this book in 24 hours. It's like Stuart was writing about my upbringing. I too would love to share with my parents that I am gay, but our fundementalist background prevents that. I know that my coming out would result in a situation similar to Stuart's, yet I hate to lie to them. And as Shakespeare would say, &quot;There's the rub.&quot; The Bible says that liars shall have their share of the lake of fire. At least Stuart isn't a liar. He told his family the truth about his life. To his sister and sister-in-law who I have noticed have written responses to this work here at Amazon.com, do you love Stuart? Do you truely love him? It sure seems like you are still bent on judging him rather than showing Christ's unconditional love to him. I love my family and know that someday I will have to tell them the truth. I don't want to be a liar any longer to them. I just pray daily that their reaction will not be the same as the Miller family's reaction, but deep down...I know it will be, and that frightens me to death."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I was amazed in this book of a family's capacity to hate and to teach hate. I have heard about the beliefs of Fundamentalist Christians, but it was really hard to read. Miller did well in his book to explain, understand and respect his parents belief systems. He did not waste time condemning them, instead he persuaded the reader to look at their side of the argument as well as his.The book was written fairly and honestly with Miller adding a lot of personal information that I am sure was difficult to write. He should be commended for having the courage to write this book."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"This book is truly special. It describes exactly what a &quot;Christian&quot; family does to &quot;change&quot; a gay son. Very well written, lots of emotions. A very good book."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Stuart... I read your book from cover to cover in less than 48 hours.. I found it very compelling and thoughtful, and especially appreciate the honesty and intellect you displayed in writing it. I think that it is a real human tragedy when people mis-use the power of prayer. Unfortunately, a day will come when these people will have to answer for that sin, too. The book was very well written, and I would highly recommend it. Definitely worth writing a sequel!"},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"As a Christian I know the power of prayer. After reading Prayer Warriors I now know another side of that power. We've seen prayer as healing, now we can see prayer as harming. Why? Because Stuart Miller's parents went beyond praying for their son, they used prayer to condemn their son, to attack who he was. As a Christian I was disgusted and disturbed by the treatment Stuart received from his parents. A faith based around love, grace, and focused on Jesus Christ shouldn't treat a son this way. On the other side, As a gay man I was sadened by this story. One would hope that nothing could tear apart the bond between a child and his parents. Is it any wonder so many people stay in the closet? I'm greatful that Stuart Miller took the time to tell his story. Your friends may leave you, your relatives may leave you, your prarents may disown you or attack you with prayer, but God still loves us all. While I may not agree with Stuart Miller on some theological issues, I do agree with the bottom line, that gay or straight, we all truly can come to God, just as we are."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"There aren't many books by gay and lesbian people who grew up in fundamentalist Christian families.Most people have no idea of the level of fear and loss involved with coming out in these families. This book made me feel heard and sane. One thing this book talked about that I have not seen acknowledged elsewhere is that most non-fundamentalists who have come out will say, &quot;Your parents will come around.&quot;We even start to believe that this must be true, although we know on some level our families are different. Real different.Our parents cannot &quot;get there&quot; for the most part. My parents finally have a relationship with me, just barely.The other thing I especially appreciated about this book was that it dealt with the &quot;forces of evil&quot; focus of these churches. [The only other book I've seen that addressed this was Jeanette Winterson's &quot;Oranges are not the Only Fruit,&quot; a classic.]For all the talk of love, conservative churches put a lot of energy into fear of evil. Some churches say being gay is demon possession. Others literally believe God may strike us dead.Mr. Miller endured numerous veiled threats to his life from Christians. It's bizarre and if you've been there, it's frightening, because you know these people will do anything they truly believe is God's will. But it was good to read someone else's story acknowledging that this goes on."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Any gay person raised in a church community will identify with large parts of the author's story. And since few of us have been accepted by everyone in our families, the effect of Miller's coming out on various relationships offers material for reflection as well. He was strengthened more than he knows by his realization (not his deccision) that 'going back' wasn't an option. It is important to evaluate this for what it is: a personal memoir, not great literature. But it really could have used an editor, as much for grammar as for style. All in all, a very whorthwhile book to read."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Prayer Warriors is heart-breaking. It is an amazing book about a one man's struggle to overcome the effects of his family's abuse of God and their lack of compassion when he comes out as a gay man. This book illistrates that sometimes Christianity is used as a weapon of hate and not love."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"How fortunate for Stuart and his family that he came out to them at a time in his life when he had formed a second &quot;family&quot; of friends and coworkers.If he'd been a teen (without that outside support system) when he made his announcement and was confronted by the &quot;prayer war&quot;, he may very well have gone the route of suicide. I certainly respect the rights of Stuart's family to disagree with his &quot;lifestyle&quot;, their right to pray for his salvation, and even their right to believe that he is living a sinful life. Instead of approaching him with love and compassion, however, they've chosen to try to bring him back into &quot;the fold&quot; with a campaign of venom and hate. Perhaps they should ask themselves, &quot;What would Jesus do?&quot;"},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Coming out to your friends may be one thing, but coming out to your coworkers and family is another matter entirely. This book is a strong argument that it may be better not to come out to your family at all unless you want to permanently burn bridges and discard all of your past and any future contact with them. Which is what happens here. There is no happy resolution, no coming around by the author's parents and relatives to accept him as he is and understand he has always been. As for the book itself, I kept expecting to read a climactic chapter describing personal confrontations or verbal or even physical assaults on the author by his closed-minded family's church associates, but it never comes: almost everything after his initial revelation to his family was written back and forth in letters, with a few phone calls thrown in here and there. I do feel for the author for going through this bad experience, but I have heard horror stories far worse than the story here, perpetrated by both so-called &quot;Christian&quot; families and secular friends. And that's the point, there's just not that much of a remarkable story here to write an entire book about. Not yet, anyway."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"After reading about this book in a magazine interview, I was anxious for it to be released, because my own background seemed to be similar to that of the author. I anticipated the release of the book so much that I even tried to get a pre-release copy. The publicity for the book sounds as if the book will be exciting and that the book will provide new insight about dealing with fundamentalist family members. Actually, this book is quite boring; it's a quick read with large type and wide margins. To say that I'm disappointed is a big understatement...the book isn't bad, it's just blah. If you have to read it, borrow it, but don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"This man is mad at his parents for having rules when he was growing up. They took him to church and had meals together each night. He had a time to go to bed and a time to get up. Doesn't sound like the parents were too weird. They practiced their faith, studied the bible and had guidelines to follow and chores to do. As soon as he left home, he got into heavy drinking and doing cocaine. Later into a homosexual lifestyle. Once he decided to tell his parents they were not excited about his choices. He says being gay was not his choice but was not clear if the cocaine and drinking were. Now he is older but seems to want to fault his parents. After he told them he was gay they told him they loved him but could not condone his lifestyle. They ask several friends to pray for their son and write him as they would their own. These letters really mad him so now he will take on the prayer warriors by influencing as many as possible to be gay. It seems he is looking for converts. The sad part is this story does not have a happy ending. He seems to be more miserable than ever. Maybe he should try praying for those he is so mad at. A very sad and lonely story."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"This is a story that many Gay and Lesbian people can relate too and unfortunately it happens all too often. But there were some things that really bothered me. I am a Christian Lesbian and am currently in Seminary. My goal is too reach out to my community with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I feel Mr.Miller's book hurt my cause more than helped. I am not one to judge another person's walk with the Lord, but based on the facts of the book Mr. Miller seems to think that being a Christian only means being a good person who tries to do the right things. Well, Mr. Miller that is not what a Christian is. I think it's a horrible what your family has done to you. But Mr. Miller, a Christian believes on Jesus Christ and that Jesus is the ONLY WAY for salvation,what does the Bible say Mr. Miller?. Being a nice guy has nothing to do with it! I am happy you are a nice, clean, honest young man Mr. Miller, but are you a Christian? Again, please I am not judging you, only God and you can answer that. It's time in this country for a book to be written by the many gays and lesbians out there who are Christians who love the Lord Jesus Christ with all the hearts who have suffered endlessly and needlessly at the hands of the Heterosexual Christian world. The ones who want to serve the Lord with their whole hearts and souls and believe He is the only way, but have been kicked out of their churches and Bible schools. WE NEED TO READ THEIR STORIES if we are going to make an impact on on hate and discrimination that happens in the name of God. Born again Christian gay and lesbians are really out there!!!!! And I am one! We need to show the world that we gay and lesbians can and do know the Lord we are not under a delusion."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"As the sister-in-law of the author, and after reading the other reviews, I feel I must have my say about this book. From the moment the book arrived in the mail from Stuart, I began reading it. Almost from page one, I found so many inconsistencys and half truths I had a hard time giving the book the benefit of the doubt. I feel that I have an advantage over the other readers, in that I was there when all this was happening. Basically the book chronicles the author's unhappiness, alcohol and cocaine abuse, and promiscuity ad nauseum. Much more than I wanted to know about someone's personal life, anyone's personal life. He is bitter, it seems, because his parents had the gall to actually pray for him. These were not prayers and letters of condemnation. OK, maybe they did not want to accept his lifestyle , that is their right. Just as it is his right, he says, to chose his own lifestyle. These people, who I deal with everyday, never once banished him from their life. That was his choice. I cannot feel sorry for someone whose parents are concerned about a son's reckless choice of living, as the book so chronicles. I, as others seem to have been~ was not fooled for one minute."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I must from the start admit that I am the author's sister. Therefore, my opinion may be a bit biased since I know firsthand the whole truth of these so called &quot;prayer warriors.&quot; My main concern is that strangers are being deceived concerning our parents. They are wonderful, loving, Christian people who only want the best for their children. Since when has it been wrong to pray for your children and let them know that they, along with others, are routing for you? The author should be thankful that his name is being mentioned to God by so many people on a daily basis. The book is obviously written out of bitterness and not love, which is ironic since that is what the author is so diligently seeking. True love would not write such a slanderous book. As for the spiritual aspect of the book, I believe the author is very confused about true Christianity and what God's Word says. Therefore it is dangerous to those who are not strong in their faith. Readers, please read God's Word for yourselves to form your own opinion."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I just finished reading the book, and was very moved by it. This book illustrates very well how many &quot;religious&quot; people ignore the message of Love that their faiths are based on in order to impose their judgments on others. Throughout the book Mr. Miller is very funny and candid, and he demonstrates a great deal of patience and understanding. His frank discussion of his coming-out experiences will ring true to anyone who has had to balance their desire to be true to themselves with their desire to maintain peace and harmony in their (perhaps intolerant) families. Reading the book was an affirmative experience for me, and I think that it would do a lot of people (children and parents) good to read it."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Prayer Warriors is a tragic story, to be sure. Stuart's story of coming out as gay to his fundamentalist family and their pained, seemingly heartless response is hard to read. The conflict between Stuart and his family is easy to understand and frustrating to witness; it lays bare the problem that so many people have with fundamentalism - that it so often forces its followers to decide between what they believe and who they love. Stuart has my sympathy (and indeed, my empathy) for having to deal with this at all in the first place.Despite my heart going out to him, however, my head had a hard time understanding exactly where he was coming from. It seems that many of Stuart's negative experiences were a result of either expecting the worst in a given situation or reacting as negatively as possible. Although certainly he is treated appallingly by his family and former church, Stuart rarely takes any personal responsibility for his own reactions to how others treat him. I felt conflicted when reading: although it was obvious that what his family was doing to him was atrocious, it was just as obvious that Stuart did not exercise the self-control necessary to come away from the experience with anything other than self-indulgent pity.I was not disappointed by the book's \\"lack of a resolution\\" as another reviewer was; in real life, we oftentimes lack true resolutions to true problems such as the ones found here in the Miller family. However, I do have a problem that Stuart chose to share his story when it is obvious he is still deeply disturbed by it; that he seeks to teach an audience about what he learned when it is so clear he has not yet learned everything he should have from his experience.And who am I to know what Stuart should or should not have learned from this? Just a reader, like any other, drawing my own conclusions from what was presented to me in the pages of this book. That, I think, is this book's final failure: although it is heartwrenching and brutally honest about his personal feelings and experiences, it does not convince its readers of Stuart's ultimate rightness. Stuart, then, comes off as eminently human, but hardly as somebody we should have spent 192 learning from. His honesty is appreciated and his story is truly tragic, but his authority feels hollow."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Bravo to Stuart Howell Miller!I just completed Mr. Miller's book and I must say it is very well written and to the point. As an openly gay man and a recovering fundamentalist &quot;Christian&quot; who has since found what the true Peace of God means in my life, I am amazed at his honesty and sincerity as he relates how his family chose to react to the news of his homosexuality. As good as their intentions may be , we must remember that &quot;the road to hell is paved with good intentions&quot;.I recommend this book to anyone who needs to learn that the only true healing there is begins within. We can no longer afford to point the finger and say &quot;you caused me this misory&quot;. We can only make ourselves miserable. Stuart seems to have learned this lesson. I pray that his family will follow suit.Thank you Stuart for the valuable lesson in forgiveness and many blessings to you and your family. You now have a new &quot;prayer (peaceful) warrior&quot;."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Three words for Mr's Miller's family: love, compassion and forgiveness for this is the true work of Christians. Trying to change someone's homosexuality should not be anyones business; just my point of view."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Prayer Warriors tells a mesmerizing, and superficially sad, tale of what happened when one son came out to his dysfunctional and fundamentalist family, and how rather than let that ruin his life, he grew and created a new family, as many gay men and lesbians have had to do. The book is beautifully written, and reasonably priced [I am Scottish, so that's important]. It is unfortunate the the [notably anonymous] reviewer from Chicago was unable to see beyond the surface of the book."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"This is a positive upbeat book about moving on after being devastated by one's birth family's reaction to one's coming out. Luckily, many of us have stories that are much more mundane. Stuart's book moved me to tears, as it has the many friends I have lent it to. Stuart Miller is someone who has moved beyond the dysfunctionalism and fundamentalism of his family and created something wonderful for himself, which he is good enough to have shared with us all. I cannot recommend the book too highly, for all people regardless of age, sex or orientation."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"I loved this book. It was a very touching story."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"This book is very moving. While the subject matter is by now common, the circumstances of this story are UNIQUE! We are afforded a glimpse behind the Christian curtain; the journey is both enlightening and terrifying. A MUST READ for any socially conscious human being."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"As a fundamentalist, straight Christian, you might be surprised that I would recommend this book. But the medium for our witness for Christ is the relationships which we have with others and this book has important lessons about relationships with those we should care the most about. I identified much more with Mr. Miller's father than with Mr. Miller but I appreciate the author showing how hurtful such well-intentioned actions can be. The book reveals a son who believes he cannot help being gay and a father who rejects his son because he &quot;refuses&quot; to change. But there's also the father who believes he cannot help being diametrically opposed to the gay lifestyle and a son who rejects his father because he &quot;refuses&quot; to change. Neither seems to be able to accept the true nature of the other's &quot;compulsion&quot; to act in accordance with his beliefs. I believe in the power of prayer, but that prayer should be &quot;Thy will be done,&quot; and we Christians sometimes act as if we are the ones who define God's will. The Prayer Warriors should also be praying for themselves. Read Prayer Warriors and see how similar father and son really are and pray that in similar situations parents and children will find the basis for understanding and growth."},{"Title":"Prayer Warriors","review":"Prayer Warriors sat on my bookshelf for four+ years, and I finally decided to pick it up this month. I opened the book hopeful of reading a story of depth and honesty that eventually came to a positive resolution, and was highly disappointed.It appears that the author used the writing process as a therapeutic approach to processing emotions during a trying and difficult time. While I support this approach, I would hope that one would not publish the raw material for others to read. Miller's words about his family and friends were certainly unfiltered, and altogether hurtful. I can't imagine writing this book would be helpful in mending his relationships.While I praise honesty and vulnerability, Miller's words feel self-righteous and conceited, with little care for others' feelings (which ironically mimics his depiction of his father).Overall, I am disappointed at the lack of tact (and editing in general) in a story that could've had a stronger impact. His all-too-common story of fundamentalist Christian rejection of homosexuality was lost among the jabs at the other characters, and the use of strongly stereotypical portrayals of gay life."},{"Title":"The Open Cage: The Ordeal of The Irian Jaya Hostages","review":"This is one of the very best books ever written about West Papua!The author was the leader of a British-Indonesian zoologist expedition into the remote highlands of the Lorentz Nature Reseve. The entire team was kidnapped by OPM guerillas fighting for West Papuan independence, and held hostage for several months until being freed by the Indonesian army - minus the two Indonesian male members of the expedition who were executed by the OPM.This could easily have been turned into a shallow account of hardship and horror, but instead the author has used the experience to give us probably the most interesting and insightful account of West Papua ever. Rather than just concentrating on how the hostages themselves felt during their ordeal, he is painting a thorough picture of the background to the kidnapping, and excellent descriptions of the Papuans' psyche and motivations. His observations are sharp and balanced, and instead of pointing fingers at any party, he leaves us with an understanding of the tragic circumtances that lead to the kidnap, and the hopeless situation that continues in Papua to this day.We also get to \\"experience\\" the down-to-earth lifestyle that was a horrible ordeal to the hostages, but is in fact the everyday reality of life in the extremely isolated Papuan highlands.Having spent months in West Papua myself, I also found the book entirely free of factual errors, hype and exaggrations that abound in other travelogues of this \\"exotic\\" place.I would highly recommend this book to anyone planning a longer trek through the mountains of Papua.Don't let it put you off visiting - there has been no similar incident ever since.

The story is written in an active and engaging style of \\"reportage and descriptive writing.\\" Start was the British biologist leading a scientific expedition investigating and cataloguing various plants and animals, and specifically focusing on the fish in an isolated region of the island's mountain jungles.He had taken an expedition of zoologists from Britain to Indonesia, after months of negotiation with the government and excruciating paper work and delays at various bureaucratic levels. They were stationed in Irian Jaya, on the island of Papua, on the Indonesia side near the border with the independent Papua New Guinea.High on the mountainous spine of this island shared between the two countries, this international troupe of scientists were taken hostage by Papuan rebel warriors in Irian Jaya. The author has a lot of good information on the cultural characteristics of the various tribes in Irian Jaya. The group was working primarily in the Nduga tribal lands, the village of Mapnduma.Smart writes the book in diary format, but with the full discussion and background, carrying us with him through the halls of the government mazes, then finally along the ridges and through the jungles of the region he has wanted to explore and catalogue. Likewise the daily details of the ordeal he and his colleagues endured are recorded in clear, scientific detail.But though clinically clear, the pathos is not missing. We feel the stress Smart and his colleagues experienced, the injuries, the insults, the uncertainty. This is truly an adventure story. Its excitement is only heightened by the chilling realization that this really happened."},{"Title":"Symbolic logic","review":"This book by Lewis Carroll is a wonderful source to learn the basics of logic in a funny and natural way. It can be used as a self-study guide or as a manual for educators teaching elements of logic to schoolchildren. It is very clear and consequent and gives the basic idea of propositions and syllogisms. The theory is framed in an unusual game that makes it much more understandable. As always Carroll's examples are a little bit absurdic but this is exactly what makes them humorous, attractive and involving. The book is also a great brain teaser for readers of all ages. Unfortunately it is not as well known as Alice in Wonderland but it has been translated into many foreign languages. I widely used the Russain translation when teaching logic to schoolchildren in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Jean Donaldson has written a brilliant textbook on operant conditioning, as well as what would have been a very useful training guide.The rub is that without an index, or even a detailed table of contents, if you want to find a behavior or a solution, or, for that matter, anything else, the only way to do it is to thumb through the entire book.The other day I was trying to find some interesting information I had seen in the book about the plusses and minuses of adding a second dog. I paged through the entire book, and found no chapter or section with the right heading. Then I went back and practically reread the entire first hundred pages until I found it buried in a section called \\"Alone Training.\\" To add insult to injury, later in the book I found a statement to the effect that \\"this has already been covered in 'Alone Training.'\\" Aha! But where imight that be? You guessed it. The only way to find it is to page through the entire book, once again, to find the applicable section.I will go this far: In order for this book to be useful, as opposed to interesting, the reader would have to spend a few days (at least) making an index. Better yet, scan the entire book into a word recognition application so as to enable searches of the contents. But who is going to bother to do that?..."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Culture Clash is the best book I have ever read related to dog training/behavior.

Jean Donaldson's \\"Culture Clash\\" encouraged me to re-examine my relationship, my methods of training and attempts at communication with our dogs ...Jean Donaldson has a no nonsense writing style ... she says it like she believes and thinks - no excuses, no grey ... take it or leave it ... and there is no where to hide ... the reader can either agree or disagree but there is little doubt in Ms Donaldson's own mind ... And she tells it from the dog's perspective ...Unlike many training books that just set out the procedures & techniques for training a dog ... Culture Clash takes us one step further along the road ... and helps the owner/trainer understand why certain training methods work better than others ... Why positive & operant training methods coupled with an understanding of dog behaviour, instincts & psychology is the way towards a less frustrating, less stressful and more successful method of teaching/training our dogs.Culture Clash is a training manual, in that it teaches us how to teach/train our dogs - it is more than a training manual because Ms Donaldson also explains how dogs think and perceive our methods & style of training ... she explains why & what makes dogs nervous ... why & when dogs bite ... what makes our dogs tick and do what they do - or not do ... she tells us what may or may not work ... she tells us of the various psychological thresholds that exist within all our dogs ... and she does all this with clarity & in detail.No Lassies and no Rin Tin Tins - the author describes our dogs as they are ... and offers us an insight and understanding into their true nature ... and she writes of what is really required to build and maintain a meaningful & responsible relationship with our dogs.The book offers the reader a deeper appreciation of what is going on in the dog's mind as training progresses ... making for more effective training, and perhaps most important - improving our relationship with our dogs ...But the least the book will do - is make us re-think the aspects and elements of our relationship with our dog ... and that cannot be bad ...Culture Clash is a wonderful balance between a dog behavioural book and a training manual ...A good reference book ... a worthwhile buy & read ..."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"So many people get dogs and forget that they are animals. It is so easy to believe at times that your dog is acting out of resentment or is getting back at you because you did something to offend them. Dogs don't rationalize! Reading this book will teach you that and so much more about how the canine mind really works. Jean teaches you how to relate to your dog and understand why they are doing what they do. Take the guess work out of your next puppy or dog and read this book! It is a must read for every dog owner!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I just finished reading this book and have to say I loved it. Being a trainer and owner of three dogs it is very rewarding to read a book with so much factual content. As we embark on a mission to change the way dogs have been traditional treated and trained it is important to have references to back up your theory. This book does it and Jean Donaldson is a wealth of knowledge. Two thumbs up for this one. A must read for dog lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"While it is true that dogs, like most mammals, including humans, can be trained by operant conditioning, Donaldson's basic premises are simply incorrect. Her arguments that dogs can't learn except through conditioning should be obviously faulty to anyone who has spent any time with dogs. It is true that dogs don't think exactly the way humans think, but they are certainly capable of observational learning and simple reasoning, for example. She begins her discussion by contrasting Skinnerian behaviorist notions (which were also incorrect in their basic premises) with the strawman of the \\"Disney\\" view of animals. She's not willing to take on serious recent studies which give real insight into how animals think, feel, and behave. The interested reader might want to check out \\"Animal Minds\\" by Douglas Griffin. Or much older, long underrated books by Charles Darwin and George Romanes, for that matter. Skinnerian behaviorism is headed for the garbage bin of obsolete theories. And there are also far more enlightened dog training books, by people who are in touch with more modern ideas about how animals behave. The choice isn't Skinner or Disney.If you really were to believe, with Donaldson, that dogs are nothing more than mindless, always greedy automata, why would you ever want to live with one? Luckily, she's wrong."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"the title says it.this is not a training book, but a psychology book - one that helps you get inside your dog's head to know HOW and WHY our best friends do what they do. it will allow you & your dog to get along much better, and you'll both be happier that way! plus, a thorough read by anyone with at least a marginal level of intelligence may even allow you to forgo structured obedience classes.i have read and re-read this many times over the years, and it is the one dog-related book that i always buy for new dog owners as a gift."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean Donaldson's Culture Clash is just the very best dog book I have ever read.

Jean Donaldson's book has given me a whole new perspective - to appreciate dogs in their own unique way, and to finally realize that they are another species of being, not just children in fur! Thanks, Jean- and I am sure my dog would thank you too - she has been trying to be a dog but I have insisted on trying to make her a human."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I would have qualms about recommending this book due to the dogmatic and elitist presentation of the author. Donaldson attempts to establish operant conditioning as the only modern, scientific, and humane method of dog training. If you are a not familiar with operant conditioning, think marine mammal performing act. Animal hears cue, performs action, gets fish. This method works. But the approach (and this book) does not really educate the owner to understand the Dog as a Dog. In the Conditioning world, a Dog is a Seal is a Parrot.The author opens the book with a carpet bombing attack on common views of dogs and Anthropomorphism - the attribution human attributes to dogs. This is fair enough criticism, we all do it at times (even Behaviorists I suspect). But the lesson here should be the dog owner must think like the dog, since the dog is incapable of thinking like a human. Instead, the author uses the \\"guilt\\" of anthropomorphism as a jumping-off point to both run down her pet peeves and undercut the foundations of any other dog training approach. Her primary targets are dog intelligence, pack behavior, and that dogs would have any desire to please their owners.In the authors oft-repeated words, dogs are \\"lemon brains\\" capable of only the most basic functions of a living organism. Except of course where she needs to make a point, such as the dog understanding contexts or performing complex cost benefit analysis as to whether your offered treat is worth performing some desired trick. And for \\"lemon brains\\" she imbues dogs with these smarts fairly often.Admittedly, it is somewhat uncomfortable to think of Man's Best Friend as a fur ball whose brain is governed by twenty or thirty lines of operating code. However the nature or extent of canine intelligence is still debated. Dogs have been demonstrated capable of extensive vocabularies, and canine intelligence is certainly somewhat more than she gives them credit for. For starters I would point the interested reader to the Dog article on Wikipedia where over 100 citations are provided.Next up on the target list is Pack Behavior and hierarchy ( a.k.a Dominance). Despite the rather firmly established lineage of Canis Lupus Familiaris, Donaldson dismisses pack instinct as a myth. This will no doubt be a great surprise to Wildlife Biologists who have documented pack behavior in virtually every member of Family Canidae. But according to the author, it doesn't exist and therefore can not be leveraged for training purposes.The last of the primary targets, closely related to cognitive ability, would be the concept that the dog has any desire to please or work with people. This despite the fact that humans have selectively bred dogs specifically for this trait for 15,000 years (or longer). The brutal truth is that those falling short have been culled. At this point, one has to ask themselves if the author truly understands the dog as the unique animal it is, or merely sees it as another lab subject to be taught (or conditioned) to perform with a limitless and unending stream of food treats.Over the years the dog training has changed, largely for the better. For example, 30 years ago putting a dog in a crate would have been considered abuse. Today, it is recognized as both normal and helpful in house training, leveraging the dog's natural den instinct. In todays politically correct climate, there exists the idea that using corrections in training is abuse. Sadly, Donaldson is in this camp lumping any form of corrections under the umbrella of carefully undefined \\"Aversives\\". So if you have ever corrected your dog verbally, used a light leash pop, or grasped your dog by the scruff of the neck, in the Conditioning world you are the equivalent of Michael Vick and his dog-fighting ilk. Donaldson is strangely quiet on the fact that mother dogs (and other pack members) issue a range of corrections to pups and young dogs as a matter of course. While a seal has little desire to work with a human, dogs are attuned to do so, and corrections do have a place. lastly consider that in humans the results of a few generations of children who don't know the meaning of the word \\"no\\" is apparent for all with open eyes. One should expect about the same results with other social hierarchical pack animals such as .... dogs!Despite my issues with the author, the Operant Conditioning method itself is a fine approach and may indeed be the best for certain dog personalities - sensitive, shy, submissive. I do not use these terms in a pejorative way, a dog of this personality tends to be born into every litter of every breed. Your task as a dog owner is to have many training approaches to draw from. I have found that many authors (even the controversial Caesar Milan) have some insight to offer, if one looks hard enough.So, who should buy this book? If you are a professional trainer it has a place on your shelf, due largely to Donaldson's technical explanation of the Operant Conditioning theory and mechanisms.If you are interested in Operant Conditioning or clicker training but don't want to read a dozen books, you can get the same thing without the attitude from authors Patricia McConnell or Ian Turner. Or the Donaldson book \\"Train Your Dog Like A Pro\\" has the nuts and bolts of the OC approach without the soap box.If you are a new dog owner and only want to read one book, I would recommend the new (2009) edition of \\"The Art of Raising a Puppy\\" by the Monks of New Skete. The Monks approach is more \\"holistic\\" - understanding the Dog as a Dog, and attempting to get the human to think like a dog, instead of treating the dog like a seal or a parrot. Applying what wildlife biologists have learned from the dogs ancestors, the Monks approach leverages the innate instinct of the dog. Their approach is also largely positive - although they do address the politically incorrect topic of Corrections - but used in a limited, timely, and humane way. The Monks approach is focused on building the relationship between you and the dog. But if you would rather have your dog view you as a Dysfunctional Food Dispenser instead of the Benevolent Pack Leader, Culture Clash is for you."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I was gifted this book by a dog loving friend who knew that I'd love it. And I did. While I found moving around it hard at times - the author knew what she was talking about so sometimes everything wasn't in the sequence I would have liked it explained to me. However, it is all there. I wish I'd had this book or excerpts from it when I bought my first dog 11 years ago. I did my best as an owner, but after reading Jean's book it became apparent that my lack of knowledge about the true nature of dogs meant I was wandering around in a wilderness - and unfortunately so too were my beloved pooches. Not an easy read but worth perservering - there are gems in this book that need to reach a wider section of dogdom. The sooner the better for both species!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Donaldson should be required reading for all trainers. Blanche Saunders, the Monks and Carol Lea Benjamin were fine in their day, but it's time to take advantage of the latest, best learning theory out there.Donaldson puts that theory at our fingertips. We used to think, many decades ago, that the only way to train a dog was through force. Pack and dominance theory changed a lot of that for the better in the 60's and 70's; now it's time for the next stop in our evolution as trainers. This book is not about some pie-in-the-sky ideas -- it's as practical and essential as food and water.The only thing I would take points off for is the same thing some other readers have mentioned: the writing style is a little disorganized. Overall, however, this is a wonderful book. As it circulates through the dog-owning population, I'm sure it will become a classic."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I just... I don't get the hype. This was supposed to change the way I think about dogs.Nope, not quite. If you don't know anything about them, if you believe that they ignore commands to \\"spite\\" you, if you still train by dragging them forcibly into a sit by a choke chain, yeah, you might wanna read this.... I guess. However, as someone who is well-versed in positive training and operant conditioning, but does object to the thoughtful use of aversives in dog training, yeah, this meant nothing to me.It's also disheartening how Skinnerian the whole thing is... Not only are dogs only \\"black boxes\\" with input and output, they're completely incapable of cognitive thought and social learning. Come now, radical behaviorism was debunked years ago by human psychologists... Why must we cling to it for dogs?So, the content utterly failed to deliver the life changing message that was supposed to make me vow to never use a leash correction again. (Also, the highly emotive and sometimes inflammatory language doesn't help... it really just weakens her message and makes her seem juvenile, but I digress.) In addition to that, it's TERRIBLY organized. I mean, really just God awful. It's not so much a book as an angry blog post, really.So, if you're in the first category and know nothing about dogs or still believe your dog does things just to piss you off or \\"challenge\\" you, you might benefit from this book. If not.... save yourself time and money. If you want to learn how to incorporate positive training/marker training into your training methods, check out something like Morgan Spector's book about clicker training obedience.

This book is a wonderful tool for unknowledable dog owners and those who believe in the 'old fashioned' methods, i.e., choke chains and the like.....Everyone should read this to understand why we should convert to the modern training of rewards only and no punishment!!The only bad thing I can say is that some of the wording may be a bit difficult for everyone to understand. You must be an adult by all means and you must have a bit of a vocabulary as well!! (I was having to re-read a few of the chapters to get it!!)Overall: SUPER! WONDERFUL!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"A huge amount of dog books are a slog to read, preachy and unhelpful. This book on the other hand, gives a simple over view of modern training techniques interspersed with humour. As an experienced dog handler I appreciated some of the basic reminders about our dogs being..just dogs... and I think for a new dog owner it is essential reading. Some areas do become quite technical and I recommend those not into the \`dog behaviour' thing to skim those sections and quickly move on. Overall though, the number one book in this area now with practical advice balanced against dog insight."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Desensitizing dogs with distraction and extremely gradual socialization is a joke for most owners with aggressive behaviour dogs.The problem with this its impossible to control the environment around the dog sufficiently to control its exposure.It is unrealistic to expect a dogs to be buddy's with every dog that passes by.Too many trainers are hyping tactics designed to increase their puppyclass sizes instead of practical advice for walking a dog for exercise.This book is great advice e for owners with way too much time."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book dramatically changed my relationship with my labrador retriever. Training her used to seem like a battle of the wills, and now it is more like a game we play together. This may not be the definitive book on dog training, but it will change the way you think about your dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"After reading some of the more scathing reviews (and ordering it anyway, due to many recommendations from positive trainers), I was expecting something worse.Already a convert to positive training methods, the \\"attitude\\" of the book was not obvious to me (perhaps it would be obvious to those more sensitive, such as those still very attached to traditional training methods). As far as I could tell, only rarely does Jean Donaldson make these comments that the reviews have made out to be so prevalent and it hardly slows the reading down. I've only counted 2 statements she has made that I considered rather disrespectful and off-topic, and these are the very two quoted by previous reviews, I believe... and both were in the first chapter. I haven't found any since.It's a very entertaining book, with a lot of very good information that would help ANYONE with a dog (whether trainer or owner). She \\"debunks\\" many myths (sometimes less gracefully than necessary) about dog training and general dog behavior, and she helps the reader understand WHY these are myths and what real behavioral science says. It's not so much meant to be a \\"How-To\\" (sit, stay, heel) book, though it touches on such things, but it's mostly a \\"this is how dogs work, so this is how we should change our methods to suit them\\" book. It allows for room for our brains to kick in and think of creative (and positive) ways to solve our individual problems. If you want more specifics, this isn't the book for you... but it's a great \\"general positive reinforcement training\\" book for those of us who don't know it all. Also a very easy read (there are some psychology terms but nothing overwhelming), so it's great for the ordinary dog-owner.As has been noted, this will be a hard book to go back to if one is attempting to search for something specific... but this is why I take notes along the edge of the pages. Then you can flip through the pages and find the relevant points in your own writing. I also agree with the previous review in that the flow could be better between chapters and sections of chapters.Overall, not as well organized as I would like but the best book I've read on the \\"Culture Clash\\" between man and dog that's so prevalent in society today."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean Donaldson is a gifted dog trainer. She has two border collies and that should speak for itself. She has a great love of dogs, but she doesn't romanticize them. This very helpful when one's dog is not perfect.I have quoted her take on why dogs have trouble understanding the whole house training/potty thing. That chapter alone is well worth the cost of the entire book.She gives many wonderful lessons on training and what to expect. Her description of \\"extinction burst\\" should be included in every parenting book, too.I like operant conditioning and she offers a good place to start. I did shape my JRT to \\"roll over\\" in less than a week with her suggestions. My pup was 11 weeks old at the time we did that.I have a dog who trusts me. I can clip her nails and play many games with her. I also have a great companion with four feet."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I liked most of this book, but was bothered by a few flaws. Donaldson seems to have a good intuitive understanding of dogs, which is probably why she can train so well and use clicker training so effectively. I enjoyed her insights into dog behavior and how dogs and people are truly different creatures. I was less convinced by the later chapters addressing specific training issues, more because they didn't seem to be follow in any particular order. I also am not quite as convinced as she is that dog's are 100% Skinnerian, behaviorally oriented beings.If you're particularly sensitive about your relationship with your pets, you may find Donaldson's attitude a bit off-putting. I found it humorous, and sometimes a little helpful to know just how silly I'd been."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have to admit that I could not get past the first 30 pages. I was so turned off by the arrogant tone of this book that I simply stopped. Perhaps there is useful information further on, but I just don't see the point in subjecting myself to such 'stuff'. I doubt if Donaldson has ever lived with a Siberian Husky, but if she had she would never have dismissed the native intelligence and problem-solving abilities of dogs. Perhaps I just hate being told that I'm stupid. Perhaps I simply don't believe that my dogs are stupid. I just can't buy this book. I got much more useful information from William Campbell's 'Behavior Problems in Dogs', Patricia Gail Burnham's 'Play Training your dog' and 'On Talking Terms With Dogs : Calming Signals'by Turid Rugaas. Ian Dunbar has some great information as well. I'd simply avoid Donaldson and Diane Bauman as well unless you have a passive, easily motivated, eager-to-please, dependant canine shadow-dog. I've never lived with one of those."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have been working with dogs for years and this is one of a handful of books I always suggest to my clients as a must-read if they want more information.One of the things I love about this book is that it is full of science and precise language but it is also very accessible to non-professionals. It presents a more modern way of looking at dog training by looking not at the human so much but at the perspective of the dog. It really shows where there are some big culture clashes between human and hound and how to go about preventing and fixing those issues.If you are looking for a book that includes physical punishments like kneeing a dog in the chest, leash popping for non-compliance, ear-pinches, etc., this is NOT the book for you. If you are looking for non-confrontational, positive, and relationship-based training mindset, this would be a great place to start.While I do not follow her training techniques to a \\"T\\", the big-picture philosophy of this book is quite amazing. I think it is worthy of being a foundational or cornerstone book to any modern dog owner/trainer's library.It has the potential to be a life changing book to the right reader... an eye opener to a new perspective in dog training."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"When I read this book, I already knew a lot of what Jean Donaldson says about animal behavior. But somehow, it never occurred to apply it to dogs....at least not in my heart of hearts. Her idea is that dogs are not audacious creatures who are plotting a coup and that most of their less than desirable behaviors (and many of the things we find \\"cute\\" as well) are not, in fact, attempts to become the \\"pack alpha\\" but are just dogs being dogs and doing the things that they think (or have learned) will be rewarding to them. And dogs do not think the way we do. As with any other organism with a nervous system, we can get dogs to do the things we want without punishing them and shutting them down but simply by rewarding the things we DO want them to do in ways that are salient to them and failing to reward (or allow them to be rewarded) for doing the things we do not like. Maybe, just maybe, we will enjoy a stronger bond with our dogs if they associate us with \\"good things\\" that they like rather than with punishment. WoW! A couple years later, I started agility training and that reinforced my \\"conversion\\" to reward based training. I got to see the amazing things you can get a dog to do in a very distracting environment (full of strange dogs and strange people and fascinating smells)using only rewards for desired behavior (since the goals in agility are speed as well as focus and accuracy, you do NOT achieve success by punishing a dog until it becomes \\"cautious\\" and shuts down).Why am I reviewing this book now? Because it amazes me that after so many years, so many dog lovers have not read this book or any of the others by various experts on scientifically based \\"positive dog training\\" such as Paul Owen, Ian Dunbar, Karen Pryor or Sheila Booth. Everything from web sites to popular TV shows and even some vets still promote the idea that pretty much all of the things dogs do that we don't like (and even any sign of spontaneous behavior at all, even if we do like it) is a sign that your dog \\"thinks he is alpha\\" and needs to be \\"put in his place\\" by forcing the dog physically, using \\"corrections\\" and flooding the dog with stressful stimuli until it shuts down. The \\"miracle\\" result of the training regimen is a canine robot who obeys not \\"to please his master\\" (as so many seem to want to think) but out of a canine form of \\"learned helplessness.\\" Of course, trainers who invoke scientific data about animal learning and who advocate using treats or other rewards that are more meaningful to most dogs that a simple pat on the head and who cajole us to avoid the use of aversives (aka positive punishment) in training are often dismissed as \\"impractical egg heads\\" or \\"hippie tree huggers\\" (when did it become so cool to hate trees and what do they have to do with dogs anyways)?I've had discussion with many people about positive dog training over time and have convinced very few naysayers. No one likes to consider that the attractive trainer on their favorite TV show, their dog's breeder (who really knows \\"their\\" breed), or their uncle who has always had dogs may, in fact, be promoting some training methods that are, at best, unfair to the animal in question and at worse, downright dangerous. I also have this sinking feeling that we humans find the act of inflicting punishment on others to be emotionally gratifying and will do so with the slightest amount of \\"permission\\" from an authority figure who says it is for the greater good, even as they feel conflicted about it (anyone else remember learning about the Milgram study in school). So punishment is always a touchy topic and people tend to get very emotionally invested in their world view about punishment in general. At this point, when people start pontificating about how some behavior or another is a sign that a dog needs to learn not to be \\"alpha\\" or when they start rhapsodizing about such and such a show on TV and how wonderful that trainer is...I just say I am a big \\"fan\\" of Jean Donaldson, Ian Dunbar and Paul Owens as trainers. When they ask what that means, I suggest they start by reading The Culture Clash. This book is not a \\"how to\\" training manual that gives direct advice on how to solve various canine behavioral issues (I'd suggest books by Booth, Dunbar and Owens for those) but it does explain what we actually know about how animals (including dogs) learn, and provides some very accessible analogies about our behavior towards our \\"best friends.\\""},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Donaldson's book was a revelation. Having grown up with dogs and watched many friends own and (more or less successfully) train them, I finally began approaching canine ownership with all the passion and compulsion people normally reserve for human pregnancy. I wanted to get a dog, and I wanted to do it right, dammit. I needed more than a training guide. I needed a training philosophy.To that end, I ordered something like twenty books ranging from breed guides to \\"training for Dummies\\" manuals. Reading through them reminded me of a college anthropology exercise - the second I attached myself to what felt like a useful piece of information, the next book I read would come in with an updated, seemingly superior strategy. Thank god for THE CULTURE CLASH, which firmly established itself as the top-most tier.This is a conceptual book, not a manual. And I totally agree with all the other reviewer comments expressing disappointment in the layout and overall inaccessibility of the book...by the end, I was a converted zealot without a plan. It was clear to me that Donaldson's beliefs and ideas were all factually and morally right-on and that this was and would remain the keystone of my dog training ideology. I also wanted to cry, or call her up and invite myself over for my puppy's first four months...though the book is full of concrete, well-explained exercises and strategies, it is not a do-it-yourself, a-to-z starter kit nor even a particularly accessible reference manual. I put it down feeling galvanized, vindicated, and completely overwhelmed. Which is probably exactly the point. The book is not the be-all end-all of dog training, but rather the correct starting point for mutually satisfying canine/human cohabitation mastery.I would love to read a step-by-step puppy-to-senior dog training manual by Donaldson, but in its absence, I am enormously grateful for this book and have ardently forced it upon every dog owner I know. A friend - while eyeing my ever-expanding canine library - recently asked me what one book I'd recommend to someone about to adopt a puppy, and I immediately recommended this one. True, it's probably not the only one she'll need, but it is the only one that will successfully and beneficially influence the rest of the acquisition list."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Absolutely outstanding insight into how your dog thinks and why he does the things he does.

Her clarity and succinctness surpass all others, and her content and writing style put The Culture Clash in a class by itself to which all others will be measured.

Way to go, Jean!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I was so excited to receive this book and couldn't wait to start reading it. I was totally bored within minutes. The author is extremely disorganized and critical of what seems like the entire world. The use of so many big, obscure words is totally unneccesary and pompous. I currently own six dogs of various breeds and have been involved in animal rescue and training for many years. I got the feeling that the author really doesn't know dogs at all! I wasted my money and will probably throw this book away because I wouldn't want to sell it to anyone and have them disappointed too. I wouldn't have given it a star at all, but that wasn't an available option."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Author seems unaccredited and ignorant.

Tried classes and though he could heel like a champ in the training center, was still floundering at all else. Advice from the class instructor was hopeless - not even internally consistent, let alone sane or helpful. Tried home training. Rather like an attempted exorcism, but without the crosses and such. The theory \\"unifying\\" the ministrations smacked of humours and trephaning.The entire dog training profession seemed like various sects of voodoo. My wife was lent Culture Clash by a co-worker. Oh my. Rationality. Science. In dog training. My only puzzle is how this wacky, superstitious profession produced Ms. Donaldson."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"According to Jean Donaldson, anything that you do different from her style of training is wrong. She will refer to you as an amatuer trainer if you use any style of training other than bribery with food to train the dog. My experience in training is with Hunting retrievers, and obedience training, along with some field work with a Police Service dogs. Now if you want to walk around smelling like a big piece of liver, and have the dog pretty much run the house, than buy her book, and get set for a uncontrollable dog. She is jumping on the band wagon of another trainer(name wont be mentioned) who thinks the dogs should train the owner. Many of which have attended my training course, and the owners were much happier now that they had a trained dog. Donaldson needs to get out of the office, and into the field of training, real dogs, real life situations with dogs. So Save your money, and invest the money on a good training book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I completely agree with Ms. Donaldson's central premise; that we create unnecessary frustration (both human and canine) when we act on the mistaken notion that dogs possess human-level understanding of abstract concepts, human motivations and human desires. She presents excellent techniques designed to short-circuit the escalating frustrations that result from our tendency to anthropomorphize our dogs.That said, I do not like this book.Culture Clash has a minimalist table of contents and NO INDEX, which makes it nearly impossible to find passages on a specific topic. This renders the book nearly useless as a training resource or reference work.One could still read it cover to cover and glean much useful information in the process, but this would require enduring the vitriol that seems to drip from every page. The story I made up about Ms. Donaldson while reading Culture Clash is that she has been nursing some long-standing personal grudges against specific people in her professional field and that she wrote this book as much to ridicule them and settle old scores as to impart useful information to dog-owners.Ms. Donaldson seems unsatisfied with simply pointing out the faulty notions about dog behavior that are the currency of contemporary \\"common sense\\" thinking about dogs. It seemed to me as I read the book that she considers no myth properly debunked until she has cast one of her \\"rivals\\" as the personification of that belief and then heaped ridicule on that person. The following passage seems typical:\\"I once spoke to a traditional trainer who poured scorn on the use of food as a motivator. The line he trotted out, which still makes me wretch even to this day, was \\"if you use food to train, the dog is doing it for the food and not for you. (...) If you opt to not use positive reinforcement, you end up, like they all do, using aversives and announcing that your dog is doing it for you. Pathetic.\\"If you think you would enjoy wading through 224 pages of this sort of thing, then Culture Clash may be the dog-training book for you. I'd still like to finish the book, but Ms. Donaldson's tone starts to wear on my nerves very quickly, so I take it in very small chunks."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book was recommended to me by a trusted trainer after my rescue cattledog bit my mother-in-law. I chose to order it from the library instead of rushing out to buy it...my mistake. That dog bit again (perfectly predictable--there really is NO such thing as an &quot;unprovoked&quot; bite) and I chose to re-home her because I did not have the dog-experience to keep her safe. I'm telling you this cautionary tale to emphasize that Culture Clash WILL teach you how to help your dog adapt to living with humans. Jean Donaldson has the dog's best interest at heart, and her advice shoots from the hip. If you prefer your dog advice sugar-coated for easier swallowing, keep reading about &quot;alpha rolls&quot;; if you're ready for reality, buy this book. One warning: get a second copy now, because you'll want to loan it to friends!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I felt it would be worthwhile to respond to a couple of comments. Some reviews refered to Donaldson's methods as fadish or inneffective. However, Donaldson's methods are based on the work of B. F. Skinner, a prestigious behavioral scientist who made major contributions to the field of psychology and behavioral science. Classical and operant conditioning, principals used by Donaldson in her book, have been around for quite some time and have been shown to be highly efective with numerous species. Donaldson's point is that people who train the &quot;standard, leash-jerk&quot; way are ignoring years of tried and true animal behavior science.Some have said that this is not a good how to book. I don't think that is its primary purpose. I think she is trying to provide a sound foundation on how to think about dogs and training so you the owner are &quot;set up to succeed.&quot; The hope is that when you choose a how to book or a training program you will look for one that uses positive reinforcement.For example, do you see zoo trainers using negative reinforcement with sea mamals or elephants? Of course not, they use treats. Positive reinforcement works when other techniques don't or simply can't be used.Finally, her point on liking dogs for who and what they are vs. liking them for the human qualities we project onto them is an important distinction for owners to make. I think that this is perhaps the most important point made in the book: what is wrong with a dog being a dog or why do they have to be part human to be good animals/pets?. Changing the way we think about our pets will help us to stay objective and think with our human heads rather than our hearts when we are struggling with training and/or problem behavior in our pets, and in turn to have an experience that is both successful and positive."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book makes clear the dog's view of interactions with humans.

I keep stacks of this book in my house to give to any friend who has a dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Noted dog behavior expert Jean Donaldson, with contributions from another well-known expert, Ian Dunbar, explains the &quot;why&quot; of dog behavior in straight, simple terms. The first page of Chapter 1. Getting the Dog's Perspective sets the tone for the book by openly discounting the commonly held Walt Disney image of dogs in favor of the more logical B.F. Skinner view. Jean describes dog behavior from the dog's point of view.This book is about motivation, positive reinforcement, and empathy. There is actually an excercise in empathy starting on page 97 that makes the reader think twice about punishing a dog for being a dog. (read the book and you'll know what I mean)With easy-to-understand, logical dog behavior theory and chapter titles such as &quot;It's all Chew Toys to Them&quot; and &quot;Lemon Brains but we Still Love Them&quot; I couldn't put this book down! I now have two of the most well-trained mongrels on the planet! Ok, that last part was a bit exaggerated but BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Be warned: Jean Donaldson's writing style is abrupt. Like the (few) negative reviews mention, she does lecture and there is a tone of &quot;my way or the highway&quot;. But that's because the stakes are so high. Watching people spend time, money and tears hurting their dogs in the name of &quot;training&quot; is enough to make anyone abrupt. My dog is another dog saved by Culture Clash. The traditional trainers (all three very effective, very experienced) I hired recommended that I &quot;try again&quot; and give my aggressive dog back to the shelter. She would have been put down--she was snappy, growly, and obnoxious. The positive trainer I consulted with recommended that I start treating my dog like a dog and told me to read the Culture Clash. We've worked in small increments using positive methods and made AMAZING progress. My dog is not a sweet, love-everyone kind of girl but she is a well trained, well socialized girl who gets lots of compliments. the training techniques and the approach to dog-human relationships described in this book are not quick fixes. You won't get instant results. You will get rock-solid information grounded in behavioral (dog and human) science that allows you to create a training program that will produce results."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have two dogs I adopted from the dog pound. One had serious abuse related problems from previous owners. She was about 3 years old when I adopted her. The other had a serious separation anxiety and barking problem. He was 10 years old at adoption time. The author's advice when directly followed worked wonders with both dogs. Of course you must have patience and kindness in the process. With consistent application my dogs are now the best dogs in the buidling. I live in a downtown highrise and everyone thinks they are expensive pure breds raised from puppyhood dogs. I have read several other books on the topic, but I must say this book was the one that truly helped me to help my dogs and me be happy good neighbors."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is by far the most useful compilation of general dog-knowledge I have read. It is especially valuable if you have a new puppy, but also a MUST for those of us with older dogs who have 'problems' that need to be resolved, including chewing, dog-dog aggression, dog-human aggression, fear, barking, urinating, etc. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN, you should absolutely read what Donaldson says about how dogs view small people staring into their eyes, clinging to their necks, and patting them. Considering the thousands of children injured by dogs every year, training children to behave around dogs, and vice-versa, should be common place. Another interesting but less approachable book is The Other End of the Leash (McConnell).This is not a cookbook for dog training (though there are several puppy-lessons to give you an idea of how to go about that). It should be viewed as a foundational, Dogs 101 class. The stuff you should know BEFORE you look down into those happily mischievous puppy eyes and say \\"BAD DOG!\\"I bought this book because it was highly recommended by professional behaviorists in dealing with aggression. I was so impressed with it, I have since, in four months, loaned it to 3 friends, and am waiting to get it back so I can quick-read it again.

It is clear and thorough and a very good resource for owners and trainers. It is also easily accessible, despite covering some fairly technical material. In terms of the content, Culture Clash is first rate.It suffers from problems in other areas, however.I agree with other reviewers who found this book to be distractingly disorganized. The chapters are loosely put together, and the lack of an index makes finding specific references difficult. My own copy has several post-it notes sticking out of it: a testament to the book's utility and lack of organization.Another weakness of this book is Donaldson's tone, which is kind of cranky at times. She takes issue with other schools of thought in dog-training, and not only lets the reader know she disagrees with them, but also lets the reader know how stupid they are. The dog-training world is famous for rabid arguments, so I take her comments with a big salt-lick, but the book suffers from them.This book would have greatly benefitted from a good editor. But still, the information it offers more than compensates for it's shortcomings.

If you are not up on the 'lingo' of dog competition or do not have a thorough grounding in 'Dog Psychology 101' you'll probably find yourself lost.However, that being said, I refer to this book again and again as it brought me light years ahead in the way I train my dogs. I compete in both Conformation and Obedience and I use every bit of what I learned in both fields.The only real complaint I have is that 'The Culture Clash' spoiled me tremendously.

Culture Clash is the fourth in a series of dog/training books that I ordered from amazon (fourth to Patricia McConnell's Other end of the leash; The Dog Whisperer (not Cesar Millan); and Ian Dunbar's Teach an new dog old tricks and I have to say I am glad that I waited to read this one.On the positive side: She drives home the point that dogs are not human (not furry humans, not babies, not spiteful)--this is perhaps the number one concept that gets us \\"melon-brains\\", into trouble when bringing home a new pup or as she refers to them, the \\"lemon-brains.\\" We forget that those big beautiful canines are their defense mechanism and that they will use them when necessary.On the negative side: She drives this point in such a arrogant, self-righteous tone that it's annoying to read (as if she wasn't a melon-brained monkey herself). I find myself skipping over the redundant ranting to get to the fleshy ideas she has to offer. For someone who stresses \\"positive\\" \\"humane\\" and \\"gentle\\" training her words and how they are organized leave me feeling like my choke chain has been pulled and yanked (sometimes i feel like I swallowed broken glass).On the positive side: Gives some ideas and techniques that are gentle and focus on positive reinforcement.On the negative side: You have to dig into the text and into the chapters (well into chapter 5 and 6) to find them. also the only set of pictures is at the back but they were of no use to me. its not the typical how to book.Patricia McConnell (animal behaviorist) in her book Other End of the Leash, really delves (in a well written and organized manner) into the research and gives concrete examples of research that supports her argument (same \\"dogs aren't human--so don't treat them as human\\" concept)and is so human and humane and truly witty. The data really builds McConnell's credibility as a behaviorist. McConnell calls us humans \\"monkeys.\\"Donaldson calls us humans \\"melon-brains.\\" It seems like Donaldson's book is just a book of opinions w/little research data to support it. I'm reading chapters 5 and 6 but in retrospect, I cannot recall scientific data to support her argument.I don't find Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson \\"witty\\" at all. Donaldson attempts a \\"what if\\" scenario by putting the humans in the dogs' place where the humans depended on these creatures called Grons (not unlike dogs depend on us humans). She goes on to question, how would you feel if all those natural behaviors, such as smiling, using the toilet, reading the newspaper were behaviors that the Grons didn't approve of (not unlike humans don't approve of chewing, excessive barking, and soiling the carpet). After a LOOOOONG and drawn out description of problem behaviors that lead to aggression (not unlike that found in a frustrated, confused, and under-socialized dog), the story ends sadly with the human being taken to Donaldson's version of the \\"shelter\\" to be euthanized because of such aggression.I found the story stupid and drawn out to make a simple point: communication and training with a dog (while isn't not rocket science)it takes time, effort, and responsibility on the part of the owner. I wish she would get to the point (for a melon-brained money, i'm thinking a lot more simply, like a dog).That's concept is what this book is supposed to be about: dogs don't think in such a complicated manner. Dogs close the gap between themselves and piece of food, they don't calculate calories. Dog increase the gap between themselves and a scary person/object/situation they don't analyze it to death.Having said that: Good concept and idea--bad, BAD, BAD presentation."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book should be required reading BEFORE anyone can buy/adopt a dog. Although some have critized it for not offering more indepth training information, that was not the intention of the author. Rather Ms. Donaldson is attempting to stop the war we wage on our dogs for being dogs, hoping that we will gain new knowledge and understanding of how our dogs think and how they look at the world. Yes, there is some training information, but its purpose is to show how we can achieve a well-mannered dog without resorting to fear and pain rather than to be a step-by-step training guide. Yes, an index would have been nice, but, as a professional trainer, I would and do recommned this book to anyone who has a dog or is contemplating getting one.

However, if you're a solid reader who can get past these obstacles, this is otherwise a GREAT BOOK.Donaldson added greatly to my understanding of my dog and what I've been doing wrong in training him. It was a little off-putting at first, because her views of what dogs are -- and why they respond to us -- are so different from the views I'd previously held.

Excellent descriptions of how dogs think with many examples. It supports positive reinforcement methods of training, which is the only type of training I do unless it is a survival issue. It is set up in a weird way, but as long as you read it through, you will get all the info you needed. She does have a kind of tough attitude- but it is a response from so many ignorant beliefs that have been proved wrong yet are still being used by thousands. Not everyone should have a dog- not everyone should even have children! It is a nice outlet for me to read this because I totally agree with her, but I can't tell my students, \\"Well you don't have time for a dog so you shouldn't have one!\\" That won't fix anything, but reading this book helps me vent.

A short time afterward I had the good fortune of being able to attend a seminar given by the author, Jean Donalson, and it solidified my resolve to be an advocate for humane and effective dog training.This book will teach you how to get your dog to want to cooperate with you. You don't want your dog to obey because you're forcing him to... trust me, it's much more pleasant for the both of you when he's a willing partner."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is an extremely well-written and useful book. It's also heavy-hitting in the sense that is emphasizes the work involved in responsible dog ownership. The author, Jean Donaldson, pulls no punches. She says, for example: \\"It is my overwhelming experience that [dog] owners who absolutely demand fast fixes to undesirable behavior need to downgrade from organic to plush animals. Dogs are time-intensive and not for every body. It is a huge privilege to own one, and we've got to start feeling some obligation to do right by them.\\" And she certainly provides the detailed carefully-thought-out advice to enable anyone who is willing to take the time and trouble to do just that. At the same time, she is not sentimental about dogs and does not anthropomorphize them. As the title of her book indicates, she emphasizes that dogs and humans belong to entirely different species that do not naturally live harmoniously together,that dogs are predators with \\"small, smooth, lemon-sized brains\\" but, as she says, \\"I like them anyway.\\" Indeed, her realistic, unsentimental affection for dogs shines through this book.The whole book is packed with detailed, useful advice, but the final chapter in particular is worth the price of the whole book. This chapter, \\"The Nuts and Bolts of Obedience Training,\\" takes six fundamental commands/behaviors(sit, down, stay, stand, recall/come, and heel)and breaks them down into training levels: kindergarten level through college and even PhD level. Detailed advice is given for each level. The useful (but often ignored) distinction between heeling and loose-leash walking is also explained and illuminated. (The only better advice on heeling that I have found anywhere is in Morgan Specter's book \\"Clicker Training for Obedience.\\")The book also gives excellent advice on playing with your dog. Especially useful for me was her discussion of \\"predatory games\\" such as tug-of-war. Since most dogs I've ever owned have been big and powerful (bull-terriers, a bloodhound, Rhodesian ridgeback, German shepherd and shepherd mixes, and now a Newfie) I have until now tended to avoid games which I believed encouraged aggression and could get out of hand. Donaldson points out that such games are highly motivating for dogs, that many dogs prefer playing tug to any kind of food reward, and that's it's a pity for trainers to deprive themselves of this motivating power. The whole point is to teach the dog to play by the rules, your rules, and at the same time to teach the dog to obey even when s/he's in a highly aroused state.Along the same lines, she points out that motivating fun like chasing squirrels and rabbits, playing with other dogs etc. should be identified and named and then deliberately put into the training schedule as rewards. (\\"Good dog. Now go chase rabbits\\" etc.)Donaldson is informed about clicker training, but she does not write as if no other method of successfully training a dog is possible."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"After reading about this book on a couple of e-mail lists I subscribe to, I decided to see what all the buzz was about. I was very disappointed in what I found. I was so put off by the author's arrogant attitude -- I'm right, anyone who thinks differently is stupid -- it was difficult to get through the entire book. As others have already pointed out, the lack of an index makes the book useless as a reference. And it's scary to think that an inexperienced owner with a really aggressive dog could be guided by her recommendations. My favorite books on dog training are written by Carol Lea Benjamin, and Donaldson's book has done nothing to change my mind about recommending Carol's book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is the most significant dog book ever written -- yes, it's that good.

If you read this book BEFORE owning a dog you're safe but anyone who has had dogs in the past should be prepared to be attacked for past \\"sins\\".Donaldson's ideas are terrific. Her methodology is completely logical- she doesn't need to resort to name calling to convince readers that she's right. Obviously we're reading the book because we're looking for a new way of doing things, we don't need to be scolded on every page for the way we used to do things (which by the way was taught to us by professionals like Donaldson - if anyone deserves to be scolded it's her own colleagues!)If you're like me, and have trained dogs in the past using the \\"method du jour\\", I'd skip this book and find a different Positive Reinforcement book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I liked the book but it really seems more like a text book.

We (unknowingly) adopted an aggressive dog from rescue and ended up foster parenting (and ultimately keeping) a shy puppy. We had absolutely no idea about the whole socialization process and how (positive) obedience training can actually increase a dog&#8217;s self-confidence and help make them a happier dog.The passage, &#8220;Undersocialized dogs are not only dangerous but under chronic stress&#8230;That&#8217;s not a fun way to be.

Skinner"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I see lots of controversy in the reviews, but I think many of the negative reviewers have missed some important points in this volume, or perhaps have reacted emotionally to them. This is an excellent book on positive dog training - one of the best. If you want a close, mutually-respectful relationship with a well-behaved dog, this is really the way to go.Jean Donaldson fully acknowledges that we can build close relationships with our animals and that the use of classical and operant conditioning are not the only methods that can be used for training. She simply shows that these approaches are the most effective ways, and the most scientifically-validated approaches for socializing and training dogs using positive methods. If you want to teach your dog good behavior or new behaviors, socialize it well and use positive behavior methods. You can still be emotionally close with your dog, but don't use your (or your dog's) emotions as the primary TRAINING tool--we all tend to respond more readily to consequences when we're learning. When applied properly, Donaldson's methods really do work with a very wide range of dogs and problems. Some reviewers may be unhappy because the currently-popular \\"pack theory\\" is not supported in this book. In my reading of it, however, I did not see Donaldson \\"slamming\\" pack theory, but merely stating that there's a lack of scientific evidence that it really works, and she offers a noncoercive method that DOES have solid science behind it. Through effective use of behavioral methods, as explained in this book, you can create a most satisfying relationship with your dog, and your dog will respect you. But at the same time, the training takes into account the unique characteristics of dogs. Dogs do not need to be subjugated in order to follow our leadership. (Actually, when you watch some of the \\"leader of the pack\\" trainers work, you'll also see them using a LOT of what Donaldson talks about. What Donaldson avoids are the aversive control measures that are sometimes employed by others.)As a psychologist, I thought Donaldson's explanations of behavioral methods were very good, although they might be a bit technical or detailed for some. I train therapy dogs to work with children, and I also train children to interact positively with therapy dogs, and I really have no choice but to use positive methods. The kids learn how to be the leader for the dog, but we do it via all-positive methods, such as defined in this book.I've trained a lot of dogs through the years using a variety of methods, and I've recently reviewed many training books in preparation for a book I've written about using dogs in play therapy, and I wholeheartedly endorse positive training methods as the means of training dogs for a wide range of roles: well-behaved pets, obedience, therapy work, and traditional working dogs (such as herding or hunting). Donaldson makes it clear how and why this works.Some may want an easy manual of the \\"10 steps to training a dog,\\" and this book is not organized that way. I think its aim is to educate the owner or trainer in a process, and how to apply that process to a wide range of situations and behaviors. Ultimately, understanding the material in this book permits owners/trainers much more versatility in the work they do with dogs.I strongly recommend this book. To get the most out of it, put your preconceived notions on a back burner and really try to see what she is saying. She provides the most effective way of helping dogs learn our human ways (by requiring us to learn about their canine ways!), and ultimately, having a well-socialized and well-mannered dog can only deepen the loving relationships we have with our pets. We have 4 dogs (2 are rescues who came with some problems), and I'm as attached as ever to all of them, and a lot less frustrated when I'm trying to teach them something new!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The teacher of my puppy's obedience class recommended this book to me. After I got through the first half, I found that I really liked it. The first half is ridiculously preachy, especially if you already believe in using positive reinforcement in training. The second half, while still peppered with diatribes against owners who use training collars, random moments of near-anthropomorphic descriptions of dog behavior (a bit much from a book that begins by explaining how ridiculous it is to anthropomorphize your dog), and other attempts to make the reader feel guilty, is also filled with exercises that are extremely valuable.If it weren't for these excellent exercises, the book would be worthless. At times, it reads more like an overgrown master's thesis than a book for the general public. Perhaps a master's thesis dumbed down and extended for the general public is a better descriptor. Donaldson's diction bounces all over the place. She often begins a sentence with a keyword taken from behavioral psychology and ends with a coloquial expression. This mixed diction is a massive stylistic fault, making understanding the author's meaning somewhat difficult from time to time.The book's organization is present but not in any truly engaging manner. The chapters seem a bit like lectures written into book form. Its lack of an index makes note taking, highlighting, etc. an absolute must. I am surprised that the second edition does not include an index, this seems like the sort of thing you would actually think to do when you go back to improve a text for its second edition.As I said before, this is a good book. It has its problems, but when it's on it's dead on. In spite of all of its stylistic and structural problems, it's still better written than some of the other books that people have recommended to me. The exercises are incredibly useful and generally easy to understand. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a handy book to help you understand obedience training in terms of the way dogs learn (and also recommend that you find a good trainer, have him or her recommend other titles to you and start classes as quickly as possible). Donaldson's explanation of how to teach your dog how to play fetch works. My dog wasn't really getting it, but Donaldson's book gave me the tools I needed to get my dog to understand what I was wanting from him."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Before this book was recommended to me by my vet, I had my puppy enrolled in a 'classical' training class with choke chains, leash 'pops' and the like.This book does an excellent job of explaning what works (operant conditioning) and what doesn't ('classic' training with choke collars) and WHY.Please -- do your dog a favor.

This book has some good points, most notably debunking the Lassie paradigm. But her training method for teaching a dog not to jump is crazy making. She induces the dog to try to jump and then gives it a cue that it has made a mistake. A better method is to teach a dog to come up and touch his nose to a hand target and then sit. If your hand is low the dog can not jump. There are better books out on dog psychology and training. The Coppinger's book Dogs, a new theory of dog evolution is excellent. While pricey, Steven Lindsay's books &quot;handbook of applied dog behavior and training&quot; Volumes 1 and 2 are about the best out there. These are college level texts but written in a readable style with information on how dogs learn, biochemistry, genetics, breed traits, and more. Works by Skinner, the Bailey's and real life dog trainers are used as sources. Another lower priced book is &quot;How Dogs Learn&quot; by John Bailey and Mary Burch. This is real dog psychology and learning, not pop stuff with emotional and biased writing."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The back cover of this book sports a recommendation saying that the book is \\"literally overflowing with information that's so new it virtually redefines the state of the art in dog training.\\" Alas, I've been unable to find this information anywhere in the book. In much of the book Donaldson quite correctly points out techniques used by many, perhaps the majority, of dog owners that are bound to make life sour for the dog and the owner, such as punishing a dog for an offense comitted hours ago or yanking him around forever on a choker. That the people doing this are wrong and Donaldson is right is proven thousands of times every day by people who can't train their dog. Yet nothing about this is new. If Donaldson had consulted dog training literature even from the nineteenth century, she would have found the same observations. (E.g., Carl Tabel's very punishment-oriented classic makes this point very clear.) These things were known long before Skinner ever got to abuse his first rat.Donaldson's strong aversion against punishment is entirely acceptable, yet the way she condemns everyone who uses corrections in her moralistic tone is not. Donaldson admits that corrections, if and only if adminstered correctly, can increase the reliability of a command, and she also admits that one can reasonably argue that a command that could save the dog's live might be \\"installed by all means necessary.\\" She could have added that the increased reliability can lead to increased freedom for the dog, and thus enhance his quality of life. What is more, at the end of the book, when she finally gives practical training advice, Donaldson falls into using \\"active corrections\\" all the time. Her innocent insistence about halters and anti-pull harnesses that \\"I honestly don't know how it works. Perhaps there's some aversive being applied.\\" is ridiculous. These things might indeed be better for many dog owners than choke collars, but the reason is, and Donaldson herself correctly states, that in order to deliver a convincing correction with a choker you need to apply a serious yank. Like so many other advocates of \\"positive-reinforcement only\\" training, Donaldson does not practice what she preaches. I have seen people who clearly abuse corrections, people who arguably overuse them, and people who arguably underuse them, but I never have seen anyone living with a dog who did not apply some form of coercion or punishment at times.Finally, Donaldson needs a better editor. Her constant use of nouns as verb modifiers and techniques of emphasis \\"soooooo\\" make me \\"distress vocalize.\\""},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The Culure Clash by Jean Donaldson can be broken up into three parts:The first of which is a statistical rendering of dog psychology which, to me, is very dry. Although well written, the first several chapters do little to actually shed any light on what really motivates canines or how to predict their behavior. The second third of the book over-emphasizes the need to positively reinforce behavior with treats and walks to the point where the text degenerates into kindergarten-level drivel. The third portion of the book seems to have been written with a thesaurus in hand, citing the pitfalls of under-socialized dogs while never advising any useful socialization techniques for adult dogs.

What is the point of insulting your readers who are trying to learn something new? To that end this book is worthless.Much better alternatives would be the excellent books by The Monks of New Skete: \\"How to Be Your Dog's Best Friend: The Classic Training Manual for Dog Owners (Revised & Updated Edition)\\" and \\"The Art of Raising a Puppy\\" They spend less time extolling the author's own points of view and instead actually talk about dogs in a way that doesn't make the reader feel like an idiot."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Frankly I wasn't able to read the book all the way through, I had trouble with the author spending a lot of effort unnecessarily slamming other training methods and theories, and in some instances talking down to the reader. Her theories should be able to stand on their own merits without bashing other theories. Organization is also lacking, often introducing things and then noting that follow up of the will occur later in the book. I tend to prefer starting on a subject and completing it within a given section. The chapters could generally stand some editing to allow the book to be used for easier reference by issue, given that this is for the most part a training guide.While I agree with most of the author's training methods I also see the validity in other methods since there truly appears to no given method that out shines all of the others. I do like the positive reinforcement approach to dog training that most people are now practicing,and while the method presented is a good sound method of training dogs I don't see it being heads and shoulders above the rest. All in all this book could be a very good guide if it were made to be more positive, reorganized by content, and overall cut back by about 30%."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean Donaldson nails it. She explains behavior so that the dog owner realizes that Fido doesn't have an ax to grind - Fido just found something fun to do. Whether or not it coincides with the owner's wishes is an entirely different matter! Makes me see my 6 month old, 75 pound German Shepherd in an entirely different light. I've been around dogs for 30 years and this is one of the best books I've seen. She doesn't sugar coat anything, just explains behavior and suggests how to shape it to fit the owner's life style. Mandatory reading for every dog owner!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"As breeder of Australian Shepherds, this is a book I will be sending out with every puppy I sell. I have not enjoyed a dog book more. So much of what Jean says..is &quot;oh my god, of course, that makes sense! &quot;, but seldom put into use. If you don't have this book in your personal library yet, GET IT!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This has got to be the best fifteen bucks I've spent on any dog book. The Culture Clash is an amazing mixture of scientific objectivity and a very real love for dogs. Has a good balance of theory and specific instructions, and will be appreciated by the clicker training community."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean's book is a must read for the content. The information she provides is extremely valuable. In particular the information on the natural behavior of dogs and theory of operant conditioning. Five stars for content. However, the general organization needs help. In the early portion of the book she mixes theory with practical training drills making the theory hard to follow and the drills hard to find later. Her sentence structure is sometimes ponderous and difficult to read through. Two stars for organization and editing."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"A fantastic review of a mentality that results in brilliantly well trained dogs, and more importantly, intelligent owners. She does a great job of placing the responsibility for good dog behaviour squarely where it belongs: on the owner. She provides plenty of practical examples to illustrate her points. This book is a MUST read for anyone who has never trained a dog before, for people looking to improve their training skills, and for experts looking for solutions to training problems. She dispels the myth of a dog as a small, fuzzy, person, and details why this is ok! Her methods do not exclusively use food, but seek 'real life reinforcers' as rewards for behavior. Practical examples are given to illustrate what might otherwise be confusing behaviourist jargon. Get to the heart of REAL training. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is a wonderful book. I only wish I had it when my dogs were puppies. It is full of useful and practical information. A must read for anyone who cares about raising their dogs to be well adjusted and happy."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"A must for every dog owner or anyone considering getting a dog. It's tells what dogs really are and not what we think they should be. It has great real training methods that are gentle and positive. These methods help built a great realationship between you and your dog. I've read the book through and have used many of the training methods with great success. Most of all it encourages you and your dog to have fun."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I considered myself pretty progressive regarding dog training and behavior and then I read this book and realized I needed to update my thinking even more. The book is so good I bought 5 more to give to my friends with dogs. I STRONGLY recommend it to anyone who owns a dog. It is really worth the read. After you read this book, then move on to clicker training books - especially anything by Karen Pryor. Using clicker training (discussed in Culture Clash as well), I was able to train my 7 week old Aussie puppy how to sit, down, give paw, \\"attention,\\" and \\"touch\\" (target) my hand, in about 3-5 minutes for each command. If you love your dogs, read these books and train them well."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is an excellent book that shares how a dog's mind really works when it comes to training. Many people have unrealistic expectations of what dogs should or shouldn't know. The Culture Clash is easy to read and is a fundamental building block to any training program. It puts the dog and dog owner on the same playing field, speaking the same \\"language.\\" Jean Donaldson makes this a very fun and enlightening book. Excellent! Evey dog owner should have this book in their personal library!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have owned, bred, trained, and shown many breeds, and I'm telling you, you simply cannot find a better book for getting into your dog's mind and understanding what makes them tick. All this makes for VAST better training. I have read so many 'understanding your dog' books it would make your head spin but this book puts them all to shame. For example, I was having trouble getting a real fast down from my Golden Retrvr. in obedience competition. After having read Jean's book,in a matter of minutes, we had the problem licked. Finished her title w/ a 1st place to boot.However, this book in not just for people in competition, it is for everyone who owns a dog. There are so many nuggets of truth on how your dog thinks and so many training tips, that you wonder why you hadn't perceived them on your own.This is the only book I recommend to my dog friends. Some may have difficulty getting past the psycho-lingo but it is so well, well worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I had this book recommended by a flyball trainer. I have read this book and found lots of great and useful information in it. However there are bits which I find completely wrong and just ignored those bits. Even so it is definately worth buying."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is such a great book! It completely blows old myths about dogs and dog training out of the water. Thankfully, as a first time dog owner, I'm on the right path with my new dog. Give this book as a gift to any new puppy owner and, of course, get it for yourself. Your dog and dogs everywhere will thank you!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I went to three different book store to find this book and now I can hardly get through it.The information is very disjointed and waffly where in contrast I was looking for a guide that would teach me how to solve problem behaviors through positive reinforcement - with the culture clash addressed in a documented rather than theoretical manner.Middle ground is sorely needed in this writer's perspective because pack mentality and extreme aversion training seem to have been lumped together in one terrible package. Canine dominance over humans is merely imaginary also, which raised a red flag for me.I don't twist my pet's ears or use a choke chain, however, a calm assertive ah ah or uh-oh along with body blocking, body language and restricted access to food, my bed and the couch has been excellent in calming him down. I have a VERY dominant Jack Russell terrier and after 4 years of living with his top dog attitude no book can convince me that the dominant behavior is imaginary. I see it every time we go to the dog park and he mounts dogs 4 times his size. I also see the improvements when I give him rules and make him work for his food.Motivating an animal with only food based rewards can often cause them to chain behavior (if I jump on the couch, then get off I get treated!) - I am a firm believer in positive reinforcement for wanted behavior and gentle retribution or just plain ignoring the dog for unwanted. It works.Asserting yourself as the dog's guardian/pack leader/alpha etc is to me essential to ensure the animal feels secure and protected but also respects you enough to obey commands if you leave your bait bag at home.Donaldson scoffs at those who ask the dog to wait before bolting through a doorway but personally I love that it gives my dog time to stop and think and wait for me to say that it's OK to go out there (after I have scoured for squirrels, cats etc) rather than follow the initial instinct of freeeeeeeeedommmmm!!!I am currently reading everything I can find to not only train my dog but educate me towards my dream of being a dog trainer and the most helpful book I have found so far is Be The Dog by Steve Duno as it actually provided clear, workable solutions to scenarios I am trying to solve.I would certainly read Culture Clash but take it with a grain of salt, I bought it hoping it would be the positive training bible it has been reviewed to be but I can't help but be suspicious of someone who doesn't even suggest how to control aggression - the reason why so many dogs end up in the SPCA in the first place. Coddling my dog also lead to the seperation anxiety I am now trying to fix.So far I prefer the style of Victoria Stillwell who proves that pack theory and positive training can go hand in hand."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"... but it's worth saying again. This is a very good book made almost useless by the lack of an index. I keep thinking, &quot;O.K., now that I've got all of this backgound to build on I'll sit down and outline a plan of action...&quot; but after about 10 minutes flipping back and forth to try and find what I want to include in that plan I sigh and put the book back on the shelf. Donaldson's a skilled and insightful writer, but &quot;Culture Clash&quot; doesn't really help you to act on that insight. I'd recommend it anyway, but not as a sole choice."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean Donaldson has some interesting things to say, no doubt. But her publisher has hobbled this book by including NO INDEX and a pathetic table of contents.Imagine this scenario: Fido's just knocked your child over. You remember something in the book that might help you correct this situation, but how do you find it? You can't! You're doomed to skimming through several chapters, and you'll likely give up before you find it.This book was published in 1997, and is highly recommended by many dog trainers. Hello, publisher!

It really isn't what I thought it would be. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have found the reviews to this book very telling. Let me say up front, I have not read this book. But I am using a behaviorist from the most reputable vetrinary school in this region. Since my initial consultation, my dog has attacked me numerous times, biting me two times severely. He challenges me constantly.I am medicating my dog with Paxil, although there are no efficacy studies for aggressive dogs. The trainer who called all this stuff a &quot;fad&quot; in his review of this book is voicing my fears when I started this &quot;non-violent&quot; technique. If my dog could laugh, he would laugh at me when I drag him to his quiet room after he attacks me.Maybe for some dogs, the new &quot;non-violent&quot; approach works, but for highly aggressive dogs, I believe this approach might be very dangerous to the owner and fatal to the dog.And I am sick of trainers dismissing the other techniques as dated, or cruel, or medievel."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is a great book to read along with your other dog training books. It focuses more on understanding why dogs do what they do, and especially on how dog 'culture' compares with/interacts with human 'culture.' I think that a few of the other reviewers are a bit off the mark when they criticize the book for not being a basic step by step training manual -- this criticism is technically accurate, but I don't see this book as being designed to fill that need (try the Monks of New Skete books for that). Instead, this book helps to understand WHY dogs behave (and react) the way they do. It helps lead to a training approach (or helps you understand how the dog reacts to you in general) where you see why the method/training works, as opposed to you just learning a training approach by rote.If you are looking for a step 1, step 2, step 3 type of training, this book is probably not the one to start with. If however you want to understand how and why dogs react the way they do, then this is a very helpful book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book was recommended by a professional trainer. We knew we had a poorly socialized, fearful dog, but didn't know where to start to re-educate an adult dog with an unknown history. We knew that the addition of a second, well socialized dog to the house had already done wonders for the first in terms of her confidence, but didn't know how to take the next step. This book has practical methods to identify and fix the root cause.On the other hand, if you think dogs are just furry people, you're going to have a hard time reading this book, because it will slap you upside the head on every page."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I got this book when it was fresh from the presses. Well, I even got two, I knew that was probably the only way I would be able to have one at home at all times, according to what I had heard about this book...English is not my language, and back then I had barely read a book in English, so I was a bit worried. I soon found out that there wasn't any need to worry... I brought it with me travelling the day I got it, and soon was totally captured. I even made a fool of myself, laughing out loud on the airplane.This book is so fun to read and it gives you so many \\"A-HA Experiences\\" about your dog and it's behavior... Back then I had my wonderful Shanti, the best Yorkie friend anyone could wish for. She had a tough past before I got her though, and was troubled by severe anxiety. The best thing I ever did for her, was getting this book and Turid Rugaas' book \\"On Talking Terms with Dog's: Calming Signals\\" (hope I got that right)... Soon Shanti and I understood each other much better, and her anxiety was much better controlled, giving us both a better quality of life. I will forever be grateful to Jean Donaldson for learning me how to understand Shanti (and now my also highly loved Yorkie Peanut) a lot better.I of course also had to buy Jean Donaldson's follow-up book (Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars...) \\"Dogs are from Neptune\\" a bit later, and it is just as wonderful as this one, also a must have, if you ask me.I find that books like this often get a bit boring, just like reading a school text book, if you get my drift... But that can surely not be said about Jean Donaldson's books. She has a wonderful writing style. It is easy to read and full of humor, makes you really understand in a fun way, with examples that makes you laugh and go \\"YESS!\\". It is definately not without reason that this book is a best-seller!!!And, I really must add, I really recommend buying more than one, because this is sure one of those books that everyone wants to borrow!!! If I had to do it again, I would get at least 3, because this is knowledge I sure want to share with friends and family!!! I had both of my books out at all times for a couple of years, as all my dog owner friends had to read it, even if many were real concerned by the fact that it wasn't written in Norwegian, and as me, they had never read a book in English... They're reactions were just like mine, it didn't matter at all, that is how easy to read it is, and on top of that you get some useful training in the English language (wonderful side effect of reading this book, don't you think?)!!! So, if your language is English, Chinese or Norwegian - Go for it!!!! Enjoy!!!Had I been able to give it 6 stars, I would have!!!I just have to mention a few other dog books that I got on amazon.com which I also recommend:Karen Pryor's books about Clicker Training, especially \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" - also must have's!!!John Fisher's books\\"Dominance, fact or fiction\\" (booklet) - Very useful (also in discussion with \\"the old school\\" dog owners who believe in being very rough with their dogs as if they were wolves)!!!\\"Dog Tricks for Dummies\\" - Tricks is a lot of fun both for you and your dog!!! Great for raising a battered dog's self esteem!!!(I'm probably forgetting some now, this is just from the top of my head)One booklet (\\"Reader's Digest format\\") which I really love too, I haven't been able to find here, I found it in a US Wal-Mart or K-Mart, is \\"What do Dogs Dream About\\", if you see it - Grab it!!!Happy Book Shopping!!!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I admire Jean Donaldson and her ideas. And what a pleasure it was to read something by a trainer who has a \\"so what?\\" attitude toward the \\"rules\\" about showing your dog you're alpha. She really sticks it to trainers whose techniques rely too much on the old alpha myth* (which accounts for the two stars, above). But what Donaldson fails to realize is that operant conditioning is almost as big a myth as the alpha theory (which accounts for there only being two stars).One of her main points is that \\"traditional\\" training (meaning dominance) creates negative side-effects, which is the main reason I gave up using those techniques years ago (in 1992) and turned to operant conditioning as a possible alternative. What I found, though, is that not all behavior can be learned (or unlearned) through conditioning. I also found that instinctive behaviors tend to override conditioned ones, and that a training system based primarily on food rewards (and by extension, clickers, since their effectiveness is dependant on the association made between the click and being given a food treat) can also create a negative learning experience for a dog. The truth is, food makes for a great inducement for most behaviors, but it's a rather shaky reinforcement.Someone reading this might say: Wait, go back a second. Did you just say that food rewards create a negative learning experience? That's impossible to believe. I mean, after all, it's called positive reinforcement, right?Yes, but \\"operant conditioning\\" works best when you use INTRINSIC REINFORCERS, meaning they're directly related to the behavior being learned. And food is not directly related to any obedience behavior other than sitting on command, or to a lesser degree to coming when called. On the other hand, EXTRINSIC REINFORCERS, which is what food usually is, don't work as well. Not only that but, according to the behavioral textbooks, extrinsic reinforcers can actually undermine the effectiveness of intrinsic reinforcers or just plain ruin the learning process entirely. How positive is that?Imagine you're a dog and you have strong instincts to chase things and bite them. That's what really floats your boat. The dominance trainer says, \\"Don't use your predatory energy or I'll punish you,\\" and the dog learns to obey by repressing those instincts, which leaves him feeling unfulfilled. The clicker trainer says, \\"There's no need to use that energy-look! I've got a cookie!\\" And the dog learns to obey by giving up what he really loves for some instant gratification of a lesser kind. And although his tummy is now full he still feels empty inside. A smart trainer would say, \\"What great instincts you have! Let's play a game that lets you use them by obeying my commands!\\" And the dog learns to obey because it just feels good, naturally. He feels totally happy and emotionally fulfilled because the reinforcement is built into the learning process and, thus, into the behavior itself.So, which of these models of learning is really the most positive for the dog? And which is the most effective?Nobel Prize winning biologist Konrad Lorenz said, \\"All animals learn best through play.\\" So while I'd read CULTURE CLASH for a fresh viewpoint about dogs, I definitely wouldn't use it as a training manual. Buy a copy of PLAY TRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, instead. Or better yet, try the more comprehensive NATURAL DOG TRAINING, by Kevin Behan. Both methods work via intrinsic reinforcers. It's kind of like the difference between learning something slowly and painfully by rote, through endless repetitions, and learning it instantly and permanently by being \\"in the zone.\\"*(The top wolf experts don't even like to use the word alpha anymore because, as Dr. L. David Mech puts it, \\"it falsely implies a hierarchical system.\\" (Canadian Journal of Zoology, 2002). No Alpha Wolf + No Hierarchy = No Alpha Theory.)"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I am a dog trainer who specializes in individual consultation for behavior problems. I first became aware of this book from clients who had followed Dondaldson's methods and couldn't understand why their dogs were so uncontrollable, didn't respect them, and in several cases were becoming aggressive. I've made a lot of money &quot;fixing&quot; these dogs and retraining their owners, but I'd just as soon not.Donaldson wants to be a behaviorist, but selectively -- dogs are dumb and learn via Skinnerian and Pavlovian conditioning, humans are smart and learn via insight and reason. Sorry, no cookie, Jean -- Skinner would be the first to tell you that. She sets up a straw man -- anthropomorphism/abusive training -- against her brand of operant conditioning, and ignores the work of ethologists and ethological trainers.When Donaldson doesn't like some insight into canine nature, or a training technique that has been proven to work, she simply dismisses it as &quot;stupid&quot; -- no argument or justification. She appears to have great contempt for the native intelligence of both dogs and their owners (her readers).The few good ideas that Donaldson includes are old saws of dog training, but she never acknowledges this fact.Donaldson's approach to training is a fad at the moment. Readers seeking to live with a civilized dog would be better served by writers such as Carol Benjamin, The Monks of New Skete, Brian Kilcommons and Job Evans. Readers who just want to know how a dog &quot;works&quot; (ethology) should look at works by Roger Abrantes, Konrad Lorenz, and Michael Fox."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I struggle with how to rate this book, to be perfectly honest.I agree with many of the fundamental concerns raised by the author and think that there is good information hidden in these pages. On the other hand, the author's tone is so profoundly abrasive that I kept having to put the book down for a breather. She makes me want to argue back, and I am a reader who actually agrees with much of what she is saying. I can't imagine that her arguments, presented as they are, find much foothold with an audience that still needs to be persuaded. Which is too bad, because I do think she has some good points to make.The most-helpful critical review mentions that a lot of this book reads as though the author is giving an outraged point-by-point rebuttal to well-known dog training authorities she really dislikes. I would agree with that. Often a passage will feel strangely personal and like something that could be omitted without losing a single bit of useful information for the reader.So, in sum: how to rate this title? One star, for being vitriolic and petulant to the point of being unreadable? Or four stars, for containing useful information? I settled on two stars (not the worst, but I can't recommend it in good conscience), but really I would recommend that you read Karen Pryor's much better-written, more cheerful, less cranky, and generally much more informative DON'T SHOOT THE DOG, a book I have re-read multiple times and which continues to be, in my opinion, a classic in the field.Give it a try:Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The reader who gave this book 1 star and called it horsehockey recommends books by Carol Benjamin and The Monks of New Skete. Both of these authors condone violence against dogs in the name of &quot;training&quot; and I do NOT recommend them for anyone who does not want to hit, strangle or hang their dog up by the neck until it passes out.Culture Clash is for intelligent readers who want to train with gentleness, using proven training techniques. They WORK, but only if you use them properly.Anyone who can't get a dog to learn using these techniques is doing it wrong, plain and simple."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"When I read this book I felt I was being lectured to. The author seemed to think that only she knew the right way to train dogs. She presented a good argument for what she said but there were so many contradictions in her book that I became confused and doubtful. The reviews to the book on amazon.com were so different it added to my confusion. The good part is that it caused me to do more reading to understand what was being said. I found other books that spent all their time telling how wonderful their way of training was with little or no practicle advice. The books that helped to get a better understanding and didn't spend all their time saying how wonderful they are were written by Carol Benjamin, The Monks of New Kete, Karen Pryor and a new author Captain Haggerty who is very funny and explains so many different things."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I can't tell you how many times I've had a dog-owner tell me \\"My dog thinks he's person.\\" They usually deliver this gem as if this is a good thing, while their. dog (mostly small and fuzzy) barks wildly, snaps, charges, wraps it's leash around my ankles while I walk my own well-trained dog (who is perfectly content being a dog). Occasionaly the dog-who-thinks-it's-a-person is constrained in a baby carriage. I have yet to meet one of these \\"person/dogs\\" who wasn't a total mess.Well, your dog doesn't think he's a person. Jean Donaldson makes this perfectly clear in the 2nd edition of her ground-breaking book \\"The Culture Clash: A revolutionary new way to understanding the relationship between humans and domestic dogs.\\" Donaldson fires a clean shot across the bow of our Disney-fication of dogs by stating right at the top that dogs are amoral scavenger-predators by nature, whose self-interest trumps any desire to please us. Human concepts of Good & Bad are lost on them. They are loveable aliens in our midst, who are best integrated into our households and society by understanding the huge differences our two species, not by papering over them.Otherwise dogs suffer greatly at our hands, often winding up abandoned, in shelters, euthanized. Donaldson offers us an alternative to this deadly disconnect. By understanding how dogs learn we are able to teach them(without jerking, and pulling, and punishing) how to best live in our society to our mutual benefit. \\"The Dog Whisperer,\\" that fount of misinformation and discredited techniques, would be well-served to read this book, as would every dog owner, or anyone considering becoming one."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book is at the very top of my must read list for clients. I completely disagree with the previous review. Jean donaldson is one of the best, most experienced trainers out there. She is also in charge of the Behavior &amp; Training course at the SF SPCA. To put it bluntly, she knows her dogs! As a professional dog trainer who works with aggressive dogs regularly I can tell you that her methods DO work. If the other reviewer had problems it was probably due to inacurrate application of the methods. After all, training is a mechanical skill."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Culture Clash is a good example of a classic that really needs to be recast, re-edited in some aggressive ways.This book gets an incredible number of word-of-mouth recommendations from within the dog world, and for good reason. It's also somewhat exasperating, also for good reason. An updated edition might turn into a sort of Dr. Spock guide for dogs; as it is, even for its few blemishes, if you're interested in training at all -- you have a dog, you should be interested -- you need to read this one.The book is basically an engagingly-written set of essays on positive-reinforcement, operant-conditioning dog training. (In a nutshell, that means concentrating on setting a dog up to succeed, and then on rewarding it when it does succeed, rather than on punishing the dog for mistakes.) Culture Clash does two things: it gives you a broad sense of why positive reinforcement techniques work, and it really, REALLY lays into old-style, aversive, leash-jerking training methods. The reason it gets recommended so much is that it's GREAT for people who have only a vague idea of how to train a dog based on what they see others doing, and who might end up with a miserable dog and a sore arm from tugging at a choke collar. Donaldson does a truly excellent job of showing you how and why positive reinforcement will help you communicate with your dog. She does a great job showing you how happy that can feel, and showing you the broad outline of how it works.What she DOESN'T do especially well in this book is give you a specific, basic training regimen for your dog. That's where my editing objection comes in.As I said, the chapters in this book are almost more like stand-alone essays. They don't really flow into one another as well as you might expect. Other, how-to training guides will structure themselves around common issues -- a chapter about housetraining, or sections based on a puppy's age or something. Culture Clash doesn't do that. It reads more like Jean Donaldson -- a lively, agile writer whose style and sense of humor is a delight to read -- sat down and decided to write a set of thematic articles, and like those got packaged together in the form of the book. Each essay is trying to do both the book's jobs at the same time, so we're talking about treats and clickers AND ripping into the &quot;Bad Dog&quot; school of thought simultaneously. That means the level of detail in the text varies pretty dramatically from page to page. So, for example, you'll be reading about how to train a &quot;down stay&quot; or something, and suddenly Ms. Donaldson is skewering leash-jerking in a long aside. She delivers her barbs with obvious relish and skill, she's a heck of a writer, but when you're reading to pick up practical tips, that's a somewhat frustrating style to work through.So, the chapters in Culture Clash are this sort of mishmash of different material, but it's well-written and you enjoyed reading it through. Now, you remember some clever idea about how to train that &quot;down stay&quot; that Rex just can't &quot;get.&quot; You turn to the index... and there isn't one. The single easiest thing the publisher of this book NEEDS to do is include a thorough index. Argh! Frustration!The other irony, of course, is that the book doesn't use positive reinforcement on the reader all that well. When Donaldson goes after the leash-jerkers, or talks about ear pinching at obedience schools, she's saying &quot;BAD DOG&quot; to the old school of dog obedience in about as loud a voice as anyone can write in. You can see why a few people take this book as a sort of personal affront. She sure isn't luring THEM along, she's just plain scolding...If you're already sold on the idea of a rewards-based training regimen for your dog, I still think you'll get a lot out of this book. You might want to avoid dealing with a lot of the hard-hitting criticism, though, and choose a simpler how-to guide. &quot;The Power of Positive Dog Training&quot; by Ms. Donaldson and Pat Miller, is a more practical guide than Culture Clash. It gives you a specific, six-week training regimen. Also, Karen Pryor would be a good author for you; she has a great puppy book, and a nice little book-with-two-clickers-and-some-treats kit that sells in pet stores. Pryor spends almost no time on dissing the &quot;bad trainers,&quot; she's all about the positives.(If you've got kids, you may want to go with something a little more accessible for them; there are guides specifically written for the whole family that way, but you should probably judge those by age by seeing them in a store.)"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I was originally turned off by the beginning of this book. The author's ideas about dogs having no &quot;desire to please&quot; their owners was so contrary to everything that is considered basic about dog training and dog behavior that I didn't believe it to be true. However, she thoroughly backed up her ideas and completely clarified the difference between &quot;desire to please&quot; as we see it and &quot;desire to get treats or attention&quot; as the dog sees it.It's difficult to get beyond the &quot;Disney&quot; approach to dogs as she calls it, the way society and Hollywood have taught us dogs should behave, but the book opened my eyes to what sort of relationship dogs really have with people.The book takes dog training from a dog's point of view - and that is the best way to get results. The empathy for the dog's position that the author encourages was a completely new experience for me. I adopted an adult dog from a shelter four months ago who had never been indoors before. She had been abused and you could hardly say &quot;no&quot; to her without her cringing and running away. I needed a training method that was completely positive and non-abusive in every sense of the word. More importantly, I needed a training method that worked.My dog can sit, down, stay, come, wait, drop, and fetch; she doesn't jump up, she doesn't chase the cats, and she's housebroken - all thanks to this book.The author thoroughly takes you through the way dogs learn with specific examples and exercises. It's hard not to get excited about teaching your dog after learning so completely how to teach!I highly recommend this book to new dog owners and to people looking to improve their relationship with their pets. Getting rid of unrealistic expectations makes all the difference in understanding and relating to your dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have read many dog training books in the past 6 months, but this is the only one that really rang true for me. Jean Donaldson articulates what many dog owners have felt for some time: that yanking, yelling and regimentation do NOT constitute positive training methods. She rightly calls slip-collars and choke chains &quot;strangulation collars,&quot; and makes it clear that the &quot;leash correction&quot; is simply a punishment -- and not a very effective one at that. Her whole training ethos is based on the premise that dogs are dogs, not people. That may sound pretty obvious, but it doesn't seem to be, at least not to traditional dog trainers. If you have a dog that likes to be a dog (interacts with both humans and dogs in the same manner, and doesn't like to be restrained in any way) Donaldson's training methods will save your sanity -- and perhaps your dog's life. This book is more than a manual, however, as it fully explains the theory before detailing the methods. Along the way, it provides a good read and some great laughs. This is also the first book I've read that describes some fun and effective training games to play with your dog, rather than just saying &quot;play with your dog.&quot; It's not all fun and games though: I dare you to read the section called &quot;Empathy 101&quot; and remain unmoved toward the plight of the average family dog. My only (minor) complaint about &quot;Culture Clash&quot; is that it needs either a more detailed Table of Contents, an Index, or both. That said, however, I urge you to buy this book, and leave the traditional methods of dog training back in WWII, where they began, and where they belong!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"A new way of understanding dogs from the dog's point of view. The book is brimming with empathy, humor, and understanding. Jean Donaldson is above all a very PRACTICAL lady - and her approach is very functional - it works! I particularly liked the insight that biting is natural behavior for dogs, i.e. that even the &quot;nicest&quot; dog will bite and it is therefore extremely important to train bite inhibition with ALL dogs. Donaldson also reminds us that dogs have no sense of morals and that they see a large percentage of the world as &quot;chew-toys&quot; or &quot;food&quot; (even your italian shoes and gum on the sidewalk), unless they are TAUGHT otherwise. The last section on practical training is brief, but extremely well written - if you follow this program you will end up with a recall proofed against virtually everything (yes, I've tried it). I recommend &quot;The Culture Clash&quot; to everyone interested in dogs."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I lend out lots of books to friends and neighbors. This is the only one I make sure is returned. Within a few weeks of bringing our shelter pup home, she was agressive and totally out of control. Among other problems, the choke collar seemed to enrage her and I couldn't figure our why! After reading this book I RAN out and bought a halti harness and a huge bucket of treats. The results of positive reinforcement and intensive food reward training were immediate and dramatic. Now the days of choke collars and alpha rollovers are are in the past and I think (I hope) my pup has forgiven me for my bad judgement. I can't reccomend this book strongly enough. I feel like it has allowed me to understand my dog (as much as a human can)."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I am a professional dog trainer, and *Culture Clash* is the only book I recommend to all dog owners, regardless of experience with dogs, training knowledge and ability, etc. Donaldson covers what I feel is the most important aspect of dog ownership -- bite prevention -- with a thoroughness that no other book does. Rather than blaming the dog for doing what comes naturally, she teaches the reader how to change the dog's natural responses to ones that are acceptable to human beings. And this will save many dogs' lives.Donaldson has been criticized for her up-front language, particularly when it comes to her criticisms of traditional (largely competitive) obedience trainers. But this is one of the things I like BEST about the book. Rather than pussyfoot around the issue of punishment, she confronts it head-on and then offers alternatives.A wonderful book that is not only very informative, but so well-written that you read it like a novel."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book is hands down one of the best ways to a better relationship with your dog. A little advanced for the average owner, but OH SO helpful. I had read all the Carol Lea Benjamin books, and I think they are great. I do a lot of rescue though, and slip/nylon collars on the rescues was not my cup of tea. So many of the dogs come thin and so food/love motivated, so I thought it was time to start with food. My, oh my, I'll never go back. I have read some of the reviews that allude to Jean being holier-than-thou in her approach. I think you need to read the book again, and rethink the title. She is indeed challenging many of our notions about dogs-- like wanting to please us always. I had already figured out that my dog was out for #1. He likes me and all, but when push comes to shove, he wants what HE wants when HE wants it-- especially attention. And that makes him no less of a dog. I think Jean is simply passionate about what she has come to believe to be true through research. OH-- THE CHAPTERS ON DOGS AND KIDS-- WOW!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"There's not a whole lot I can add to the other five-star reviews on this site. I especially loved DGodley's comment, &quot;Jean Donaldson's book has given me a whole new perspective - to appreciate dogs in their own unique way, and to finally realize that they are another species of being, not just children in fur!&quot; If every dog owner came to this realization, there would be a lot fewer dogs surrendered to shelters or euthanized because they failed to live up to their owners expectations, since many of those expectations are more appropriate to human beings in fur suits than to dogs.After 40 years of reading every dog book I can get my hands on, I confess to being jaded--I pick up new dog training books, riffle through them, think &quot;same old, same old&quot; and put them back. Jean Donaldson broke me out of that pattern! This book has so much to offer. It should be required reading for everyone who lives with a dog, or who is thinking about living with a dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The training strategies proposed in this controversial book are RIGHT ON! The most straightforward, effective, and HUMANE dog training book I have ever read.However, I had a bit of trouble with the abrupt and often insulting style in which Ms. Donaldson writes. It is obvious that she feels strongly about her views regarding dog care and training, but insulting others is not always the best way to get your point across. Also, I don't completely buy her theory that all shy/timid/slow-to-warm-up-to-strangers dogs are a product of poor socialization. I do believe that different breeds and invidual dogs have different temperaments and personalities. But, Ms. Donaldson would probably just call me an old-fashioned moron.Overall, this book is a humane and intelligent resource for dog trainers, new and old, but it is not for overly sensitive souls.

I am a dog trainer, and as such it is difficult to tell people why some dog behavior is going wrong, it's simply not what they want to hear, but if everyone read this book and understood, we could finally move forward.

No, but the book title clearly does not state that it is supposed to be.Is she harsh in her explanations and chastising of falsely attributing non-dog traits to dogs? Yes. You'll find a lot of behaviorists that get tired of sugar coating everything and rely on a matter of fact scientific evidence. (if you would like a book on training dogs she has one for that too)Although she is critical in her explanations there is a fair amount of humor for the dog lover, but it is a simple enough layout that any newbie in the field of dogs can understand what she is getting at. I don't think anyone can have a good relationship with their dog (from the dog's perspective at least) without knowing some of the key points in this book even if unconsciously."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book does a good job of explaining operant conditioning in a concise yet thorough fashion. It serves as a great introduction to aspiring trainers and dog owners. This book has the power to promote the dog lover to the level of the educated \\"dog person.\\" I know plenty of people who love dogs, but most owners are completely ignorant as to how their dogs actually learn and perceive their world. She explains that while humans are good at attributing emotions and thoughts to other humans, they mistakenly use this same theory of mind technique with their dogs. In other words, they anthropomorphize. Donaldson does a great job of having her readers assume the perspective of a dog--a cognitive challenge for many humans. I'd like to emphasize that this book is NOT intended to be a how-to training manual. She does include some training tips, but it's mainly a book about the methodology and philosophy associated with operant conditioning. If you are looking for a how-to training manual, I highly recommend this:Train Your Dog Like a ProThere are some holes in her reasoning. Throughout the book, she states that a dog does not have the capacity to detect the emotions of humans. We know that dogs can smell cancer long before any machine can detect it. We also know that dogs can be trained to predict seizures and panic attacks in humans. Based on these observations, there is no reason to omit the possibility that dogs can sense many other internal states. I'd be interested to look at future academic research in this area.Donaldson also claims that dogs are \\"amoral.\\" If you look at the dictionary definition of \\"moral,\\" you find this: of, pertaining to, or concerned with the principles or rules of right conduct or the distinction between right and wrong. Sure, dogs may not have a human moral code, but all social animals have their own species-specific system of right vs. wrong. Dog-specific morals may be different from human morals, but this doesn't mean they don't have their own system. What I find contradictory is that although she categorizes dogs as amoral, she goes on to describe social rituals that are present in dog-dog socialization. Isn't the fact that dogs possess social rituals indicative of a moral system? You see this all the time at dog parks. There will be many well-socialized dogs playing and adhering to The Golden Rule of reciprocity (play is not possible without reciprocation), and all of the sudden a rude adolescent enters wreaking pandemonium. The social code of conduct is the primer for successful social interaction and species-specific morality serves as a prerequisite for social harmony. I have to brazenly say that Donaldson is wrong on the issue of morality in dogs. It does exist; it's just not the same as human morality."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"To be frank, when I read this book years ago it changed my life.

Most of the writing has been covered before and better. Most trainers have a personal style, bias, and experience that contribute to their own take on training but generally speaking there are not many different ways to teach sit, stand, down and wait, this book is no different, if you've read a good book on positive training you can likely skip this one as it offers nothing 'new'."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"My dog-eared, worn-cover, beaten up copy of The Culture Clash, signed by Jean Donaldson Oct. 5, 1997, is one of my most prized books in my dog training library. I've had the great opportunity to attend her seminars and listen to her speak on a few occasions. It's a book that is required reading for any serious student of dog behavior. It's also great for anyone just interested in learning more about dog behavior and training. Let me explain why:1. The book opens with \\"Getting The Dog's Perspective - Walt Disney vs. B.F. Skinner\\" and goes on to explain that dogs are amoral animals, that they have no understanding of right and wrong. She adds that dogs don't spite us, get back at us or feel guilty for doing \\"bad behavior.\\" When we believe that our dogs are getting back at us, or trying to spite us, they end up getting a lot of punishment.Think about it, you come home after a long day at work only to find your favorite $200 pair of shoes chewed to bits. If you think your dog did that to \\"get back at you\\" you would dole out a nice big dose of punishment. In reality, your dog was stressed at being left alone and chewed to relieve the stress. The next day you leave for work and your dog feeling stressed again, chews your kitchen chairs. You walk in the house and think, \\"He did it again to ME!\\" Severe punishment follows.If this happens again and again the behavior is likely to get worse. In reality, your dog is not associating the chewing with his behavior. The chewing is a direct result of your behavior. Your dog associates the punishment with your homecoming. You walk in the door and pound him - this sets up a behavioral history. When you walk out the door there is a good chance that when you come back in a beating will follow.Everyday you leave and your dog learns that when you come home he is going to be punished. It's all very stressful. How does the dog relieve stress - CHEWING!Jean Donaldson explains this process so well and really gives you insights into why your dog is behaving a certain way.2. Chapter 2 continues with the fact that dogs are predatory animals, that they are hard wired to search, stalk, rush, chase, bite/hold/shake/kill, and to dissect and eat(prey). This chapter is particularly important because of the writing on tug-o-war, the most misunderstood game in \\"dogdom\\".In addition to tug-o-war, she discusses alone training, chew training and a lot more.3. Chapter 3 on Socialization, Conflict Resolution, Fear and Aggression goes on to give some of the best advice for new puppy owners. The sections on bite inhibition, timid puppies, dog-dog socialization, food bowl exercises, object exchanges, and the bite threshold model is a must read for any new puppy owner.4. Chapter 4 - Its All Chew Toys To Them, starts off with the story of The Gorns. The Gorns is an excellent story of putting us in the position of dogs. Humans are kept as companion animals to a more intellectually sophisticated species.Imagine living on a planet with a Gorn and this Gorn punishes you for doing normal human behavior like: Shaking hands, sitting on couches, eating anything but \\"Human Chow,\\" etc.Think about dogs, they get punished for sniffing each others butts (human equilevlent to shaking hands), sitting on the couch, trying to eat anything other than the food from a bag that we feed them. This is a very eye-opening chapter.5. Chapter 5 is the one chapter that I think makes a lot of people upset - \\"Lemon Brains But We Still Love Them.\\" The first paragraph of this chapter she states:\\"The enmeshment between dog owners and Walt Disney has been too tight to allow behaviorism in. We've been clinging to the wish that dogs might just have big, convoluted, melon brains like humans and have a natural desire to please. The fact of the matter is dogs have little, smoothish lemon brains and are looking out for number one. I personally still like them.\\"It's an excellent chapter that goes on to explain how behaviors are taught. Much of what has been taught on dog training is false. For years dog owners have been told that when a dog does NOT do the command the dog is being dominant. The dog owner is then instructed to be \\"The Alpha\\" and apply appropriate force, setting up a negative situation between dog and owner. If we truly believe that the dog has a natural desire to please, then the dog should want to do it for us.On the other hand, if we take a realistic view and understand that as Jean states, \`They are looking out for number one,\\" we figure out what the proper motivation is to teach the dog to do the command.6. The final chapter finishes up with instructions on how to teach your dog obedience commands starting with kindergarten levels and working up to PhD levels.The relationship between dogs and humans is a long one. It's time that we stop expecting our dogs to think like us and learn to think like our dogs.Is it any reason that we have 56 million dog bites every year in the United States? The only way were going to make that number go down is to read books like Jean Donaldson's book, The Culture Clash."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"There's a ton of great info in this book.

Recently we added a new puppy to our family and was able to train her so much easier utilizing Jean Donaldson's wisdom. This book gave so very much insight that i would recommend it to all dog owners - it just makes so much sense!!!!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"...this should be the one. Jean expresses what many of us have suspected for years about the relationships between dogs and people. She gives the reader a dog's eye view of things, which we can use to decipher why dogs often have such a hard time fitting in to a human household, and what we can do to help them adjust - without the need for punishment and fear. Read this if you love your dog. If you are disappointed with your dog's behavior, and don't know what to do, understanding is the first step - this book will get you there."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is the best first book for any new dog owner. It helps one understand the mind of a dog. Once the basics of &quot;dogology&quot; are down, the owner can move on to training the new pet. Donaldson teaches us her philosophy behind training -- that using reward instead of punishment yields a well-trained dog, as well as a warm relationship between pet and owner. A win-win situation! What's not to like?"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Anyone who is thinking about getting a dog, or who already has one should buy this book immediately. This book is easy to read, full of real-life examples, and very useable. I can't think of another book that I recommend to my clients more often."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I agree with most of the reviews, however, this is a book that is not for the novice dog owner who wants to teach their dog basic obedience. For that it's too intense and heavy reading. The most annoying thing about the book (especially for dog trainers who would like to refer back to something) is that there is NO INDEX! REALLY??? How terribly inconvenient.For novice dog owners: After you've put yourself and your dog through a basic obedience course at your local Petco, pick up \\"Don't shoot the dog\\" for instance."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"First, I'd like to respond to some of the complaints that some readers had about the book - that it's got too much attitude or that it's demeaning to the intelligence of dogs or that it's disorganized. Let's remember, to begin with, that this book was published in 1996! Maybe cut it *some* slack? At the time of the mid-90s, there was very little information on reward-based training, and certainly not much in the area of literature - IF ANY AT ALL.I got my first dog in 1999 and the few books I purchased to learn how to train my dog (with the exception of this one) all talked dominance theory and choke chains. So, if the author appeared to take her stance very seriously, it's because the prevailing climate at the time was entirely comprised of punishment-driven techniques. And these tactics were or are often propelled by the idea that dogs are capable of the same vindictive thoughts and motivations of humans - that they do things to spite their owners, for example. In this respect, Jean helps clarify how dogs brains and minds differ, and playfully refers to them as lemon brains. Given that she's a dog lover, I highly doubt she meant to say they are stupid. It's simply a new way of looking at dogs that might help you as the trainer not so quickly lose your temper when working with them. Hence the title, \\"Culture Clash.\\" It's not a bad thing if the aim is to have you and your dog get along better.As far as the organization of the book, it's written in a somewhat conversational style which may resonate with you or not depending on what you like as a reader. It's very subjective. When it comes to the content however, this book is one of the originals, if not \\"the original.\\" So take it all in with the proverbial grain of salt. This author and book were pioneers. Parts of it could probably use an update. My recommendation is to combine your reading of this book with some of the newer authors (like Patricia McConnell or Pat Miller) so you get a more multi-faceted view of this new and important training methodology.Lastly, as an aside, this book did wonders for me and my \\"difficult\\" dog at a time when few trainers would or could. So, I can speak to its effectiveness."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"You don't have to be a dog whisperer to get your dog to behave, according to this book. It makes a lot of sense to me! I've tried a couple of the techniques with my Yellow Lab and they do work indeed. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I've learnt so much from this book, and also gone on to read more about dog training (the good ones that is - non-aversive, dog friendly methods). I wish more people read this book. Dogs and people would be less stressed out and training could be fun.This is not necessarily a step by step instructional manual, but it is a very, very important foundational book to understand what is going on with our dogs and demystifies alot of things. There are definitely still good instructions in this book on training though - and I have used them to great success. Like now, I know that I can play tug safely with my dog (and that it is a natural thing for dogs - and a great energy burner) and we both have fun, and he practices 'drop it' all at the same time."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"She doesn't mince words, so if you can't take it, this book might not be your favorite. But the information is so important I hope everyone reading these reviews will look past that. Donaldson knows her stuff, and backs it up well in this book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The first edition of this book was the basis for training my now 8 year old dog. Using her methods and insights, my husband and I raised the best behaved and happiest dog I know (I'm not biased or anything :). But that aside, her points were pivotal in our mindset in raising our dog. I read everything out when we decided to get a puppy and Jean's book was the easiest read and best book to guide our training. My husband still refers to her book 7 years later. We've loaned it out so many times that it's dog-eared. I'm so glad she's put out a 2nd edition because the last person never returned my original. We've got a new puppy to raise and I'm so glad I'll have the latest edition to brush up my mindset. Ignore the bad reviews, Jean has written a classic, must-read for dog owners who truly want to understand their dogs and train them the right way."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This excellent book was recommended to me by my vet, and is invaluable when it comes to working out how to get your dog to behave, or not behave, in a certain way, without resorting to cruel or unusual punishments.The quality of the writing isn't that great, and this can make it a little hard to read. However the information is golden, and I'd recommend it to anyone with, or planning to get a dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is a must read for all dog owners. Jean Donaldson does a great job explaining in layman's terms how dogs learn, and why they behave the way they do.

I work in the veterinary field and will definitely recommend this book to anyone with dog behavior questions."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"As a Dog Trainer and Canine Behaviorist, I have read many, many books on canine behavior and training. This book is one of best I have ever read. The dog training and veterinary behaviorist world also acknowledge this book as an icon. It is well written, sensible, and an enjoyable read. If you are a canine professional or just want to understand your dog better, this book will be invaluable. Buy it!!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"After not having a dog for quite some time, I recently brought a Doberman puppy into our home.

A must read for any and all dog owners."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is a very informative book packed with information that I had never thought of before.

Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"&quot;Culture Clash&quot; has absolutely changed an anthropomorphic perception of dogs I accumulated during childhood. Jean Donaldson walks the reader through a dogs eye view of human behaviors, and it is liberating to dispose of classic mistakes that people make.Though I'm sure behaviorism can't explain the full richness of dog-human relationships, it is certainly a useful training model. The style is colloquial, but charming once you get the rhythm. Jean, my future dog thanks you."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"If you want plain, no nonsense advice about dog trainig, buy this book. Jean Donaldson, much like Ian Dunbar, bases training techniques on positive reinfocement. In a nut shell her, advice works. In time, so will your dog."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Looking past the horrific editing and unprofessional packaging, I found this an interesting read, even though the author manages to undermine many of her more interesting insights by overstating her case. Most of her problems stem from her compliance to Skinnerian behaviorism, one whose theoeretical and practical inadequacies were revealed decades ago (logical behaviorism and functionalism were the results). More sophisticated understandings of conditioning and of behavior would play more than simple lip service to what genetics brings to the table. Things like temperament, hardness, drive are not imaginings of medieval torture enthusiasts, but real features of dogs. There is a reason why champions are most likely bred by champions and why it is unlikely that Golden Retriever, for all its operant conditioning, will never be titled at a Schutzhund 3 level. The box is NOT empty; dogs are not black boxes that you produce from scratch. Genetics are base lines on which conditioning takes place, and, like in human athletics, in large part determine our future performance. To believe otherwise (like Ms Donaldson) is to invite catastrophe. For instance, working dogs need more guidance and, at times correction. If you do not give it to them, then life as you know it will change radically.Despite all this I found Donaldson's comments on socialization noteworthy (most especially for those dogs who will not be involved in any Schutzenhund training)."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Read this book in one long session. Opened my eyes to dogs and thier behaviour. Someone should pass a law &quot;no one can bring a dog home without first buying this book&quot;Must go back and read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book changed the way I live with and interact with my own dogs and the dogs I work with. You can motivate dogs to do what you want by controlling the things that they want. I always say that my Pit Bull cross is a Culture Clash poster child because he grew up with all of Jean's methods, has exquisite contol and is the most explosive, compulsive and obsessive dog I know. In the old days, this dog would have been trained with a pinch collar, most likely illiciting aggression. Yet he has never worn a restrictive or hurtful collar or had a physical punishment. Thanks Jean for making the lives of the dogs around me better!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to know where we've come in the field of dog training. Jean Donaldson, who is currently the Director of Behavior and Training at the San Francisco SPCA, tells it like it is. Dog training for so many years has been held hostage by people who wanted to hurt dogs and call it dog training. Jean will bust those myths and more. This book can really open the eyes of anyone &quot;crossing over&quot; from traditional methods. Her ascerbic, take-no-prisoners approach is directed not at the individual owner, but toward the cruelties inflicted on dogs in the name of dog training for many years. Methods that include hitting, hanging, drowning, and using a &quot;jumping bat&quot; (riding crop, but &quot;sturdier&quot;) are still being promoted out there, and Jean's rage is wholly appropriate.As a professional dog trainer running a very large training program based at a shelter, I recommend it to anyone wishing to get an excellent perspective on what it's like to be a dog in our culture."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This is THE BEST book on canine behavior I have ever read. It totally blew my mind. Previously I had only known of the \\"jerk\\" method of dog training. I never imagined that dogs could be trained using positive methods. The fact that the idea of operant conditioning etc were first proposed by BF Skinner in the 50's makes me wonder why it took so long to make it to the main stream.I have used many of the methods I learned in this book with my two adopted dogs, one of which is aggressive, and have had outstanding results.IMO this and Karen Pryor's \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" are the best books you can ever read about dog psycology and training."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Has some good concepts and some I don't agree with. and it could use some updating. \\"Take what you want and leave the rest\\""},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book is considered a \\"classic\\" for positive reinforcement based dog trainers. It's good if you really want to dig into the details of how/why certain methods work. If you really just want a well-behaved dog and don't care so much about the how and why, then this might not interest you. If you're a dog trainer or dog enthusiast and want to learn all you can about dogs, it's a must-read. If you just want to learn how to get results with your dog training or behavior issues, you might not enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Donaldson clearly knows alot about dog behavior and provides some useful knowledge about the dog's evolutinary history and behavior issues. Unfortunately, her writing style is overly tedious and at times excessively academic. Who cares, other than psychologists, about the subtle differences between operant and classical conditioning and the overly complicated version of \\"aversives\\" that she brings to the discussion? Much could be said with far simpler words and better sentence construction. I felt like I was reading a textbook,,,,not what I wanted. Why say \\"olfactory\\" when \\"smell\\" would do quite nicely. She also displays, on occasion, a rather silly arrogance when she refers to some people (who might have differing views than she does)as \\"poor\\" or \\"stupid.\\" I was extremely disappointed. Her writing got in the way of providing solutions to my dog's issues."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book is very well-written. It gives LOTS of insight into the dog world. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is a little too detailed. People who are just wanting some basic information for why Spot won't come when he's called should not get this book. I found it very insightful as I begin to train my pugs in obedience."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Donaldson can pretend all she wants, but it is clear that she does not have much in the way of dog handling experience, she is all Ivory Tower, a lot of her advice is simply nonsense, unfortunately, much is dangerous. She should stay out of the aggression field until she has logged in 5 years or more actually out training and handling dogs, not sitting around naval gazing and pretending they are humans wearing fur coats. Let me tell you why I feel this strongly: at our facility, we we accept severe behavior problems, primarily aggression. And, when we get pets in who are about to be put to sleep, we usually find out that the owner is a Donaldson follower and has religiously applied all of her principles, resulting in a more aggressive and dangerous dog than what they started with. Over and over again.Please, folks if you are having behavior problems, get advice from an actual trainer who does hands on work with all types of dog every day of the week, not some (probably) well intentioned daydreamer who refuses to accept that dogs are dogs and will behave as dogs."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"A must read for anyone who owns or trains dogs!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"So Dogs are dogs. hmmmm how enlightening! She accepts all the natural attributes and psychology of dogs, and as well she should, but she doesn't accept \\"Pack\\" mentality.She accepts that dogs are social beings and predators, but she doesn't accept hierarchical structure. She restates many obvious canine patterns, but her solutions for curing or redirecting problem behaviour is off-target and often time way too simplistic. She has no real life applications for the problem dog you have now - she just recommends what to do with a new puppy you get. She is correct that we \\"humanize\\" our pooches, but her cure is always of a kindly humanistic way. That will not work in this day and age of subdivision yard dogs and home protection dogs and busy families. Jean Donaldson's remedies are not practical or \\"real\\" for a dog psyche raised in these venues. Aversion does work on many \\"untrainable\\" dogs and many \\"unplaceable\\" dogs. I have seen positive-only trainers bail on dogs when training and behaviours did not go their way, so they judged the dogs \\"insane\\" or \\"unbalanced\\" and dismissed them! I have seen those same dogs after small doses of aversion training get better and learn their place in the home. They never will run free in the park with other dogs, but they can have a good life. Not every dog needs aversion training, but positive-only training will not work on every dog. Donaldson's stance on what good training is very closed minded and belittling. Her nonacceptence that other methods can work is very disconcerting!This book has many correct observations about dog culture and many bad theories for easing the clash of our culture and the dogs' culture. You will shake your head yes while reading this book (recognizing stated canine patterns in your dog) and then you'll be sucked in thinking that the remedies are the only correct ones. This is very sinister way of misleading you. Add just enough truth to validate the errors.I wonder if she has come across a truly \\"unbalanced\\" dog.There are better books out there! And Mr. Dunbar has failed his followers by recommending and publishing this book."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"After reading just 10 pages, I decided that it would be waste of my time to read more. First, she states that dogs are incapable of observational learning. Well, I just wrote an article that talks about observational learning in dogs by citing scientific peer review journals. So, J. Donaldson didn't get that right. Perhaps the research about observational learning in dogs came after she wrote Culture Clash. Second, she states that dogs are incapable of abstract thinking, etc. Now, how does she know that? I doubt that there is any research to date that is able to tap into a dog's cognition. Studying human cognition is complicated enough. But dogs? Anyway, for someone who is into science, this book is a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Although this book was recommended to me by a professional I must say that I was terribly disappointed. Out of the entire book the only part I actually did agree with was that in general a lot of us treat dogs as humans when they really should be treated like the animals that they are.With that in mind, Donaldson believes dogs to be quite stupid and not capable of working for anything other than food. I have had and trained dogs for years and have never had to result to such pandering. Dog's are extremely intelligent and can be taught anything without giving a treat every few seconds. (She even suggests using cut up hot dogs to 'motivate' your dog. Those hot dogs with all the perservatives and additives are going to do more damage to the dog than whatever the behavior is worth.)She focuses an inordinate amount of time to teaching a dog to fetch saying that this one move will solve most other problems. I can't disagree more. The things that works best for dogs is exercise and strong leadership. Besides, some breeds are generally not interested in playing fetch but rather doing the activites for which is bred in the first place.Also, Donaldson tries to refute Pack Theory, which takes into account the fact that dogs evolved from wolves and hence have a strict social hierarchy, by showing her own ignorance on the subject. In her view she only sees dominance as being cruel and punishing your dog into submission. When in reality it alleviates the need for punishing since your dog will do what you say because he knows that you are the boss.Throughout the book she contradicts herself constantly on her own points. This shows me that she does not have a great deal of self examination of her own information and that it isn't worth much.I believe that her book does very little to help people with dogs that have any issues whatsoever.I recommend Cesar Milan's book and his approach. I have used several of his techniques with no damage to my dog, as Donaldson would have you believe, and I got the results that I wanted.Do not buy Culture Clash as it is really only good for being recycled."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"The author uses too much theorey that can't readily be tested, such as her theorey on dog biting. She attempts to quantify what makes a dog bite, but says little about preventing the dog from biting.Her writing style comes across as this is the only way and anything else is stupid. A command that can not be taught using her reward method, is a command that is not worth learning in her opinion. A good example is when she talks about the dog chasing wild animals while walking in the woods. She wants the dog to wait until you say it is ok to run off, but nothing about if you want the dog to stay with you. I would prefer a method where the dog comes to you when it is unsure, such as Koehler.It only takes reading one page to see the flaw in the book, the page where she describes Master techniques. According to her it is a master technique to have the dog heal for a whole minute. That shouldn't really be that big an accomplishment, let alone the highest accomplishment."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book has been a great eye opener into the minds of our dogs. If you are truly interesting in understanding why your dog does some of the things it does and are eagar to learn this is a great book to start."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I must say that this book is a real must-have for everyone who owns a dog. I only wish that I heard about this book earlier, because it gives a really good insight into dogs and the way dogs think, learn and behave. This book is rich in both good information and humor and helps you appreciate dogs as they really are, not as we would (some of us) like them to be.It also has a chapter about basic, intermediate and advanced training of the most important commands: sit, stay, come when called etc."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"This book will fool you. It is unassuming...Just another in the parade of books on dog behavior...NOT AT ALL! I have been training dogs since 1979, put a boatload of titles on dogs (Siberian Huskies mind you, not the easiest of breeds for obedience training), even taught obedience classes. I thought I had it made with a new Border Collie. Smart? Yes. Easy to train? Not exactly. He's got some complex behavior pattern going on, part prey-drive, possibly part aggression, and part obsessive compulsive behavior. I can't &quot;shape&quot; some of his behaviors, but he certainly &quot;shaped&quot; some of mine (such as lightening fast reflexes that I now have). THIS BOOK may have opened the door to understanding a very complex animal. It was like a breath of fresh air for someone who had &quot;tried everything.&quot; I have tried so many techniques on this particular dog... clicked myself silly, jerked on the chain collar, the force collar, and (my heavens) even (when nothing else worked) used an electric collar. FORCE is not the ANSWER! THIS BOOK helps provide answers! It is an absolute MUST for anyone involved in dogs. NO KIDDING -- it will be a boost to the novice dog trainer, and the &quot;expert&quot; alike."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Jean Donaldson has a winner with the Culture Clash. The book is packed from cover to cover with useful information, with scarcely a page lacking some nugget of training wisdom. I have to admit that when I first found this book, I read it straight through twice (once while taking notes!) and then returned it late to the library because I was constantly referring back to it. It really is that good.The main theme of 'The Culture Clash' is a plea for us to honestly understand the motives of our canine companions, instead of seeing them through the distorting lens of anthromorphism. Ms Donaldson is a behaviourist, and includes a lot of information on operant conditioning and learning theory in this text. However, the book also teaches us how to apply this theory - included are a wealth of practical suggestions on how to live with and train your dog. The theory and practical in 'The Culture Clash' are equally good, and I do not exaggerate when I say that many individual chapters would alone be worth the purchase price of the book. Ms Donaldson leaves us understanding not only how to train our dogs, but also exactly why we are doing what she says.So why not five stars? The content of this book is inspired, but unfortunately Ms Donaldson shoots herself in the foot with her sanctimonious tone. Ms Donaldson champions the effectiveness of positive reinforcement when changing behaviour, so it is strange that she feels the need to resort to punishing her audience so much. Dog trainers who use punishment are variously labelled \\"pathetic\\", \\"cruel\\" and accused of finding personal gratification by punishing dogs. Choke chains are not called by their proper name, but are melodramatically renamed \\"strangle collars\\". Trainers who believe in pack theory are \\"too stupid for words\\". The vast majority of owners will find this approach alienating. If punishment really is that ineffective and morally bankrupt, then why must she continually resort to it throughout the book to blugeon her hapless readers?Ms Donaldson could also use a little education on the subject of canine drives. Unpleasant as it may be for a behaviourist to admit, it is easy to see that domestic dogs have intense inborn genetic drives, and good training exploits these desires in a much more sophisticated way than outlined by Ms Donaldson. Unfortunately, this truth doesn't fit Ms Donaldon's behaviourist paradigm at all. Instead of rewarding in drive, she treats all rewards as equivalent, which in turn results in her promoting a couple of quite unlikely techniques.It is also concerning that Ms Donaldson seems a little confused about her own stance on the use of punishment. She has a helpful and well-thought out chapter on the proper and appropriate uses of punishment when training dogs. And her methods include a great deal of punishment - she regularly prescribes negative punishment and \\"no reward markers\\" to her dogs. On the other hand, positive punishment is given the thumbs down, and negative reinforcement is a definate no-no. Ms Donaldson fails to explain why negative punishment is so much less damaging to a dog than positive punishment - I imagine many dogs would rather be verbally reprimanded than denied dinner or isolated from their human family for any period of time. One gets the feeling that negative punishment is sometimes promoted as 'better' than positive punishment not because of its effect on the dogs concerned, but merely because Ms Donaldson feels more comfortable using it.If I could have given this book four and a half stars, I would have. I honestly believe that any dog owner or trainer could benefit from a read of this book; it is one of the very best dog training manuals published so far. In fact, in a perfect world, all new dog owners would recieve a complimentary copy of 'The Culture Clash' when they collected their new puppy! Here's hoping one day this book will be re-edited and re-published, so that it retains the gems of information while losing the occasional blunders and distractingly spiteful tone."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"\\"The Culture Clash\\" is a how-to dog training book that's filled with loads of useful information. I gave it five stars because reading this book and using the knowledge imparted has proven invaluable in the training of my own dog.But \\"The Culture Clash\\" does have its problems. First and foremost, the author's obvious disdain for dog owners (and dog trainers who don't adhere to Donaldson's brand of doggie-psychology) is all too apparant. A good editor would have taken care of this when the book was in draft form. Donaldson's nastiness is especially virulent in the first chapter; it's a miracle anyone would read on. I myself put the book down after the first few pages, but a dog-trainer friend encouraged me to continue - promising that if I could see past the author's vitriol, it'd be well worth the effort. (She was right!)The second problem has to do with the author's overly technical language. Donaldson throws around complicated behavioral words and phrases as if everyone's as familiar with the terminology as she is. I happen to be a clinical psychologist, so I'm familiar with the terms she so casually tosses around. But I'm guessing not every reader will have taken college level courses on learning theory, so reader beware. She begins explaining the basic terminology in the 5th chapter instead of the 1st, so starting there might be helpful.Which brings me to the third problem. The arrangement of the chapters, as well as what she includes within each chapter, is so disorganized that the book reads like a first draft. And the table of contents is so general it's useless. My book is dog-eared and filled with stickies so I can refer to various topics without having to pull my hair out.That said, \\"The Culture Clash\\" is one very helpful book on dog training!"},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"I have to agree with the other negative reviews of this book that criticize the tone and disorganization. Donaldson's hypocritical diatribes against any sort of training that does not agree with her's is distracting and unprofessional. Additionally her militant \\"positive-only\\" philosophy is just as much based on outdated theories as dominance theory is.I'm always wary of experts who spend more time criticizing than providing info to back up their claims.That having been said, there is a lot of good information in this book...especially for someone who is about to get a new dog. I especially appreciated the information she provided about dog bites and animal behavior. Too often people adopt cute puppies, and expect them to miraculously be social, friendly furry little humans. When they become unruly adolescents, they are surrendered or euthanized."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"In preparation of getting a puppy I've read 4 books that have come highly recommended: Carol Benjamin's Mother Knows Best, Monks of New Skeet's Art of Raising a Puppy, Karen Pryor's Don't Shoot the Dog, and Jean Donaldson's Culture Clash. I read them in the order listed and when I finished I threw out Benjamin and the Monks. I can't believe the violence and intimidation we inflict on our pets in the name of 'training'. Pryor and Donaldson explain both the priciples and the methods to safely, humanely train your dog. I highly suggest getting them both.

This book has become my main reference book, the place where I look first when I am observing a behavior in my dog and not certain of what I am watching.I have used this book to help shape and fashion two fine service dogs, both 9 pound Papillons who now do the laundry, make the beds, retrieve all objects I drop, open and shut doors, and tug clothing off my body.I have used this book to rehabilitate rescue dogs, using Jean's systematic desensitization tips to shape new behaviors in the face of fear.Unfortunately, I have given away over a dozen copies of this book and never seem to have one on hand for myself.

I don't go to shows, I refuse to cook for dogs, and it disturbs me when people refer to dogs as their children. I live, however, with a partner who loves dogs and does all 3 things... We have two large, intelligent dogs from two different notoriously \\"willful\\" breeds. My partner's dog training coach loaned us a copy and I read it.The book did a tremendous job of showing me how I was creating much of my own stress through my interactions with the dogs. The author's largest point is to not anthropomorphize dogs and assign motives to their behavior consistent with primate, rather than canine, drives and intelligence. It helped me tremedously understanding what was reasonable to expect and its helping us both in getting our dogs more consistently obedient.It's a great book and since finishing it, I've realized that virtually everyone out there in the dog world (including me) romanticizes the behavior of dogs to the point that I'm amazed any dogs are successful as pets. If you decide to read this book, please give it a fair shot and read past the first time the author disagrees with one of your deeply held beliefs about dogs. I promise you that even if you disagree with the book, you will take away things worth considering."},{"Title":"The Culture Clash: A Revolutionary New Way to Understanding the Relationship Between Humans and Domestic Dogs","review":"Ms. Donaldson has many good ideas, but unfortunately in some areas her views are narrow-minded. She accepts food training as the &quot;only valid approach&quot;.

Too often good advice is obscured seemimgly by a desire to blow her own horn. It is unfortunate, because I belive she has alot of insight. Nobody has all the answers, and I believe that in her heart Ms. Donalson knows that, but it does not come through clearly on most pages.

He will explain all the things the dogs ears say by their various postions, he will explain the meaning of head position, tail movement, lip curl, etc. Mr Coren is respectful to both animals and to readers.His book is especially valuable when you see your dog interact with other dogs.

He is killer, protector, enforcer for Stan, the head of the Orlando crime syndicate. When Miami crime boss, Beggar Johnson, decides that Stan has grown too old to milk Orlando crime for all its worth, a territorial battle begins. When Stan disappears and the rest of the gun monkeys are killed off or turned to the dark[er] side, Swift has to go it alone to fend off Beggar's goons, renegade FBI agents and others. The body count mounts chapter by chapter, and as ruthless a killer as Swift is, the reader begins to root for him due to his loyalty to his boss, family and new girl friend, as well as his sheer skill as a &quot;detective&quot; and vengeful killer.This is indeed a noir novel of the first ilk. It's a fast, exciting, easy read and holds the reader's interest until the inevitable showdown between Swift and Mercury (his counterpart as Beggar Johnson's head gun monkey).If you are squeamish about descriptions of bloody violence or about raw language, stay away from this one. Otherwise, it's a really entertaining romp of a pulp novel."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"This guy Vic Gischler knows how to write prose that makes you keep reading, even when his main character's a professional killer. Let's say instead, especially when he's a professional killer. Charlie Swift is loyal to his boss, Stan, his mother, and his younger brother Danny and, as well, to his taxidermist girlfriend Marcie who also happens to be the widow of a guy Charlie had to put on ice.Seems like Charlie's boss goes missing. Seems like other guys in Charlie's crew are getting wasted, as in permanently. Seems like another guy, Beggar Johnson, wants to take over Stan's turf. Charlie manages to miss getting wiped out himself and goes after the guys who killed his compadre Bob. He's got friends--Lou the New Guy and Jimmy the Fix principally. And he's got his wits. Which are pretty sharp judging by the story here.OK, here's some sacrilege. Gischler claims to have read a lot of John McDonald and been heavily influenced by him, but for my money, he writes better than McDonald who in my opinion a lot of the time is hard to get through--clunky prose that's dated now. But VG's writing is smooth as silk and tough as shoe leather with powder burns.Nice job."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Gischler hasn't written detective fiction here, but criminal fiction. This is the kind of book neo-noir fans like, with its muscular prose, language of the day, and unadulterated violence. Charlie Swift is so tough he's not ashamed to take care of his mother or be loyal to his boss. So he lives out of a suitcase and works out of a tin box trailer called the Monkey Cage, Charlie's got a bulging safe deposit box and he owes it all to one man: Stan the Man.The opening sentence: &quot;I turned the Chrysler onto the Florida Turnpike with Rollo Kramer's headless body in the trunk, and all the time I'm thinking I should've put some plastic down.&quot;Charlie Swift, gun monkey, speaking."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"The first sentence of &quot;Gun Monkeys&quot; is a perfect distillation of everything I'm always looking for in a crime novel: grisly, curt and most of all laugh-out-loud funny, without ever lapsing into cuteness. I've been recommending it to everyone I know who cares about this kind of book."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"You just can't get good help these days, even when the job is something simple like whacking a midlevel hood named Rollo Kramer. Given his druthers, chief gun monkey Charlie Swift would never have picked the inept Blade Sanchez to accompany him on the job. But Charlie's boss Stan told Charlie to take Blade along as a favor to Miami crimeboss Beggar Johnson, and sinceCharlie owes Stan for &quot;every nickel hidden in [Charlie's] safe deposit box&quot;, Charlie doesn't see that he has much of a choice.So begins &quot;Gun Monkeys&quot;, Victor Gischler's instant noir classic from Uglytown Press. Charlie's day starts off bad and gets steadily worse as someone decides to make a move on the aging Stan's territory, a business decision that involves whacking most of Charlie's crew. The only bright spotin the day is Charlie's budding relationship with Rollo's widow Marcie. The widow Kramer is a tough, foxy redhead with an eye for Charlie and a talent for taxidermy. The latter trait has the fortunate effect of making her less squeamish around dead bodies, which is a good thing, considering.Charlie's attempts to find out what happened to Stan, even the score, and incidentally take care of his Mom and his kid brother, make for a great read. If you're a fan of the dark humor of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; or the tough talk of Richard Stark's &quot;Parker&quot; books, you'll love &quot;Gun Monkeys.&quot;"},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"One of the most impressive debuts I've ever read, Gun Monkeys is a return to the two-fisted days of Mickey Spillaine and Richard Stark, with an important twist-it's funny as hell.The tone of the book is summed up in the very first line: &quot;I turned the Chrysler onto the Florida Turnpike with Rollo Kramer's headless body in the trunk, and all the time I'm thinking I should've put some plastic down.&quot;If you believe, like I do, that this line is the perfect way to start a book, then buy Gun Monkeys right now. It's noir on nitrous oxide, and will keep you guessing, and laughing, from page one to the slam-bang finale."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"It seems like every year one of the Edgar committees rescues from obscurity a previously unknown undiscovered work. Many times these works are true gems in the rough uncut state. The nominations tend to bring some prominence to authors most of whom would probably never have been heard from again. For example KJA Wishnia and Margaret Moseley. GUN MONKEYS is that kind of book and Victor Gischler is that kind of author.Charlie Swift is a thug. He is a hit man for an Orlando gangster named Stan. When the leader of a rival gang wants to move into the territory, he calls for a hit on all of Stan's gang. The result is virtually all of Charlie's friends are killed in the attack. Stan, however, is missing and being the loyal soldier, Charlie devotes his energy into finding Stan and discovering what is going on. The path to the truth will be strewn with the blood of dead bodies.Victor Gischler is a refreshingly new voice in noir crime fiction. Characters are tough, dialogue is gritty and the violence routine. Most important, he is a helluva good storyteller and his first effort never fails to entertain. The book is not perfect, however. There are several times the story proceeds in an endless fashion and it is quite evident the author didn't know where his characters were taking him. I would think that an editor from a large publisher would have identified and corrected that problem. Nonetheless, Victor Gischler has written an impressive book and one well worthy of Edgar recognition."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Charlie Swift is a hit man for the mob, an unrepentant career criminal who views his grisly vocation with detached practicality. As a former Army Ranger, killing is simply what he was trained to do. And killing is what he does, stacking up the corpes across central Florida's seamiest strip malls and strip joints as he tries to extract himself from a rival gang's setup, dodging some less-than-scrupulous G-men while trying to find his gangster boss gone missing.Author Victor Gischler is the real deal; a hip and refreshing 21st Century twist on pulp fiction from the glory days of Hammett, Thompson, Chandler, and Block. While you'll see glimpses of Carl Hiaasen, Dennis Lehane, or Charlie Huston in his writing, Gischler's style is all his own. His cynical brand of black humor rolls unforced across the pages - an easy banter from a world where Kansas is \\"elevator music with grass\\" and people can be as dumb as a \\"bag of door knobs.\\" His abominable menagerie of players - a hierarchy of thugs and mobsters, killers and con men - put in another day at the office with guns blazing and knives slicing - but Gischler offers neither apology nor passes moral judgment. He writes not to preach, simply to entertain. And if you prefer your entertainment hard-boiled, irreverent, brutal, and witty, \\"Gun Monkeys\\" sets a new standard for crime fiction. Kick back with this decidedly unPuzo-like saga of life within organized crime, and I can almost guarantee you'll be back for more Gischler in \\"Suicide Squeeze\\" and \\"The Pistol Poets.\\""},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"It's almost impossible to review this book without explaining the whole book itself. This book reads like something by Charlie Huston or Jeff Walters. It's detective noir with a funny bone. Our hero(?) kills more people quicker than the Terminator and with a weird attitude to boot.All the Hookman wants to do is sit in the monkey cage in the back of the bar and play Monopoly for real money. When he's needed, he will get a call from his boss Stan and go off to break some legs or shoot someone in the head. Except for cleaning his guns he really doesn't have a hobbie, but he loves his mom and his little brother Danny.When the mob from Miami decides to take over Orlando, they begin by wiping out most of the gun monkeys. It does turn out that one of them is a turncoat (who of course our boy shoots three or four times before killing him). In between running from the hoods from Miami, he also spends time shooting his way out of bar full of crooked Federal agents.Since he has so much spare time on his hands, he takes time to fall in love with the wife of a hood his murders (but it was by accident).All in all it's good clean fun or bad dirty mayhem...or good clean mayhem...whatever. Great read."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"If you're an action/adventure fan and don't mind a body count reminiscent of a Shakespearean tragedy, and you enjoy a lot of creative and cathartic violence in your reads, then this a great book, a whole lot of fun, and I highly recommend it.Charlie Swift is an ex-army hitman in the employ of an aging mobster in Orlando, basically content with his station in life, and just getting along like most of the rest of us. That all goes to hell when when the Miami mob wants to take over Orlando and the FBI follows hot on their heels. Violence explodes and Charlie is left directionless, friendless, and in need of some stability, so he sets out, against seemingly suicidal odds, to reorganize the entire situation operating under a quixotic belief in loyalty to his friends and employer.For a debut novel this was very enjoyable, the pacing excellent, and the plot and characterizations pretty good. It's not that easy to turn a hit-man into a sympathetic character but Gischler manages it well. The writing is deceptively simple, fun to read, moves quickly, and there is a satisfying close. A good all around first effort and lots of bangs, booms, shots, and all sorts of fun guy stuff. If any of this sounds interesting then give this one a whirl and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"A killer for a local mob boss, who is also the goon's surrogate daddy, kills his way through a long tedious book.

Bloody meaningless shootouts (not fully explained), continue as the Miami mob trys to take over \\"dad's\\" Orlando territory. Our hero starts looking for \\"dad\\", who has gone missing, with lethal results for scores of unknown and meaningless characters. Its a one dimentional tale that never caught my interest. Unless you enjoy keeping track on your abacus of an ever rising body count with no interesting tale attached, give this one a bye for your own good. Life is too short to waste your time on books like this."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"I agree with the reviewer below. This is an OK thriller, but the illogical actions of the &quot;hero&quot; ruin any realism. He spends much of the book on the run yet continues to return to a location he deemed unsafe (his mom's house) - this makes no sense. And too often, incidents are initiated for dramatic effect, yet never followed up on or referenced again in any true manner (the run in with the FBI agents in the car and the resulting aftermath is one example). Overall, a quick read but with no depth and requires a complete suspension of belief and logic. Perhaps with his second book, the author will plot a novel that entraps the reader, instead of constantly losing us through careless plotting."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Some special read. Gischler entertains the hell out of the reader, has you curling your toes on one page, laughing out of your chair the next. What great characters, too. A stone killer with heart as the hero. Dealing with a bunch of thugs, trying to stay alive. And the storyline, delving deep into Florida's underworld. Gischler knows too much. I wouldn't be surprised the FBI investigates him for some kind of pro hit man."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"I was laying in bed this morning browsing the Amazon store on my Kindle before my family woke up. I wanted something with a story line that kept moving. I searched for something by Tom Clancy, but he must not have read the memo from Amazon about Kindle ebooks. His loss!So I browsed down the list of Fiction > Action & Adventure. A few pages down the list I saw a book called \\"Go-Go Girls of the Apocalypse\\". OK, you've got my attention--sounds pretty cheezy, but that's not always a bad thing. The reviews looked pretty good, so I checked to see what else he wrote (I like to follow an author's career from earlier on).So I downloaded the Kindle Sample of Gishler's \\"Gun Monkeys\\". It's just a sample, so there's no risk to me.HOLY TOLEDO, what a ride. I couldn't click \\"Buy Me\\" fast enough when I got to the end of the sample. I've been reading this book in every spare minute of my day. I feel kinda guilty that he must have spent so much time writing this book and I devoured it in a day.What did I like about it? First of all, I love authors who start off with their first book with such a well crafted mix of characters, plot, and totally cheap pulp. Love it love it love it. It's the best \\"first\\" I've read since Laurel K. Hamilton's \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" (book 1 in her Vampire Hunter series). More important though is that I sympathized with his protagonist more and more with every page. Not necessarily a lovable guy, since he's such a crook, but you can't help but wish him the best. Kind of like the way you root for Tony Soprano. He's a thug, but you can't help but warm up to him.I'll be purchasing Gishler's next couple of books before I turn in for the night. If I can trust the reviews, his books get better with each one. Bring it on."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Charlie Swift is a gun monkey, hired muscle for an old mobster named Stan who runs Orlando. Charlie knows he's a bad guy and just accepts it as his lot in life because of his skills with his fists and a gun. He lives by a strict code of honor: when you throw your lot in with a guy, you stick; otherwise you're just an animal. That's why when things suddenly go bad, Stan disappears, and Charlie's friends are murdered, Charlie, a guy who'd trained himself to unquestioningly take orders, suddenly doggedly starts searching for some answers. Charlie isn't used to thinking for himself, but he's a trained professional who's good at his job, and since he's up against a cadre of thugs and goons, brutality is the way to get to the bottom of things anyhow.He meets Marcie on the job, the ex-wife of a man he was paid to kill. Marcie isn't sad to see the last of her ex, and she and Charlie hit it off, even if he is creeped out by her career in taxidermy. She helps him decipher a pair of ledgers he wound up with that everyone else in Orlando seems to want, since they're the complete accounting records of mob boss Beggar Johnson who has come up from Miami to take over Orlando. He's also assisted by big thug Lou, otherwise known around the monkey cage as New Guy, after Lou narrowly escapes the bloodbath that took out all their other friends. They work together to figure out what happened to Stan, all while everyone else from the cops to the feds to rival gangsters is trying to get their hands on the ledgers.I can't remember the last time I read a book wherein the protagonist offs quite so many people, including Serge A. Storms. For Charlie, however, hurting and killing people is a job and he's rather dispassionate about it, though not unaffected. He's also fiercely protective of his mother, his younger brother Danny, and anyone he considers an ally. Though Charlie is not a guy I would want to meet in an alley, he's a very likeable sort on the page. He does bad things, but those things are all done in his world, purposely held apart from the rest of polite society.A lot of bodies piled up in this book, but it was not luridly graphic, and the violence was more of a backdrop to what was happening in the story, while still being an integral part of it. This is a very fine example of modern noir, twenty-first century pulp fiction that, unfortunately for me, costs a lot more than a dime. I'm glad I bought the entire Gischler collection, and will savor each and every one. For a nice, gritty break from the mainstream, Gischler delivers a winner."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"It's hard not to. A professional killer works his way onto our good side, while being not so good himself. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"A very nice blend of Richard Stark, Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen ... hopefully we'll be hearing more from Mr. Gischler."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"...and then stalling when the light turns green.I read Gischler's PISTOL POETS and loved it. The witty dialogue, twist-filled plot, hilarious characters, and tight tension hooked me from the beginning and wouldn't let go. I laughed and held my breath in equal measure, and couldn't wait to devour more of Gischler's work. So it was with high expectations that I dove into GUN MONKEYS, hoping for much more of the same.The result was like my morning commute: Frustrating, long, and full of stop-and-go traffic.I caught some glimpses of Gischler's burgeoning talent in MONKEYS, notably the few instances of comic relief and the occasionally well-written visual. But really, those are the only comparisons I can draw between MONKEYS and POETS. Where POETS had humor by the bucket full, plot twists like a wound rubber band, and fresh, captivating characters, MONKEYS had a long story spent watching the hero traveling hither and thither to little effect other than inducing boredom in the reader. The prose in MONKEYS was stiff and oftentimes clunky, like it could use another go-around with the editor's pen. The mystery itself is somewhat intriguing, and it kept me interested in learning who was behind the book's shenanigans and why.But my interest had grown exhausted after the first 100 pages. If I hadn't liked POETS as much as I did, I'm not sure I would've finished GUN MONKEYS; it feels like a limp warm-up to POETS by comparison. So if you'd like to see exactly what Gischler is capable of, skip GUN MONKEYS and go straight to the good stuff in PISTOL POETS."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Great book that I have been looking forward to after reading some of Gischler's newer stuff...very well written and entertaining."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"I generally prefer my mysteries and detective stories on the cerebral side, rather than hardboiled Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich noir-style, but I'll make an exception for this one, which was recommended to me by a friend. Charlie Swift is a simple person -- not stupid but he doesn't require a lot from life. He's good with his fists and his guns, and that's really all he needs. He has risen to become the senior member of a group of enforcers and goons working for Stan, the crime boss of Orlando, and he prefers to just go along, doing what he's told, and thinking for himself as little as possible. But now Stan is getting old, and his mind is becoming iffy, and the Miami mob wants to take over his turf. Charlie is nothing if not loyal and he's going to fight back as long and as hard as possible. But the FBI is also taking a hand in things. And there's a set of incriminating ledgers floating around that everyone wants. And Charlie really ought to remember to put plastic down in the trunk of his car the next time he dumps a headless body in there. He also has a kid brother who wants in on things (not if Charlie has anything to say about it), and there's this female taxidermist whom he's becoming interested in -- after whacking her good-for-nothing husband.It's hard to describe a story about a collection of violent career criminals and stone killers as a \\"romp,\\" but that's sort of what this is. Charlie has a narrow but unique view of the world and becomes surprisingly sympathetic character. There's plenty of tension interspersed with dry wit, and the characters and dialogue are equally well done. I'll have to see what else Gischler has written."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"This mug, Victor Gischler, seems to be a like an Oklahoma version of Raymond Chandler with a little Cormac McCarthy and Tim Dorsey thrown into the mix. Read his books, all of them. Now."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"I'll say it-- Victor Gischler is just a great writer. This book is fantastic (as are all of his books). I have read several others by him, but this was his first. This book is a cross between Dashiell Hammett and Elmore Leonard-- totally Gischler.The narrative is dry, dry, dry and freakin' hilarious. Charlie Swift is not a good man. He doesn't do nice things, but he does do a lot of them....It took me until about 75 pages into the book to definitively decide which era I was dealing with. To me Florida always smacks of the 1950s, so I thought Charlie's narrative fit right in. However, his girlfriend is just too assertive and independent to work for that time period. The tale actually takes place in the early 21st century. But that all starts to make sense as you find out just what an anachronism Charlie is. He might be a bad guy but he has a heart of gold (yeah, weird, right?).Try as I might I just couldn't hate him. I found myself rooting him on even in situations when I knew he was doing the wrong thing. This is how good Gischler is at developing character.The best part of any Gischler novel is the dialogue. If you like Elmore Leonard you will like this book."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"A dark--very dark--and violent comedy told from the viewpoint of a mob gunmen. Charlie Swift's boss is slowly getting pushed out of business in Florida. Charlie tries to figure out why, and the role a set of accounting books has to play in it all. The cast of characters includes fellow thugs and gunmen, a senile boss, a girlfriend who is a taxidermist/avant-garde artist, crooked and honest FBI agents. The violence is all very unrealistic and over the top. But it makes for great reading!Gischler is an engaging writer, and has excellent characterization throughout the novel. Even with first person narration, there is very little exposition. Character is revealed through dialogue and actions."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Love this author. This book was not as totally fabulastic as Go Go Girls of the Apocalypse, but it wasn't bad. I have never read this type of \\"pulp fiction\\"esqe book before, but it reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction. In a a good way, not in a totally-stole-the-plotline way. But the funny thing is that Charlie, the protagonist, is a really bad guy. He's a thug, a wiseguy, a murderer, and yet you can't help but root for him.I love Gischler's writing style and some of the things he writes make me guffaw out loud which makes people on the train look at me funny, but it's like I don't even care because I love that he can make me laugh. :-)I gave this only 4 stars because it was a little slow in parts. A book like this would normally take me a day two to read, but because I set this one down when it didn't totally hold me, it took me about a week.Definitely love his writing style though, and Pistol Poets will be the next Gischler book on my list."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Charlie Swift is a gun monkey; the head gun monkey in Stan's crew. He kills people for a living, and he's very good at his job. Life's pretty good; he's got a good crew, he enjoys his job, he's loyal to a fault, his mom cooks a mean meal, his little brother might go back to college, and he just met a nice taxidermist who seems to be as okay with dead people as she is dead animals.Unfortunately, Stan's getting old and maybe losing his edge a little. He's been muscled out of Orlando by his Miami equivalent, Beggar Johnson, and while he works out what to do, Stan agrees to send Charlie and his monkey cage crew on a hit at a lapdancing club.Charlie being Charlie, it isn't much of a problem - until four of the dead guys turn out to be cops, Charlie's monkeys disappear and start turning up dead, his brother wants in on the family business, Stan pulls a vanishing act, and Charlie's left with a couple of accounting ledgers that everybody wants - including Beggar Johnson and the FBI.Gun Monkeys is a classic, breezy, thriller and as a protagonist, Charlie follows the classic mold. He's the right mix of tough and cynical, with a dash of humor thrown in for good measure, and Gischler's easy handle on dialog and character makes this an entertaining and quick read. If there's any faults in the book, it's that it follows the set formula a little too closely - but it's so entertaining while it does that you barely notice, and having an unrepentant killer who just might be a nice guy as the narrator adds a nice twist to it.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Gun Monkeys is a great first novel. I picked it up, intrigued by the name, and I didn't put it down till I'd read it from cover to cover. I won't talk too much about what the other guys said, but I will say it is a slam bam crime novel. Filled with suspense and humor I drew looks from people nearby when I laughed out loud at some of the hilarious jokes and scenes. The writing itself is great too. Straight to the point with no nonsense. I eagerly await Gischler's next novel."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"If Victor can continue to churn out novels like GUN MONKEYS he will earn the title of &quot;The new Elmore Leonard&quot;."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"This book is a great read. It's told through the voice of Charlie Swift, a tough piece of gun toting mobster muscle. Charlie works throug the problems that confront him like Dick Tracy on the wrong side of the law. The violence combines with a dark sense of humor that gives this book a fun gritty feel. Charlie meets a gal pal named Marcie who does taxidermy with an artists touch. Whether your a noir fan or not, or even if you don't know what noir is, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"This book is hard to put down, it holds your attention from the first paragraph. Funny, easy to follow storyline, believable characters. The language is a little strong, but I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery/thriller. I can hardly wait for Mr. Gischler to produce a second book."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Interesting characters, a page-turner -- there's not much to add to what other people have said except it's a good read. Don't miss this one. Victor Gischler has written a fine book. I'm looking forward to his next one. You might want to visit the Ugly Town Press web site, too."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"I like fast paced, violent crime novels, but Gun Monkeys is one of the most forgettable books I have ever read. Victor Gischler throws his main Character, Charlie Swift, at you with zero background, zero personality, and zero likeability. Swift is about as deep as a puddle of water, dumb as a bag of hammers, and as likeable as an out of control Rotweiller.I didn't care what happened to Charlie, I didn't care about his boss...I really didn't care about anything in this book. The best way to put it is the whole thing feels forced, like it is written by someone who wished they could have been a gangster, but in reality learned everything they knew from watching the Sopranos. Every time I picked this book up, I had to go back a page or two to remember what was going on; It is that forgettable."},{"Title":"Gun Monkeys","review":"Gun Monkeys is an action packed book about a hit man by the name of Charlie Swift. Charlie is to get ledger books that can bring a mob boss down, but everyone on his side starts disappearing, even his boss. The rest of the book is his journey to find his friends and bring down the mob boss Beggar Johnson.I really enjoyed the novel because there is never a dull moment. Every time you turn the page something exciting is happening. For example people are always fighting with each other, or shooting at each other, or cussing each other out. It is like a suspenseful it keeps you on the edge of your seat or in this case wanting to read more.I also liked the language used, because if I would get tired of reading, a bad word would pop up and wake me up. The book had a lot of bad words, so I never really got tired of reading it. It reminded me of movies and real life. The language being so realistic is what kept me reading this excellent novel."},{"Title":"The house without a door","review":"Hanna Carpenter was a young woman living in New York City.

Its point of departure is that the state - or atleast nearly all states - is neither independent nor sovereign in thecommon meaning of these terms and should not pretend to be. AdamWatson does not suppose that the state is about to disappear or that aworld government is either imminent or desirable. His concern is theadaptation of the idea and status of the state to the realities andneeds of today and tomorrow. These needs emerge in his concludingchapters as the imperatives of peace, prosperity and standards ofcivilized behaviour: these being the goods which the state exists todeliver. Adam Watson's rare range of historical erudition andpersonal experience give his analysis and prescriptions a driveequalled by few.The state as we know it is a European product whichhas proved to be one of Europe's most acceptable exports. Europeanstates have always displayed considerable diversity and inequality butthey have for several centuries formed a recognizable category byvirtue of certain common features, chief among them territorialdefinition and legal sovereignty. In the present century the number ofstates in the world - and therewith this diversity and inequality -has been enormously increased by, first, nationalism and the principleof self-determination in Europe and, secondly, the decolonization ofAsia and Africa. There are now nearly 200 states in the world, some ofthem very small, many of them very poor and others (of all sizes) illgoverned and therefore dangerous to their citizens and theirneighbours. This last feature is not new. It has characterized theEuropean state from its first appearance. It is also the principalcause of dissatisfaction with the unfettered power of the state in itsexternal relations and of state governments in their domesticaffairs. The state has many virtues but it often does more harm thangood and even more often it is exceedingly and harmfullyincompetent.Powerful states have always interfered in the internalaffairs of lesser states, restrained more by practicalities than bypolitical theory or legal sanction. But whereas in earlier times itwas supposed that states ought not to interfere in this way, today itis thought that perhaps sometimes they should. A comparison of theCovenant of the League of Nations with the Charter of the UnitedNations illustrates this shift. Although article 2 (7) of the Charterspecifically upholds the older view, other articles are renderedvacuous if article 2 (7) is strictly interpreted. Nor has it been,albeit that attempts to square this circle have been ill-starred andclumsy (e.g. safe havens for Kurds in Iraq). In the last few years theIMF, having adopted the role of physician to national economies in amess, has made its aid conditional not only on certain economicremedies but also on the establishment of good government - by whichit means more democracy as understood in the West and evidenced bymulti-party elections (which may too easily be turned by fraud andforce to undemocratic ends). Earlier this year outside intervention inSouth East Asia's economic affairs was loudly opposed by nationalleaders as an illicit infringement of sovereignty but then acceptedbecause it was too glaringly obvious that the states in trouble hadproved themselves strikingly incompetent in regulating the economicgrowth which they had vaunted and enjoyed. In some Latin Americancountries the state in effect shares power with criminal organizationswhich displace the legitimate government in wide areas and evenprovide the inhabitants with the services which governments aresupposed to provide. And other examples of governments not in controlin their own houses are plentiful. The point is that outsideintervention, with its corollary of legitimate infringement of theabsolute independence of the state, has come to be seen as a goodthing in some circumstances. These circumstances are mistily definedand the practicalities of intervention are riddled with pitfalls. Thisbook seeks to point a way towards diminishing the confusion and thepitfalls.An international order consisting of states may be eitheranarchic in the sense of no-rule-of-law between states or subject to adegree of dominance or hegemony by one or more superiorstates. Anarchy, dangerously unpredictable, has become even more sowith the proliferation of states and their ever closer contacts withone another. The alternative is hegemony - the surrender of someauthority in order to avoid a Hobbesian nightmare. As Watsonemphasizes, hegemony is not a simple concept but a variable resultantof the forces along a continuum, from a Napoleonic or Hitlerianabsolute (dominion) to a more measured relationship like that betweena conglomerate corporation and its subsidiaries. These relations areset by law and political culture as well as sheer power. Allianceshave immemorially worked that way and in the modern world theinternational system rivetted together by economics and communicationstechnology is no different. Specifically, it depends today on how theUnited States of America regards and treats the United Nations. AdamWatson believes that the restraints on any hegemonical power havebecome much stronger in our time. That is the main point in thisbook. It is the view of a hardheaded, intelligent, professional man -not the view of a romantic optimist. It is comforting, coming fromsuch a source, but as I stand poised to endorse it I hesitate. Overthe last decade or two the United States has seemed to me moreinclined to make a virtue of going it alone with or without satellitesthan to moderate its judgement of ambitions in the light of thejudgements of others. The test of leadership lies not in thewillingness to give a lead but in deciding what to do when your leadis disapproved. What impresses me most about the United States is notits great power (others have had that) but its extraordinaryhistory. For most of its life it has existed in a vast area withoutanother state or consequence in sight. It is difficult to think of anyother state of which this is true. China, yes; but certainly not anystate in Europe where the horizon is cluttered with states not veryfar away. It may be too much to expect any Superpower to accept in itsheart or its policies any serious limits to its independence. Nonehas. The locus of great power has shifted away from Europe to NorthAmerica and may, some predict, shift again in a century or so toChina. Do these shifts augur a more civilized handling of great powerby the giants of the next age than by Napoleon, Hitler et hoc genusomne? This is a short book about a very big question, highlyintelligent, carefully distilled. It provides crumbs for comfort buthow big those crumbs are none can yet say."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"This translation of Aesop's fables (600 of them!) contains detailed references for people interested in finding out more about the Greek and Latin originals. And contrary to the comments of jennal24, the gender of the animals in this translation follows the gender of the animal names in Latin and Greek - since the fox (alopeks) is feminine in Greek, that's why monkey is a \\"she\\". there's nothing feminist about this: it's just grammar. too bad jenna124 has no idea what s/he is talking about. anyway, if you want to find out about the hundreds of Greek and Latin fables and need an English translation, this is a great place to begin. none of the other books of Aesop's fables in English contains as complete a selection of fables as this Oxford World's Classics version."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"Perhaps there are versions of Aesop that readers would enjoy more, and there are plenty of editions that come with engaging illustrations, but if a reader wants to get as close as possible to Aesop's Greek, this is the edition to buy. All of the prior great translators of Aesop have been British--Caxton, L'Estrange, Ogilby, Croxall, Clarke, James, Townsend, Jacobs, and Jones--and of these only Jacobs was a serious Aesop scholar. Laura Gibbs is a scholar as well as a translator; she bases her translations on the best editions; she includes more fables (to show historical variation, some fables appear twice); she provides a better introduction and much better notes than competing editions. Gibbs's volume also has the best index of any Aesop in English. This is an edition worthy of the Oxford imprint, and the first thorough translation of Aesop by an American since Lloyd Daly's AESOP WITHOUT MORALS (1961, now out of print). To experience the immensity and complexity of Aesop, try this."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"Excellent reference for for the novice story teller. This book is cheat sheet for the complete Aesop's fables and also gives you the take home message. I grew up hearing Aesop and wanted my kids to have the same experience. This is definitely not for reading to the kids verbatim. I highly recommend it for the storyteller parent."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"I have loved Aesop's Fables for many years. This edition (Kindle) is the best I've read. Not only did the editor/author cross-reference and arrange the fables in easy form, reading them on the Kindle makes the reference experience excellent.Some other reviews disagree with the analysis the book gives to many of the fables. The purpose of the Fables has for thousands of years been for the reader to decide what lessons to take from them. That has not changed. That this edition includes summaries and conclusions that were added and debated over millennia ADDS to its value. I don't think audiences have forgotten to think for themselves as other reviewers claim.Aesop's Fables have provided intellectual fodder for generations and still does not disappoint. It is a great way to introduce kids to critical thinking and debate.My only slight critique is it needs a detailed table of contents, but the Kindle's search capabilities makes up for it."},{"Title":"Aesops Fables","review":"Although, I haven't finish reading all of the fables, however, the ones that I have read are enobling for educators and any serious literature reader.
