I have been drawing longer than I can remeber but just recently decided I wanted to improve my art skills mainly my ability to draw the human body. So I started buying art books on human anatomy and this by far is my favorite one and heres why, its at a comfortable size so you can easily take it with you, it has close to 500 illustrations, and his style is helpful to me most when I'm drawing from memory. For its price I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"This book is filled with pictures. George B. Bridgeman did a great job with this book. The reason I gave only 4 starts is beacuse it was kinda hard to understand. I mean I spent 20 min. figuring out the introduction and still dont full understantd it. But farther into the book it was easier to understand but still difficult. I am only 13 and this book may have been written for college students or adults so that may have been one reason I dont unerstand so well but once you start picking it up you learn a lot of stuff about the human anatomy. THIS IS GREAT FOR COMIC BOOK ARTISTS, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ARTIST."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I'm a Bridgman fan, but his complete guide to drawing from life is available used for $7.50. and sells new for $12.21. This is less than an introduction to the genius that is Bridgman, get the big book."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"&quot;Constructive Anatomy&quot; is unique in that George presents the viewer a 'real world' application of the muscles, by telling you what each muscle does.I'd be wrong in saying this book is a one-stop source for learning to draw people. Let's face it anatomy is tough and artists can use all the help they can get! What this book offers that other's don't is different views and applications of perceiving the limbs, muscles, bones, joints, etc., of the body. For the price it's listed out, ya can't go wrong!"},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"If you are learning anatomy, this is a great resource.

It totally helps art students to become better at the anatomical study and to understand the differences of each part of the body. I have owned so much many others anatomy books and this is by far the best one. I will always go back to Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I love George Bridgman works, so I decided that I should get a book just so I can look at it all the time in physical time instead of elsewhere. I did not expect it to be so small, but I think it was because all the paper copies my instructors give me is a large piece of paper. None the less, I think this book is a helpful anatomy book, since it explains what the artist needs to know and is good for the basic review of muscles. Bridgman does a good job of breaking things down and making it easy to see the underlying structure. What I like about Bridgman is the use of exaggerated muscle, it helps to see better and it is not complicated."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"Highly essential to any serious and commercial artist.I am a working comic artist who uses this all of the time as a learning and reference tool.If you aren't serious about improving your anatomy drawing skills then go buy something else."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"This is a good quick reference guide and is easy to read as is all of Bridgman's books.

Although it has some good information about what specific muscles jobs are, the illustrations are not clear enough for good understanding. As an artist specifically working with the human form I find this book very mickey mousey and incomplete. If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"Title":"The Nun: a Novel","review":"One could weep to see a Masterpiece-of-a-novel like this lose its standing in the world especially during these times. Author Rene Bazin was one of the most courageous authors of his era in portraying the truth about convent life, along with the forces of good and evil that pitted 5 nuns - thrown literally back into the secular world to battle with spiritual weapons...only.

One of the best reads of your life, I promise you."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"Loved this cute little book - it's a wonderful departure from your regular chick lit fare.

She wishes to be younger and she is made to look younger by her gay friend Maggie.This is the story of a woman who left her job to raise her child and forgot what she had dreamt for herself in the process.Her hubby leaves her for a younger woman (almost like their daughter's age) and she is left to find out who she is and what she can become.I found the story weak and faulty, it didn't do it for me since the main character is too redundant for my style, and she asks herself the same question tons of times instead of voicing it just once. It felt like a boring tale of a woman who wants to work again but has lost her direction and ventures one more time in the quicksand that is the workplace nowadays.Of course there is a guy a 25 year old guy in fact who she meets kisses and falls in love with but of course she had to let him go, asking herself several times what to do and how to live her romance without her daughter knowing etc etc.I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"Alice Green has had a really bad year. Her husband left her for his much younger dental hygienist, her mother died, and her daughter has dropped out of college and joined the Peace Corps. Despite having the luxury of looking younger than her 44 years, Alice has never really taken advantage of it. Her pal Maggie helps her enhance those looks to start the new year off to a good start. Soon, she catches the eyes of many younger suitors at a New York City bar.Armed with her new appearance, and newly acquired confidence, Alice has changed places with herself, so to speak; she is living the life she lived prior to settling down and getting married. Suddenly, the job she applied for months earlier and was considered too old for is hers for the taking.But now Alice is finding it difficult to live her lie, as she grows ever closer to her new boyfriend Josh, a man young enough to be her son. Josh assumes she is an older woman - he is thinking 29 - he is just now aware of how much older she is. As she and Josh delude themselves into thinking that they are a casual couple, both find that they are falling in love, which causes more pressure on Alice's over-burdened nerves, and their seemingly insurmountable 19-year age gap.\\"Younger\\" works not only because of the great writing style of the author, but also because it does not portray either age as ideal - each has its own ups and downs and troubles and triumphs. It is really interesting to see a 40-something woman masquerading as a 20-something woman, and feeling the age discrimination issue from both ends when she is assigned to work for a jealous 30-something who treats her like the child that she thinks she is."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"I read Pamela Redmond Satran's \\"Babes in Captivity,\\" and enjoyed it, but I thought this was even better. For one thing, the plot was much tighter, and filled with fun twists and surprises.This is the story of Alice Green, a dowdy, 44-year-old housewife in suburban Homewood, New Jersey. Alice has always looked young for her age, though she hasn't bothered with her appearance for a long time. She's married to a dentist, who leaves her for his hygienist. Then Alice's daughter leaves for Africa, leaving Alice alone.In the year following her husband's departure, Alice whips herself into shape by working out for a couple of hours a day. When she tries to re-enter the workforce, she is less successful. She tries to get a job at the publishing house where she worked before she had a child, but they dismiss her as dried-up and middle-aged.After Alice tells a gypsy that she wants to be \\"younger,\\" Alice's best friend gives her a makeover. With her gray hair dyed blonde and her newly fit body on display in tighter, more fashionable clothes, Alice decides to give the work thing another try. She returns to Gentility after taking all the dates off her resume and omitting the years she spent as a stay-at-home mom. She also goes to a bar and meets a young man named Josh.What makes the novel work is not only the riveting plot, but Satran's careful look at the ups and downs of being young and old. She doesn't portray youth as a perfect haven, but instead shows how the \\"young\\" Alice must deal with an overbearing boss who doesn't take her seriously. She shows the pressure that the young women at the publishing company feel to get married and have kids before they're 35.Alice's relationship with Josh is a little less plausible. After he sees her naked, he still thinks she's 29, and can't tell that she had a kid! It's hard to believe that after having a child she wouldn't have stretch marks or something.However, Satran follows Alice's deception mostly smoothly from beginning to end, and it makes for very engaging reading."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"Her husband dumped Alice for a younger model. With the encouragement of their daughter, Alice crosses the Hudson from New Jersey to Manhattan where she meets her best friend Maggie. One look at her middle aged pal upsets Maggie so that she decides a total make over is needed to convert the suburban mom into a hot urbanite. The years come off and forty-four years old Alice looks like she is in her twenties.At a New Year's Eve party Alice meets Josh, who is much younger than her. Though their personal definitions to what are a couple shows the age gap, both insists they are not interested in a relationship. As she continues to see a man old enough to be her son, Alice also obtains her first job. However, pretending to fit in as a fellow twenty-something at work and in her \\"non-relationship\\" with Josh proves overwhelming as Alice wants to climb back out of the rabbit hole and confess to being a fortyish mother.YOUNGER is a deep character study that looks at age discrimination especially in the workplace, but to a lesser degree in relationships. The story line centers on Alice who finds lying about her age difficult to keep up with, but knows the truth will not set her free as it probably would cost her job, the friends she has made at work, and Josh. Pamela Redmond Satran writes an intriguing thought-provoking drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Younger","review":"I picked up this book for a couple different reasons.One, I am 44 years old, just like Alice. Two, people usually think I am much younger than I am. Three, I tend to date younger men who have no idea how old I am when they begin the pursuit (who am I to tell, anyway?) and Four, I liked the first few paragraphs and figured, \\"Why not try out a new author, I haven't read any novels lately.. so.... Just go for it!\\"I wasn't disappointed.Pamela Redmond Satran creates multi-dimensional, interesting characters in situations the reader can both relate to and want to find out more about as well. I was fascinated (in an odd way!) about the Alice's new best friend, Lindsey... and wondered if young women like her are truly out there? I am guessing yes...I also enjoyed being a part of Alice's choice making... and the miracles in Maggie's life, too... and regeneration of the relationship between Alice and her daughter.So yes, there is romance (and unconventional romance, which I appreciate...) there is career, there is friendship, there is parenting... there is art...A thoroughly enjoyable, engaging read - I will read more of Pamela Redmond Satran's books after discovering this one."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"I starting reading this book while waiting for my hair appt, just a way to pass the time. It didn't take long for me to start enjoying this book. Alice wanted a chance to correct some of her mistakes from the past and an opportunity to re-do her life based on her life experiences. Overall, the book was very good and a quick read. This is the first book I've read by this author. I'm looking forward to reading her previous novels."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"I'm a big fan of Pamela Redmond Satran's work. I loved her first two novels, The Man I Should Have Married and Babes in Captivity, but Younger is my favorite so far!

This was a funny, engaging, thought-provoking book that kept me reading late into the night. I recommended it to all my friends and you will too!"},{"Title":"Younger","review":"Younger is a page turner!

I would say that it's a coming of age novel, in a different way.

Thanks for a great novel."},{"Title":"Younger","review":"I am 29 and I appreciated the young and older perspectives in this book. It was much more entertaining than I had anticipated. Great beach book!"},{"Title":"Younger","review":"If you had the chance to do it all over again, go back ten or fifteen years and make different choices...would you take it? That is the opportunity the heroine in Pamela Redmond Satran's novel \`YOUNGER' is offered and not only does she take it she revels in it. When stay-at-home mom of twenty years, Alice, finds herself alone and heartbroken with little prospects for her future she wishes that she could be younger and do something's differently. With the help of her best friend Maggie that wish comes true in the form of a fabulous make over that makes her look about fifteen years younger than she really is. Now with her daughter five thousand miles away and her ex-husband shacking up with his dental hygienist, Alice decided to give this new opportunity a try and lands a job at her favorite publishing company and a much, much younger man.While \`YOUNGER' was a pleasant and quick read I felt that it lacked some of the excitement that this story could have had. It seemed to me that Alice should have embraced this opportunity a little bit more than she did. Instead of completely reverting back to her younger days (which it seemed to me she did) she should have been a bit bolder having the knowledge of a forty-four year old and the body of a twenty-nine year old. I give \`YOUNGER' three stars for being a good effort but not great one."},{"Title":"The Book of Romans: Righteousness in Christ (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"I purchased this book because I am teaching a class on Romans.It's a great resource for anyone wanting to use a great, direct commentary that is relevant for today's readers.Woodrow Kroll is best known for his involvement with Back to the Bible. He does an excellent job of making the book of Romans approachable to the reader.There is not an exhaustive covering of every position on the many topics in the book, which is OK. The introduction informs the reader that this series is directed at conservative, dispensational, pre-rapture, pre-tribulation believers. That narrows things down, and if you fall into that position, you'll be very comfortable reading this book.If you want something that presents all sides, other resources are available.All in all, I like this book, and will continue to use it as a resource. Of its many good features, I like the questions asked at the end of each section. It makes setting up a study series a little easier."},{"Title":"The Book of Romans: Righteousness in Christ (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"This is a well written book.

Still,a great buy for the money."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"You can't beat the price for a very well made book like this. This covers American, Italian, german, french, russian and japanese aircraft and more. I use this book often when I'm working on my website and I highly recommend it. C. Jeff Dyrek"},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"This book has a lot of good info and photos. But the layout is the stupidest thing I've seen in a book. Most of the photos are spread across two pages and since this book is quite thick, the centers of the pictures are curved and it ruins the photos. The info and the photos in the book should get 5 stars but the layout has ruined everything. They have also missed IL 2 which I believe is the most produced aircraft in history if not in the second world war. They have included aircraft models that are much insignificant but missed IL 2. Some would argue that IL 2 was a ground attack aircraft but not a fighter but almost half of this book is dedicated to bombers and other non fighting aircraft. I give 2 stars because it makes me mad to see all the good photographs in this book spread across two pages which looks like the author is mocking me."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"As a student of WWII aircraft, I found the information in the book to be very interesting. The format, alphabetical by manufacturer and country, makes it easy to look up a particular aircraft, with the caveat that not all aircraft are included. It is disappointing that no US dive bombers or torpedo bombers are in the book, even though there is a picture of a Grumman Avenger (in British insignia!)on the back cover."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"This is a book with an appealing cover and is of the 'pocket' book variety. However, I find 3 serious flaws with it: 1) This book is divided into sections by aircraft type and nationality. There is, for instance, a section on British fighters. But there is no section on single engine bombers/attack aircraft for allied nations. This means you won't find the Fairey Swordfish, Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik, Douglas Dauntless, Curtiss Helldiver, or Grumman Avenger mentioned in the book !! (There is a picture of an Avenger on the back cover, though !!) On the other hand, there is a section on Axis light attack aircraft, so planes like the Stuka and the Judy are covered. 2) The shape of the book is rather vertical in nature, and since this is a small book, the majority of the pictures are cut in half by the bookbinding! I find this ruins the esthetic lines of the plane which is pictured. It just doesn't make sense to make a vertical book about a subject (airplanes) which lies horizontally when photographed. Nice pictures but bad format, say I. 3) Finally, the book has no index or overall table of contents. Instead, each section (about 10) has its own mini- table of contents. This means that you end up spending time thumbing through the book to find the right section and then the right plane you're looking for. (Unprofessional, but it helps hide the fact that some planes are missing.)The author does a fine job, however, covering obscure British and German warplanes. Here are some of these planes: Westland Whirlwind, Blackburn Skua, Bachem Ba-349,Blohm und voss BV40, BV155, FW-187, HE-100, HE-112,HE-280, HS-123, HS-129, HS-132, JU-388, ME-263, ME-328. I don't recommend this book for serious aviation enthusiasts (unless they like obscure German aircraft), but it's fine for those with a casual interest. Those interested in the Pacific Air War should steer clear of this book!I haven't been able to find the PBY Catalina yet. I would appreciate if another reviewer could let me know if it's actually in the book."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"This is a good book for brief reference about WW II aircraft, including numbers produced, fronts in which the aircraft flew, nations that utilized the plane. About pilots, nothing. It's an extremely technical book."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"I am holding this book in my hands right now.

It covers aircraft from all countries with a bomber section in addition to its fighter section."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"This is an excelent book for everyone interested in the aircraft of World War II. Though it doesn't have every plane, it has a vast amount of detail on all the common ones that flew into combat, and even some that didn't. Great drawings, photos, and an incredible amount of info are the main highlights of this book."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this book, &quot;The Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II&quot; by Bill Gunston, had actually 479 pages and not just the mere 96 that is erroneously described here! The first two sections(Allied and Axis respectively)focuses on fighters and are categorized by nation and each includes an introduction. Each aircaft includes specs and narration of its development and service history. The third section covers, alphabetically by manufacturer, bombers of all nations . Unfortunately not every aircraft of the war is found in this book including the Russian IL-2 Shturmovik and U.S. made torpedo bombers of which one is curiously shown on the back cover. Nontheless almost every one of the aircraft the book does portray includes black/white and/or color photographs , planview line drawings/silhouettes, and (thankfully) color illustrations to show off unique aircraft camouflage (esp. colorful paint jobs of the Japanese variety). This handbook provides a very good balance between technical and casual reading on the more popular(and some not so popular such as the British Whirlwind, the German He-177 Greif, and various Japanese twin-engined fighters)aircraft of World War 2. Overall a very pleasant and informative read on a good collection of fighters and bombers of the second world war."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"I think this book is fantastic.The book tells you about american,british,soviet union,german,italian,and japaneese planes.This book also tells you about bomber planes of all the countries.The book has some real pictures and it also shows colorful illustrations."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"Although the book doesn't cover EVERY 2ndWorld War era warplane, it does a great job in its descriptions and provided information on most of the important aircraft, as well as some obscure and over-looked ones used by both the Axis and Allies. Very useful and its small physical size is a plus. Recommended for anyone looking for a good refference on WW2 warplanes."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"The book being reviewed is &quot;Aircraft of World War II by Bill Gunston&quot; and has ISBN 0-517-31680-3 (c) 1980. It is of 208 pages.This book covers 20 types (total) of various Axis &amp; Allied aircraft. All illustrations are nicely rendered (the book contains no photos).Each type is rendered ~ 11 times through a side view that shows a different Mark, or paint scheme. Each type also is show in 3-view.Graphically, this is the best Bill Gunston book. The data and commentary is also intersting without being long-winded.No other book in my collection receives the attention this book has received.My only wish is that Bill Gunston would create another book of this quality, with aircraft that this title hasn't covered."},{"Title":"Illustrated Directory of Fighting Aircraft of World War II","review":"I wish I had the chance to look at the book before I purchased it. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it.It includes the Republic P-43 Lancer but no Yaks or Hawker Tempest! The Brewster Buffalo is included (but listed as F2S, not F2A). The Grumman F4F Wildcat is included (as well it should be) but the F6F Hellcat isn't (though the photo in the Wildcat article is of a Hellcat!). The \\"Other Nations\\" section is one page, the Commonwealth Wirraway (Australia); why not include it under British Commonwealth? The photo of the Fw 190 has been used SO MANY times; get something different. The photo of the Ju 87 has been retouched (during WWII?) and is just plain bad. The Bf 109 photo combines the worst of the Fw 190 and Ju 87 photos: over used and retouched. I could go on but you get the idea.The book is probably fine for someone with no knowledge of World war II aviation, but anyone who knows a little about it should not purchase this book."},{"Title":"Becoming Bobbie","review":"Bobbie took after her dad with her love of cars and music, and after he was taken away, she and her mother found the distance between them had grown. She falls in love with her high school literature teacher, Agatha Claraday, and when the two indulge their mutual attraction, the older woman cannot handle the strain. Bobbie drifts through some more tough times through the 1980s, and when she again encounters Agatha, the two both feel that fate has brought them together again. From this relationship, Bobbie draws strength and is able to confront her past. \\"Becoming Bobbie\\" is a wonderful coming-of-age story as well as a journey of self-discovery. With Stevens's skillful writing and compelling story voice, stale plot contrivances come alive and become fresh, drawing readers further. This is a novel that brings hope to its readers, hope for the future and for love and for the breadth of living."},{"Title":"Becoming Bobbie","review":"I think that enjoyed this book because it includes emotions that I have felt. I also really enjoyed the plot device of using music to bring vibrancy to each era being addressed. I so agree with the author that Melissa Etheridge and Bruce Springsteen (and other artists as well) write songs that stir the soul. This book also stirs the soul. I enjoy reading books that span a long period in someone's life...sometimes, if you're paying attention, you can learn something in a book without having to go through it yourself. For this reason, I found the main character's life lessons particularly beneficial. I also found the story telling style accessible and engaging...not frilly, just honest and direct. Many thanks to R.J. Stevens for writing this book. Like Melissa Etheridge's songs or finding a soul mate, this book could also save lives. Thank you for writing the novel in the tone of a memoir that tells the truth about one lesbian's experiences and family."},{"Title":"Becoming Bobbie","review":"Although it may be easily comparable to many other coming-of-age novels, this one really pulled me in. I felt connected to the characters and genuinely cared about their futures. The characters were well developed, the story held many surprises, and I had trouble putting it down. I easily finished it in two sittings in a weekend because I always wanted to read more. A day after finishing it, I'm tempted to go back and start again!R.J. Stevens either knows from experience what it is like to grow up different in the late 70s and 80s, or has done some excellent research. It all felt right on target.

I finally decided to read this book out of curiosity, and discovered an incredible story that is entirely left out of our history books. The story of these young women who brought gentility to the West, leaving their families and homes far behind, is fascinating and enlightening. This book is a page-turner, and the history of the Santa Fe Railroad and the Harvey Houses is something that should not be lost in the mists of time. Ms. Poling-Kempes is a gifted and entertaining writer, and I look forward to reading her other books on the Southwest."},{"Title":"The Harvey Girls: Women Who Opened the West","review":"I had heard of Fred Harvey and the Harvey Girls and their role in civilizing the American West, but I never knew much about the subject. Recently, on a trip to the Grand Canyon, my wife and I wandered into Bright Angel Lodge, one of the last surviving Harvey hotel/restaurants (although the Harvey family sold what was left of the chain many years ago). Inside was a memory room full of old photos and memorabilia, including the Harvey Girls. With my interest piqued, I bought \\"The Harvey Girls\\" by Lesley Poling-Kempes. The book is well written, giving a fascinating look at how Fred Harvey developed and ran dozens of hotels and restaurants along the routes of the Santa Fe Railroad in the west and southwest.Ms. Poling-Kempes did a nice job of researching the life and times of the Harvey houses and the Harvey Girls who worked in them. A number of factors resulted in the gradual demise of the Harvey houses, and most of them have been destroyed, but \\"The Harvey Girls\\" very effectively recreates the era, and the numerous old photos in the book contribute greatly to imagining how it was in those days.Fred Harvey and the Harvey Girls may not have singlehandedly tamed the West, but they certainly made a significant contribution, and Ms. Poling-Kempes deserves an \\"A\\" for documenting this fascinating footnote on the history of the American West.Highly recommended reading for history buffs!"},{"Title":"The Harvey Girls: Women Who Opened the West","review":"As someone who likes the Santa Fe and Fred Harvey, this book added a new dimension to my knowledge. I applaud Ms. Poling-Kempes' research, and I truly think the oral form she used was the correct way to bring the memories of former Harvey Girls to life. I believe this book could be used as suggested reading in an American History class, as it shows one facet of the development of the west. Also, it shows in places, the goodness of these largely unsung women (and even a few Harvey officials who were men), the goodness this country is rightly proud. I would recommend this book to anyone who has even a passing interest in this era of the West, railroads, and even of fine food service. I tip my cap to Ms. Poling-Kempes for a very worthwhile bood."},{"Title":"The Harvey Girls: Women Who Opened the West","review":"Having traveled on the trains and visited the places like La Posada, La Fonda and El Tovar, this book helped to bring their history more to life.

But...and there is always a but. I think that, her final proposals tend to be naive. Do not misunderstand me. Her proposals would be very good...if and only if, the people with the power to move ahead with the kind of actions that are needed were really interested in the fate of poor countries and in the people of their own countries ( as she very well explains). What they are interested in , I mean the elites everywhere,is in PROFITS and power..that is the reason and the blood of limitless capitalism. All other issues, including the welfare of the people or the environment are simply not considered.Another point is that the role of the corrupt political elite in third world countries is in some way minimized. These guys are gangsters and must be treated as such. But instead they are very well treated by the political and corporative elites in the developed nations...and when they no longer represent PROFITS or geopolitical advantages they are simply discarded..Just remember Noriega or Saddam...The sad point is that the people of these countries can not discard these gangsters by their own means..Why?? Because of the support the corrupt Govts' receive from the rich countries..And they preach about moral and ethics....!!! Very good read....Worth your time."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Few exhortations to action manage to blend a detailed objective analysis of the facts; a practical, well thought-out agenda for change; and the true passion that comes of moral certainty. Dr Hertz's book somehow pulls it off.Her central case is that developing country debt is the legacy of bad decisions - bad on the parts of the lenders, and of the borrowers. The consequences are awful at the human level, on a massive scale, just as Bono eloquently described at the Labour Party conference. IOU goes some way down the same path, successfully mixing the pure statistics of poverty with anecdotes of uneducated children, needlessly untreated HIV/AIDS sufferers, and women forced into prostitution. One of this book's strengths, however, is that it brings to the fore something far less obvious: namely, that the consequences of debt are malicious for the lenders in the rich world too. The debt quagmire entrenches much of the world's unrealised economic potential in a spiral of corruption, dampening demand for western goods and limiting investment, breeding ill-feeling towards lender nations, and ultimately contributing to the existence of failed states in which terrorists can thrive.She goes on to explain exactly how to break the spiral, and anticipates and overcomes the practical objections. In a nutshell, she proposes applying strict criteria to debt relief, and an ingenious series of controls to ensure that money freed up benefits people rather than corrupt politicians.Dr Hertz's breathless writing style conveys her passion for the subject rather well. Colloquialisms, run-on sentences, and a strange eye for the physical characteristics of her protagonists all give the sense of being on the receiving end of an intense face-to-face monologue rather than reading a dry book about development economics. Male characters \\"probably used to be good looking\\"; women are \\"hose clad\\". But the facts and figures to buttress the case are never far behind. If there is perhaps one area in which she stretches the case a little too far, it is in the impact of debt on the environment. The reader gets the sense that because both debt and climate change are important, there must somehow be a causal link. But this section does little do dilute the impact of the whole.All in all, an engaging and important piece of work that deserves the plaudits. As Bob Geldof says: \\"everyone should read this book\\"."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"A highly readable and accessible book on an important subject that most people believe is too difficult to understand. Hertz's history of third world debt, which takes us from the Bretton Woods agreements to the present day, is interspersed with stories from the author's work and observations, such as Bono's Jubilee activism and the author's own foray to Russia as a consultant for the World Bank and International Monetoary Fund. Every American should read this book -- particularly every American who finds the subject off-putting, doesn't think it really matters, or has wondered why all those people are protesting globalization."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"The relief of debt for poorer countries is an issue which many support but few really understand. Noreena Hertz is someone who knows what she is talking about. She formerly worked at the World Bank and in now Professor of Economics at Cambridge. She is also a tireless campaigner for debt relief.What I most appreciated was her ability to explain the economics in a way that was both understandable and convincing. She tells us how the debts came about - often during the cold war in an attempt by the West to gain and maintain areas of influence in the developing world. She also reminds us that many of these loans went to corrupt leaders of countries whose citizens now have to pay the price. As a result basic human needs - food, housing, and healthcare are sacrificed to service the debt payments.We are left in no doubt that we carry a significant responsibility for this situation. This is why we should lobby our leaders to write of these debts. It is easy to say that fault lies on both sides. That may be so but if poor children have to pay then we who are in a position to do something should do all that we can.She writes all of this in a very readable style. This book did far more than big events such as Live 8 to convince me of the need to do something. I would urge all readers to get hold of a copy and read it!"},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Although this is a well written book, there is just a bit too much fantasy to be taken seriously. Obviously the author is quite liberal, which is fine, but this book was written six plus years ago and there still and always will be a problem with politicians. She makes several jabs at George Bush and his spending problems (I'm curious what she thinks about Obama now) and how insensitive the \\"rich\\" nations are about the poor nations. Well, even with our current administration, politics is politics and this problem is simply not on most people's radars. Funny thing, I found myself agreeing more with her premise but than reality slaps you in the face. There is simply no way to make debt forgiveness a major issue for politicians to hand out our borrowed money. Then she basically says we should all get along as a world, hand this money over to UNICEF and the UN for them to enforce it.. Well how long until corruption enters the ring?? I hate to sound so negative but these countries are in such a deep hole, Lord only knows how they can ever recover and join the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Back in the good old days of Western imperialism, Western powers used the same tried and true approach over and over again to extract wealth from and subdue non-Western peoples: invasion and/or colonization, and/or enslavement. This method was effective for a few hundred years, until subjugated populations after living in close quarters with their masters and learning their weaknesses, mounted various successful forms of resistance against them, e.g., the Algerians' violent resistance of the French, or Gandhi's non-violent resistance of the British. After the First World War, the Western powers (although with much backsliding, evident now in Iraq), began to withdraw their armies and close up their colonial shops. After the great bloodbath of WWI the old cover stories -- \\"The White Man's Burden\\" - were so threadbare that the average Westerner could at last see imperialism for the nasty racket it was.But wait. It turns out that was just the opening chapter of imperialism. There's a new chapter, or in business-speak a \\"new paradigm.\\" Through the relatively abstract miracle of debt, rich countries since WWII have been able to reclaim their hegemony. The beauty part for the West has been that invasion through debt does not require much in the way of armies and colonists. In fact, what is really sweet about the new way of doing business is that invaders get to dictate terms to poor countries and don't usually have to back up their threats with armies. Instead there's the threat that global traders will lower poor nations' bond ratings, squeeze their economies, and, by extension, their people, until they see the light. Kind of like loan sharking when you think about it.Loan sharks, contrary to the stories told in movies and books, generally like to keep their customers alive, because after all, they want to get their money back. In this new form of colonialism that's pretty much true, too. But still, people do get killed like they did during the traditional imperialist paradigm. Hertz shows in chilling detail, for instance, how a cholera epidemic swept through Peru because Alberto Fujimori, following the dictates of the IMF and World Bank, sent every nickel he could get his hands on to pay the interest on Peru's national debt so Peru would get back into the good graces of the financial markets. Healthcare services, welfare and other human services were curtailed or cut to pay the debt. When Peru and opened up its economy to the international market as per the IMF just as commodity prices dropped, unemployment and poverty rates went through the roof. Rural dwellers moved to the city seeking work. Work was not available; unsanitary conditions were. So desperate was their poverty that these Peruvians couldn't afford soap to wash their hands or kerosene to boil their water. And so cholera killed nearly 4,000 in less than a year.Ms. Hertz provides much needed insight into the history of the debt threat. It began in the Cold War - the era of the \\"chessboard and the checkbook\\" in Thomas Friedman's phrase - when the U.S. and the Soviets were buying allies. Few restrictions applied to these loans. Dictators and oligarchs could spend it any way they wanted as long as they remained friends. Then in the 70s came the commercial U.S. banks, awash in petrodollars, making loans and betting that Uncle Sam would reach into the pockets of the U.S. taxpayer to bail them out if necessary. After the Soviet collapse ended the era of checkbook diplomacy, a newly invigorated IMF and World Bank began its recent career as a lender of last resort. Their one size fits all free market approach placed the same onerous restrictions on every nation they did business with. Debt enslaved nations meekly agreed to more enslavement lest these agencies tighten the screws further.Ms. Hertz takes us through this history at a brisk pace and shows through examples that though the approach may have changed, the result is the same: poor countries in thrall to rich countries. She shows with gripping examples not only how the racket works but, more importantly, how these practices put the West in danger by promoting dangerous conditions around the world. For instance, disease can now board an airplane and land in any Western nation in a matter of hours. Poor people grown even poorer because of their nations cannot afford basic health services and so grow weaker, more susceptible. Their afflictions mutate and metastasize, and soon the entire body of humanity is at risk. Then, of course, there is the wholesale destruction of the environment as poor countries rip up their forests and sell their oil to the West so it may be burned or turned into toxins. And, of course, there are terrorists who find an ever expanding pool of ready recruits among the poor, a whole new class of young men who are boiling with resentment and rage. Tragically, in the narrow Western ethos of profit and loss, payment of debt must override all other concerns, because profit-making is the only goal, and capitalism the best of all possible alternatives.With THE DEBT THREAT, Ms. Hertz's continues to demonstrate how the forces of global hypercapitalism that she explored in her first book (\\"The Silent Takeover\\") put the lives of everyone in physical, and at the very least, moral jeopardy. As in that book, her personal story gives one hope: an economist trained at Wharton (she was there to help \\"jump start\\" the Soviet economy in the early 90s and was witness first hand to the anti-human ethos of the free-market fabulists), she has switched her allegiance to the other side of the barricades. On a positive note, global protests and activism has managed to arrest some of the worst abuses of the World Bank and IMF, the commercial banks and ECAs. One can only hope that this cogently argued work will awaken more and more people to this latest, and perhaps even more deadly strain of imperialism."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Large amounts of government debt are a combination of a noose around the neck of many developing countries as well as a potential time bomb that could explode and threaten the developed countries as well. When I was growing up, I was repeatedly told how much the United States was giving to the poor countries of the world in foreign aid: money, equipment and food. I also heard many times about the anti-American stance that people in those countries had and how their lack of gratitude was disgraceful. Once I entered graduate school, I encountered people from other countries and we talked very frankly about how they perceived the United States. Those from Chile talked about how they watched the Chilean military round up their friends and take them to the soccer field, and how they later heard gunshots and never saw the people again. They also described how the same thing was happening in Argentina. At the time, those regimes were strongly backed by the U. S. as fellow anticommunist governments and received substantial amounts of American aid.Students from other countries considered U. S. allies also talked about how the aid sent by the United States and other western countries was used to buy arms and equipment for the government forces and very little was ever distributed to the people. A large amount of the aid that the United States sent to third world countries before the collapse of the Soviet Union was used to buy weaponry or to bribe the leaders. The only two conditions imposed on them were that the weapons had to be purchased from the west and the country had to maintain a firm stance against communism. If the leaders receiving the money followed these guidelines, then they were free to skim whatever they felt they needed with no threat of the funds being cut off. Therefore, those nations are now overloaded with vast amounts of debt that they can never repay. One of the main themes of the book is that most of the debt of the third world countries should be forgiven. Since it was the price that the west paid to defeat communism, that is one strong argument in favor of the debt cancellation.There is also the ugly history of the origin of much of the debt, namely greedy bankers who literally pushed the debt onto governments, giving out massive loans, knowing that the U. S. government would step in to avoid defaults in the worst cases. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have forced debtor governments to institute policies that have made bad situations worse. In Rwanda, after the horror of the genocide was over, and there was not even so much as a stapler in the government buildings, the new government pleaded with the IMF to give them an emergency loan. The response was that they first needed to pay the three million in interest that they currently owed.This theme of western rapaciousness in the face of increasing problems is the saddest aspect of the situation. In western societies, if a person goes bankrupt, the law allows them to keep some of their assets and at least tries to let them keep enough so that they can work, seek medical care and avoid starvation. That has not been the case with the IMF, which has forced nations to chose between making their interest payments and providing medical care and education for their citizens. In many nations, schools and hospitals have closed, as there is no longer any money to keep them open. The IMF had dictated that in order to get additional assistance, they must make their onerous payments. Such policies will only make the situation worse in the long term and is breeding a great deal of resentment. As Hertz points out, many of those nations are Muslim and this is the source of a great deal of anti-western hostility.The worst two aspects of this situation are how rich some western people and institutions are getting from this. She describes how much money many of the lending institutions have made from these bad loans; few of them have truly lost significant money, even when a nation has defaulted. In my mind, the worst is what Hertz refers to as the debt vultures. These are people who spend their time in the legal system acquiring what few assets the debtor nations have in the west, stripping them of one of the few things they have of value. This is done in an attempt to pay off some of their debt. When she interviews one and asks about any feelings of remorse he may have because he is literally forcing thousands of people to an early death from starvation and disease, the vulture shows none. Such actions are considered criminal in the United States, but are routinely committed against the poor of the third world.Hertz was in the former Soviet Union as it was collapsing, working with the international banking agencies and implementing their policies. Her opinion is that those policies were so destructive and shortsighted that they helped accelerate the collapse of the Russian economy. By trying to impose a western style capitalist economy, the functional parts of the old Soviet economy collapsed and this led to the rise of the underground and criminal economy.This is a book that all people who study the relationships between the wealthy and poor nations should read. I will never forget my discussions with my classmates from Chile. While we all got along and they enjoyed being in the United States, there was bitterness in their voices when they talked about the events in their country. I realize that they will never forget that the United States encouraged and bankrolled the Chilean military and will always assign some blame to the United States. I also understand that they are only a few of the billions of people around the world who have similar reasons to hate the United States. It is time that western banking and political institutions recognize that it is in their best interests to implement a policy that will allow the debtor nations to recover from their indebtedness and begin to expand their infrastructure, educate their people, treat their sick and protect their natural resources."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"The Debt Threat: How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World...and Threatening Us Allclearly explains why Third World debt should be forgiven. I always felt that, hey, if you incur a debt, you should pay it. Reading this book changed my opinion.A lot of debt in developing countries was incurred at a time when commercial banks needed to make loans. Sound familiar? Some of the borrowers were ruled at the time by despots who used the funds for their personal use.Those who are now left with the debt find they cannot make the interest payments. They spend more on paying off the debt than getting clean water and education for their children. This book helped me see why many third world countries can't get ahead economically.Of course, since the book was written, many Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina paid off their debt. But for the others, a fresh start would help not only them, but the rest of the world as well - including Americans."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Insightful, interesting and accessable. I read this book as part of my disseration research for a critical assessment of World Bank/IMF policy with regards to third world development. Prof. Hertzs' arguements are persuasive and compelling. They demand the attention of the policy-makers, finanical workers and the international community at large. Debt hangs from the neck of the developing world preventing it from standing upright. Prof. Hertz explains that this need not be the case."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Debt cancellation for developing countries is a subject that has attracted much attention and little real action, despite in 2005 G8 countries and few others have taken some clear-cut commitment. This readable book provides:a) a quick and simple description as to how developing countries got trapped into unsustainable debt levels. But among developing countries it fails to distinguish between middle-income emerging market economies and low-income economies. Therefore, the author jumps to the conclusion that Argentina (or Turkey) and Somalia (or Botswana) should be treated the same.b) a simple theory, which suggests that developed countries often offered loans to corrupt governments (or full-fledged dictatorship) of developing countries and therefore, the peoples of those countries cannot bear the burden of servicing that debt, for which they did not benefit at all. Thus understood the problem, the full debt cancellation is a moral (and maybe legal) obligation. The author does not develop further that theory, but in practice she says that those countries that have violated human rights, or more specifically, at the time of borrowing were violating civil and political liberties, and/or economic, social and cultural rights should be provided full debt cancellation. Who and how the violation would be assessed is not clear, but this idea merits to be developed further and into operational detail.I would recommend it for the general reader and those interested in development issues without prior knowledge."},{"Title":"The Debt Threat : How Debt Is Destroying the Developing World","review":"Noreena Hertz's basic principle is that the rights of creditors do not stand above fundamental human rights.Debt repayments should not be imposed on governments when they could put in danger a minimum level of food, health care, clothing, water, education and housing for the entire population.But as US president Calvin Coolidge said to the English delegation after WWI: 'We lent you money. Didn't we?'The fact is that a lot of money was lent to corrupt and despotic regimes (Suharto, Marcos, Abacha, Ceaucescu, Mengistu, the South-African apartheid regime ...). More, after the end of the cold war, the US asked immediate debt repayment from States which were no longer strategically important.Democratic governments should not be responsible for irresponsible lending by States or International Organizations.She remarks that 60-70 % of all World bank projects under Mc Namara were failures and that only 10 % were ecologically and socially sound investments.For her, debt should be forgiven if it was lent to undemocratic regimes, if the investments were against the interests of the majority of the population and when those who gave the money knew for what it was disbursed.Ultimately, debt forgiveness will ot only favour the poor but also the rich countries, for it should not force nations to implement unsound policies and should improve security in the world.By the way, she rightly lambastes massive arms investments (4 stealth bombers represent 1 schoolyear for 155 million children) and agricultural subsidies in the US and Europe (every cow receives 2,20 $ per day, or more that 1 billion human beings on our planet).This book is a must read about a crucial problem for a massive part of the world population."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Les Standiford is noted for writing excellent prose in novel format, however, this tome about a famous man of his day, Henry Flagler, reads like an intense story about a man who changed and impacted his world.Not too long ago, I was encouraged by a teacher to learn about life and what and how to approach it by reading about great men. Most have not heard of Flagler, but his legacy and work live on in spite of the lack of knowledge of him. We learn early on that we have all heard of the famous John D. Rockefeller. Well, without Flagler, Rockefeller may never have achieved the greatness and wealth that he did. You see, Flagler was his partner and the number two man in the founding of Standard Oil.Standiford starts out his writing about a massive hurricane that impacts the railroad crossing that Flagler had built 20 years prior out to Key West. Over 120 miles of varying topography and water crossings, being hit by arguably the fiersest storm ever to hit US shores. We hear of cat 5 hurricanes a lot the last few years, but it seems that cat 5 level storms with 200 mile an hour winds and 20 foot walls of water have happened.You get to meet Flagler and walk fairly rapidly through his life, although not a short book, you can read about this great man in a very short period of time. Standiford gives us an insight to how Flagler thought and how he wanted to give his riches back and hope to make something in return.Flagler had a few careers, Corn (where he met Rockefeller), Oil, where they were partners, and then a passion for building hotels and resort destinations that basically gave us Eastern Florida. Flagler is credited for building out or beginning to build out resort hotels St. Agustine, Jacksonville, Daytona, Palm Beach and Miami. Miami, named Fort Dallas at the time, was a small hovel of less than 200 families before he built the train from Jacksonville to Miami. He built resorts all along his railroad that eventually lead to his desire to build a rail system that would link Key West to the mainland.To say that Flagler was a visionary is an understatement. Although the rail never really made the money that he had hoped, Key West was to continue to grow, even the highway famed for its long spans out to Key West are a tribute to his vision.There is no indication that Flagler became a billionare as did his partner, however, the massive impact that he had on Florida lives on very powerfully. What if all those with their billions would develop as did he?The resorts that many go to for diversion today are a result of his vision and work.We see lastly that through the efforts of many men who worked hard in very difficult circumstances much was achieved. Flagler never waivered in his desire to finish his railroad. Many died due to the work being done, many died as well with the attempts to resue those in the path of the storm that ended the rail for good.One of the take aways in this book is how a great man can give back to building with a wonderful vision and create more for many. Henry Flagler was a visionary whose story is an inspiration for his time and for ours."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is a biographical look into the marvelous accomplishments of a determined visionary whose neuroticism was focused to make the world a better place.Henry Flagler dedicated his long life and enormous fortune to social minded pioneering never following in another's footsteps while he turned his boundless dreams into unparalleled monuments out shadowing all who came before him.This is an incomparable story of the biggest chapter in Florida's centuries of romantic history.I highly recommend the book for those who appreciate a monumental true history told by one of the best authors of our time."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"\\"Last Train to Paradise\\" is popular history at its best. This is the story of an era that is no more--a time when one man with unlimited resources, and more importantly, unlimited vision could accomplish something wondrous. Henry M. Flager, who co-founded Standard Oil with John Rockefeller, left his active role in the company 15 years after its birth to pursue his new passion: building the modern state of Florida. At the heart of this book is Flager's drive to see the Key West Railroad completed before his death.The idea of running train tracks all the way to Key West had been around for a while, but had been dismissed by most people as wildly impractical. Flager was determined to see it through, buoyed during the many challenges the project faced by his unshakable belief that the completion of the rail line, coupled with the opening of the Panama Canal, would transform Key West into a major port. (That part of Flager's vision was to remain unfulfilled.) The engineering challenges proved to be huge, and the toll of lost lives was great. But Flager persevered. The line was completed in 1912, slightly more than a year before Flager's death at eighty-three. It stood for twenty-three years, until its swift obliteration in the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. Author Les Standiford brings the creation and destruction of this rail line to life in vivid, novelistic detail. At the end, the reader is left pondering a question: Was the expenditure of lives and treasure worth it? If we could put that query to Henry Flager today, I believe the answer would be yes.--William C. Hall"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Henry Flagler was co-founder of Standard Oil, but later in life, when he'd left that part of his professional life behind him, he embarked on a late-life career that produced amazing, though not especially lucritive results.By combining his extensive business and managerial skills, along with his poltiical connections and a huge amount of foresight, Flagler did something few other people could claim - he developed much of southeastern Florida.I didn't know this before I read this book, but at the turn of the century (1800-1900) the largest city in southern Florida was Key West! Miami didn't exist, nor did much of anything in eastern Florida south of St. Augustine (the oldest city in the United States). That's right, Miami didn't even exist! This was at the time one of the last frontiers in the lower 48 states.This book tells about Flagler's decision to build a luxury hotel in southern Fla., and of his decision to purchase a RR that would extend not only to his hotels, but all the way to the southern tip of continental Fla. and on out across the Florida keys all the way to Key West! Amazing! That's a distance of well over 100 miles. People thought it couldn't be done. People said it was an impossibility, in terms of the engineering that would be required. Many people of the day said that Flagler's plan to build a RR extending all the way to Key West was comparable to if not more demanding in terms of applied engineering than the digging of the Panama Canal - another project that was going on at the time.If this kind of true tale intersts you, then I highly recommend that you dive into this book.As with most great true stories, there is an imperfect protagonist, and his antagonist is nature herself - a force competely indifferent to the aspirations and pains of humanity. And, as many of you now know, the Florida keys lie in the realm of hurricanes.All I'll say about hurricanes is that if you are considering this read, prepare yourself for the hurricane of 1935, perhaps the most powerful storm ever to hit the United States (Katrina included).This is a solid telling of a great true story. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is a quick, thrilling read about a truly magnificent feat of engineering and the one-in-a-million megastorm that brought it crashing down. It touches just enough on the history of industrialist Henry Flagler and his key role in the growth of the state of Florida to provide a solid background (and encourage the reader to follow up with a more in-depth biography). It also avoids going into great detail about the engineering and political machinations behind the project -- perhaps a bit too much, especially when it comes to Flagler's long-term feud with Teddy Roosevelt, which sounds quite interesting and appears to have had a significant effect on construction of the railway.Of course, the book is not trying to be scholarly. It moves along at a brisk pace and works very well as a pop history. The included photographs (some of which are a bit gruesome) really help bring the story to life, although the single map is not nearly as detailed as it should be. Many of the places referenced in the text are not identified on the map, and some of the Keys islands named on the map are not mentioned in the book. In addition, its arrows marking the paths of hurricanes that affected the railway is missing one. But it's easy enough to look those things up elsewhere, and an extensive bibliography is included. Overall, this is a fascinating and enjoyable book that will appeal to those interested in 19th-Century industrialists, railroads, or the history of Florida."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Before I read this book, I knew nothing about the Florida East Coast Railway company, nor anything about Henry Flagler. Turns out I was missing a great story. The beginning of the book talks about Mr. Flagler's hand in creating Standard Oil, how he got involved etc. That was cool because I had only heard how Rockefeller was the guy behind it all. Not true, Henry was the man behind Rockefeller.The other reviewers have detailed the whole train building problems, and yes the book spends about 2/3's of it going over the usual issues, labor, engineering, water crossings etc. But I liked it because it explained why things were difficult, who the people were who figured it out, and what the ultimate cost in people and dollars were to do such a project. And it pretty much explains why no one does this anymore.The other bit that this book goes over is the amount of damage that a hurricane can do. Living as I do far from these storms I have only tv news and reporters leaning into the wind to understand it. The author does a very good job of explaining how bad it can get, and what can happen to mere human things that we think of as permanent. Hah! These storms laugh at our puny attempts to defy them. If ever a hurricane as strong as the 1935 one hits Miami or Key West the loss of life and damage will be enormous.All in all a good read. Especially as a beach read, easy to pick up and put down."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I knew little about Flagler before I read this book, just that he built the railroad to Key West and that it suffered a great amount of damage from hurricanes.This is one of those books that you could find at gift shop in a destination resort in Florida, of which Flagler was a pioneer. I like the paperback format with the photo plates towards the center. It is a good book for studying the history of Florida and especially the development of the Keys. Little by little, Flagler built resorts and extended his railroad empire farther south until he reached what would become Miami. He was introduced to east Florida by way of finding a more suitable climate for the improvement of his first wife's asthma. Flagler (for better or worse) is in large part responsible for making the east coast of Florida what it is today, which is why you might find many roads and places named for him. It is also a tribute to his political clout that he was able (according to this book) make insanity grounds for uncontested divorce in Florida.Flagler was a businessman with a keen eye and helped Rockefeller form Standard Oil, using money from his in-laws. His expected payoff for building the railroad was to service a port at Key West that would be the closest port to the Panama Canal. His railroad would then transport goods and passengers to the north and the rest of the country. The book is an interesting chronicle of the construction of the railroad and helps one to understand how the Florida Keys developed the way they did. Along the way, Flagler had to build accommodations for the workers (it sounds like he took good care of them) and provide water and sustenance for both man and machine, all while hoping for fair weather - there was more than one hurricane along the way... The story of Flagler and the Florida East Coast Railway is similar to H.H. Rogers and the Virginian Railway - a \\"Mountains to Sea\\" railroad primarily to ship coal from West Virginia coal fields to the naval coal piers in Hampton Roads, VirginiaThe Key West Extension of the FEC was a project similar to the trans-continental railroad, in that it was deemed impossible and a folly by many people at the time. It also required visionary thinking and engineers that were both skilled and audacious. Both projects were similar in scope to the space program's race to the moon. I thought it was interesting that the chief engineer on this project, Joseph Meredith, suffered an untimely demise, as did the chief engineer / proponent of the trans-continental railroad, Theodore Judah. See:Nothing Like It In the World : The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad 1863-1869I had read Spider Robinson's \`Callahan's Key'Callahan's Keyand part of the action involved the trip to Key West down the Overseas Highway as well as \`Callahan's Con'Callahan's Con (Callahan's Crosstime Saloon Series)that \`resurrects' Ida Alice (Flagler's second wife). Odd, what you can learn from a sci-fi / fantasy novel, isn't it? This engineering feat is also seen in the film \`True Lies',True Liesso when I had a chance to read this book, I did not hesitate. This book also whets my appetite for a trip to Key West to see it all for myself.If you are interested in \`how the Keys were won', or are a fan of railroads, you should consider this book."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"The other reviewers are correct in that this book reads more like a magazine article than a riveting piece of historical literature. I definitely see this being made into an episode of \\"When Weather Changed History\\" on the Weather Channel.The book focuses more on Henry Flagler and his career than the actual building of the railroad itself but nevertheless man and project are often one and the same, (i.e. Howard Hughes and TWA).The book is an OK read...I question several of his facts, it felt awkward reading and it was not as fascinating a story as the preface made it sound. It is a good read about Florida and the railroad so if you have either lover in your family they will enjoy this book. But what it has done, its made me want to read more because this book just didn't go into detail and I'm excited for more so in the end the book did its job...it got me reading."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"It is impossible to separate the history of the Florida East Coast Railroad from the biography of Henry Flagler, the characteristics of the Florida Keys, the technology of railroads, and the business climate of the US at the turn of the 20th century. All are interdependent on each other.Last Train to Paradise tells the story of the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railway, and its legendary extension \\"across the ocean\\" from Miami to Key West. One only needs look at a map to realize the magnitude of the challenge, especially when climate and economics are considered.Les Standiford attempts to tell this story. He does so in a very easy-to-read 250 pages, and does a nice job of capturing the framework and highlights of the project. The book begins with a background of Henry Flager, the owner of the FEC, and continues on with the story of building the railroad and bringing civilization to South Florida. Finally it ends the legendary Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, which essentially destroyed the Miami-Key West rail link.The book is certainly worth reading, and provides much information that was new to me, including details of Flagler's life, the history and development of South Florida, and the construction and disasters of the railroad itself. I read it in two or three sittings, and it was a compelling page turner.My main criticism of the book is that it only whets the appetite for more. The FEC story cries out for a 700 page book that delves into the details of the story. I missed a more technical discussion of the railroad construction. While I knew of Henry Flagler, and Last Train provided more details on this man, there was so much more I was curious about.There were many other information stubs that I would have enjoyed more details on. For example, Standiford makes a point several times about the lack of environmental safeguards during the railroad- such as filling in of land between islands- and notes that it would never be allowed today without formal reviews. I wish the book had pursued this to its conclusion- have the Florida Keys been permanently affected?In summary, I would recommend this book if you are at all interested in Florida, railroads, or the determination of one man to build his dream regardless of technical and economic barriers. The book treats many areas of the topic too lightly for my taste, but does have sufficient detail to provide an interesting read. While none of the parties involved were avid record keepers, Last Train to Paradise seems reasonably well researched and communicates clearly with its reader.And while it never attains the gripping thriller status of \\"The Perfect Storm\\", it does a credible job of describing the devastation of the hurricanes which plagued the railroad.It is definitely a 4/5 stars, and probably even higher. If history is your thing, you won't be disappointed. It is an excellent 250 page book on the subject, but it would have been an absolutely incredible at 800 pages."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Les Standiford is the author of several critically acclaimed novels as well as several works of non-fiction. A few years back I had the distinct pleasure of reading one of those non-fiction titles. \\" Meet You in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership That Transformed America\\" was one of the best books I read back in 2005. And so when I happened upon a copy of \\"Last Train To Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad That Crossed An Ocean\\" I did not hesitate. The mere idea of attempting to build a railroad through the Florida Keys all the way to Key West sounded absolutely incredible. But the individual who conceived and financed this project to a successful conclusion was no ordinary man. Henry Morrison Flagler had helped John D. Rockerfeller found Standard Oil. After years of accumulating wealth in the oil business Henry Flager turned his sights southward towards the largely undeveloped State of Florida. For better or for worse, Henry Flagler was probably the person most responsible for transforming Florida from a mosquito infested wilderness into a progression of bustling communities and wildly successful resorts. \\"Last Train To Paradise\\" recalls the remarkable accomplishments of this visionary figure. It truly is a compelling story.When Henry Flagler arrived in Florida he was initially interested in building a resort hotel. At that point Florida remained largely undeveloped and what would become the City of Miami was just a desolate outpost called Fort Dallas. While pursuing his hotel project Flagler discovered that there were other venture capitalists who were interested in doing the same sorts of things. There was one major impediment however. Rail service only went as far south as St. Augustine. An 1889 act of the Florida legislature set aside some ten million acres of land to be deeded to entrepeneurs willing to build new railway lines and thereby bolster the state's economic infrastructure. Flagler was perfectly positioned to take advantage of this legislation and shortly thereafter the Florida East Coast Railroad was born. Gradually Flagler's railroad wended its way south to communities like Palm Beach and eventually to Miami. But in the back of his mind Miami was never going to be the terminus of the Florida East Coast Railroad. For Henry Flagler thought it entirely plausible that service could be extended all the way to Key West! It would be an engineering achievement of monumental proportions but Flagler's mind was already made up. In July of 1905 the official announcement was made. Critics dubbed the dubious project \\"Flagler's Folly\\". \\"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad That Crossed an Ocean\\" chronicles the planning and construction of what many at the time considered to be akin to a \\"wonder of the world\\". As you might well imagine there were countless obstacles that the engineers and project managers would need to overcome. You will also learn about the trials and tribulations of those courageous men who labored for seven long years on this tremendously challenging project. Finally, you will read the grim account of the amazing storm that virtually wiped out the Key West Extension in just a few hours. It is truly an unforgettable story!Before reading \\"Last Train To Paradise\\" I had no idea that once upon a time a train ran all the way to Key West. Out of curiosity I asked a bunch of friends and colleagues at work if they had ever heard of it and absolutely no one had. Les Standiford has succeeded in bringing to light a long forgotten and fascinating chapter in our nation's history. This is an exceptionally well written book that my managed to hold my attention from cover to cover. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Driving home from work the other day, my radio was tuned to National Public Radio, and I heard someone reading from a section of book describing the 1935 hurricane. Reaching my driveway, I sat in my car listening the harried tale of the greatest storm to hit American shores.Curiousity peaked, I ordered the book to find out more. Let me say, the two chapters about the hurricane, alone, are worth the price of the book. Well writen and captivating. It's one of those books that's hard to put down.

However, I think any lover of history and literature will find this an entertaining read. At times it reads more like novel than a historical account.Les Standiford tells the fascinating story about Henry Flagler's impropable dream to build a railroad over the ocean. Deemed \\"one of the most difficult works of railroad construction ever attempted\\" by Scientific America, Flagler, with his signature stoicism, pressed on despite numerous obstacles that threatened the project's completion. Workers encountered alligators, unrelenting mosquito swarms, and sweltering heat in an attempt to tame land and ocean for the sake of progress.The ill-fated extension survived public scrutiny and several hurricanes, but eventually succumbed to the infamous Labor Day Hurricane; when tragedy struck the Keys and effectively ended the train to paradise. Standiford's story is filled with vivid detail and profiles a man who sacrificed much of his fortune in order to see his questionable visions of engineering accomplishment come to fruition.I'll never look at St. Augustine, Key West and those last crumbling remnants of Flagler's railroad in the same way again. A solid 4.5 stars!"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This book is a brief but interesting combination of The Great Bridge and Twister. The author profiles Henry Flagler's transition in the public eye from oil robber baron to \\"fearless, frontier-busting visionary.\\" Flagler falls in love with Florida and evolves a unique business plan. He builds a railroad to undeveloped destinations, constructs a luxury hotel and then watches a city grow. This backward-seeming process works to create Daytona, Palm Beach and Miami (which in 1890 had all of 300 residents.) Flagler then decides to push one step too far by building a path to Key West.Forgotten in history is the fact that at the time, Key West had been the second largest city in Florida for half a century. Flagler reasoned that with the US takeover in Cuba and the planned Panama Canal, Key West would become the closest deep water port and a city of immense strategic importance.What follows is a brisk narrative of construction through the Everglades followed by a disaster epic in which the completed railroad is destroyed by a series of hurricanes culminating in 1935.This is an interesting profile of a man in transition from rich entrepreneur to failed visionary as well as a look back at a path in history not taken. It is unlikely that you will ever look at the drive through the Keys in the same way after reading this book."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I wanted to like this book more than I did. I had read Les Standiford's \\"Meet You in Hell\\" and I was ready for another rollicking account of the life of a robber baron. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this book. I do not mean to malign or belittle the history of this railroad. It may well have created Florida as we know it today. However, for the average reader, neither the railroad or Flagler himself may be interesting enough subject matter.At the outset, let me say that Standiford by no means slipped up when he wrote this one. His prose is easy to read. It is detailed enough to be true to the history and evocative enough to keep up one's interest. The depth of the book is similar to a two part article for a magazine such as the Atlantic Monthly. It is well written but may not have enough detail for a hard nosed railroad fan or Florida historian. The level of detail, however, for the average reader is likely adequate.The problem here is a side effect of the subject matter, not the writing. Unless you are a true train buff, the trials and tribulations of creating a railroad to Key West may not be the most intriguing story. It is a true story of the triumph of a man with a singular vision fighting--and winning for a time--against nature. But the story of the building of the railroad itself ends up following familiar patterns of devising a way to lay a difficult section of track, assembling and housing a work force, and setbacks dealt to the workers by the elements, mostly hurricanes.To spice things up, Standiford relates facts about hurricanes, personal accounts of hurricane survival stories from Flagler's time to the present, and occasional anecdotes about Flagler. There is little intrigue here concerning political obstacles and the building of the railroad. The political elements were less insurmountable than the natural elements--no one else had the wherewithal or desire to build a Key West extension, and no one else had the tenacity or interest to finance such a project. In fact, finance never seemed to be a real problem, as Flagler had more than enough assets to cover the construction and there was never any danger of running out of money.We do get some insight into Flagler himself. The problem is that compared to his fellow robber barons, Flagler could be described as temperate. Flagler may have been tenacious, driven, and confident, but he doesn't have the volatility of Frick or the flamboyance of Carnegie. Yes, there is the occasional isolated missive, but this seems to be the exception rather than the rule. While the other robber barons seem to spit cholic and bile, Flagler is downright phlegmatic. Flagler's rather sphinx like character doesn't help matters either. There are apparently few people who he confided in that left accounts of Flagler's true opinions or inner-most thoughts. He was not much of a diarist--his diary entries tell us what was happening on a given day in, perhaps, a single, telegraphic line.So if you are interested in a piece of Florida history, have a deep interest in trains, or want to know something more about hurricanes--this one is for you. It is a well written account, but I do not think it holds interest for everyone."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"If you love history, Florida, the Keys, Flagler, or just a really good, interesting book, you'll love this effort by Les Standiford.

He was incredibly wealthy but had a real appreciation for the people who worked for him. He knew what they were being asked to do the impossible. He inspired their loyalty and tenacity by insisting on treating them as fairly as possible, creating as comfortable living quarters as possibe and making sure that their other comforts were met as best as he could. I never realized how responsible he was for all of the cities on the east coast of Florida.

The same may be said of Henry Flagler's effort to develop Florida with his Standard Oil fortune. I'm pleased that I read the book.But the writing seems rushed and insufficiently researched. Some topics, such as the hurricane accounts, the construction of the columns in the ocean, and the need for a special type of cement, are covered and re-covered, to the point that reader might wish for tighter editing. Others, such as the problems acquiring rights-of-way across the islands, the alignment decisions, the work-arounds required to accommodate the Surprise Lake construction, and the decision to deny dredging permits for the proposed Key West seaport, are introduced and then forgotten. I know it can be difficult to find enough information to answer all questions and to support a level, balanced account. But it feels like the effort was particularly deficient for this book.If, like me, you know little or nothing of the Key West railroad, this is a fine place to start. If you already know the history and are now looking for a deeper comprehension, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"My list of favorite authors has just increased by one. Les Standiford has an engaging style that brings historical fact to light with the immediacy of a New York Times bestseller. His ability to imbue life into his real characters, without becoming fawning or overblown, is quite amazing. Les is what I call a \\"comfortable author\\". His use of the language is easy, unhurried and very pleasant. At times, the story is so engrossing that I forgot I was reading, and found myself experiencing the events of the Florida Keys rail project as they happened.Standiford opened my eyes to the early development of Florida, my recently adopted state. I had no idea Flagler was so driven to push ever southward, using much of his own Standard Oil fortune to build hotels and rail lines down the eastern coast of the state, providing opportunities for communities to develop. The book is very inspiring, not unlike a Frank Capra movie, and shows the best of what a man can be, using his money and success for the general good, accepting no barriers and simply pushing through all stops toward his goal.That the rail line was ultimately destroyed by a hurricane is more the fault of the available technology of the day than from a faulty idea or an overreaching dream. Flagler provided the push and finances that allowed the keys and east coast of Florida to develop. Without him, Miami and other cities simply would not be.Standiford is an excellent author who has done his research, and made his information accessible. He has an ability to report on the past in an engaging way, to educate, inspire and most importantly, to generate hope for the future. Any man or woman can rise to greater heights, as long as they have sufficient \\"push through.\\" Just 2 weesk ago I had a stroke that came out of nowhere. With Standiford's book in mind and Flagler's example, I simply refused to let it knock me down. I did not permit the doctors' and nurses' ideas of me being \\"incapacitated\\" as a barrier to getting better and re-establishing my life. With the help of the head of the ward and patient services, I was able to get myself released from a Dunedin, Florida hospital after just one week, and did not allow my body to tell me it couldn't heal. Less than 2 weeks later I\\"m walking nearly normally, thinking clearly and only have a slight droop on the left side of my mouth--and even that is improving on a daily basis.My personal thanks to you Les. You inspired me to disregard all the reasons why I \\"couldn't\\" get my life back, and now the prognosis is that I should have a full recovery of functionality in a few months. Did your book end up saving my life? I'd have to say yes. There are too few authors and artists that still see the good in men. Les Standiford is an author I would read for fun and education, and would enjoy meeting personally to be able to thank him for the work that inspired my intention to push through my difficulties. My heartfelt thanks, Les."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"The first chapter alone is worth picking up this well written account of how Key West was \\"anchored to the mainland\\", a feat I'm not sure modern day Conchs appreciate. Les Standiford sweeps you in to this whirlwind of adventure by skillfully weaving together the mystique of Ernest Hemingway, the olde town of Key West and a Category 5 Hurricane away from what could potentially have been a very boring account of a monumental building project by another stuffy old robber baron. The story telling of the life of the laborers, their ungodly work conditions and the perils they faced just to get paid a measly $1.50 a day brings the building of the railroad to life. As someone who spent several years working as an architect, my head was spinning at the Roman like way Flagler was able to dredge and fill his way down to Key West through mangroves, ancient coral reefs, a mafia of masquitos, heat exhaustion and of course, hurricanes. As a life long Floridian who has hunkered down in my share of those spirally storms, I was humbled by the chilling description of the loss of life and property in the Hurricane of 1936, which was apparently of Katrina proportions, minus the hellicopters and Superdome. This killer storm ended many lives, as well as the astronomically expensive accomplishment of a man willing to risk his reputation and fortune to continue the civilizing of Florida, the Key West Extension of the FEC Railroad. This book will give you a new found appreciation for men of vision, lax government, and bug spray. It will have you wondering about the contrast of today's world of over extensive beaurocratic control, high personal income taxes and environmental lobbies, and asking yourself, \\"how in the world do we get anything accomplished?\\" In Flagler's day, it was as simple as an understated directive to his right hand man \\"Go to Key West\\". Who could argue with that? Seven years, Flagler's millions and hundreds of lives later, his directive was finally accomplished."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is a very interesting biography of Flagler who developed Florida. It reads like a fiction.Great for any history buffs and Floridians."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Like many people who have traveled to Key West by highway, I was intrigued by the story of the railway which preceded it over its spectacular route that is more ocean than land. Remnants of the original structure parallel the road to this day, as a memorial to Henry Flagler and his ambitions. Based on the title, I picked up this volume expecting it to focus on the remarkable and sufficient subject of how this was achieved. Instead, the author devotes the first and last chapters to the destruction of this engineering marvel by the 1935 hurricane, an event that occurred 23 years after its completion. Aside from this anti-climactic sequencing, the storytelling also suffers from anachronistic comparisons to the lunar landing and European Chunnel construction. A more appropriate comparison would have been the Titanic, completed in the same year. Beginning with quotations from Shelley and Browning, the author rather heavy-handedly frames the story with the theme of the futility of man's attempts at monument-building. This is not only contrived and distracting, but ultimately unfair to Flagler, whose real legacy is the connection of Key West to mainland Florida, even if his original construction did not survive.In fact, for better or worse, most of the urban development of east coast Florida, including the city of Miami, owes its beginnings to the railways and hotels developed by Flagler. The scope of his achievements becomes even more impressive upon learning that he undertook the Key West railway project in his seventies, and lived to see its completion, after having spent most of his adult life developing the Standard Oil Company with John Rockefeller. To the author's credit, he does highlight the seeming late-life transformation of Flagler from oil robber baron to champion of Florida settlement. I was hoping to learn more details about this fascinating character. No offense to Les Standiford, but any of the existing Flagler biographies he drew from will probably be more enlightening. Also, rather than dwelling on the dramatic but unrelated tale of the 1935 hurricane's destructive force, including more contemporary accounts of the people and places involved in the railroad's construction would have made the story more cohesive as well as enhanced its human interest. The \\"floating brothel\\" was a too rare example of the stories of ordinary workers compared to the focus on upper management and the recitation of lifeless construction statistics. The foundations of a great story are here, but it lacks the \\"last spike\\" of personal narrative that would make it compelling."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"One of the great drives in America is from Miami to Key West. The scenery ranges from \\"American no-place sprawl\\" to gorgeous views of islands and spectacular vistas over the water of the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Remnants of the past remain, however, along the roadside, and glimpses of the old railway evoke a curiousity about Florida's past. This book is essential reading for anyone whose interest in this history has been sparked by a drive down the highway to the end of the line.Vivid descriptions of the 1935 hurricane which struck the Middle Keys frame this fascinating history of Florida's development. This hurricane created the demise of railroad service to and from Key West, and it stands in contrast with Standiford's fascinating account of Henry Flagler's creation of the railroad extension that once ran from Miami to Key West. Flagler emerges as a complex character, who maybe even experienced a second life after moving to Florida when he shifted away from his earlier career as a major business tycoon who established Standard Oil with Rockefeller. His new vision was to develop Florida through a chain of hotels, towns and cities, and links to the Carribean. The plan to build the railroad all the way down to Key West was regarded a Quixotic, at best, and it was dubbed \\"Flagler's Folly.\\" What Standiford shows, however, is that Flagler was a visionary entrepreneur whose dream of a railroad system along the state's eastern coast transformed the entire state. Standiford's book is an exciting account of this transformation. He not only recounts how the railroad was built at the turn of the century but he also gives readers a window into a very different era of American history. It's all the more vivid because he includes stories and descriptions from some of the living individuals who actually experienced the history that he describes."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is one history book you will not want to put down. Les Staniford has done a wonderful job of giving us a brief background on Henry Flagler and his drive to tame Florida. Mr. Flagler was the partner of John D. Rockefeller and instrumental in the formation and success of the Standard Oil Company. This driven self-made man after a very successful career of hard work did not go off to enjoy the fruits of his labors in retirement. Instead he started a second career in as a railroad man, luxury hotelier and land developer. And he did all this in a wilderness no one wanted to go too or thought could be used.Living on both the East Coast of Florida and Lower Matecumbe Key I knew quite a lot about the railroad that Mr. Flagler built over the ocean and the famous Breakers Hotel. I use too love looking at the parts of the railroad that still stood over the water and paralleled the road that now goes to key west. Of course some of the railway was actually used to build some bridges for the highway. All who live here know of the great effort needed to build this over ocean railroad and of the horrible disaster that befell its work crew. But Standiford introduced me to new material I was not aware of and very pleased to learn.The high standards and drive that we learn about in this book showed Mr. Flagler in a different light. Work was his life, but instead of just making money as he did with Standard Oil, with the Florida East Coast Railway he founded and was a driving force in building a State. I was not aware of the number of our famous cities that he caused to be developed that thrive to this day.The author entices us into watching the drive of this man as he carves out a railroad line and cities where none existed and no one would ever consider going. We even get to read where Hemingway becomes part of the railroad history at its end. This nonfiction account of the construction of the railroad that would span 150 miles of ocean and terminate in Key West will be very hard to put down. So be prepared to read the entire book!"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I've always loved biographies, and history, and my husband loves trains and history, so this is a book we both enjoyed. It's fascinating to know about the source of all the things in Florida with the \\"Flagler\\" name on them.It's well written and informative, as well as educational and entertaining, what more could you ask of a book? We're actually buying the author's book on Carnegie next, it looks interesting.The book follows building a railroad across the keys, even though everyone said it was impossible and three hurricanes hit areas under construction and slowed things down, and finally a huge fourth hurricane wiped it all out.The early part of the books tells about Flagler and his rise in the railroad industry and the hotels and resorts he built along the way, turning Florida into a tourism magnet. The last chapter sums up Flagler's determination through all the ridicule (they called it \\"Flagler's Folly\\") and his success at the project. He died four years after it was completed and it ran for many years after, so he never knew it ultimately failed and was replaced by the overseas highway. For a time it was called the \\"eighth wonder of the world\\" and was considered a marvel of engineering.So Flagler was sort of a modern day Ozymandias. It's a good read, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This book is a very well written account of the \\"train to nowhere\\", a railroad build from Miami to Key West, Florida. The railroad itself was destroyed in a hurricane in 1935, but it remains as a superb engineering achievement of the 20th century.The author has a clean narrative style that envelops the reader in the story, including lots of background details about the people and events involved. He also includes interesting side notes about famous people, notably Ernest Hemmingway. This book is not just about the railroad, but also about the times, and covers very interesting material about the Standard Oil Company. As a former resident of Homestead, Florida, I found the descriptions of the local area and conditions to be exactly accurate. The author has obviously been to the locations he is describing.The book is utterly fascinating, and excellent reading. As would be expected for this type of book, this work is acceptable for readers of all ages, although children would not find it very interesting.Highly recommended for those interested in railroads, engineering in the early 20th century, and south Florida."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Les Standiford writes clearly about his given topic, and without injecting himself too far into the story. (Some popular historians cannot help but proselytize.) The book moves along fairly quickly, and chapters tend to be short, so the book is easy to read in spare moments -- and yet, the text is not rushed and you get a feeling of detail from what he gives you.The book reads much like a novel, but perhaps that's because the author has ten novels to his credit. In any case, Standiford doesn't get you so hung up on names and dates that you lose track of the narrative of the book.The paperback features two sections of photographs printed on glossy paper. There are portraits, views of the railroad being built, a view of the train pulling into Key West, and scenes of hurricane damage. There is also a photo of a corpse that was pulled from the water, and a row of corpses (covered by sheets, although you see their feet) awaiting transport to a burial place. Although the images are graphic, they are not gory.Standiford notes in his brief introduction that \\"No one today would undertake what Flagler did, not in this bottom-line world.\\" That's kind of sad, really. Perhaps it is this pursuit of the impossible dream that makes the subject of this book intriguing, but what kept me reading was the down-to-earth narrative of how Flagler accomplished his goal. Once hounded by bureaucrats as a \\"robber baron,\\" Flagler comes across as neither a sinner nor a saint, but a complex individual with an eye to the future.Standiford weaves the story of Flagler along with an outline story of his own trip through the keys. He gives some details of what the Keys are like today, and how they've changed since Flagler's time. He introduces some text by a present-day author, who mentions Surprise Lake in a novel (this lake is talked about in the book). But despite the additional information, it's not at all confusing; Standiford is in control of the narrative and any detour from the main story is brief but informative."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"The book was fascinating and in great shape.

Fewer know the name \\"John D. Rockefeller,\\" the nineteenth century paterfamilias of the clan, who rose from an obscure grain merchant to the head of the mightiest of American corporations, Standard Oil (today's Exxon Mobil). Even fewer know that although John D. Rockefeller was the public face of Standard Oil, Rockefeller had a partner who kept the books and managed the backroom deals, and may, in fact, have been more responsible for Standard Oil's financial success than Rockefeller himself. That man was named Henry Morison Flagler, and his name is hardly a household word, hardly even in South Florida where people have at least heard the name.By the time Flagler was fifty five, he was one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a deserved reputation as a cutthroat robber baron, and had been investigated by Congress and denigrated in the press for his greed. Yet, at fifty five, the trajectory of Henry Flagler's life changed completely. In an attempt to ease his first wife's chronic asthma, he left his sprawling Westchester County (NY), estate, bizarrely called \\"Satan's Toe,\\" and came to St. Augustine, Florida, America's oldest city, where the perpetual summer of Florida eased her breathing. It was when Flagler saw his first palm tree that the stoic business tycoon's heart thawed. He fell in love with Florida passionately, the way some men fall in love with women. He built a house in St. Augustine, laid a railroad, and then built a resort hotel for his friends and associates so they too could enjoy Florida. Captivated by the countryside, Flagler traveled down the coast until he found what he deemed to be paradise---and in his own private Xanadu this Kublai Khan a stately pleasure dome decreed.That pleasure dome still stands. It is called Palm Beach, now one of the wealthiest cities in America. And here too, Flagler stretched the railroad and built a resort hotel, the massive Breakers, still one of the nation's most imposing hotels.Author Les Standiford says that when Flagler built Palm Beach he also created the class structure of Florida, for the rough service camp of the workers who actually built Palm Beach lay 500 yards across Lake Worth, and later became known as West Palm Beach. And until 2000, West Palm Beach was the exact opposite of glittering Palm Beach, a ramshackle city, hardly fit to be the County Seat of the largest and wealthiest of Florida's 67 counties. In 2000, a local West Palm Beach judge, later known as \\"Hanging Chad,\\" gave the Presidential election to George W. Bush, who rewarded West Palm Beach with a blank check urban renewal grant. The shanties along the railroad tracks vanished, and a city of boutique shops, fine restaurants, and recreation venues replaced them, seemingly overnight, despite a flailing economy and a post-9/11 numbness which still lingers. Now, West Palm Beach, though still the poorer relation, has moved from the room over the toolshed into the guesthouse. (Standiford's book came along too early to record this amazing transformation. The book also predates the building of the new Jewfish Creek Bridge in 2008, a flyover which has allowed the area around it to be restored ecologically).Having built Xanadu, Flagler looked around for more worlds to conquer. Rather than going West, he went South, giving a rail connection to sleepy Fort Lauderdale. Further to the South, an enterprising woman named Julia Tuttle, who owned most of the land around an old frontier post named Fort Dallas, traded her land to Flagler for a rail line and urban improvements. The grateful citizens of Fort Dallas vowed to rename their tiny town \\"Flagler\\" after their benefactor, but Flagler modestly insisted that the city be named for the local native American tribe who'd lived along their namesake Miami River.Having reached Miami, Flagler saw no reason to stop building. At that time, the late nineteenth century, Key West, on faraway Bone Island, was the largest city in Florida, a strange outlier where smugglers, South American insurrectos on the lam, and pirates lived cheek-by-jowl with cigar manufacturers, fishermen, artisans, and artists. And though Bone Island lay about 125 miles across mostly open water dotted by small points of coral and populated by a hardy and independent folk who called themselves Conchs (pronounced \\"Konk\\"), Flagler imagined steel rails leaping over the ocean to connect Key West to the mainland.It was a time of giant dreams. In Great Britain, Ismay and Harland & Wolff were blueprinting a trio of ships to be called the \\"Olympic,\\" \\"Gigantic,\\" and \\"Titanic.\\" The Panama Canal was a-building, and Flagler imagined that Canal transshipments would use bustling Key West as their main port if only items could be easily moved up the line. Havana, too, could be linked to Key West by a twice-daily steamer so the exotic tropical fruits of Cuba could be delivered by rail to New York in 48 hours.In many ways, the building of Flagler's railroad across the sea as recounted here echoes David McCullough'sThe Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870-1914. Both construction projects took place almost simultaneously and faced similar hurdles. Much of the right-of-way for Flagler's train line had to be laboriously hacked out of mangrove swamp jungle and sawgrass wilderness, a Carboniferous Era world that was teeming with billions of malarial mosquitoes, scorpions, wolf spiders, and natural gas spouts, punctuated by Mesozoic Era alligators and snakes, a world where man did not belong and few men had ever ventured. Flagler's surveyor, William Krome, was nearly lost trying to chart a path through mainland Monroe County (an area bigger than Rhode Island with a population numbered just around one hundred even today). And even when a path was found, the unexpected kept happening (Lake Surprise was named for a very simple reason).But where the builders of the Panama Canal were attempting to join two bodies of water, the builders of the railroad were trying to join two bodies of land. The Florida Keys stretch in a languorous arc southwestward away from the mainland. There are hundreds of Keys, the remnant outcroppings of a long-extinct coral reef. The main arc is made up of perhaps three score larger islands, separated in places by channels narrow enough to jump across, and in other places by gaps as wide as seven miles. The Keys have almost no natural fresh water sources, some were covered completely in jungle, and others were practically deserts surrounded by a turquoise sea. All supplies had to be brought in by rail and boat, and new bridgebuilding techniques devised on the fly. Seven Mile Bridge is a wonder, for at its midpoint one might as well be in midocean; no land is visible, except a tiny key or two paralleling the road.Les Standiford, a Florida author of some repute, handles his subject well overall, though LAST TRAIN TO PARADISE is a \\"small\\" book, the kind of book one finds classed under \\"Local Interest\\" rather than \\"History,\\" a book full of little factoids in the text, such as how Marathon, Florida got its name, or the fact that the old abbreviation for Florida, \\"FLA\\" was said to be an abbreviation for \\"Flagler\\" as well, since the two were so closely bound together. Les Standiford does make one off-note observation: Like the Canal, many of the men who built the railroad were blacks, either Islanders or African-Americans. Standiford makes the remark that the hard work and heat conditions were surprisingly hard on the descendants of those who'd been slaves, as though immunity to rough conditions should have somehow been genetic in these men. I disliked that comment very much. McCullough spends a good deal of time detailing the daily working lives of the men, including their accommodations, food, and recreation. So does Standiford, right down to the officially invisible floating bawdy houses that lay moored offshore of the Keys (and Panama, too, for that matter; it's quite likely that some of the same men worked both projects and shared the company of some of the same ladies in both locales). While Standiford is no David McCullough, he does well enough in describing the brutal conditions under which the men worked, and their triumphs and setbacks.For there were setbacks. While the Panama Canal had massive landslides in the Culebra Cut that swallowed work camps full of men whole, and then required duplicating the work of digging out amidst the corpses of the unlucky, the railroad faced hurricanes that did the same, and required the same rebuilding of the line under the same duress. Oddly enough, the hurricanes of 1906 and 1908 both struck the line at its point of furthest progress, hurling building supplies (and men) into the ocean and testing (and damaging) the areas just under construction. Much had to be replaced and rebuilt and made stronger, but as time passed, it was time that became the great enemy, for the aging and ailing Flagler wished to ride his rail into Key West before he died.Flagler got his wish in January of 1912, but his vision of Key West as America's major southern port never came true. Mobile and Tampa and especially New Orleans became the great harbors of the Southern Tier. Key West, crammed onto its tiny isle, had no place to grow. As a result, Flagler's East Coast Railway never carried the freight it might have, and went into receivership some years after his death in 1913. Still, it was a popular rail line for tourists who as of a winter's day, as it was said, could board the train in a snowbound New York and wake up in the tropics two days later with a view of nothing but blue sky, white clouds, and a bluegreen sea framed by palm trees.This idyllic adventure remained available until Labor Day 1935, when the most powerful hurricane ever to hit the United States tore through the Upper Middle Keys packing winds of over 200 miles per hour. The barometer dropped as low as and probably lower than 26.35. Keys residents and visitors unfortunate enough to be caught by the storm (which had not been forecast) were killed in the hundreds. Bodies of residents were found 40 miles from their homes, having been carried there on the winds. Twenty years later, three cars belonging to long-missing tourists were unearthed with their skeletonized occupants still inside. The storm unleashed a tsunami estimated to have been anywhere from 20 feet to 40 feet in height that washed away all the trackbed in the Middle Keys and derailed the cars of the rescue train sent to save who could be saved (the engine, weighing in at over 300,000 pounds withstood the wall of water without toppling over).The keening winds sounded a tocsin for the FECRR. Without assets to rebuild, the railroad sold its rights to the State of Florida which built the Overseas Highway to Key West. Nowadays, it is just a few hours drive between Palm Beach and Key West, though a cautious driver who keeps his eyes on the road misses much of the grandeur of the trip. Built in places atop the rail line and in places parallel to it, the Overseas Highway overlooks the gallant ruins of \\"Flagler's Folly,\\" which still stand as if daring the human soul to envision the impossible and make it real."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Interesting and entertaining.

Two years later, the Panama Canal would open. Also in 1912, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) would be completed; the railroad that crossed an ocean. It was a time for mankind to reach to new heights of how they could control the world around them. The Key West Extension, developed by industrialist Henry Flagler, was called the Eighth Wonder of the World, but before it was started, and probably even after its completion, it was called Flagler's Folly.Did Flagler truly know, but hide that fact, that the Key West Extension would never be profitable? Was it folly for a man who could afford it, and entering a new phase in life, to contribute an amazing achievement to the world? Was it folly to pursue a goal in the betterment of the people of Florida?Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Oceanexamines these issues.I have been a resident of Florida for nearly twelve years. I hear the trains run on the FEC less than a mile away from my house. My small town of Rockledge (mentioned in the book) was once the southern terminus of FEC. St. Augustine is one of the places enjoyed the most by me and my wife. Henry Flagler clearly left his mark on that town, but previously I had been more interested in the 16th century Spanish history of the city. The name of Henry Flagler is seen and heard all up and down the east coast of Florida. I am also related to a number of railroad fanatics (including my two-year-old son) and had recently become curious about this railroad that used to have a major stop nearby. So when Amazon Vine offered a change to review Last Train to Paradise, I jumped at it to learn more about the railroad. I ended up learning a lot, however, about the development of the state of Florida for before Henry Flagler began to run the FEC down the east coast, Florida was a wild and sparsely populated land. Ask anyone to name cities in Florida, and several will no doubt have been largely developed by Flagler; Daytona, Palm Beach and Miami.Although this book briefly discusses the overall history of the FEC and the life of Flagler, it focuses primarily on the construction of the Overseas Railway to Key West, or the Key West Extension. Books that seem to be regarded for their history of the FEC areFlorida East Coast Railway (FL) (Images of Rail)andSpeedway to Sunshine: The Story of the Florida East Coast Railway, both by Seth Bramson, official historian of the FEC. Well-known books focusing on the Key West Extension areThe Florida Keys Overseas Railwayby Warren Zeiller,Florida's Great Ocean Railway: Building the Key West Extensionby Dan Gallagher andThe Railroad That Died at Sea: The Florida East Coast's Key West Extensionby Pat Parks (at 48 pages, more of a booklet). I wish I could compare these books withLast Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean, but have not yet read them. However, Last Train to Paradise has whet my appetite for more information, and I am trying to get my father-in-law to give up his copy of Speedway to Sunshine (The \\"speedway\\" in this case does not refer to the racetrack in Daytona, but to the railroad itself.) This book follows the history of the extension through its death blow by the Labor Day hurricane of 1935 and the drama of the rescue train that had been sent to evacuate road workers.Last Train to Paradise was really a book that was difficult to put down. I started after dinner on a Thursday and finished reading it before lunch on Saturday. I don't believe I'm a particularly fast reader, and didn't really have that much time to devote to it. Les Standiford's writing experience seems to have been more toward novels, and perhaps his ability to tell a story brings this real story to life. However, I don't have reason to doubt the historical accuracy of the account. The book contains 16 glossy pages of black and white photographs. The author also provides a bibliography, but explains that he did not consider this book to be a traditional historical text, so purposely avoided the use of footnotes.In short, I highly recommend this book. The book also contained an excerpt from Standiford's other historical book, Meet You In Hell, about the lives of Andrew Carnegie and Henry Frick. Since as I child I went to the Carnegie library and museum, and played in the playground a Frick Park, I may have to pick up this book, too."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Before there was the Overseas Highway through the Florida Keys, there was the Overseas Railway. This railroad represents the vision of Henry Flagler, who made his fortune working with Rockefeller at Standard Oil before he decided to build an empire of luxury hotels and railroads in Florida.This book tells the story of the last 150 miles of that railroad, from Homestead through the Keys to Key West. It includes the stories of two hurricanes that interrupted construction, and a final massive hurricane that destroyed the railroad.Standiford writes very well - - he's a novelist, and he knows how to tell a story. He isn't a historian, and you'll be disappointed if you want a full history from this book. You'll also be disappointed if you want larger contexts. By the time of its destruction in the 1930s, railroads was losing their battle with the automobile, but you won't get that broader perspective from this book. Nor will you get a critical view of Flagler's role in popularizing Florida and helping start the excess development and environmental destruction that characterizes most of the state.Standiford wants to write about a hero (Flagler) and a tragedy (destruction of the hero's Great Work by Nature), and that's what he wrote. It's a good yarn."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Because I've spent a lot of time in Florida,because of work,I'd seen the Flagler name all over the place and always wondered about him and why he seemed so important. I was very curious and was interested to read this book and I'm glad I got the chance.Henry Flagler was an amazing old school builder that did what was considered impossible and built a railroad linking the Florida Keys at the beginning of the last century and it is one amazing story,it was difficult to put this book down.All of this incredible work was destroyed 22 yrs later by a hurricane on Labor Day 1935 and the story of all this is captured in a mesmerizing tale told by Les Standiford and is well worth your time in reading this book. It's one of the great ones!"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Most American children grow up hearing stories about the great engineering projects such as the Hoover dam, the Panama Canal, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the transcontinental railroad. Unfortunately, until I read this book, I had never heard the full story of the construction of the Key West Railroad. In many ways, it is one of the most challenging engineering projects ever done.It is difficult for the modern reader to understand how little was known about swampy south Florida at the end of the nineteenth century. There is no better example of this than the aptly named Lake Surprise in the southern end of the state. It acquired that name when a survey team trying to determine the route for the railroad to take from Miami to Key Largo was surprised when they encountered a lake. The project was so monumental that after it was finished there was the belief that the railroad bed was blocking the flow of water between that Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico and dramatically altering the climate of Great Britain.The railroad was the brainchild of Henry Flagler, who made his fortune with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Company. No less a personality than Rockefeller himself gave Flagler the credit for making the business decisions that made Standard Oil such a success.This account of Flagler's life, how he acquired this vision and what became of it is a gripping one, it goes back to a time when some people really thought big when it came to building things. While there was the possibility of a large amount of freight being moved from Key West up the east coast of Florida, Flagler was talented enough in the area of business to understand that major profits were not likely. Yet he forged ahead and was able to take a railroad trip all the way to Key West before he died.Another major and educational point about the book is the can-do attitude if the engineers who solved the major physical hurdles of the project. They said that it could be done and then went about inventing the techniques used to build the railroad. At some points, the bridges had to be miles in length and even when there was land, there wasn't much of it.Unfortunately, the most powerful hurricane to ever make landfall in the United States destroyed a great deal of the railroad in 1935 and it was never rebuilt. In the past two decades, the United States has experienced the fury of Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, where both left incredible devastation. Yet, weather historians have been able to reach the conclusion that the hurricane of 1935 was significantly more powerful than either of them. The accounts of people having boards driven through their bodies and being tossed around by winds of over 200 miles per hour give one pause at the power of the storm.There is a clich&eacute; that the most unusual of nonfiction would be considered the most unrealistic of fiction if it could possibly be denied. This is such an example, a railroad was built where none was thought possible and it was destroyed by a storm with power that no one thought possible. Henry Flagler was eccentric, brilliant, imaginative and stubborn and this is the amazing story of what happened when he told his engineers, \\"Build it.\\""},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Lest we forget..........Something I say quite often to the younger generations today about our history, World history, engineering achievements that changed the World, amazing entrepenuers and free thinkers, genius men and women, and visionaries.Even with the limitless information online and amazing multimedia available however, history remains pretty \\"boring\\" for todays \\"I want it now\\", youtube, guitar hero generation.Les Standiford makes it better, easier, and enjoyable.With an impressive list of acclaimed publications to his credit, he is a novelist in the truest sense. I'm quite happy to wade through encyclopedia's and online and read with interest about Henry Morrison Flagler, and what was coinsidered the \\"8th Wonder of the World\\" the railway that joined the Florida Keys to the Mainland, but it is intensive and laborious if you have no love of history.The story here is light and vibrant, almost punchy in it's narrative as you learn about the man who conquered nature, only to be KO'd on the return match, when a Hurricane heavily damaged and partially destroyed the line in 1935. Interestingly 5 hurricanes threatened to halt production completely during the 7 year construction, but the first train arrived on time at Key West on January 22nd 1912.The story reads a little like a \\"ripping yarn\\" and you'll enjoy it so much you forgot that the things you are reading about actually happened.5 stars, and a well done for making history fun!"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"One of the first things I came across was all the praise surrounding this book. On the back of the cover and inside as well are many accounts of praise from notable figures and newspapers. What caught my eye was Donald Trump's words, \\"A fascinating and incredibly compelling account...I could not put it down.\\" Not that a man can't read what he wants, but I found it interesting that Donald was fascinated by this book centered on a railroad.Praise is much deserved for Les Standiford's Last Train to Paradise. It's not just about the construction and destruction of the Key West Railroad - it's about Henry Flagler and his noble uprising, hurricanes, and the Keys generally speaking. With nonfiction works you don't always get the \\"novel\\" flow, but Standiford's vocabulary and storytelling makes this a comfortable read. Railroading doesn't make the book what it is; I would still be intrigued if it were about a bridge, skyscraper, etc."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"It is both humbling and energizing when one first learns of a subject who had an enormous impact on our country's brief history. The name \\"Henry Flagler\\" meant nothing to me two days ago, yet the hours I spent flying through this novel, interspersed with countless trips to Wikipedia for further investigation, have introduced me to a man who was as an important figure in the post-Civil War U.S. as there ever was. The co-founder of Standard Oil (the other person you may have heard of: John D. Rockefeller) took his enormous wealth and did his part of the secular \\"Manifest Destiny\\" of the time period. A lesson to future tycoons--if you want to preserve your name for the ages, become a philanthropist, not a developer.The majority of the book is dedicated to history of the enormous, implausible at the time, task of building a railroad that traversed the Florida Keys all the way to the southern terminus of the U.S., Key West. This is full of engineering feats and descriptions such as:\\"Once the alternating series of links had completely cured, the builders would go back and fill in the remaining gaps in the chain, thereby ensuring that the structure could not twist or weaken itself as it dried, and avoiding any interwoven stresses that could weaken the entire chain.\\"Since the title of the book offers no ambiguity, it is not a spoiler to mention that the book ends with the nature's cruel destruction of the great structure.As we potentially enter a new wave of infrastructure spending, alongside a revamped regulation of monopolistic entities, it is worth noting how much Florida benefited--to the extent that it may not be what it is today without such--from the efforts and funds of this man of the Standard Oil Trust. It is highly likely that Mr. Flagler would have become the \\"Father of Florida\\" if he were to have faced competition and regulation resulting from the oversight and laws of governments. However, everything suggests Mr. Flagler approached this second wave of his life with a desire to \\"build something\\" rather than increase personal wealth.There are themes throughout the novel that will appeal to readers (who enjoy nonfiction) of all stripes. The cost-per-day of this book is on the high end, as you will fly through its pages (which, in my opinion, is quite alright).It is perhaps fitting that a man, who according to his friends, rarely read history due to his preference for the present and future, would have such a profound effect on our country's (and, especially, Florida's) development and, yet, be sounbeknownst to later generations."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I found \\"Last Train to Paradise\\" a fascinating story. The story is about oilman Henry Flagler's fulfilled dream to build a railroad across the Gulf of Mexico from Key West to the Florida mainland. I never even knew such a railroad existed. Flagler's dream lasted 22 years until the 1935 \\"Storm of the Century\\". I found the book to be fast moving and well written. I enjoyed the railroad and storm portions of the book more than Flagler's history. The book left me wanting more photos of the railroad during its heyday too.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"There's both good and bad to this book.First, the good:1) The story is fascinating. I spent a few years living in Florida, and was already a little bit familiar with Flagler's railroad and the 1935 hurricane, but the author rounds out my collection of antidotes with the full story behind them.2) The author writes in a clear, simple style that keeps you interestedThe bad:1) There's not enough depth. Now I want the full story! This, like others have mentioned, reads more like a magazine story than a definitive account of history.2) The photos! They are too small, and too lacking in detail. Surely there are more and surely they could be printed just one to a page, not two or three.

What I got was an engaging narrative of a man's love affair with Florida and his great dream of running a railroad across the sea. For those unfamiliar with the story but planning on visiting southeast Florida - Pick up this book! It will make you appreciate your visit even more.This book is extremely readable. I will confess, I am a terribly slow reader but I burned through this book in two days. I literally could not put it down from the time I opened it. The author's style and ability to tell a wonderful story keeps the pages turning.If this book were to have any short-falling it would be that it suffers from a little historical-centrism. In the same way that every Civil War battlefield park ranger calls their battle the bloodiest of the war, the author seems to hyperbolize the project a little. But he does a great job of setting the historic period it occurred in. I'm sure the railway seemed to be an engineering miracle at the time, but looking back the true story is the personalities behind the project. And this story is full of tragic, triumphant and sacrificing personalities.The book is a little older now and the one thing that seems dated is that the historical hurricanes are all compared to Hurricane Andrew. After the last three years, it seems impossible that a hurricane would be compared to anything but Katrina. The author does an amazing job of describing the horrors and realities of hurricanes in the keys.I can't say it strongly enough, if you are heading for the keys get this book."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"\\"Last Train to Paradise\\" is a nonfiction account of the construction of the railroad connecting Key West to the Florida mainland, a project headed by Henry Flagler.It is a well-researched and documented history of an exciting time in the exploration and development of Florida that reads like a novel.Building a railroad over 150 miles of water under the harshest of conditions was the vision of one man, Henry Flagler. Mr. Flagler used his personal fortune to make this dream come true.When he first arrived in Florida he was the second wealthiest man in the country. His fortune was made in partnership with John Rockefeller and the creation of Standard Oil.The ingenuity necessary to accomplish this task is absolutely incredible. The obstacles overcome included the brutal weather (heat and hurricanes), having to import every item from drinking water to food to nails.As I read the story I found the task more impossible with each accomplishment along the way. The closer they got to their objective, the more unattainable I thought the goal was. They truly did the impossible.That Mr. Flagler and his crew succeeded is a testament to the pioneer spirit of America.Dr. Standiford has written a fast paced book. He is a wonderful story teller. It is where truth and fact is so improbable, that one could not make up a superior fictional account.The photographs are a wonderful addition.With all the scandals in business today, it is enlightening to read the story of a man who put his reputation and own money on the line for what he believed in.As Dr. Standiford said: \\"Henry Flagler evolved from acquisitive robber baron to creator.\\"Henry Flagler may not have discovered Florida, but he saw all the state's possibilities and created the framework and infrastructure that made Florida livable."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Les Standiford has put together a spell-binding tale of the last of the privately financed infrastructure projects undertaken by the larger than life 19th century businessmen. Here Henry Flagler races against his own mortality to complete a railroad from Jacksonville to Key West, with the final run south from Miami requiring herculean engineering, management, and financial resources. Flager was a partner of John D. Rockefeller in an earlier venture known as Standard Oil who decided in his 70's to pursue a second career in railroading, land development, and luxury hotels in the then desolate country of South Florida and the Keys.Standiford weaves together Flagler, Rockefeller, their arch-rival trust-busting Teddy Roosevelt, WWI bonus armies, and big-game hunting author Ernest Hemingway. While Rockefeller also owned vacation homes in Florida, he and Flagler ultimately had a parting of the ways, with Rockefeller pointedly not attending Flagler's funeral. Flagler had been an early supporter of Roosevelt in his successful bid for the New York governorship after Roosevelt's success in the brief Spanish American war. Later Roosevelt brought antitrust action against Standard Oil and at least in Flagler's mind was behind government resistance to his plan to build a deep water harbor in Miami. Ironically, the US victory in the Spanish American War, together with confirmed plans to build the Panama Canal, were the motiviation for Flagler's railroad adventures, as Flagler projected, incorrectly as it turned out, that Miami and Key West would grow in stature as ports.The final thread introduces Hemingway into the mix. The author was already a well-known Key Wester when the hurricane of Labor Day 1935 ravaged the Keys. Although Hemingway's home and his beloved boat Pilar were not seriously damaged, Flagler's railroad was destroyed. A group of WWI bonus army veterans were working on road construction. Many were killed, despite a daring railroad rescue attempt. By 1935, Flager was long dead and the railroad was in bankruptcy. It was never rebuilt, although some bridges are still standing, for the exclusive use of fishermen and birds."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I loved this book. Standiford is a tremendous storyteller, as good as Sebastian Junger, or David McCullough. The rise and fall of the Key West railroad, which was built over 150 miles of water by tycoon Henry Flagler, is a story I knew little about. Great fun and I learned a tremendous amount as well. One warning--be prepared to go to work a little bleary-eyed tomorrow--you won't be able to put this down until the last hurricane has hit..."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Having made the drive from Miami to Key West a couple of times, I've been curious about the abandoned bridges that you see all the way down the Keys. When someone recommended this book to me I was excited to learn how those bridges got there - which I did - but I learned a lot more too.Henry Flagler, who made his fortune as Rockefeller's early partner at Standard Oil, spent that fortune as the pioneering developer of the East Coast of Florida. One of the most fascinating things you learn in this book is just how late in US history the development of Florida came about. As recently as the 1890s, Miami was just a small outpost called Fort Dallas that was reachable only by a trip of train, then boat, then horse-drawn carriage. In the 1890s!At the same time, Key West was the most populous city in Florida with 20,000 inhabitants and a thriving economy. Flagler imagined that Key West would become the most important deep-water port on the East Coast with the completion of the Panama Canal and that his railroad would carry all of that freight to the continental US. It never happened, and by the time contruction was halfway done Flagler knew it was incredibly unlikely, but by that time he was committed to \\"ride his own steel to Key West before he died.\\"All of that is part and parcel to this story of man against nature in a manner that just can't happen in today's era of heightened environmental awareness (I guess we shouldn't block the flow of the Gulf Stream after all). In the end, all is undone by the biggest Gulf storm in recorded history, the Labor Day storm of 1935.A great read for any fan of history or anyone who is interested in the Keys or Florida."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Ten years ago, when I visited Palm Beach, Florida, I noticed a lot of places named after someone called Flagler. At the time I had no idea who this person was, or why everything in the area seemed focused upon him, but after reading this book, I understand. It's pretty clear that, without Henry Flagler's vision, and money, Florida today might be an entirely different place. This man, almost singlehandedly, changed Florida from a hot, sleepy area into a mecca for tourists. His building of luxury hotels, the Florida East Coast Railway, and later the Key West Expansion, gave us our modern state. This story is extremely interesting, and I found it well-written. It tells something I did not know before, and that's always important to me when I read any non-fiction work. It's a tale of insight, struggle, ultimate success, and subsequent destruction by the forces of an all-powerful natural storm. Men such as Henry Flagler do not walk among us any longer, and perhaps we are all the poorer for that."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Henry Morrison Flagler, multimillioniaire and second richest man in the world (John. D. Rockefeller being the first), came to Jacksonville, FL with his first wife, to help her recover from bronchitis, a chronic condition which plagued her in Long Island, New York, their home up north. First, he fell in love with Florida, and second, his businessman's acumen took over ... he saw opportunity where others only saw a wilderness. He built the first railroad traversing across Florida from Jacksonville to Miami. He built the \\"eighth wonder of the world\\" ... many bridges across the Florida Keys, across miles of water, connecting the southern most point in the United States with the mainland. He opened south Florida as a resort to the wealthy by building hotels in St. Augustine and Palm Beach. And when he visited the bustling port of Key West, the closest link to the Caribbean and South America, he got the brilliant idea to build a railroad from what is now Homestead, FL to Key West which at the time was the largest city and busiest port in Florida. Initially, he was ridiculed, he was criticized, he could not even get investors to put their money into the project. As the ultimate risk-taker, he used up his own savings, approximately 28 - 30 million dollars to make his dream, his vision for the future come true. He left a legacy in Florida which will not be forgotten But there was a steep cost ... not just in money ... but in men's lives.Henry Morrison Flagler did his market research. He determined that for economic reasons Florida was ripe for development. It had huge tracts ready for orchard farmers to grow tropical fruit to transport to the rest of the USA. The cites of Jacksonville, St. Augustine, and Miami benefited from the golden touch of Flagler ... he built hotels for himself and his wealthy friends which included the finest amenities of his day. The wealthy flocked to the pristine white beaches and newly built golf courses. They viewed the beautiful sunsets and heard the waves crashing on shore ... but they would *not* risk their money on Flagler's vision. Flagler's project needed capital and also labor. He hired the best trained bridge-building engineers and project managers, men who relished his vision and the supreme challenge of a lifetime.In this book, we learn how men were recruited from all the major cities of the USA and many from Europe (primarily Italy and Spain) and the Caribbean islands (specifically, the Cayman Islands) to do the back-breaking labor in the hot tropical climate of Florida amidst mosquitoes and slimy boggy waters ... but the most menacing threat was not even recognized until it struck unexpectedly and with deadly force ... the hurricane. The camps were destroyed, men lost their lives, bodies and body parts were hurdled with abandon, and men simply disappeared under water, swallowed up by the ocean. Yet, the \\"conchs\\" (as people living on the Florida Keys were called) recovered despite the devastation. Even with huge losses of money and lives, Henry Flagler pursued his dream until it became reality. After nearly going into debt and with failing eyesight and poor health, Henry Morrison Flagler lived to view the monument he thought would last beyond his lifetime ... a living legacy for all Floridians ... a railroad connecting all the Florida Keys to the mainland. Sadly, the railroad only lasted about 22 years before progress took a different turn ... automobiles were gaining popularity and a highway was built. However to his credit, the bridges he built were of such superior quality (some still stand today) they were used for the infrastructure of the highway. This book is a testimony to the man, the times, and his vision ... it is a magnificent opus which is highly worth reading. It is an adventure story that also includes some surprisingly spicy romance (after his first wife died, Flagler had two other wives each about 35 years younger than himself). Most importantly, the book includes descriptions of 'man against nature' with harrowing details that cause ripples of uneasy sensations to crawl on one's skin ... Having lived through *four* hurricanes in 2004, two disastrous ones named Charley and Ivan, this reader appreciates and respects the forces of nature. This is one book I could not put down until the very end. It leaves me wanting to know more about Henry Morrison Flagler, the man, the millionaire, the visionary railroad entrepeneur.

How can a book on a subject about which so many others have been written, justify its existence?By rising above all of the rest, either in style or content.By telling previously unknown facts: a recent shocking disclosure perhaps.Or by being the first book to introduce the reader to the subject.I had read nothing of the FEC until I came across Mr. Standiford's book, unfortunately, my feeling throughout and upon finishing the book was a desire to know more. This book is ambitious but reads as if not quite certain as to its purpose: is it a biography of FEC visionary and Florida pioneer Henry Flagler? A history of the development of Florida? The story of the FEC extension? A telling of the great Labor Day Hurricane? All of the above? As a result, the overall experience suffers.With rather limited selection of photographs and perhaps a tendency to choose the most dramatic of moments from the project, I found my mind wandering repeatedly through the somewhat contrived narrative. While there is ample detail of many of the highlights of the project, I was never drawn in with a feeling of what it must have been like to even have been alive at a time like that, much less conceptualize such an mind-boggling project.The stylization and dramatization of events for which the author was not present is a challenging technique, makes for good reading for many, but is entirely too subjective for me and seems to have been difficult to maintain throughout the entire volume. While I came away feeling hungry and slightly unsatisfied, for many this book may be an excellent and entertaining rendition of the great project."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is a good book if you love Florida history as much as I do. The first chapter is especially fine and very dramatic, with the old 447 chugging down the line in the middle of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane with 200 plus mph winds, a movie all by itself! Its bogs down a little in later chapters only because of its historical accuracy, ie. details about building the bridges across the open water, etc. My only other criticism is it lumps Flagler's personal life in one chapter and then you have to keep going back to see whats happening with Flagler personally (eg. his problems with Ida Shroud who went insane) while the railroad is being built.

His Florida East Coast Railroad from Jacksonville to Miami and then to Key West was the catalyst in changing Florida from a sub-tropical, thinly settled frontier to a fast-growing state. Standiford is generally clear and readable in describing the incredible determination of Flagler and the extraordinary skill and hard work of the engineers and laborers who brought his dream to fruition.Yet I came away vaguely dissatisfied. The actual facts should have resulted in a couldn't-put-it-down narrative. It didn't. The photos were good, but more of them would have been a big plus. And, finally, Standiford made such an egregiously inaccurate statement about 1992's Hurricane Andrew that I inevitably came to question the other &quot;facts&quot; in his tale. Specifically, he said of Andrew on p.122: &quot;Residents of Coral Gables... experienced heavy rains and wind gusts that felled tree limbs, the sort of weather most people associate with a strong summer thunderstorm. It was the sort of day to stow the lawn chairs in the garage and have a drink or two inside, feeling cozy while the rain spattered the windows.&quot; How can Standiford, a resident himself of Miami, not know that the National Hurricane Center, then located in the heart of Coral Gables (and about a half mile from where I lived) recorded winds as high as 167 mph - before the hurricane blew away its wind gauge? Coral Gables residents did not calmly sip drinks that night, they cowered in fear as huge banyans and other trees fell left and right and roof tiles - or roofs themselves - blew away. If he is that careless/inaccurate about an event in his own experience, can his account of events a century ago be trusted?"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"The author of this book had an idea that, in its way, is as good as the subject that the book covers. But it's a shame that the author didn't execute his idea nearly as well. It's an easy, if awkward, read.As another reviewer noted, the book feels like an overgrown magazine article -- and not a great article at that (you'd never see &quot;Outside&quot; magazine print this).In addition to what seems like superficial research -- reading a bunch of books and magazine articles rather than finding anything original -- the author makes all sorts of hyperbolic statements. For example, he says that the the mythic &quot;frontier&quot; ended when the railroad was completed and that it was the last audacious engineering project ever attempted. Huh? Ever heard of moon launches? In fact, the author does mention NASA later on, but to no apparent purpose.In short, this is a book that needs either a writer with a better dramatic ability to tell the human tale, or a far better technical ability to tell the engineering tale (where are the maps and diagrams?)."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Last Train is a short book about a big project...one that essentially created the state of Florida as we know it today.

The vision and the tenacity of Flagler is obvious throughout the book. He was an astute business man and yet seemed to have empathy for his employees and for the land that he came to love and made so much money from.It was an engineering fete that wasn't even contemplated in the early 1900s when he started it.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I love history, and I'm a people-watcher. When I see the two in one package, that grabs my interest.Here we have the story of Henry Flagler, a paradox of sharklike business domination and love for family, including a disturbed second wife, and generosity for those who suffered poverty. A baffling combination, perhaps owing to his own early impoverishment and tremendous hunger to overcome it.Standiford perfectly displays the genius and yet questionable judgment packaged in the one Henry Flagler, who, torn between his business life and the interests of family, pride, and his personal pursuits, made decisions and persuasions that only lengthy, rationalizing dreams could support.That's what I really like about Les Standiford's writing. This portrays history where it really transpires: in the mind and motives of those who helped to forge this country in its developmental infancy, in a time when lots of money was to be had for anyone clever enough and persistent enough to know how to get it.The story begins with the great and gruesome tragedy of 1935, backtracks to Flagler's impoverished beginnings, and finally moves forward through the years of expansion to his death, meanwhile unpacking the thoughts that led Flagler to build his lines to nowhere, creating budding cities in various places, but not necessarily with profit. Finally, the story ends where it began, with the storm of 1935 and the aftermath.A great structure given the story to be told, however I did find the detailed description of the Keys' natural properties and views to be much like driving through them-I'm happy for the good weather, but there's only so much to see unless you actually get out of the car and explore. Likewise, I found this reading \\"balmy\\" after the stormy start, but I wanted to move on.This is not to say the Keys descriptions weren't worthwhile. People who want to know absolutely everything about the Keys may enjoy them. I struggled and it did slow my progress for some time, but as I moved through them, I found myself really enjoying it again. The descriptions throughout the book are detailed and vivd, right down to how the railroad was contructed. I easily envisioned it as if I were there, and the pages of photos added to that as well.Much of the richness of the text comes from understanding the conflicts, the paradoxical opinions of the public, and the controversial decisions made by Flagler influence us even today. He influenced public policy sometimes for him, and other times because of him, and I really enjoyed Standiford's observant, affect-centered portrayal in describing these things. History is so much more valuable when we understand why things occurred, and we make conscious choices as to whether or not they should again. The burning question is, if can, does it mean we should?Overall, I'd say this appeals to anyone who enjoys history and likes to be in the minds of those who made our nation what it is today. Very well written, and I'm glad I selected this book for a review."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Henry Flagler, late in his life, used his formidable wealth earned in partnership with John D. Rockefeller with Standard Oil to create our nation's largest privately-financed transportation and tourist infrastructure. He had the vision to see the value of exploiting Florida's many natural attractions.Prior to 1885, areas of Florida south of St. Augustine were mostly uninhabited swampland. His purchase of multiple rail lines, standardizing their track gauges and extending rail service south to what would eventually become Miami opened the entire southern part of the state to tourism. But his biggest challenge was to further extend rail service, mostly across water, to Key West our nation's most southern deep water port. This book chronicles Flagler's life, his formidable engineering accomplishment and what ultimately took it down after his death.For anyone fascinated with our nation's Gilded Age, this book is a \\"must read.\\" Although Henry Flagler was a true visionary, his belief that Key West would become one of our nation's largest sea ports never became a reality. Nonetheless, much of what Flagler built remains to this day and was vital to the development of South Florida."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Oceanis a very engaging book on a fascinating topic. Henry Flagler, the lesser known half of the Standard Oil enterprise and patriarch of modern day Florida, is a sympathetic and intriguing man who I knew little about before reading this book. His exploits towards the end of his life are the primary focus of this book. That such an accomplished man would decide to undertake a railroad construction project over the ocean all the way to Key West is amazing in and of itself. Clearly this was a man who was more concerned with his legacy than with his wealth. That much is clear from this book.The problem I have with the book is in the editing and organization of the story. There is, necessarily, a lot of back story. But it is peppered throughout in various chapters in a way that is not always elegant and often repetitive. In addition, some of the flash-forwards don't seem to aid the story itself. Chapter two, which begins from the author's present tense point of view, seems terribly out of place. It has information peppered from Flagler's past throughout and does not flow well.The chapters that follow provide excellent back-story on Flagler's childhood and early exploits, both good and bad. But there is much repetition, with some of the chapters including facts that were just stated at the end of the previous chapter.Most of the chapters are short, making for a quick read. But while this book seems very well researched, it does leave one wondering about many of the details behind the events leading to and ultimately finishing with the construction of the Florida East Coast Railroad. Regarding the accusations that the company faced of forced labor and poor conditions, the author relies heavily on letters sent by Flagler and others stating their policy of providing the \\"best labor conditions possible.\\" While the author may have good reason to believe that the allegations of labor abuse against the company were false, they are not provided here. It is not impossible to believe that the company might have had an official policy which was not adhered to unofficially.This is a good story but the book leaves something to be desired. While I think there are many reasons to be enamored with the story, the short treatment will leave many wanting for more. There is also a flowerly and rhetorical writing style that is used here that will not appeal to all readers.CONCLUSIONI still recommend this book as a worthy read. I just wish they would have edited it further.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Fascinating coverage of how Florida developed into a state.

So Les Standiford had my attention as soon as I learned about this book. It is the gripping tale of Henry Flagler's building of the Key West railroad and its destruction over twenty-two years later by the deadly \\"Storm of the Century\\" in 1935.The Florida East Coast Railway was built to provide rail transportation between mainland Florida and Key West. Henry Flagler was John D. Rockefeller's partner in Standard Oil and was thought by many to be the true genius behind the company. The book describes the immense construction effort, gives the reader an idea of the scope of the project, and then lets us watch as the Labor Day storm of 1935 brings it all down.Mr. Standiford's writing style makes it easy for you to move right through the story and also makes it very difficult to put the book down.

The man is Henry Morrison Flagler and his dream was to build a railway from the Florida mainland to Key West.As the pages turned to the opening years of the 20th Century, Flagler - a partner with John D. Rockefeller in Standard Oil - had a number of successful business interests in Florida, including the Florida East Coast Railway. He is known as the \\"father\\" of Miami and founded Palm Beach Island. But his greatest feat was quickly steaming forward; extending the Florida East Coast Railway from Biscayne Bay to Key West - the state's most populated city - which would entail the crossing of 130-plus miles of open ocean and open a solid trade route to Cuba.Standiford takes an amazing trek through the boardrooms, where financiers dismissed the plan - \\"Flagler's Folly\\" - as impossible, to the engineers, many who deemed the project impracticable, and finally to the murky swamplands and tent cities of the workers, as they faced a number of setbacks from the brutality of several hurricanes in a race to complete the project on time. After nearly eight years of hard labor, the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\" was in place for passenger service in 1912, with the extension completed in 1916.In 1913, Flagler died at the age of 83, but the railway stood magnificently until the 1935 \\"Storm of the Century\\" swept away all but one section of track that was 60 feet long and the railroad engine that was on it. And from that disaster came a lasting monument that travels to the genius of Flagler and is a lasting tribute to those who made the incredible infrastructure nearly indestructible.This is truly a journey for the ages and Standiford allows the quest for perfection speak the loudest of all."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Outstanding book--extremely well-written and very interesting.

Les Standiford, whose books are always well written and enjoyable, has provided us with a glimpse of old Florida that is well worth the reader's time and attention, in \\"Last Train to Paradise\\".The book is an account of Henry Flagler's love for and work in developing Florida, with a special eye toward the building of the Key West Railroad. Flagler, you will recall, was partner with the crusty \\"spare-a-dime\\" plutocrat John D. Rockefeller in Standard Oil. Upon his semi-retirement, Flagler took up as his hobby railroading; not model railroading, but full-size, fill-the-miles railroading.Many cities along the Atlantic Coast of Florida were founded or revitalized by Flagler's enterprises; for, wherever his railroads went, exotic grand hotels sprang up to which the well-heeled and the curious swiftly flocked. (The First Lady, Mrs. Benjamin Harrison, traveled to St Augustine for the grand opening of the Ponce de Leon Hotel). Indeed, the St. Augustine of today owes more to Henry Flagler for its exotic ambiance as it does to the earliest Spanish settlers. So too, down the coast--from Ormond Beach to Palm Beach--his Florida East Coast Railway and glamorous hotel enterprise sprang, with such speed, vitality and &eacute;lan that Flagler has been called \\"the man who built Florida.\\"Standiford gives a great overview of Flagler and his love for the Sunshine State, and then goes on to tell the compelling story of the building of the Key West Railroad, the only railroad in the world to travel most of its length over open water, instead of land. Originally conceived in a bout of competitive bravura with the Gulf Coast's Henry Plant--at the grand opening of Plant's Tampa Bay Hotel--the Key West Railroad was designed to take travelers in cosseted comfort all the way to the southernmost tip of the United States. Standiford tells the tale of the grueling work that created this modern marvel and of its tragic demise during the horrific hurricane of 1935.All who have traveled to Key West by automobile have benefited from Flagler's vision, since much of the highway was constructed directly upon what remained of the Key West Railroad's foundations.

Unfortunately he is also bound and determined to view this story through the prism of a Greek tragedy, which has him spending most of this book pounding a very square peg into a very round hole. The trouble with this point of view is that Flagler's road was not a failure except in the most narrow business sense and even that failure was due not to the implacable forces of nature, which were all overcome, but rather to the petty, imbecilic interference of government and arguably perhaps to the relentless march of technology.Mr. Standiford's first error is the all too common one among those who carelessly bandy about words such as \\"robber baron\\", the failure to distinguish between two very different sorts of Gilded Age entrepreneurs: the political entrepreneurs who made their fortunes by gaming the system, seeking subsidies, angling for monopolies, and bribing politicians, and the market entrepreneurs who fought them and beat them by relentlessly cutting costs and supplying a superior product, raking in profits all the while. John D. Rockefeller and Henry Morton Flagler of Standard Oil clearly belong to the latter category, and it is rather telling that in his litany of petty complaints against Standard Oil, Mr. Standiford fails to mention how they actually made their massive fortunes: by providing petroleum products cheaply enough for the poor to afford them, thus massively expanding the customer base. Clearly Mr. Standiford would have benefitted from reading a book conspicuously missing from his bibliography: Burton W. Fulsom'sThe Myth of the Robber Barons.Another error that grows annoying by repetition is Mr. Standiford's environmental extremism; he quite literally appears to bemoan every tree felled during the construction of the railroad. There lies lunacy in the long run and uselessness in the short run because sensible environmentalism means having the guts to make the least bad choice available, not brainlessly opposing anything that is practical in hopes of possibly better future advances. If Mr. Standiford's apparent views had prevailed, not only would there have been no overseas railroad, there would have been no overseas highway today either.Another error that Mr. Standiford wavers back and forth upon, is the notion that in building the Key West Extension Mr. Flagler was not motivated by profit -- this is stupidity on stilts as even Mr. Standiford shows. Throughout the history of his FEC Mr. Flagler was constantly maneuvering to provide it with the one thing it lacked to insure long term profitability: a deep water port that would produce sufficient freight traffic. Mr. Flagler had unsuccessfully tried to get the US government to help pay the cost of dredging a deep water port in Miami, considered building the extension north to another possible deep water port at Turtle Bay on Key Largo, and when the Navy refused him permission to do the dredging necessary to make Key West into the super port he envisioned, briefly considered halting the extension in the Middle Keys and building his super port off Key Vaca.Of course it is an open question how profitable the single track extension would have been even without the governmental economic idiocy that slowly strangled it by denying it adequate port facilities and then finished it off with the Great Depression. Technological advances might have doomed it regardless. The ship propulsion transition from burning coal to burning oil reduced the advantages of a Key West super port over Tampa and New Orleans, not to mention the evolution of the automobile from rich man's toy to significant competitor as freight carrier. Still, more freight traffic would have enabled the FEC to better handle the economic hard times, and a profitable railroad would almost certainly have chosen to rebuild the 40 miles of damage the Labor Day Hurricane produced. With all the major bridges having survived intact, it just wouldn't have been that hard or cost that much, which points to Mr. Standiford's final error.What made the Key West Extension the Eighth Wonder of the World, was not the rails that ran on top but rather the spectacular engineering achievements that carried it over the ocean, the mighty bridges that carried the Overseas Highway that replaced the railroad until they in turn were superseded a half century later by more modern bridges that were put in right beside them, meekly following the route that Flagler blazed.Flagler's Folly didn't die at sea 74 years ago today; it lives on as the Overseas Highway section of US 1."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Henry Flagler was a rich man when he more or less discovered Florida in 1877. Born in 1830, Flagler was one of the three founders of Standard Oil. He was lured to Jacksonville, Florida in hopes it might help his wife to recover her health. In 1883, Flagler became interested in Florida hotels - and a second career was launched by this immensely rich 53 year old man.Les Standiford tells this tale well. Flagler, always a man solely focused on business, built hotels to lure the nation's rich. To connect them, he started by buying local railroads and consolidating them into the Florida East Coast Railway Company. Flagler kept pushing further south into Florida and literally founded Palm Beach and West Palm Beach and put Miami on the map.The largest city in Florida at the time, surprising to the modern reader, was Key West. A great future was envisioned for Key West as a port, benefitting from the cargoes passing through the soon to be built Panama Canal and increased trade with Cuba, barely a hundred miles away.Flagler, at an age when most men were happy to merely be alive and retired, embarked on the great project of building a nearly 150 mile railroad through largely uninhabited land from Miami to Key West.The territory it passed through was primarily ocean and the low-lying keys. Failure was forecast for the project.Through seven years of construction and five hurricanes, Flagler's crews kept pushing ahead, solving engineering problems as they arose, including the construcion of a seven mile long bridge.This is true adventure and Standiford is an extraordinary storyteller. Well worth reading. It will fill in your knowledge of Florida, a wilderness barely a century ago and the remarkable man who said \\"I used to be a rich man until I discovered Florida\\".Jerry"},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"very happy with the way it was sent and my son is enjoying another great story about Flager and his railroad in Florida."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"My boyfriend lost his first copy when he left it behind on a plane.

People who envision Florida as being a vacation paradise as far back the dawn of US history will learn much from the real story. Visitors to Key West will want to go back, this time by the current road that to a great extent follows the path of the demised railroad. Five stars."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"At first glance this seems to be sort of a regional bit of history. Our main protagonist, Henry Flagler, turns out to be a peer of Rockefeller who embarked on an almost pyramid-building type of project to bridge the Florida Keys. Although mostly a curiosity, author Les Standiford uses this project to bring the Guilded Age of American business to life. He manages to convey the peril and monumentous task that Flagler spearheaded with his ocean railroad, and the writing is taut and to the point. In fact, my one complaint is that there are glimpses of other topics that Standiford only mentions in passing, but could have also made for compelling reading and a wider canvas. But what is in the book is very informative and interesting."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Les Standiford's \\"Last Train to Paradise\\" is a well written and extremely interesting book about the building of the Key West Railroad at the beginning of the 20th century. Considered one of the greatest railroad accomplishments ever completed it also had a relatively short 22 year life-span. It's interesting to note that when construction began in 1905 many critics called it \\"Flagler's Folly\\", yet once completed in 1912 it was heralded as the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World.What makes this a great novel is the author takes his time to build a foundation of Henry M. Flagler, the man behind the dream. Taking us from his birth in 1830 to a poor Presbyterian minister through his adolescence and early adulthood working in a general store, and eventually into his partnership with John D. Rockefeller and the establishment of the Standard Oil Company, we see his strong work ethic and his devotion to his family. And we also see the many personal tragedies he had to over come as well.Once that foundation is built Standiford then goes into extreme detail, from conception to completion, of the building of the railroad line. We see the hardships that the crews had to endure with hurricanes, mosquitoes, labor problems, and the extremely rough environment of working in the Everglades and onto the Florida Keys. Although considered a commercial failure in that it never provided the cash flow he expected, Flagler still felt it was the crowning achievement of his career.I would highly recommend this for anyone interest in historical novels and the building of America in the late 19th century and into the early 1900's."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This book is a historical account of the life of Henry Flagler, the industrialist who co-founded Standard Oil, built the Florida East Coast Railroad, and built numerous hotels and resorts in Florida. But his most famous accomplishment was the construction of a railroad through the Florida Keys near the turn of the century, which was eventually destroyed by a hurricane in 1935.This book contains a gripping account of that hurricane. That alone is worth reading the book for. The author does a fine job of painting a picture from the perspective of all the different types of people who endured the hurricane in the Keys that year. We see how everyone was affected, from writer Ernest Hemingway, to wealthy business tycoons, to ordinary middle-class families, to the poorest of citizens.The book also chronicles Flagler's life, showing by example and behavior, how he came to be the sort of man who would be determined enough to build such a railroad near the end of his life, when everyone thought he was crazy for doing so. It paints a nice picture of how he changed from his early days with Standard Oil, being mostly concerned with corporate domination and success. He became a man interested more in creating \\"great things\\" that people would appreciate in their cities and their daily lives. He wanted to be remembered for accomplishment more than power. The book does a nice job of illustrating this transformation, even to the extent of explaining his relationships with his wives and girlfriends.The book is an easy read. The sentences just fly by.I highly recommend this book to any fan of 20th century history, whether you are particularly interested in railroads or not."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"This is a fascinating short history of the remarkable railroad built connecting the Florida mainland to Key West in the golden age of Hemingway. Written with verve and humor, the story of protagonist Henry Flagler appeals to that unique American optimism and joie de vivre so emblematic of the early twentieth century. That this optimism ran smack into the awesome terrors of mother nature only provides the antagonist to this little historical tale. Highly recommended for a winter weekend in the snowbound Rocky Mountains, where I write this review."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Having an interest in Florida history, I saw this book at the library and had to pick it up... Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean by Les Standiford. The Key West railroad was a fascinating concept to begin with... building a railroad line from Miami to Key West, spanning miles of ocean in the process. Set the whole project at the turn of the century, and it becomes even more incredible. And to watch it all get destroyed by the hurricane of 1935 is a sad and ironic ending to a structure that was supposed to stand as a monument to Mr. Flagler and his vision for what Florida could become.Flagler is one of those people who hasn't seemed to get much notice in history, given the role he played. He actually worked side-by-side with Rockefeller in building Standard Oil to the mega-monopoly that it became. As such, he ended up with far more money than a single person could ever spend. After spending some time off down in Florida, he became enamored with the state. He also saw a potential business opportunity... The Panama Canal was being built, and Tampa was the nearest deep water port on the Atlantic side. Flagler felt that he could turn Key West into the new destination, 300 miles closer to the Canal than Tampa. A railroad from Key West to the mainland could make a fortune. Thus... it was time to start building \\"Flagler's Folly\\", an engineering feat that many said couldn't be done. 20 years and millions of dollars later, Flagler experienced his dream... riding a train down the Florida coast, onto the Keys, and finally ending up at Key West. But yet little more than 20 years later, it all lay in ruins, a victim of the 1935 hurricane, thought by many to be the strongest storm ever to hit the US (over 200 mile per hour winds). But its short life doesn't negate the enormity of what Flagler was able to accomplish, as well as how it laid the groundwork for the highway that would soon link all the keys in the same way the rail line did.Standiford does a good job weaving the story of Flagler's trials to get his dream built. He also does an excellent job in showing exactly what obstacles were overcome to make it happen. It truly was a monumental feat of engineering for the time and technology. The hurricane portion of the story seems to get short billing, however. I've read stories of the hurricane and devastation, and it's really not captured here at the level I'd expect. But even with that caveat, Last Train is worth reading to recapture a sense of what dreamers (albeit with a lot of money) used to dream..."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"It's not clock and dagger, with page-turning suspense. It's not a compelling romance. But it is the captivating story of the building of a railroad by a giant of a businessman who chose not to rest on his \\"laurels\\" so to speak, enjoying the luxuries of his accumulated oil industry wealth, but instead looked for new challenges, found them and met them--as daunting and problematic as they continually were.The author cleverly begins his story near its end with Hemmingway's preparations for a coming storm, the history-making 1935 Labor Day hurricane basically destroyed the railroad we are about to read about. The story follows with Henry Morrison Flagler's rise to prominence and wealth in the oil industry and then continues with a series of hotels and sections of railroad he built until he got his vision of a seeming impossible stretch of railroad that would extend over waterways to the Florida Keys, becoming known as \\"the man who built Florida.\\"The body of the work covers the extensive construction period, which includes a several human interest stories and certainly also a number of formidable challenges and setbacks and disasters, covering more than one hurricane, and not to mention hordes of mosquitoes. In this section of the book, the account covers a lot of details of the building, and I found it a bit slow going, but the \\"slings and arrows\\" suffered by the work crews and their bosses and the unique situations that occurred easily become captivating. And I found myself, between readings, drawn back to the story. It is really a uniquely American story and part of our history.At the end, Hemmingway reappears appropriately, now as part of the rescue crews that dealt with the devastating effects and loss of life in the hurricane. The irony is inescapable. An impossible railroad, successfully built at incredible cost including human effort and ingenuity, only to be destroyed a little over a decade later. Yet, Henry Flagler's vision for Florida endured, the way was opened, Florida indeed was changed. As the author fittingly put it, \\"There are no more men like Henry Flagler, and there are no more dreams like his.\\"Recommended."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"Henry Flagler remains relatively unknown for his accomplishments in two giant initiatives: Standard Oil and Florida itself. The story of the railroad to Key West is the continuation of the opening of Florida by Flagler through resorts accessible by sea and rail. Without the earlier phases, the extension to Key West would not have been possible.The author rightly gives the backstory on Flagler in concise form, hoping not to duplicate other material too much. No doubt many readers will be largely unfamiliar with Flagler, and associate nothing with the name when it shows up, as in the Kenan-Flagler business school at UNC in Chapel Hill. The backstory is not excessive for people who knew about Flagler and absolutely mandatory for people who didn't. (I urge readers who visit around Palm Beach to visit the Flagler Museum and to learn more about the opening of Florida from virtually nothing.)The main section covers from the go/no-go debate until the completion of the railroad and Flagler's death. The work was an amazing accomplishment at any level, whether it be from the perspective of logistics or management and persistence and working under adverse conditions or the folly of the project in the first place or the phenomenal engineering with technology 100 years ago. The author reminded us a few times about how the project ignored environmental impacts - there was nobody to complain - in a way obviously not feasible today.The author had too much of a breathless tone at times for my taste, trying to inject some of that novelist's style or extra flair into a story with a shortage of colorful personalities. Hemingway's participation did nothing for me. The real personalities were the unnamed storms. You can't beat Mother Nature."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"While I wouldn't say this book was great, I wouldn't say it was terrible, either. I certainly would not agree with a reviewer's statement that it reads 'just like a novel'. There was a little too much technical 'stuff' in the latter half of the book that I found myself skimming over, which I why this book only gets three instead of four stars. Fascinating to me, though, was how much Flagler did to develop what was apparently still a relatively rugged and unpopulated area. I was surprised to learn that Florida, and particularly Miami, was still mostly undeveloped by 1890 and, really, due to the 'vision' of this one man, Flagler helped shape the state into what it is today. Though perhaps that idea is somewhat exaggerated by the author, who clearly wants to paint an image of Flagler in the best light possible. This book provides in intersting look at the later life of Flagler, glossing over a bit his days with Rockefeller and focusing more on his time and dedication to Florida, in addition to providing a glimpse into the hardships of attempting to build a railroad through a very challenging area."},{"Title":"Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean","review":"I'm a second generation Floridian that loves history. When I lived in Florida I traveled twice a year from Sarasota to Key West on vacation. My first visit I stayed at the Flagler Hotel. Many times it seemed, the best part of the trip was the drive from Key Largo to Key West. Much of the way, portions of Flagler's old railroad bridge can be seen to the side of the roadway bridges. This book tells the incredible story of a extraordinary vision of a extraordinary man and how he made it come true. And how unfortunately nature ended that dream in tragedy.Last Train to Paradise is a wonderful read whether you have been to the keys or not. It took me back there, describing every section along the way. Its published by the University Press of Florida. That should tell you the quality of research. I have read another novel published by the University Press,Ringling: The Florida Years, 1911-1936, and it was just as fascinating. The actual telling of the story, it reads like a great novel, is top notch, NY Times best seller worthy. Its loaded with information about the building of the railroad, the people involved, and about the tragic hurricane that struck Flagler's dream down. If you enjoy history pick this book up.

How to Beat the Bear Market and Still Retire on Time","review":"Investors contemplating retirement, but stunned by losses sustained in the extended bear market that began in the spring of 2000, will find hope and encouragement in Wall Street Journal columnist Jonathan Clements' \\"Now What?\\". This is a do-it-for-yourself repair strategy for baby boomers with badly damaged bubble portfolios. First, face facts, we are told: You've got a \\"bone-head\\" portfolio, and it's not likely to come back in value, so sell your losers. Forget the \\"foolish beat-the-market fantasy\\" promoted by Wall Street's brokerage houses and money management firms. Invest to capture market returns with stock index funds. Diversify with stocks, bonds, and real estate. Specifically, you should own large and small US stocks and foreign stocks. For the bond portion of your portfolio, use inflation indexed treasuries and short-term corporate funds, and to boost your income, consider high yield bond mutual funds. Clements recognizes that \\"this will be the decade of the dividend and interest payment\\". So, REITS (real estate income trusts) with their high, single-digit returns, should represent 10-15% of your portfolio. In all this, Jonathan Clements is in good company: W. Bernstein, C. Ellis, B. Malkiel, L.Swedroe, B. Schultheis, et.al., have recently written (or updated) books with similar conclusions. Clements' contribution is in the timeliness of his insistence that boomers can salvage their own retirement plans by acting to keep investment costs in check, diversifying, and saving \\"like crazy\\". Indeed, the investment process should be simple to follow. \\"Why are we such sluts for sophistication?\\" Clements asks with exasperation. Readers may be skeptical that a fifty-year old, in an example, who hasn't saved a \\"nickel\\" for retirement can accomplish much by age sixty-five. But this late starting investor is not the book's primary focus. 'Gilding the Golden Years' (Chapter 7) is one of the author's better chapters. Investing may be \\"simple\\", but it is also an art, so this frequently quoted columnist's portfolio advice is of value. Clements is clearly intrigued by a strategy of establishing multiple sources of investment income during retirement. In addition to income from social security, 401k-style plans, pensions, and humbled securities portfolios, investors might consider an immediate annuity, a reverse mortgage, or even part-time work. After all, if it's true that investors should take no more than five percent of their investment assets each year for income, working part-time to earn five thousand dollars is like having another hundred thousand dollars in retirment assets. And an unconventional idea like a reverse mortgage may take on a new practicality for today's generation of soon-to-be retired. Investors paralyzed by their recent bear market experience will find sound, helpful advice in this book."},{"Title":"You've Lost It, Now What?

Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Grossman's coverage of the Battle for Stalingrad was popular and well known. In fact, Grossman may have been the first reporter to tell the story of the Holocaust, beginning with his reports subsequent to the liberation of Treblinka in Poland. Prior to the publication (abroad) of Forever Flowing Grossman had seen his other major work, Life & Fate, banned by the KGB. In February 1961, a KGB Colonel, Vladimir Prokopenko came to Grossman's flat not to arrest Grossman but to arrest his novel \\"Life and Fate\\". Grossman's manuscripts, carbon copies, notebooks and typewriter ribbons were all seized. These events took contemporaneously with the authorized publication in the USSR of Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. An explanation of why Grossman was perceived as more of a threat than Solzhenitsyn can be gleaned from the contents of Forever Flowing. (The story of the eventual publication of Life and Fate is best left to reviewers of that book.)\\"Forever Flowing\\" tells a simple, yet emotionally deep and politically nuanced tale. The story begins with the 1957 return to Moscow of Ivan Grigoryevich after 30 years of forced labor in the Gulag. (1957 marked the year in which the tide of returning prisoners of the Gulag reached its peak.) He arrives at the flat of his cousin, Nikolay Andreyevich. Nikolay, a scientist with less than stellar skills, has reached some measure of success at the laboratory through dint of being a survivor. He reaches the top of his profession only after those of his more talented colleagues are skimmed from the laboratory after purges (Stalin's last campaign - the Doctors Plot - seems to be referenced here) and other typical political campaigns. The meeting in the flat is entirely unsatisfactory for both parties. Nikolay is particularly upset (although he is not capable of figuring out why) as he sees his pale imitation of a life reflected through the prism of his cousin's 30 year journey. Grossman paints a vivid picture of Nikolay, more than a bit jealous that Ivan's light had always shone brighter than his own prior to Ivan's arrest. Nikolay suffers from the guilt of one who was not arrested and who is painfully aware of the choices he made to keep from being arrested. In that sense having Ivan sit across from him at the dinner table disturbs Nikolay no end because Ivan represents a mirror into which Nikolay can see only his own hollow reflection.Grigoryevich leaves Moscow for his old city of Leningrad, the place where he was first arrested in 1927. There, quite by chance, he runs into the person whose denunciation placed him in jail in the first place. Grossman here embarks on a discourse on the different types and forms of denunciation available to the Soviet citizen. It is a remarkable discourse that shows how many different ways there are to participate in a purge and how many ways there are to legitimize ones participation and/or acquiescence.From Leningrad Ivan travels to a southern industrial city where he finds work and eventually finds a deep and satisfying love in the person of his landlady, a grieving war widow. That relationship forms the centerpiece of what might be called Grossman's vision that love and freedom are two goals, not mutually exclusive, that form the essence of our shared humanity.The above summary does not do justice to the power and depth of Grossman's prose. Further, it cannot do justice to the literary and political importance of the work. Since the death of Stalin, the Soviet line had remained relatively firm - Stalin's excesses were the product of a disturbed mind that represented a horrible deviation from the theory and principles of Leninism. The USSR's best path is the one that returned it to the path created by Lenin. Khrushchev first enunciated this line. (Brezhnev never paid it much mind as his own administration marked a step back towards Stalinism in some respects.) Even Gorbachev's perestroika was based on the theory that a return to first-principles, i.e. Leninism, would save the USSR from destruction.Grossman did not buy into this line and Forever Flowing is noted for a remarkable attack not only on Stalin but on Lenin and Lenin's anti-democratic tendencies that had more in common with Ivan the Terrible than the principles of revolutionary democracy. \\"All the triumphs of Party and State were bound up with the name of Lenin. But all the cruelty inflicted on the nation also lay - tragically - on Lenin's shoulders.\\" Grossman may have been the first to make this leap and he paid the price for making that leap. (This involves the suppression of his Life & Fate.)Despite the horrors set out, quietly and without excess rhetoric, Grossman returns to an somewhat optimistic vision of mans search for freedom\\" \\"No matter how enormous the skyscrapers, no matter how powerful the cannon, no matter how unlimited the might of the state, no matter how vast its empire, all this was only smoke and mist which would disappear. There remained alive and growing one genuine force alone, consisting of one element only - freedom. To live meant to be a free human being.Forever Flowing (and Life and Fate) are well worth the time and attention of anyone with an interest in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Forever Flowing","review":"Grossman began writing this book in 1955, two years after Stalin died. It was completed one year before the author's death in 1964, but was not published until 1970. Framed as a novel, and written with great tenderness, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; is primarily a history of the horrors of the Soviet state before, during, and after its Stalinist phase. Grossman's chapters recounting the huge famine of 1932, which was a government-enforced starvation of millions, particularly in the Ukraine, are matchlessly brilliant and profoundly moving. The entire novel is a tribute to human freedom. It also reflects the great courage of its author. In my opinion, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; will become more widely read as time passes, and will become increasingly recognized as one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It is a true classic. The lucid translation by Thomas P. Whitney is excellent. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forever Flowing","review":"This translation should not have been republished.

Because of my reading, I was able to understand a little bit better what was happening.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about what has happened in Indian policy since the end of the Indian Wars, and also to anyone who wants a better understanding of how our own government works."},{"Title":"The Nations Within: The Past and Future of American Indian Sovereignty","review":"This book provides a history of native \\"sovereignty\\" wrapped around a particular political manifesto. That manifesto very much reflects the concerns of the 1960s and 1970s, and part of this book represents a criticism of the approach of the American Indian Movement. It's written in a level-headed and balanced style despite the authors' obvious passion.This book emphasizes the history of sovereignty, the struggles, successes, and failures. It is lightly informed by theoretical notions of sovereignty, self-government, and self-determination. This is sociological theory of the type found from the 1960s through the 1980s, not the critical theory of the humanities that have dominated such thinking since the 1990s.The middle chapters give us a fairly detailed legislative history of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. That's more detail than most people will want. However, the authors' hero is John Collier, whose actions they defend vigorously but not uncritically. Understanding what Collier wanted to do, the obstacles to his vision, and the scope for evading congressional intent inform Deloria and Lytle's own political concerns.The authors' larger agenda is to argue for self-determination, to show that Indian participation in social programs tend to make them federal agencies and not self-governing communities. Government-to-government relations, similarly, does not make the tribes sovereign. Instead, they argue for a cultural, political, and economic renewal of the reservations. This should be grounded in the \\"tribal Indians\\" living in a native linguistic and cultural environment, and not among the \\"ethnic Indians\\" who speak English, feel at ease working with the federal government, and who live in the agency towns or in larger urban areas.They also believe that the ethnic Indians' movement has led to unnecessary conflict with white society. Tribal Indians have pursued both autonomy and mutual respect with respect to other cultures, they argue, and this provides a stronger political foundation for renewal. This part of the argument is overstated, I suspect. The book does not provide much evidence about any individual tribe or reservation, so the authors' statements must be seen as generalities based on their personal histories of working with a large number of tribes around the country.Though this book is now dated after 25 years, it still very much warrants reading. After this moment, writings on Native sovereignty move away from political, legal, and economic concerns and toward postmodern approaches. As I've noted in other reviews, I think this humanistic turn is a political mistake. Deloria and Vine provide an excellent example of previous approaches, one that those with humanistic inclinations would be well-advised to consider."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"I love the fact that Aldous Huxley, a philosopher, wrote this book. Instead of only writing this book from a medicinal point of view or from only a psychological point of view, he ties in how our eye health is a reflection of the state that our mind-body complex is in. I already have great eyesight but I'm definitely not taking this for granted now that I'm in my mid 20's. While I don't follow all the exercises that are in the book, I have changed the way I use my eyes and eyelids. With that said I am unable to vouch how effective this book/method is for curing vision impairments - but the information makes so much sense. I definitely feel that my eyes are more relaxed now and I did learn a lot of different ways to avoid unnecessarily straining my eyes."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"I had to buy this used because it is out of print.

HOWEVER it is a good book even for the purpose of better vision, especially for the ARTIST in you. I love photography, and some of the techniques in the book HAVE helped me to have what i consider to be better photos. it's hard to describe, but one technique in the book is to outline the horizion lines of the outdoors scenes you are looking at. and as far as artistic ability is concerned taking notice of things like line and form are basic to creating an effective image.also in a historical context it was an interesting book. i like learning from 'thinkers' from this era as they seemed in some ways less inhibited by the society in which they lived than those of today who are so often unorigional.this was a good book."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"Great Book! One of the first original Natural Eyesight Improvement books after Ophthalmologist Bates Better Eyesight Magazines and his, other doctors, early teachers books.I found Huxley's book in a old bookstore on Rt. 9, Brookfield Massachusetts. I had unclear distant vision, prescribed glasses in high school. The Treatments, steps in the book were easy to learn and it improved my vison to 20/20 in one day. Threw away the glasses. I did the shifting on a distant tree and suddenly saw the leaves clear. I still have that first image of the clear green leaves blowing in the wind that sunny day. Freedom! Distant vision still clear at age 54 by occasional practice of this method. The teachings also improve the mind. I grew, began studing more subjects.

Glasses are not necessary!"},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"This book is difinitive proof that no matter how smart you are, you can still be conned. Much like the characters described in his &quot;Devils of Loudon&quot;, Huxley convinced himself to believe the most foolish things, in this case, the Bates method. The Bates method has been proven time and time again not to work. Even in Huxley's time most people knew it was a hoax, but Huxley, with his love of the Eastern &quot;mind over body&quot; religions never even questioned it. He bought the lie hook, line, and sinker.

After about a year of doing several of the exercises I was able to pass the motor vehicle eye exam and throw my glasses away. I lent the book to someone who needed it and it disappeared, now I am looking for another copy. As my eyes change with age I need to review it again.Paulkelt@ix.netcom.com"},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"This account of Huxley's personal experience with the Bates method is enjoyable, and useful. Unlike a hoax, the method doesn't require any leap of faith or that you wear a pyramid on your head. You have to work, reflect and learn. This is perhaps why the method isn't successful with everyone. It is far easier to pay for a pair of glasses. My advice: If you get your hands on this book, read it."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"Several months ago I bought the book \\"Relearning to See\\" and I never finished reading it. Talk about boring. The author of that book goes into how the eye works and gives way too many examples of people he knew that lost their eyesight from trying to see too much or gained it back by using the Bates method. When I say a too many examples, I mean to the point where I had to put the book down. In the end (or at least as far as I got, which was a little over halfway), he discussed the theory of the Bate's Method, but didn't get into the nitty-gritty.Huxley's book, on the other hand, is about a third of the length counting pages only. When you consider his font is much bigger and there is less type on each page, it's probably 20% of the size of \\"Relearning to See\\". But it's because he cuts the crap and get's to the point; he tells you what you need to know to improve your eyesight without ranting for over 700 pages.I don't care about the structure of the eye because it has absolutely no bearing on relearning to see. I just got Huxley's book this week and I already finished it. He concisley describes each major point of the Bate's Method and because it's to the point, you actually remember the main points come the end of the book. Furthermore, he tells you exactly what to do.In \\"Relearning to See\\", when I read about palming, I thought you were supposed to actually push on the eyes. The author didn't get into detail aobut what it was. It turns out you are just supposed to cover the eyes and block out light. In \\"Relearning to See\\", the author says blink frequently. Huxley tells you what drills you should do and how often to do them. He gives specific exercises to do for central fixation and sunning the eyes. Don't waste your time on any other book if you want to relearn to see. This book has everything you will need."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"I read this book with skepticism, I did the exercises with skepticism, and I watched my prescription go from -2.25 to -1.25 in three months. Not bad for a method that \\"doesn't work\\" according to the people who sell me glasses, contacts and laser surgery. I highly recommend anyone considering laser surgery to atleast check this out first. Someone please republish this book."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"I read this book 10 years ago and I freaked out my eye doctor when I wnet back a year later and went from a -2.25 in each eye to a -0.75 in each eye. Not perfect, but close to it. He asked what happened and I told him about the book. He said that the shape of my eye had changed and was wondering where I found the book. I told him a used book store, because it was not republished at the time. I am glad it is now. You have to have patience, but it really does work! Good Luck!"},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"Huxley used the bates method to save his failing eyesight. The Bates method is not a hoax. I have used it for 20 years and continue to receive many benefits. Huxley was not selling a hoax, he was sharing the truth with the public."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"From the age of 8 I was wearing spectacles (which I hated so much) until I visited my friend's art studio and left my glasses on the table. Recognizing it I feld in panic. I called up my friend to find out when I can pick up my glasses. I was shocked by my friend's reply that I don't need any glasses and, that I am addicted to them like a junke to his drug. Nevertheless I was invited to pick them up any time I wanted. So I went there again and my friend along with my glasses gave me a book to read and to think about it. The book was Aldous Huxley's \\"The Art of Seeing.\\" I simply followed the footsteps of Huxley and ever since I have told \\"SAYONARA\\" to my glasses. I was so happy that the method works that i shared my joy with my occulist, who was also my friend. He insisted that the method doesn't work. Upon checking my sight he stated that I'm an exeption. When I was about to elaborate more on what I did he said to me that he doesn't wan't to hear it. He said that he has wife and kids and he has to make a living. He showed me the door and that was the last time I saw him. I've lost a friend and won back my eyes. No regrets. The method is so important because one by improving his eyesight is improving his mind. And the mind is responsible for the function of the entire universe of the body. And so on and so forth. If I can recommend anything I am recommending this little wonderful BOOK."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"The author had a lot of knowledge that he could bring into his understanding of all this. He's got a good understanding of what the Bates Method is about (even most interested people totally miss it), and he's a good writer and a smart guy, so I'd have to say that I like this book and recommend it.From what I understand, Huxley didn't end up improving to the point where he had normal vision all the time. His failing to read a paper one time at a speaking is what's referenced a lot by the critics as &quot;proof&quot; he didn't benefit. Give me a break. If you consider the serious visual problems that this guy started with, and how much he improved his condition from there, it's quite a success story."},{"Title":"The art of seeing","review":"I read this book twenty years ago when my eyesight was good.

You know, that place all the world's fools dropped when an angel flying over it accidentally tore the sack in which he was transporting them? From that day to this, we have heard of their foolishness, um, excuse me, their wisdom.It's hard to say which of the 14 stories is the funniest. I like \\"The enchanted goat\\" (don't worry, he isn't really) and \\"Because of a blintz\\" in which Yossel and his silly wife Sossie run into some trouble over little rolled pancakes filled with sour cream.But my favorite (and I think my children agree) is \\"The holes in the bagels.\\" Mayor Gimpel, his grandson Abba and another Helm worthy travel from Helm to Vilna, the capital of Lithuania. After a night in a fine hotel, the three men assemble to discuss the fools in this city. (Now remember, this is in the Jerusalem of Lithuania, famed for its scholars and rabbis.)\\"One is more stupid than the other,\\" says Abba. \\"Worst of all, they have no sense of humor. As I wandered through the city, all I found was noise, hurry and bustle. There is not a shred of reason or logic in their behavior.\\"Needless to say, the wise men of Helm prove themselves foolish several times over. But the funniest idiocy in this tale follows their first encounter with bagels.\\"Look at them,\\" said Shloime. \\"Did you ever see baked goods like this? It is shaped like a millstone, with a hole in the middle and a ring of dough around the hole. But never mind the shape. Taste it!\\"The next day, all three Helmites went back to the bakery and ate a dozen bagels each. When they could eat no more, they asked the baker to teach them how to make them. Rueben turned to Shloime and asked, \\"I'd like the baker to go over it again from the beginning. Especially, I'd like to know how he gets the hole in the middle.\\"Well those holes cause more fun before the tale is done. But to find out how, and a lot more besides, read a story a night.

Many other books and articles on portraiture may address these issues partially, but still tend to have images of very thin models with perfect skin, hair and eyes. Many of the models in this book are attractive, but there's a reasonable diversity of subjects compared to other sources (with some caveats noted later in this review).The author has a very conversational style, and this short 120 page book is probably best appreciated as a really strong lecture or set of short seminars on topics (lighting, posing, making the client feel comfortable) with lots of useful tidbits and examples. This is not a rigorous reference with lighting diagrams, explanations of the functions of various equipment and accessories, and a glossary of terms and index...this book doesn't have any of these for the novice.That sounds like a criticism, but the author's breezy, non-academic style really works well to get certain key basics across, and it's very useful for both inexperienced and experienced photographers as a result. I found the book an excellent read, particularly the section on corrective posing, and specifically the focus on getting the most out of the eyes in a portrait. The lighting discussion is good as well, though the author jumps all around with various techniques and accessories he favors, and some areas don't have a lot of detail. But again, this book is strongest for posing and basic lighting in the service of making an imperfect subject look their best, rather than extensive details around equipment and technical explanations of lighting. His discussion of backgrounds, props, and the general benefit of foreground elements is valuable as well.The author is also very entertaining when he talks about how to engage the client in a comfortable and professional manner, and avoiding all the cliches and rude manners of other photographers.As another reviewer pointed out, the focus does seem to be on younger women who are heavier and who in general have hang-ups about different aspects of their appearance. It appears this is the case because the author feels these subjects are much more sensitive about their appearance, relative to men. It would have been nice to see a few more people of both genders across age groups, simply because the author is so good with his existing subjects, and more detail and a greater variety of subjects would have been even better.A final small note: this is not the book to go to for any discussion of black and white portraiture. Black and white is relegated to a small sidebar, and the author sticks to C-41 film because of the expense of processing and printing other B&amp;W films.With all this said, I recommend this book very highly. I'm about to read it for a second time cover to cover, to review the numerous useful concepts he discusses for the wider range of portraits I'm going to be taking this summer. Few authors communicate in as straightforward, educational and as entertaining a manner as Jeff Smith does."},{"Title":"Corrective Lighting and Posing Techniques for Portrait Photographers","review":"There are a number of &quot;tricks&quot; professional portrait photographers use minimize the visual imperfections of a client. While many of these tricks have been around for years, the author does a good job of presenting them with real-world examples.To be blunt, the book deals mostly with women with weight issues, most of whom are posing for their senior portraits. Using subtractive lighting, posing and sometimes props, the author shows you ways to shave a few pounds off a photograph. However, don't expect to be able to completely undo years of cheese-fries. The results are subtle, not earth-shattering.Overall, its a very useful guide for anyone wishing to make their subjects look a little better. Unfortunately, the other problem areas don't get nearly as much coverage as weight did, some only get a few paragraphs without photographic examples. Also, the author was politely vague when discussing individual photographs. Perhaps hiring some models specifically for this book would have allowed the author go into more detail without fear of offending his clients."},{"Title":"Corrective Lighting and Posing Techniques for Portrait Photographers","review":"This book contains a lot of Photos example.

This book includes two very useful templates. The first one is a short form which you can complete in minutes in which you state who the partners are and when you will complete a full partnership agreement. The second template is for the full partnership agreement. The book takes you step by step to help you figure out how to fill out the template. Again, for simple partnerships like ours, you can skip over a lot of the book. In the short form I wrote that I'd complete the partnership by July. With this book I'm hoping I finish by June.

An impressive debut!"},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"Robin Tamblyn's novel \\"King of Hollywood\\" follows the life of a man named Danny Spain, who grows up to be a promising Hollywood actor. But Danny has one fatal flaw - he is gay. Homosexuality still not being fully accepted in the film industry, Danny and his people try to hide his sexual preferences. But Danny's lifestyle will eventually catch up with him. Now, one of his friends wants to reveal the truth about Danny Spain's life.I absolutely enjoyed reading the book, because it shows you how a Hollywood life could be and how it could end. Interestingly, Tamblyn based the character Danny Spain on biographical details of an existing Hollywood actor who is rumored to be gay.Tamblyn's characters are all believable, thus the protagonist doesn't always behave in a lovable way. Tamblyn allows the characters to make mistakes, which makes them even more human.A very nice read, indeed!"},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"The story follows the life of Daniel Gibson from childhood to his violent early death.Daniel desperately seeks the attention of his father, but to no avail.With the safe distance of a voyeur, the reader accompanies Danny from his first sexual experiences to far inside the homosexual-milieu.After a long struggle for recognition Danny finally achieves a meteoric career within the dream factory of Hollywood.This only works by making a painful decision: to be popular or to be loved.To hold either the Oscar in your arms or the homosexual partner. To have both of it is not accepted by society.With enjoyable verbal trials, Tamblyn projects day dreams into a framework made by the basic biographical data of a certain Hollywood star. King of Hollywood is a fictitious story and a fascinating reading pleasure."},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"Danny Spain, subject of Robin Tamblyn's recent novel, King of Hollywood, was what some might call a \`bad boy made good'. Certainly not \`good' in the eyes of moralists, but in his abilities in his chosen career - an Oscar-winning actor.Spain (the name thought to be the author's disguise for a real actor) had a tormented childhood: from his father's brutal shooting of his pet dog, to his beatings and forced enrolment at military school in reaction to his homosexuality. Treatment that Danny refused to forgive, even at his father's deathbed.If you are looking for a moral, it is that homosexuality is not a trait that can be \\"promoted\\" as a \\"lifestyle\\", or beaten out of someone. And that a boy seemed destined to a life of petty delinquency or prostitution can turn to something far more creative.Robin Tamblyn writes with particular empathy for gay characters and has a keen interest in Hollywood, so Danny Spain was the natural subject for a first novel. Not one for those who are squeamish about gay sex, but this aspect does not unduly dominate the book. What does come through is the subject's inability to choose between the single life and someone he loves - a contradiction that eventually cost him his life."},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"King of Hollywood tells the story of Danny, a vulnerable and likeable boy trying to understand himself and the world around him. His humanity and defencelessness leave him open to the harshness and dangers of social contact with his fellow man. As his story unfolds, we empathise with his character and learn to love him, revelling in his successes and lamenting his mistakes and failures.This debut novel reveals a sensitivity and mature perspective to the subject matter of a young homosexual. It is skillfully written and we look forward with anticipation to the next Robin Tamblyn novel."},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"King of Hollywood, a debut novel by Englishman Robin Tamblyn reflects his true love of Hollywood film culture. Or more accurately a slice of it. Mr. Tamblyn has created an interesting and provocative tale about Danny (Gibson) Spain, an Iowan nobody who makes it big in Hollywood. This particular star, who eventually wins an Oscar after starring in many major motion pictures, is a closeted gay man. The novel tells us Danny's tale from his childhood to his eventual demise at in his early 40s by a male hustler.This story could be about any famous closeted Hollywood actor-ones the tabloids have hounded about sordid tales of their sexual appetites. Most likely it depicts a particular one whom we all know. In this tale-since it's a tell-all story-we get to know Danny on a very personal level. We also get to despise him greatly. Danny's dysfunctional childhood and his intense hatred for his father have warped his sense of self, squeezing him into a little emotional box and leaving him very little room to truly love and be loved. Mr. Tamblyn runs us through many of Danny's affairs with men older than himself, but especially Danny's penchant for younger men who he thinks will make him feel better about himself.Although this story begins and ends on a sad note-one that often occurs in gay-themed fiction-it contains a message. I believe that message is that unless one gets over their trauma, unless one pursues love over just sex, unless one reaches out for others, they are doomed for an existence of despair and eventual downfall. A classic theme to be sure, but one that is well played out in this debut work.Although this story takes place solely in America, Mr. Tamblyn can be forgiven for the occasional use of British slang and wording. They do not detract from the overall storyline. In fact, to my \`mind's ear' it makes the work sound all the more interesting!"},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"I first want to apologise for my awkward english : I am a foreigner. Nevertheless I hope I'll manage to be understood.Let's make it clear : I didn't read this book, and I probably won't. I'm just wondering here about the psycho-sociologic, and even anthropologic meaning of the increasing relentlessness the Anglo-Saxons, especially their militant gay communities, put - often in the most cruel way - in forcing to come out of their closets celebrities who, supposing they are actually concerned, do not wish to obey this terrorist demand. In the seventies, the french semiologist Roland Barthes, himself homosexual, already worried about that kind of hijacking which menaced his freedom as well as it hurt his intelligence and sensibility. Are we allowed to reduce the individual to his sexuality, deliberately ignoring the other components of his humanity ?Regarding exceptionally charismatic personalities, like the actor who inspired Danny Spain's character, we also may wonder if our desire to penetrate their bedroom secrets would not be the decayed metaphor of the impossible knowledge of their artistic enigma. As far as I could observe, the relentless and self-nourished rumour which harasses this actor (in the media, but also more and more on the web), is recurrently based on the mystery of his mesmerising presence on stage and screen. Here we are, this is the classical image of the artist martyr of his own art...I'm afraid this novel doesn't help him in any way, would the gay character it portrays be empathetically described. Things have got to the state where the point is not the rumour being true or not. The problem is, whatever he says or does now, this artist is in an unbearable situation. The most comfortable behaviour is perhaps the one he seems having chosen : silence."},{"Title":"King of Hollywood","review":"As a gay individual myself i found the book to be exreamly parronising. As far as the literary style goes it seems perfectly obvious to me and any half baked simpleton that the author has no grasp on the complexities of writing a birthday card, let alone a novel.

Although he has a &quot;crude&quot; (according to Jackson's mother) companion, together they make a great team to stop any problem that passes them by, even if it means risking their lives. When I started to read it, I thought, &quot;So what's the kid gonna do?&quot; But with the brilliance from this author, it's a definite page-turner. I recommend this book for any one out there who is looking fo a good book (good, my friends, isn't even half a word for this review.)

The plot was wonderfully set out, and the author's writing style was very interesting. There were a lot of times when Jackson looked back on things that happened when he was little. The topic was a little too mature, but all in all, this was a remarkably good book."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"Once again I find myself wondering why writers of children's books feel the need to bring up subjects that should be discussed rather than read. The young boy in this story after being exposed to a terrible reality, instead of talking to someone about it decides to take on the task of saving his ex-babysitter by himself, and stealing his mother's car is just one the impulsive ways he tries to deal with the problem. Maybe if Cracker's age were two or three years older the whole story line could have been easier for me to accept. Although well written, and a topic needing more exposure, I'm not sure this is the proper forum for elementary readers."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"I have just finished reading the book. This is a wonderful book. It's about a boy named Cracker Jackson. He gets an anonymous letter from his old babysitter, Alma. He found out that she was getting beaten by her husband. He tries to help before it gets way out of control. But it's too late, it's gotten out of control. This is a good book because it tells you what may happen with younger people, what situations that they can get into. For example, Cracker got into that situation with Alma. He loved her so much that he would do anything for her. What I learned from this book is to be determined, like Cracker never quit trying to help Alma. Now if I start something, I finish it. This is agood book by a great author. You should get it and find out what happens to Cracker and Alma."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"Cracker Jackson is a book that deals with everyday problems, like if a husband beats his wife or the boyfriend is beating the girlfriend.

He could have been arrested for stealing his mother's car. But before he did anything, he should have told someone before he got involved. This book teaches you a good lesson in life....That's why this book not only helps you read, but it's a good lesson in life.

It's about a boy named Jackson Hunter who is trying to help a woman named Alma who is getting beaten by her husband named Billy Ray.

She is about 6 months old. But when they are about 15 minutes away from Avondale, Alma decides to go back because she is afraid that if he finds out that she left him, he would hurt her, or even kill her. Goat, Jackson's best friend. But when they come back, Billy Ray finds out what happened, and beats her and the baby also, and gets them put in the hospital. A few weeks later Alma and the baby get out of the hospital.My opinion of the book is that it is a good book, and I really enjoyed reading it. The lesson to be learned from this book is to learn from your mistakes and don't follow in Alma's footsteps."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"My reading lab class just finished reading CRACKER JACKSON, and we all liked it. It was a very good book because I would read ahead when I was not supposed to, just to see what was going to happen. When I read this book I couldn't stop reading it. The book is about a guy named CRACKER JACKSON. He has a big problem, and he is the only one that can help. The problem is his old babysitter Alma is being abused by her husband named Billie Ray. Cracker is the only preson who can help Alma. You should never stay with a person like Billie Ray. The first time they hit you, you should leave because they will think it is okay to hit you. For example, Alma went back and got hurt even worse. That's not love at all."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"This book is about a woman named Alma and her husband, Billy Ray. When Billy Ray and Alma were going out, Billy Ray was very nice. What Alma didn't know is that Billy Ray is abusive. Billy Ray started beating Alma when they got married. Alma knew a boy named Jackson from babysitting. Jackson started to realize that Alma had bruises on her body. Jackson tried to do something, but Alma said, &quot;If I leave, he will find me and beat me again.&quot; So one time Jackson asked her if she wanted to go to Avondale to get away from him. Avondale is a place where women like Alma go when their husbands are being abusive. Jackson and Jackson's friend Goat decided to take Alma to Avondale, so Jackson and Goat Drove Alma and her baby to Avondale. Alma didn't want to go anymore after halfway there because she still had feelings for Billy Ray. So they turned around. When they got home Billy Ray found out and beat Alma and hit the baby. He put them in the hospital. Jackson's mom took her. After Alma and the baby got better, they went to Avondale and lived happily ever after. The point of this book is that when a husband or boyfriend hits you or someone you know, you need to tell aomeone that can do something about it.

I really liked it, sad or not, I liked it."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"I read this as a class and at the end we all said \\"wow!\\"It is a great book about jackson, who is trying to help his ex-babysitter.

Cracker attempts to get Alma and her baby girl Nicole into a women's shelter, but when they do Alma gets scared of what Billy Ray might do and returns home. When Billy Ray heard of what she attempted to do he abused Alma and Nicole so badly that they ended up in the hospital. This is not only a story of abuse but also about a young hero. Cracker stood up for what he felt was right and what he believed in. It takes a special quality to see something wrong and do something about it even though there may be a high risk involved."},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"This book is by Betsy Byars.

I recommend this book"},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"\\"A humorous children's book about spouse abuse? Betsy Byars pulls it off with rare sensitivity and understanding of how much a young reader can--and can't--handle. \\"Cracker\\" Jackson (nicknamed by his loving babysitter Alma because he's sweet with a surprise, like cracker jacks) has divorced parents but they both love, support, and protect him. It's Alma who marries an abusive man, and when Cracker realizes she's in trouble, he wants to help her. By placing the abuse outside Cracker's immediate family, Byars keeps the violence at a safe distance from the reader yet makes it a significant problem, in part because of Cracker's love for Alma.The story is narrated in first person by Cracker, whose honesty is at times very, very funny. Readers will have no trouble identifying with Cracker and therefore feeling a personal concern for Alma without being overwhelmed. The dynamics are genuine. Alma exhibits many of the characteristics of an abused wife--denial, loyalty, etc.--to Cracker's confusion. The ending is not tidy but is believable, and the conclusion leaves young readers with a sense of hope for the future.Altogether, this is an outstanding treatment of a difficult topic. Highly recommended.\\""},{"Title":"Cracker Jackson","review":"Cracker Jackson was a very good book. It explained the importance of telling someone about an abusive family.

I couldn't put the book down! This book shows you how Betsy Byars took a horrible situation and turned it into something special.

THIS IS FAR TO DRY A REVIEW!!!! Izutsu genius though, not only takes us through these concepts, but you become so immersed simply in the explanation of Concepts like the Unity of being, or the paradox between a light and darkness presented here, that the reader is drawn to a place beyond intellectual understanding, to a place of 'knowing', that make a strong argument that these concepts may be seemingly in conflict, but are actually complimentary and open new windows of knowledge for the reader when understood this way.

The main character in the book is Vera, who has left her father and disabled brother in Saskatchewan to forge a new life for herself in Toronto and ends up returning feeling not quite defeated but definitely weathered. Her relationships with her son and her aging father are complicated and recognizable and the ending was surprising as the past comes back at first to hurt and then to heal.

As a single mother with a dead-end job and a twelve-year-old boy who's falling under negative influences, it's time to take action. The problem is that Vera's been angry with her father since before she left home seventeen years earlier, and her anger hasn't faded.Homesick is a beautifully written story about a family who can't accept, or abide, one another's strongest traits, or flaws, as the case may be. There are secrets and memories that haunt Vera and her father Alec. Fences need to be mended, yet each cannot quite fully take that final step, and this makes the story riveting and painful.I loved the fact that this isn't a story about horrible abuse or murder, yet judging from the level of Vera's anger I thought it might be in the opening chapters. Don't get me wrong, there are serious issues in a story dominated by obstinate personalities and misunderstandings. It's about how elusive forgiveness can be, and it's a great read."},{"Title":"Thomas Guide 2000 King County: Street Guide and Directory","review":"A good book if you are new to the area or to keep in your car for a quick reference.

They are easier to read and less crowded with fact - ornithology, sailsmanship - than O'Brian's books. There is quite a bit of repetition from book to book - Sergeant Harper's amazing seven-barreled rifle is explained often enough to begin to sound preposterous.

FEEL-GOOD atmosphere"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Set around the Talevera campaign of July 1809, this first installment in the Sharpe saga deploys all the elements found throughout Cornwell's entertaining Napoleonic War series: the friendship between Sharpe and the Irish Sgt. Harper, their bravery and cunning, the ignorance and arrogance that pervaded the foppish upper class officer corps, a beautiful woman, and rousing battle scenes. Cornwell uses this first book to firmly establish the absence of meritocracy in the British army of the time, as armchair commander Simmerson needlessly leads the South Essex (including Sharpe and his Riflemen) into a debacle in which they lose the King's Colours, thus disgracing the whole army. Also clearly established is the tension between Cpt. Sharpe, who was promoted from the enlisted ranks for an act of heroism, and the upper class officer corps, who paid for their rank, irrespective of any actual military knowledge or ability. Simmerson and his toadying nephew Lt. Gibbons attempt to place the blame for the rout on Sharpe, and his only hope to save his rank is to perform an outrageous act of courage in battle at Talevera. Meanwhile, there's a beautiful Spanish woman he rescues from Gibbons and a crony, whose honor he must avenge. All is resolved at the Talevera, as Cornwell clearly and crisply recounts the military maneuvering on both a macro and micro level without getting overly technical. Also introduced in the book are Major Hogan, the Irish engineer who develops over the series into Lord Wellington's spy, as well as Lord Wellington himself, who is fond of Sharpe, but not hesitant to use his deadly skills. Above all, Sharpe is presented as a full action hero, strong, smart, roguishly handsome, honorable, deadly and ruthless. A perfect start to an engaging historical adventure series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"To be honest I am a confirmed fan of the works of Bernard Cornwell, including both the Sharpe series about the peninsular war against Napoleon, and the Copperhead series about the American Civil War. Sharpe's Eagle is the first of the Sharpe books written by Cornwell, though chronologically it does not come first. This is where he first introduced the charachter and his fellow riflemen to the world, hard-bitten, tough fighters to a man. We are shown how clever Sharpe is, what a good soldier, how loyal to his men and how contemptuous he is of superior officers who bought their commands and didn't earn them. I thouroughly enjoyed the book, following Sharpe's trials as he tries to keep an impossible promise made to a dying officer. As I said in my summary, I lost sleep over this book, and do not recommend it to anyone who has things to do."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Sharpe's Eagle details how our hero, Richard Sharpe, along with Patrick Harper capture the first French Eagle, a french standard, in the heat of battle to redeam the demoralized South Essex regiment who early in the novel lose one of their colors due to the bumbling of Col. Henry Simmerson. Sharpe utilizes this heroic act to save his career and gain a fame that gains him a place in the heart of even the Prince of Wales. A must read for any Sharpe fan and probably one of Cornwell's best novel's of all time!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"\\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" may have been the first Richard Sharpe novel that Bernard Cornwell wrote, but the formula of this novel permeates the entire series. For fans of \\"you are there\\" historical fiction of a military bent, that is a great thing.I came late to Cornwell's Sharpe series, after having read many of the author's other works (the Grail Quest novels, the Warlord trilogy, \\"Stonehenge,\\" and \\"Redcoat\\"). So I have been able to start at the \\"beginning\\" of the Sharpe saga with \\"Sharpe's Tiger\\" and the India trilogy. Accordingly, Sharpe and his fellow Riflemen as well as many of the commanders are familiar characters by now. It's interesting how smoothly \\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" fits into the series even though it was the very first novel.\\"Eagle\\" recounts the British army's struggles in Spain against the French and, even more so, their Spanish allies. Look for some notorious Spain-bashing as Cornwell derisively depicts its rag-tag infantry led by lazy peacocks for officers, including a real historical event where thousands of Spanish infantry are spooked by their own musket barrage! Not much subtlety, here.Fans of Cornwell's novels will also recognize the villain of the piece, fat Colonel Simmerson and his nephew, Lieutenant Gibbons. Sharpe, our admirable hero, has done a rare thing and won his officer's rank solely by merit, largely unheard of in the British army. Instead, most officers bought promotion after a suitable period in a given rank, and Cornwell is of the opinion, his idol General Arthur Wellesley notwithstanding, that this led to dozens of craven British officers, all of whom seem to encounter Sharpe during their career.Colonel Simmerson leads his battalion, including Sharpe, to the ultimate disgrace - losing their battlefield colors. Foisting the blame onto Sharpe, Simmerson hopes to avoid shame himself as well as to send Sharpe to a death sentence serving in the disease-infested West Indies. But Sharpe has another idea - salvage the battalion's pride by doing the impossible - stealing one of Napoleon's eagle standards from the juggernaut French infantry.An action-packed novel, \\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" also finds time for Sharpe to have a little romance, but this element of the story is entirely secondary to the main focus, which is Cornwell's unrivaled mastery of depicting a battle scene. A mere 270-odd pages, \\"Sharpe's Eagle\\" will defy your efforts to put it down.I highly recommend reading these books in chronological order, and this was the recommendation of the good people over at Bernard Cornwell's website as well. Get reading!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"This is an exciting that puts in the field with Richard Sharpe. From the scirmish where he retakes the regimental colors to the battle where he tries to capture a French Eagle to regain honor for the regiment and himself. Bernard Cornwell does an excellent job of keeping the story flowing smoothly and the action and excitement coming. I had a hard time putting it down and it wasn't long before I was reading it again. And the best part of it, you don't have to read the previous ones to know how those stories play into this one. Mr Cromwell does an excellent job of explaining all important information. His knowledge of history the soldier's mindset makes this story take on a life of it's own, as if Richard Sharpe could have really existed. A must read for anyone who like or loves history and adventure novels."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"This is probably one of the best Sharpe novels in the series. It was one of the first that Cornwell wrote and his attention to the details of the Talavera campaign is excellent. Here we have Sharpe and his detached half-company of rifles doing standard duties on the skirmish line. There is a minimum of running around behind the enemy lines defying the odds as we so often get in the later novels. The episode at the bridge is a study of military incompetence. Sir Henry Simmerson, our classic snobby bad Anglo-aristo, becomes one of Sharpe's perenial enemies here. People like this did try to make life difficult for Wellsely in English politics and the novel picks up correctly on that, albeit a bit heavy handed at times.The high-light of the story is certianly the build-up to the battle of Talavera in 1809. This was one of Wellsely's most difficult and dangerous battles, and his most costly after Assaye in India. The battle scenes are carefully constructed and taken heavily from Jac Weller's well known &quot;Wellington in the Peninsular&quot;. Sharpe is cleverly inserted into the action in ways which are believeable and mesh with the history. His double confrontation with Messhrs. Berry and Gibbons illustrates how many old scores were likely settled during the confusion of battle.Wellsley won a narrow victory at Talavera, winning his title of viscount Wellington, but losing a quarter of his army in the process. Cornwell does a great job describing the fascinating horror of Napoleanic combat. This is really his forte, and the descriptions of French columns slamming into British lines is right out of Jac Weller. This book is certainly vintage Sharpe, and remains one of the best.It is a pity that the television version of this novel could not convey the scope of the battle. The tongue and cheek nature of the TV productions does a bit of dis-service to Cornwell in that way. Still, one of the best early Sharpe books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"&quot;Sharpe's Eagle&quot; is &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; of the Napoleonic War novels. What Rustad's WWII novel does for the Second World War, Cornwell's skill has done for this earlier era. I'm more familiar with war novels about 20th Century conflict, but greatly admired Cornwell's Civil War books so thought I'd give his Richard Sharpe books a try. I'm glad I did! He brings his gift for drama, flair for characterization, and vouminous knowledge of the military art to the fore with &quot;Sharpe's Eagle.&quot;"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I came to the Sharpe series by a winding trail. Someone told me that, if I loved the Flashman books, the only other author writing a series of comic historical novels, but who was completely different from Fraser, was Van Reid. I didn't want any copy-cats. Van Reid's Moosepath novels are some of the best books I've read in years, exciting as well as funny and in a surprising and warm communication with Mr. Reid, by way of his website, he suggested I try James L. Nelson. Right again! Top notch nautical adventures! Then on the cover of Mr. Nelson's latest book \\"Glory in the Name\\" I see a blurb from Bernard Cornwell. Well, if Mr. Cornwell has such good taste, lets see if his books are tasty! Right again! Sharpe has a little of the anti-hero thing going, and he reminds me of Flashman in his dalliances with women, but what Mr. Cornwell does best is put you right into the middle of a battle and scares the life out of you. It seems pretty stupid to say that you can smell the gunpowder smoke when you read a book, but let's just say, that I could *see* everything as if I were watching a movie. Mr. Cornwell's action is terrific, his dialogue sharp,if you'll excuse the awful pun, and the plot twisty and believable. Thanks Mr. Reid, thanks Mr. Nelson, and thanks Mr. Cornwell for blurbing a favorite author so that I could be led to your great series!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Sharpe's Eagle is the first of many books by Bernard Cornwell in which his character, Richard Sharpe is a member of the British army in the years around 1800. I didn't read the book in the order they were written, I read them chronologically, but this book is still the best regardless.This book introduces Cornwell's fantastic writing style, he educates us of the British actions throughout many different campaigns. He is very detailed on a number of subjects, from how the battle was fought to the steps in which a cannon is loaded. After reading these books you feel like you know a great deal about such an important point in our history.This book introduces us to the upper class in-adequacies surrounding the British army of the time. Rich upper class 'snobs' became commanders by buying their commission, this left a greatly trained army to be run by untrained commanders. In this book an arrogant Sir Henry Simmerson, thinking he knows best, goes on to disgrace his whole unit by losing the Kings colours. It's then down to Sharpe, with the help of his immense bravery and courage to restore his regiment's honour.It's a great introduction to a truly interesting and gripping series.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"The entire Sharp series is F*U*N*. The books are set during the Napoleonic Wars. Richard Sharpe--think in terms of James Bond with a muzzle loading rifle--is a rare bird indeed. He joined the army as an enlisted man, and through a series of heroic actions manages to become an officer. In the early 19th century, such promotions were exceedingly rare; but Sharpe saved the life of the future Duke of Wellington on the battlefield; this gave his career a jump start. Throughout his time in the military by dint of other feats of heroism, he continued to rise in rank.Richard Sharpe is unrealistically romantic and dashing, but Bernard Cornwell inserts enough details of the life of the ordinary soldier in the early 19th Century British Army, to make this and other books in the series worthwhile reading.Contemporary readers may find the fact that leadership positions in the British Army were purchased. Some of the officer class were outstanding--cf Wellington who never lost a battle. Cornwell describes in vivid detail what happens when an aristocratic idiot with no military experience attempts to command a regiment in battle. The inevitable result was a series of very stupid blunders that caused a lot needless suffering and death.Cornwell's explainations of military tactics are clear and vivid; so are his descriptions of early 19th century miltary medicine (shudder).Fans of the cartoon strip &quot;Dilbert&quot; will chorus &quot;plus la change...&quot; when they read about organizational and bureaucratic stupidity in the British Army.I am thouroughly hooked on the series. The film adaptations which have appeared on Masterpiece Theatre and repeated on the History Channel do justice to the books.I categorize the Sharpe books in the second rank of historical fiction. _The Name of the Rose_ is an example of what I consider first rate historical fiction. I put the Sharpe books in the same class as the many books written by Norah Lofts.Thanks Mr. Cornwell--I finally understand what happened at Waterloo! Let me reiterate--you'll learn a lot from reading the Sharpe series, and you will have fun reading them."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"All the books in Cornwell's Sharpe series are riveting, evocative, untaxingly middle-brow, escapist reads.

Cornwell does a very adequate job of conveying the feeling to you that the society of Britain is changing due to the coming of mass industrialization and the changes in class based military that eventually put merit before social standing. His use of analysis of the actual battlefield tactics of the Napoleanic era is fascinating and although the work is fiction I believe that a student of European history would find this to be a useful work to &quot;get in the mood&quot; to study more mudane and boring aspects of the time period. I would recommend this as a suitable book for a highschool history class or early college history major."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"In the second of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels, Richard Sharpe finds himself in Spain, still in the fight against the French and still commanding his cherished green jacketed Riflemen. Sharpe is not a happy man, though. With his home regiment, the 95th Rifles, back in England, Sharpe has no way to either resupply his threadbare men or to gain his next promotion. Further, he has ostensibly been saddled with Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson, an armchair soldier who knows everything about battle -- even though he's never been in one. Sharpe's Riflemen, along with Simmerson's untried battalion, the South Essex, are dispatched on what should be an easy assignment. However, Simmerson exceeds Sharpe's worst expectations by leading the South Essex into a needless battle that turns into bloody rout. But Sharpe manages to salvage the day and a portion of the South Essex's pride. Sharpe receives no gratitude from Simmerson, though, only blame and Simmerson's promise to see him busted back into the enlisted ranks. So, as Sir Arthur Wellsley's army marches to what will be a decisive battle at the town of Talavera, Richard Sharpe's mind is on enemies ahead and beside him, and on an act of crazy-bravery that he must perfom to not only save his career but to keep a promise to a dead friend."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Napoleonic wars are not my thing but one day I picked up this book and for want of anything to do I read it.Didn't know some British officers were promoted from the ranks during this period.

I listened to the unabridged audio edition of Sharpes' Eagles, and I really, really liked it. My only issue with Cornwell's writing is that some of his characters are similar to other characters in other series (such as the Starbuck series). Also, I think Cornwell's characters are somewhat shallow. I would like to see him concentrate more on developing characters which are more than just same archetypes. Overall, this was a great book, sure to delight fans of historical action-adventure."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"For the fans of Richard Sharpe and his adventures this is another great book and a good addition to my collection."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I'm now into the part of this excellent series of military history/adventure novels where Richard Sharpe, commanding his isolated company of green-jacketed riflemen (the battalion having sailed back to England without him), is marching slowly through the Peninsular Campaign on his way to Waterloo. In the earlier novels (written later, but earlier by internal chronology), a year or several often passed between the volumes' action. But now, it's only a couple of months, each story segueing directly into the next in an almost continuous narrative. It's 1809 and the British army under Sir Arthur Wellesley has gone on the offensive in northern Portugal, striking east into Spain toward the town of Talavera. Sharpe is sent ahead as escort for his Irish engineer friend, Captain Hogan, who has to blow a Roman bridge that threatens to give the French access to the British rear. But the Spanish insist on detailing an infantry regiment to accompany them, too, so the British have had to send along a newly-arrived militia battalion, the South Essex. Sir Henry Simmerson, its commander, is a theoretical soldier only, convinced he knows better than the real generals how to win, and his arrogance and ignorance costs the South Essex its colours, captured by the French -- the ultimate shame. Sharpe, by sheer ferocity, recovers one of the colours, however, which gets him gazetted a captain in command of a light infantry company. As the British move on to the extraordinarily bloody battle they will fight at Talavera, Sharpe makes friends in his new command, as well as enemies, and he also acquires a love interest -- as he does anew in every book. The climactic battle itself is a masterpiece of atmosphere and shrewdly minimalized description; Cornwell could not possibly do justice to the entire confrontation so he concentrates on Sharpe's small part of it, leading the skirmishers out in front against their French counterparts, and observing the rest. I think it unlikely, frankly, that today's citizen soldiers could stand up to the pounding the redcoats take from enemy artillery and muskets in a Napoleonic set-piece battle, and just keep marching into it. Of course, war is a very different proposition nowadays, too. Cornwell does a very good job of reminding us of how things used to be."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"After watching the Sharpe series on video I decided to read them in print. Bernard Cornwell wrote this book first, although chronologically it is not the first in the life of Richard Sharpe. What a great story! It has all the elements of a great adventure. This book is a page-turner from the very beginning. This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure. One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them. I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Before reading this I'd only read Cornwell's Civil War-related series, and it was immediately apparent that he is *much* more comfortable with this Napoleonic Wars setting. His facts seem far more accurate and more fluent, his characters' dialogue is more believable, and I overall get the sense that he simply has a better grasp of his material. This is the story of the young career Army man Sharpe, who finds himself in political hot water through no fault of his own, and who has to do something heroic to get himself out of it. The battle scenes are good, very detailed; the characters, as I've come to expect with Cornwell, are generally engaging though not particularly deep. I intend to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I previously skipped over Sharpe's Eagle-the second in the BBC's television adaptations from the novels by Bernard Cornwell- because I was reading the book. The first Sharpe novel by Cornwell, Eagle is a fine historical work. Surprisingly, the TV adaptation does the written word justice.When we first meet Richard Sharpe in the Eagle novel, he's a lieutenant raised from the ranks after rescuing Wellington years before in India. Sharpe is a scarred and rough soldier, originally a member of the 95th Rifles. After being left behind by his regiment during battle, Sharpe and his remaining handful of crack shot riflemen move to the South Essex battalion. Sergeant Harper is as close to his superior officer as one in the ranks can be, but Sharpe has his eyes on a captaincy won on the battlefield-a promotion that cannot be taken from him. He can't afford to buy a commission like the spoiled gentlemen do. New colonel Sir Henry Simmerson doesn't make things easy for Sharpe-nor does young and greedy Lieutenant Christian Gibbons. The slick nephew of Simmerson contests Sharpe on and off the battlefield. Both men are vying for the affections of abandoned but high class and expensive Portuguese lady Josefina. Sharpe slowly realizes that the only way to gain respect, wealth, fame, and promotion is to capture an imperial eagle.Written in 1981, Cornwell might have a tough time publishing Eagle today. Although there's currently 21 Sharpe books-the most recent Sharpe's Fury was publishing in 2006-British born Cornwell's writing style is distinctly European here. (Later Sharpe novels are more American in feel and have become influenced by the television series.) Cornwell's British-ness doesn't detract from the story; the historical accuracy, the richly detailed locales, characters, or Napoleonic vibes. In fact, that British-ness adds to Eagle's charm. Some Americans, however, may have a slow start adjusting to the English wording and punctuation. Fortunately, once you're into the book, these quips disappear. The battle action comes off the page, revenge, even romance. Unlike his hesitant Napoleonic compatriot Horatio Hornblower, Sharpe knows what he wants and usually gets it. Whether it's a little lovin' or the fine line between murder and killing on the battlefield, the reader is routing for Sharpe.Director Tom Clegg's 1994 adaptation of Eagle takes all the good from the novel and places it onscreen. Script writer Eoghan Harris sometimes gives us line for line dialogue from the book. Harris knows the written Sharpe to the T, and it shows onscreen. The attention to detail and the pull of material from the Sharpe canon keep Eagle authentic to the books and the history.Sean Bean plays the titular Sharpe to perfection. Even though the reader reads time and again of the dark haired and scarred Sharpe, the blonde Bean carries all Sharpe's rough edges along with his intelligence and veiled sensitivity. Daragh O'Malley is likewise ideally cast as Patrick Harper. His scale and wit bring the Irishman to life. In a book and film with so many characters-officers and soldiers coming and going with each storyline-the entire cast of Sharpe's Eagle looks and feels the part. Some folks just don't look like they belong in a period piece, but everyone here is either Napoleonic gritty or perfectly Jane Austen. Assumpta Serena is beautiful yet strong as guerilla leader Teresa Moreno, and new Bond Daniel Craig is a young and delightfully ruthless addition-even if his Lietuenant Berry has swapped vile places with Lieutenant Gibbons onscreen.But of course, movies have to change up a few things. Written years later as a prequel, Sharpe's Rifles introduces the Sharpe characters to each other, naturally making a good fit as the first film adaptation. Much as I like the Teresa Moreno character, her premature introduction in Rifles and her odd place in the Eagle film diminishes the onscreen relationship of Sharpe and Josefina LaCosta (Katia Callabero). It's also a bit confusing later on in the Sharpe's Enemy film when Elizabeth Hurley plays Lady Farthingale-one of the aliases used by Josefina in the novels. More riflemen are also given names and personality in the television series. Only elder statesman rifleman Hagman appears in the early novels. Later novels, of course, incorporate the onscreen Chosen Men.The film adaptation of Sharpe's Eagle brings the book's essence to life. Every time I watch, I think to myself, \`this is a damn good show.' Sharpe's Eagle is neither a perfect book nor a perfect film. Both are, however, as near to perfection as is perhaps possible. Fine storytelling, characters, love triangles, action, history. If you're a fan of all things Napoleonic or even if you just like English period pieces, Sharpe's Eagle is not to be missed in either medium. Look for the DVD in several available Sharpe collections. The novel may be elusive in big box bookstores, but it is definitely worth the used store hunts or online purchase. Do, however, be prepared to read the other twenty books- Eagle is that addictive. Just look at all the Sharpe reviews I've done!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Sharpe's adventures in Iberia continue, leading up to the pivotal battle of Talavera. Now an army under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley advances from Portugal into Spain, facing a huge Napoleonic force but with the possibility of defeating it - if Spanish allies and raw troops just landed from Britain hold up their end of the bargain. A big if. Sharpe chafes as he sees others purchasing high rank, mostly undeserved, while his own accomplishments go unrewarded.Sharpe salvages some honor from a disastrous preliminary defeat, when a mission to blow a bridge becomes a fiasco, and finds himself promoted. But he's now under the command of Simmerson, a politically connected parade-ground martinet with no idea how to fight a war. He will destroy Sharpe's career unless Sharpe can win a signal victory on the battlefield redeeming the regiment's lost honor. Simmerson's equally useless nephew Gibbons, an arrogant dandy, from whom Sharpe rescues the lovely camp follower Josefina, becomes his enemy as well. Watching Sharpe's back throughout are the two Irishmen, Major Hogan the engineer and the redoubtable Sergeant Patrick Harper.As enjoyable as the others, this book only lacks Cornwell's usual battlefield clarity. The book includes no map, and Cornwell's verbal layout of Talavera, the Tagus river, two tributaries and some key hills never really came clear to me."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"BERNARD CORNWELL HAS DONE IT AGAIN WITH THIS VERSION OF THE LIFE OF RICHARD SHARPE.

Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities.

I was recently introduced to the writings of the talented Bernard Cornwell and his ability to transport the reader to a different era, by reading THE WINTER KING and THE ARCHER'S TALE. In both, Cornwell displays his knowledge of war and weapons, life and death, and human nature in both Arthurian England and during The Hundred Years' War.Cornwell's writing elicits a wide range of emotional responses, especially with the vivid descriptions of battle preparation, weaponry, and the battles themselves. In SHARPE'S EAGLE, Sharpe must not only fight the French, but he also encounters Lt. Colonel Simmerson, an arrogant and inept coward who purchased his rank and the honor and responsibility that goes with it. The battle-experienced Sharpe, the epitome of bravery and competency, finds himself in a personal struggle with Simmerson, who made an egregious error by losing the regiment's flag and then makes Sharpe the scapegoat. Sharpe devises a plan which, if successful, will return the regiment's honor and will protect him from the political manueverings of Simmerson and his cronies.SHARPE'S EAGLE served as an excellent introduction to the series and is recommended to readers who get enjoyment from historical fiction with a courageous hero who cares about his comrades and does what he believes in no matter how difficult."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Avenging the loss of his Battalion's colours, Richard Sharpe and his trusted friend Sergeant Patrick Harper, set out to capture a French battle standard... an Eagle.In Sharpe's Eagle, Cornwell again gives us the detail, and the fearsome exhilaration and confusion of personal combat and brings it to life.

I love that we experience this war through a common soldier's eyes, his experiences, his feelings. It makes each battle, the survival of each day more viscerally real. We feel Richard's frustrations with the chain of command, with the stupid system of purchasing promotions, of nepotism, of political connections being more important than merit. As well, it's an incredible and vastly irritating contrast between officers and enlisted, between the upper class and the nothing. It's another argument for nature and nurture with no advantage being held by either \\"side\\".This is the first novel in which Cornwell portrays the Spanish army as bumbling idiots incapable of organizing a party in a brewery. As accurate as he is in so many other portrayals, Cornwell does twist facts to suit his story so I am curious as to how truly bad the Spanish were. It's just so hard to believe that any leader can be so incredibly incompetent as General Cuesta not wanting to battle because the men are tired and allowing the French army to more than double its size. I just don't understand that. So, I had better suss out some books on the Spanish perspective. It will be most irritating if the primary reason for this kind of behavior and the Spanish avoiding fulfilling their side of the bargain with their English allies being simply one of pride.Gawd, how lovely is it when Col. Lawford takes over the battalion!!I love reading how Sharpe inspires the men. He has learned so much since his first promotion. He leads by example and by understanding what will motivate them. He understands what is necessary and what can be ignored. Sharpe has compassion. A man who never received compassion as a child or a young man. Who worked his way up in a system that continually thrust him down. You can't help but admire Richard Sharpe. And that's before you think of Sean Bean playing him...sigh...The StoryCaptain Hogan needs to blow up another bridge and usually Sharpe and his men would be a big enough escort but politics insists that a Spanish regiment escort Hogan and Wellesley feels a British regiment must go as well. Unfortunately for Sharpe, Simmerson's South Essex is the general's choice; fortunately for Sharpe, he is under orders to obey Hogan and not Simmerson.A fact that Simmerson hates and immediately challenges Sharpe with an impossibility. To teach the South Essex to fire three or four shots in one minute. A challenge that only Sharpe can twist back on the old bugger! And Sharpe continues to show Simmerson up.Rescuing the regiment's Colour when Simmerson abandoned it. Saving the day when Simmerson cut off their retreat and abandoned his own men and wounded. Putting down the mutiny before it happens. Saving the battle when Simmerson deserts. Even as his nephew and cohort, Lt. Berry, abuse Gibbons' woman again and again.The CharactersRichard Sharpe is just hanging on as a lieutenant; Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson does not like to be made a fool of--he does such a good job all on his own. Sergeant Patrick Harper has gotten comfortable with his rank and with his commanding officer. They are friends and they watch each other's back. The rest of his men who are mentioned include Pendleton, Daniel Hagman, Gataker, and Jedediah Horrell.Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson has raised a battalion with his own money--the South Essex. It's the ideal opportunity for Simmerson to show Wellesley how to properly run a war. All spitshine and discipline with perfectly ordered rows of polished soldiers. Lieutenant Christian Gibbons is Simmerson's toady, lackey, nephew, and arrogant womanizer. Since he agrees with anything Simmerson says, his uncle believes that Gibbons is a brilliant strategist. Lieutenant Berry is another.Those on Sharpe's side include Captain Lennox of the Light Company who had been at Assaye as well with the 78th; the 16-year-old Ensign Denny; Lieutenant Knowles; Captain Thomas Leroy; and, Major Forrest.Josefina has run away from her husband's family in Lisbon, taken in by Gibbons' promises, and rescued by Sharpe at least until she finds someone richer. Captain Claud Hardy of the Prince of Wales Dragoons is a rival for the beautiful Josefina.Lieutenant Colonel the Honorable William Lawford returns to Sharpe's orbit; an old friend from India who taught Richard how to read and write as they suffered in the Sultan Tippoo's dungeons in Seringapatam. Sir Arthur Wellesley is in command. General Rowland \\"Daddy\\" Hill remembers Sharpe. Colonel Shrapnel's invention continues to wreak havoc and General Robert \\"Black Bob\\" Crauford is one of the celebrants at the dinner celebrating the victory.The CoverThe cover is subdued blues and reds banded in the deep blue above and a subdued red below while in between the redcoats are advancing on a stone-walled fortification with a French gun crew about to fire their cannon. Not sure what the fortification has to do with this story as the French did not fight behind a walled city or fort this time.The title is perfect as Sharpe does acquire his eagle in time forestall that idiot Simmerson. Sadly, Simmerson isn't the last idiot in charge of men."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Sharpe's Eagle was the first book written in the series and falls as the eighth in the current chronological sequence. Wherever you place Sharpe's Eagle, it's a marvelous story . . . one that you will long remember.All of the great themes of the series are beautifully developed in this story: foolish dim-witted privilege versus low-birth but professional skill and courage; the lowly, poor Sharpe being fascinated by and fascinating beautiful women desired by richer, more powerful men; quick-witted discipline overcoming strategic errors and mistaken assumptions of the enemy; a beautiful friendship between Richard Sharpe and the Irish Sergeant Patrick Harper; and an uninfluential soldier being indirectly important to Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington. Like the other books in the series, Sharpe rises up to accomplish something important.Lieutenant Richard Sharpe had been left behind with a small band of 30 riflemen when Sir John Moore's retreat to Corunna had collapsed. Sir Arthur Wellesley wanted all the riflemen he could get, so Sharpe had been ordered to stay rather then returning to England to rejoin the second Battalion of the 95th Rifles. It's just as well. Sharpe had been a quartermaster before his superiors had been killed with no chance to get a battle command.His friend Major Hogan has been ordered to blow up the bridge at Valdelacasa, and Sharpe and his men are to be the escort. Because of protocol, the Spanish want to lead the way. Because of that, Wellesley assigns Colonel Sir Henry Simmerson and his South Essex Regiment militiamen to be the British honor guard.Sharpe is appalled that Sir Henry likes to flog and has taught his men to do things by the book, rather than emphasizing speed of fire. Soon, Sharpe gets a chance to make his points which makes an enemy of Sir Henry. Tensions escalate as Sir Henry takes an unnecessary risk and crosses the bridge to be blown and tries to get Sharpe to make a suicidal attack on cavalry. Sharpe declines, and Sir Henry makes a muddle. Sir Henry escapes his own mess, and Sharpe has to pull the bacon out of the fire . . . to save his own life as well as those of his men.In fact, a terrible loss occurs . . . the King's Colours are taken by the French. Sir Henry blames Sharpe and promises to get Sharpe either drummed out of the army . . . or sent to the pestilential West Indies. Sharpe makes a promise to a dying man and knows that he must avenge the loss by gaining a colour standard, a French Eagle, in compensation.From there, the story focuses on Sharpe re-establishing his honor, saving his career, and charming a pretty lady. In the process, his career takes an unexpected step.The story has great historical details, from Sharpe's use of maggots to heal a wound to part of the story being based on the actual capture of a French Eagle by Ensign Keogh and Sergeant Masterson of the 87th, an Irish regiment, at the Battle of Barossa on March 5, 1811.Naturally, not every story in the series is as good as this one. It's important to have some excellent stories to carry the not-so-excellent ones. Bernard Cornwell did his homework very well with this one.Bravo!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"This is technically the first in the Bernard Cornwell Sharpe series, and because of that, the first I read based on a timeline I saw on Mr. Cornwell's site. Granted, I started this series because I'd seen the Sharpe movies with Sean Bean, but don't let that detract from a wonderful story. Sharpe's Eagle is a fascinating story of the Napoleonic Wars (The Peninsular Wars) one rarely hears about. The detail of the battle, the battalion inner-workings, firearms of the day, and landscape were enough to keep me interest throughout the story.As for Richard Sharpe, I found him to be a hard character, willing to do anything to get the job done (soldiering, the only thing he knows) but an honorable man, too. He fights for what he believes in as much as for what his commanding officers tell him to. Brought up from the ranks, a near impossibility in the British army at the time, Sharpe is far from what other officers consider a gentleman, and yet comports himself much more gentlemanly than they. It's part of his charm as well as what often gets him into trouble.In the Historical Note, Mr. Cornwell mentions what really happened at Talavera, yet despite that, and the liberties he took with history, instead of being indignant, I'm far more curious. I'd usually toss this book against the wall and never read another in the series, yet the writing and story intrigue me to read more.The supporting characters are equally well drawn, especially SGT. Harper, who follows Sharpe throughout the series. I look forward to reading more of their exploits."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I enjoy these military historical fictions books normally and this one was a pleasant surprise. The author does a good job of mixing the personal drama with the tactical/military aspects of the period.

I find all the Sharpe books equally good including this one.So to all you Sharpe fans I say, \\"BUY ALL THE BOOKS IN THE SERIES!\\" I am currently on my 9th book and plan to buy the rest as soon as my pocket recovers *grin*Enjoy reading, you can't help but fall in love with Richard, especially if you're a chick *grin*"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I love the Sharpe books. I'm amazed that Cornwell can be so prolific (in addition to the dozens of books in the Sharpe series, he's written novels on the American Civil War and early Britain) and produce books that are always spellbinding and entertaining. The history appears to be very accurate and well researched. He even visits and walks the battlefields before writing. Sharpe's Eagle is a good one. Of course, you have to get into these books with the understanding that they're violent (as war always is) and that Richard Sharpe is a pretty ruthless fellow, at least when it comes to disposing of his enemies on the British side. It is this violent and ruthless nature that makes Sharpe a successful (you might say amazing) soldier."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Bernard Cornwell, is probably the best contemporary writer of historical adventure novels. These are great novels of the Napoleonic wars."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Richard Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell. However, Sharpe's Eagle was one of my favorites. We get to read about Sharpe as an accomplished officer, and leader. As usual, the British officers seem to be the bad guys--a few exceptions of course--but in the main they thwart Sharpe. The South Essex commander is a buffoon, and a coward. Again, Wellington helps in getting the battle account correctly, and saves Sharpe undue humilation."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is brilliant at bringing history alive with realistic recreations of events that are full of adventure. This book is a great example of Cornwell's ability as a writer."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Eagle (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #8)","review":"If you wish to find a book that is nothing but entertainment-and there is nothing wrong with that-then this is a good choice. Cornwell is a good author for action/adventure and comes through with another one. The continuing saga of Richard Sharpe a British soldier during the Napolonic wars. The series follows him from enlisted to officer.For a light and fun read give Cornwell a try."},{"Title":"Lema: An L. L.

A story in paragraph form full of cognates would be even better.- Practice exersices.- Cognates (words that are similar to the English word (but may be pronounced with the accents of the other launguage)- Audio accompaniment so you can actually hear how the word sounds.Of the 7 things listed above, this books does 1 1/2.1) Cognates gets an A+. This book is just about exclusively a book of cognates and the patterns that they come in, followed by a long list of pure cognates. Cognates are a wonderful way to add huge amounts of vocabulary (4000+ words in this book) to your language with very little work.2) Audio accompaniment. About 1 in 15 words in this book is spoken on the CD. The spoken words give you a taste of each of the different types of cognate conversions and you have to hope you can take their example and extrapolate it to the rest of the list. I only give this half credit cuz this so easily could be bolstered. How hard is it to have a native speaker read all 15 words instead of 1 when they are listed right in front of speaker. It's a opportunity lost. I would gladly pay extra to hear all the words spoken.There are no phonic pronunciations written for any words in the book. There are no uses of the words in sentences. There is no grammar. The words are not listed in categories (exect for the cognate type (ie words that end in -tion)) I think words could be categorized even at this point.This book is a tool that can be used to add great numbers of vocabulary (4000+) to your language and for that I am glad that I have it and recommend it as a gap filler in your language library.This is a partial replacement to the out of print and outrageously costly Madrigal's Magic Key to French by Margarita Madrigal (which is selling for $183 on Amazon) I have nooooo idea why this book is out of print, when the Spanish version is in every book store I go to. Go figure. Anywho, Madrigal uses the same cognate approach, but adds lots of connecting words that help you build simple sentences that can be used instantly and frequently. Madrigal's book does not have an audio accompaniment and doesn't have phonics spelled out either, but the added sentence building and practice exercises are more valuable than just listing cognates, as Instant French does. If you ever find Madrigal's French in print, send me a copy. Please! : )"},{"Title":"Instant French Vocabulary Builder [With CD] (Hippocrene Instant Vocabulary Builder)","review":"Recently my wife and I were planning a two week, once in a lifetime trip though Italy. We were very excited to see the entire country but realized that communicating might be difficult as we got into the Tuscan countryside. With this in mind we picked up a copy of Instant Italian Vocabulary Builder.Although my wife and I had a bit of Spanish and Italian while in college, we didn't retain nearly enough of the language and its structure to feel comfortable on our trip. We each spent some of our free time reading though this book and were simply amazed at how much we retained. This method of learning worked wonders for the both of us and we commented to each other on our trip that we feel we learned more in the short time spent with this book than in our entire college experience.This level of comfort with the language helped make our honeymoon a truly unforgettable experience. It allowed us to put our concerns aside and to enjoy our time in the Tuscan wine country. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fast and easy way to pick up the Italian language. Simply the best learning tool I've used while studying a foreign language."},{"Title":"Microsoft FrontPage 2003 Savvy","review":"I decided to take the publisher up on their invitation to write about the reader's experience. I am writing about the Microsoft Savvy FrontPage 2003 by C. Crumlish.On the surface this appears to be a very promising book. Right from the cover all the way to the table of contents. So what is the problem ?The problem is that Mr. Crumlish spends an awful long time belabouring points that are all too obvious. Four entire chapters are wasted on basically two points: know your audience, organise your material. Ok. I got that in chapter I. I don't need it repeated ad nauseam. Even Mr. Crumlish himself writes at one point: \\"enough with the advise\\", let's get down to business. But he never does.The two chapters that I was so looking forward to, Forms and Database connectivity are left barren of any substance. I still don't know how to write to flat files across forms. Say if I have a few pages of questionnaire that the user needs to fill out and then click submit at the very end. How is the material carried over from one from to the next ? No one tells you. Just more advice about knowing your audience and preparing your material.Then I though well I will get to the chapter on database connectivity and surely Mr. Crumlish will show us how to connect a form to a database and update the contents. No such luck.You are shown the most basic and simplistic of wizards of how to connect to a database but beyond that nothing.I don't doubt that a very sincere effort was made to create a \\"Savvy\\" book but the end result falls very short of the objective. Mr. Crumlish goes on to profusely thank the web diva for poring over his book to fix errors. Maybe what Mr. Crumlish should have done is asked a plain reader like me to go over the book and then try to build a database-enabled web site. If I am not able to then the book is pointless. And maybe that's what this book is: pointless.I will need to see if the bookshop where I bought it will take it back and allow me to exchange it for a book that does more than offer platitudes."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I have to state that all of the Titan books, this one included, are excellent and have been a long time coming. Reading about Will Ryker as captain and Deanna Troi as his wife and first lady, plus as counselor on the ship has been most enjoyable! I am so glad that the Star Trek series lives on in books at least! I recommend these books to any Star Trek fan or perhaps any Star Trek fan wannabes!"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I'm not usually a fan of science fiction, so maybe that is why I found the alien names and descriptions of alien crewmembers overwhelming. Some of the alien crewmembers made me really realize why you don't see as many of the more oddly shaped aliens on Federation ships. Maybe I'm human-centric. There is a scene where an alien with a very frail skeletal structure is easily subdued; her species can only survive in low gravity. Later on, she wants to learn martial arts from her attacker. I thought it was a little unrealistic - if a fall breaks so many of your bones, you will not be good at martial arts. Period.Also, the book seems to give Deanna a voice that is not empowering. She acknowledges her limitations but does not bring much else to the table besides her empathic abilities, which are a by-product of her species, yet her own skills and talents are downplayed. It would be nice to see some more of her diplomatic training come to the fore. She is obviously a very good advisor, the 'A Time to...' series has really developed her knowledge base, made her seem interesting and highlighted the fact that she is a very capable politician. It would seem natural that she would be very useful to a ship of Titans' mission statement. However, she doesn't seem to come into her own in this book. In fact, there are a number of scenes where it seems almost comedic. She hardly seems like a bridge officer you could look to for leadership. There are a few scenes where she uses overly technical psychiatric language in a discussion with an alien race - it seemed rather forced. It was a shame, because as a psychology minor, I always thought Troi had potential, that is wasted in this title.Riker himself doesn't seem that firm of a leader. On one hand, you want to make allowances for how new being a Captain is to him - unfortunately he has been training for this position for a little over thirty years, and half that time has been under Picard. Yet he doesn't seem to come to the fore in this story, either.It is unfortunate, but I think the author was trying to be so diverse with the crew selection that it starts seeming like a cosmic zoo in space rather than an exploratory vessel. Good idea - but the execution seems off. This may be because the crew don't have much personality individually, so altogether they seem rather dull.I cannot understand how so many readers gave this book so many stars - it seemed like Star Trek-lite, and turned me off from the books, while many of the 'A Time to...' novels got me interested. I can't in good conscience give this book a good rating - but then again, I usually don't read Star Trek, either."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"\\"Orion's Hounds\\" is an excellent addition to the TREK universe of novels.

Well, that is when the crew isn't have deep philosophical discussions about profound psychological issues. *Sic*What could have been a good story about a loose-loose situation is instead the latest piece of crap from the House that Kirk built.One group of people have been preying on intelligent space jelly (and as we all know all animals are intelligent and shouldn't be hunted or eaten. Insert knee-jerk.)For thousands of years this has been the way it's been, until our \`heroes' arrive, and in a stroke of masterful diplomacy, bring the sides together after only FIVE minutes. Wow, five whole minutes. Brilliant.This book is simply awful. I don't know how the author makes a living, I really don't.He adds the ability for Troi and Riker to communicate telepathically just to get him out of a corner later in the book.The crew conveniently invokes or ignores the Prime Directive whenever it suits the plot.Character change their mind at the drop of a hat, and will argue contrarian opinions of what they did a hundred pages previously.They jump into bed with any male/female or whatever, whenever they want.They spend pages debating vegetarian vs meat eaters. (But hey they solve that in 2 pages)Heck, a crew member bites the arm of someone while another assaults a crew member, but hey it's all good and no one gets punished.Tap...tap...tap. You know what that is?It's the sound of another nail in the coffin of the Trek franchise.While not as bad as the Article of the Federation, this is still a dreadful book.Another one-star blunder(tm) that is headed to the recycle bin.Oh and if the authors reads this: I want my $8 back please."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"This book was great . I could not put it down . I cant what until the next book. Is there going to be another ????"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I often fear that in today's fear-filled social climate, Trek's philosophy of peace and diversity is often lost on a neo-conservative, cynical and selfish new generation. The Star Jellies in the well-written novel Orion's Hounds are sentient creatures with a civilisation of their own. Would it be right for the Titan's crew to turn around and allow murder or genocide to be committed? Should respect for other cultures triumph over the respect for other lifeforms? Or are the other people implying that the Star Jellies lives aren't as important because they \\"aren't human\\"?I've also noticed plenty of complaints about \\"too many aliens\\" on the Titan's crew. As a Trek fan of two decades, I'd like to point out that the whole point of Trek was to discover new life and new civilizations. If the reader can't tolerate the idea of aliens mingling with humans, then they are essentially rejecting Gene Roddenberry's original vision. They are completely missing the point of Star Trek, and quite frankly, shouldn't bother reading or watching it at all if that's the case.The Titan series of books are a consistently very good (but not great) read. The biggest problem with Titan is that it has the biggest cast of any Trek novel I've read to date. I would strongly suggest to Pocket Books that they provide a Dramatis Personae at the beginning of each Titan novel, making it easier to follow all these characters. However, it's clear from the prose which of the cast are the 'leading' characters - and they're not who you'd expect. For instance, I find both Ra-Havreii and Melora Pazlar more interesting than the Science Officer Jaza.It's interesting to see the way that Titan's multi-species crew use their diverse talents to resolve the diverse challenges they face. In that respect, the Titan novels do carry an important message, although they don't hammer the reader over the head with it. That it is our diverse talents and abilities, united together under common values and goals, which can help us overcome the challenges that we face. It's a timely message that's sorely needed - and shows that Star Trek is more relevant than ever. Even if no one is really listening anymore."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Orion's Hounds, I am reading at the moment, I am almost finished but find myself skipping a lot of the 'jargon' as 'page fillers'. The overall context is a good idea, but there are too many unpronounceable names and descriptions that tend to take ones mind off the story.Also, some of the 'Alien' creatures do seem a bit far fetched, although one can relate to the'Jellys'.I find the Titan series to be less believable than STTNG, Enterprise, Voyager and DS9 which seem to relate more to the imagination than Titan which, although has some real characters, there are some which would just not be right in Starfleet, however trained they are.I am reading the Titan series as there are no other books available, but by choice, the other books mentioned above are far more believable and less technical and, which I feel is the most important, more entertaining.In passing, the first Titan book was quite good, the second not as good as the first and in my opinion, the third, Orions Hounds, seems to continue the downward slope."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Read this book only if you really enjoyed the Troi episodes of Next Gen.Or if you like predictable plot \\"twists\\".Or if for some reason you need to make time seem to crawl by painfully slowly."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"It wasn't as good as the first two books in the series.

I don't like reading propoganda, especially when its written under the guise of something else. Of COURSE the star trek crews are diverse-thats a GIVEN! It was never something that required force feeding, either to the reader or to the characters.Very poor, not recommended."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"FINALLY! A book where Counselor Troi shows her true value. I always thought she got short changed on the air, and in the books written while the series aired. Up to now, I always considered her part-Betazoid empathic skills to be more of a gimmick than an asset. This book easily dispels that notion.This was by far my favorite Titan book. (No slight to Misters Mangels and Martin is intended. I thoroughly enjoyed those books also.)I liked the beginnings of Mr. Bennett's development of the dynamics among Riker-Vale-Troi. They're reminiscent of the Kirk-Spock-McCoy triad, yet totally unique as well. I hope that particular element carries over to the next installment.I'm glad to see that some of the crew, both those who are already familiar to us and those who have been recently introduced, are getting a little more character development. I'm anxious to see more of the same. Hopefully, Mr. Bennett will be asked to write for this series again. I would certainly purchase it without a moment's hesitation."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Finally a Titan book that completely convinced me!In my opinion it has three major points, that are reflecting it's strength:1) crew diversityIn the first two books it was constantly mentioned, that this ship features the most biodiverse crew in whole Starfleet and the characters became intoduced, but apart from discribing differences in species appearances, the authors did not make clear, what such diversity means for a ship's crew.This book makes the difference!The alien key characters are portrayed beyond body characteristics. One really gets the feeling, that they are aliens and not just strangely looking humans from another planet. Even more noticable is, that the author lets these aliens express their cultural and biological distinctivness without succumbing to Federation standards (which are pretty much human standards), like usually shown in ST. From this arises conflict among the crew, but also strength. The characters have to adjust themselves to oneanother and have to overcome prejudice, cliches and fears in order to function as a crew - fascinating!2) no moral highground for the FederationThe author manages to portray the Titan crew as well as their opponents as complex societies with complex ethics and moral, that are not necessarily superior to one another. Christopher L. Bennett dares to take a second, unbiased look - bravo!3) a strong Deanna TroiFinally Deanna experiences a character developement, that logically reflects her past. She is one of, if not THE main character of this book and has the chance to show how fine an officer, how skilled a telepath and how passionate a wife she is. She's written strong without having to take on characteristics, that are traditionally associated with males - refreshing!"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is a 5 star; I don't know why someone would give it a 1 star.Titan Book Three is a terrific completion to the three part series depicting Captain Riker's first missions. The characters are well thought out and this book further defines all characters. This book is much better than Book Two in that you learn more about the characters. This book is very upbeat and well-worth reading; much more reminiscent of what made Star Trek so great. This book is well worth reading.I hope that the Star Trek franchise will produce more Titan books and possibly a movie or series with Titan. These books are really terrific and so reminiscent of the plots that made Star Trek so great!"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Readers of Trek!!! Did it ever bother you that in TNG Riker and Picard would be speaking to each other only to be disturbed by the communicator, never finishing the conversation?! Riker couldn't kiss Troi-or for that matter, Troi couldn't kiss Worf-without the twerp of the intercom! The viewer understood the reason for the interruptions: Too much dialogue or character development curtailed the plot development. This same technique was taken from the small screen and put into the books; however, the reason was different. Paramount wanted to keep watch over the Star Trek characters, fearing outside writers would go too far or better said, the company wanted to protect its copyright priviledges. The results were mixed.When the strategy worked, books such as True Q or Vendetta were produced. The conversations were brief, but the action was ongoing. When the strategy failed no one asked about Nightshade or Boogeyman. Regarding the protection of the franchise, this lead to stagnated characters. While Picard, Data, and Worf were given almost every opportunity to grow and explore on film and in books, Riker, Troi, Geordi and Crusher were allowed to basically languish, leaving them in an eternal time warp that stunted their development. For almost twenty years, this has been the pattern for TNG until now.What makes Orion's Hounds so special is the ability of its characters to mentally and physically evolve and communicate with each other. Personal growth and development appear to be prerequisites that each character carries with him or her. This is done using dialogue, which has often been sacrificed in Star Trek lore in order to please the objectives of TPTB. In Orion's Hounds, the characters are allowed to finish their conversation, reflect on their experiences and make decisions in accordance with earlier dialogues and events. Riker talks to Troi, Troi communicates with Vale, and Ree consults with Tuvok. Their conversations are not trivialized and abbreviated, making the reader unhappy. It is just the opposite. The reader is treated to mature conversation by the characters who are affected by their experiences and who very much want to work out their problems.How does Riker distinguish himself as a leader and what are his fears and strengths since he is no longer under the shadow of Picard? Although Vale is Number One, Troi has maturity and experience on her side. How do these women come to a consensus over their roles, so that there is a smooth chain of command on the Titan? Tuvok holds logic above all else, but what if he is no longer capable of total control over his emotions? These questions, which were for many years ignored or left up to the television programs, are written about.For people who said this book was poorly written, I can understand their unhappiness. I, too, would be upset if the rug was suddenly pulled out from underneath my feet. Over the years, despite its diversity, the reality of Star Trek is that it has catered to SWM ages 18-45, ignoring many of the very tenants that it has stood for. To please TPTB and SWM, over the years the reader received along with Picard-Data-Worf triad, an endless barrage of war stories to keep up with its nemesis, Star Wars. It didn't matter if the supporting characters suffered, the dialogue empty or a tiny majority were tired of the same refabricated tales.It was good for business until Star Trek's star began to fade after Nemesis. This is when the editors realized that another approach was necessary. War, famine and corruption cannot dominate every arm of the franchise that must somehow evolve. Characters cannot remain stagnant and eternally youthful like a Barbara Cartland romance. There is a need to recognize that readers want their favorite characters to grow and go forward. There is also a need to recognize those who are faceless such as homosexuals. Thus, the human condition of a character is many times more important than the war at hand.Based on this, Orion's Hounds is a good read. Once, in a great moon, TPTB produce something that goes outside the box. Read this book if you want something other than a meal of war. You may find yourself actually liking who Riker, Troi, Vale & Co have actually become and wishing that the true adventure of exploring space never ends."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I don't know why the pundits and apologists in the Star Trek book community (in which I deem myself a proud member) write glorious and positive reviews about every Star Trek book that comes out. Can't someone in this community just honestly say what they really think, i.e. that a lot of Star Trek books nowadays are just plain crap? I don't want to offend any writers (I envy your job), but I hope that the quality of Star Trek books that are published is indicative of lower reading ability and laziness on the part of the reading public, and not a matter of weak talent among writers. I can say this with confidence about \\"Orion's Hounds\\" because I know that Bennett can write really well. And just don't take my word for it, read \\"Ex Machina.\\" In any event, on to \\"Orion's Hounds.\\"This \\"Titan\\" series appeared promising. After a good start with the first book, it was all downhill from there. Isn't there anything else to write about except bringing back the \\"star jellies\\" from the first season of \\"The Next Generation\\" (TNG)? I couldn't even finish this book, and after a month, I don't really care anymore. The characters violate their own set of ethics (the Prime Directive) just so a group of space faring creatures won't be killed. Are we now to justify interfering with every culture that hunts to sustain itself, or that even eats meat. I don't think so, because that includes 24th century humans.The writing is weak, characters act out of character, there's a mishmash of species that don't even exist in the Star Trek universe (I could tolerate this at first, but now it's getting annoying; part of the essence of Trek is the Trek universe's unique races; by making up more and more races that don't exist as part of the Trek universe waters down the essence of Trek), and the author obviously writes with a political agenda in mind, which is fine itself, but stop preaching. It's not that I necessarily disagree with the author on some points, but I read Trek novels to escape and be entertained."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Orion's Hounds is by far the best titan book so far. this story is why star trek is made for the only down side is the 2nd half of the book slows down but it is the best one so far...."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Well, this has to be one of the best written books that I didn't really like in a lot of places. This is a very well told story with intelligent, engaging dialogue (in fact, some of the best dialogue I've read in a Trek book to date) that should give one pause and consider how tolerant a person they really are towards others and the story is competently handled as well.The problem here, which might just be me, is that I really didn't need the lion's share of a Sci-Fi fiction book to serve as catalyst for personal growth in the area of tolerance among diversity. This book, and the Titan series in general, continually bludgeons me over and over and over with how diverse the crew - and life in general in that galaxy. Don't get me wrong, I agree and the topic is treated fairly and intelligently and the discussions and stories in the books are well done. Problem is, it's more of a distraction than it should be and I'm really just looking for a little Sci-Fi escapism and a bit more fun in the Trek books I read. Intelligent fun to be sure, but still, fun.That's my biggest beef with the book, really.....not much really happens. At 50% of the way through the book it was largely set up and a lot of discussions with just a couple important scenes of any substantive action. It picks up a bit in the last half, but it's still largely intellectual and not enough mystery, action, suspense of the other elements that made for some classic Trek.So, bottom line, I rate it 3.5/5 stars because I recognize this is quality, intelligent writing....I just wish the balance that's so often talked about in the book could have been achieved with other elements in the story. Beyond that, I did like the author and have hopes that his next novel will achieve a bit better balance."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"The USS Titan is a new ship with a super-diverse crew. While most of the command crew is human, they are not the majority. The crew includes a water-breather, a predatory meat-eating reptilian doctor, a member of a micro-gravity dwelling race and many others.In this, the third Titan novel, Riker, in his new role as Captain of the Titan encounters a race of beings who hunt and kill large space-faring creates affectionately known to the crew as \`star jellies'. Star Trek TNG fans were introduced to these creatures in the 2-part series pilot episode. In his attempt to correct what he perceives as an injustice, he discovers that the truth is far more complicated and that his interference has upset the balance in a millennia-old system.In the midst of all of this, some of the crew is affected by the physic powers of the creatures, causing them to sabotage the mission. Now Riker must deal the furious hunters, a collection of hostile space creatures and psychically affected crew members as he tries to remedy the situation.The story, especially with the focus on the giant space-dwelling creatures, is interesting and moves along well. As in the previous Titan stores, the reader is subjected to the non-too-subtle social rants of the author, who even manages to slide in a page of gun control along with sermons on tolerance.If you do not mind that, then you should enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"With \\"Orion's Hounds\\" being the third book of the Titan series, I'll say that this is the second best book of the series. What makes this book so good and a stand-out among the other novels it's that it has an original plot. This is a departure from other novels, other plot lines, things that have perhaps dominated and bogged down modern-day Trek. This novel is about exploration and a conflict that has you torn between the different sides.It's not hard to get into or to read; if you haven't read the other two Titan novels, you'll be missing out on the crew's first big adventure and mission. Yet, this novel is more like the true start of the Titan series. The first novels were a setup to the crew and new ship. It also continued plots from the \\"A Time to ...\\" series as well as served as a continuation and wrap-up to the film Star Trek Nemesis and an earlier novel written by the the authors. This one though is easy to get into, there are some references to the past novels but it serves a true showcase of the new series and Riker as the captain.This novel also deals with the large cast of characters well. There are still a lot of characters to keep up with but it's better dealt with in this novel than in the previous ones. It actually is a good Deanna Troi novel. The author amusing has her voice what many fans of Trek have said in the past; that she simply voices what can be clearly seen and that she's more there for show than for actual use. In this novel, Troi uses her empathy well and shows off her diplomatic skills. Riker must also learn to balance his duties as a captain with his relationship with Troi, an interesting situation that is explored.The new aliens introduced are also interesting. They aren't completely bad and they aren't good but the author actually provides a lot of moments for the audience to decide things for themselves and to actually think while they're reading the novel. At times, there's a lot of description or information being packed in, making the novel feel as if it's dragging at some parts, but that is one of the few flaws that held this novel from being a five-star, in my opinion.This is definately a recommended reading. If you haven't read a Titan novel yet, this is a nice place to start, in my opinion. This is the true mission, perhaps where the Titan series should have started. Going back to exploration is an interesting theme to play with since Trek has been about war and corruption in the past few years. It's refreshing though and has an early \\"The Next Generation\\" feel to it. Definately worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"This book is an emotional roller-coaster. The first quarter was good, the last quarter was enjoyable, but they just don't make up for the middle half. The first quarter is essentially about establishing the crew. There are all sorts of small details to fix them in our minds. In fact, I noticed that Bennett, a much less experienced author than the two who wrote the first two Titan books, avoided one of their mistakes. In those books it is hard to keep track of which character is which. Bennett always gives us little reminders of what they look like or what species they are. I had no problems keeping track this time. Apart from that, while the author is very fond of using excessive introspection, there is a lot of good dialogue. The characterisations are all well done, and at this stage enjoyable. His descriptions are excellent. In fact, this is a good point to say that that is one area he succeeds in throughout the book. The backcover blurb mentions that this book deals with space-dwelling creatures. It is a major part of the book and the author does a great job. Take the best and most awe-inspiring documentary you have ever seen on whales, or other sea creatures, and imagine it done in space, and hopefully you will have some idea of the scope of this. The author isn't afraid to be daring in other areas either. At one point Troi is channelling some space aliens' emotions and reactions, and she basically has an orgasm right on the bridge, with what must be a dozen people carefully not watching her. It is very well done and well handled.So, what goes wrong? The ship encounters a group of aliens shooting at some of the spacedwellers, who are sentient and send out a distress call. It is not much surprise that Riker charges in and disrupts the fight. But in total contravention of what Kirk or Picard would do, and the Prime Directive, he then declares that the victims were pure and innocent, and despite his verbal protests sides with them absolutely. The crew and the reader spend two hundred pages being shown just what a stupid decision that was. It is two hundred pages of guilt trips and self-recrimination. Riker also throws in a few lectures to Christine Vale about his plans to use the Luna series to restore Starfleet's virtues, while cooperating in ruthless and brutal combat. The crew's supposed allies also give frequent self-righteous and gloating speeches about how natural selection favours the ruthless and brutal because such people kill off moral and principled. Also, the crew and the general situation are presented as having the same fault lines as American society, and every single one of them is stressed to breaking. It makes me wonder what is left for the next author to work with. It is too long, too intense, about issues that are way too inflammatory for me in the real world, and it is just too much.Then, at about the three quarter mark, the characters do a 180 and start acting like Starfleet officers again. They stop accepting the aliens' \\"be murderer or victim\\" viewpoint and start working out ways for everyone to talk through their problems and stop fighting. The solutions they come up with and how they work out are very imaginative and quite well done, although you can tell how the aliens are going to respond from a mile off. Actually, that is a problem throughout the book. When it comes to explaining and dealing with issues, the author refuses to be subtle. Virtually every single emotional problem every character has is dealt with only by being dragged out and confronted full on. It might work if it was just one or two characters, or on issues actually central to the topic. But virtually every character in the book has some major emotional issue, and virtually every one is dealt with in this brutally direct fashion. It is once again just too much to handle for just one book.It is hard for me to summarise my feelings about this book. I guess I would have to recommend against it. The sections that are enjoyable just do not make up for the relentless focus on everything that is morally wrong with the situation, and the crew's attempt to rationalise it rather than work to change it goes on far too long. As for the series so far, I find that the last two books have been too morally ambiguous and too bloody. Spoiler warning here: as Riker himself points out, this is the second mission to involve the death of an entire planet's population, and I also don't want this to be a regular part of the Titan's adventures. Still, I continue to like the characters, so unless they bring in David Mack to kill most of them off I will be getting the next one. With that said, unless it is by this author. He has joined the unfortunately lengthening list of skilled authors whose Trek writing style I dislike."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"While the bar wasn't terribly high from Titan's first two titles, Orion's Hounds is the best Titan adventure so far. Admittedly, this novel starts a little slow, but does establish an interesting storyline. I always enjoy the manner in which some Trek authors bring together different pieces of Trek canon (makes me feel very nerdish) and this book found some untouched material.In terms of a story, there isn't a strong or clear villian to Titan's hero relationship, and the most clear conflict in the final stretch was over far too quickly. I'm willing to forgive typical storylines because this book finally got Titan's exploration underway and moved beyond known space.If you skipped the first two novels, you should pick up Titan here. The first two only established a few pieces of the story arc, namely Vale's acceptance of First Officer (but if you read A Time for War, A Time For Peace, you'd probably already be under that impression), Tuvok and his wife joining Titan."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I discovered this series after the A Time To... series and am in love with it. I love Riker. I am also liking Keru's sub story and the diversity it adds."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Christopher L. Bennett delivers more great Star Trek with the third installment of the Star Trek: Titan series. Orion's Hounds is definitely the best Titan book so far, stretching the series up to another caliber of sci-fi writing.This book has nearly everything: it adventures into the unknown, but connects to previous Trek lore from the books and TV series; the main dilemma the crew faces is multifaceted and requires an intelligent, empathetic, moral, and creative solution; it's informative in a well-written and easily accessible manner; the dialogue is superb.With the cornerstones of a good Star Trek book in place, what puts this book beyond the rest is its ability to weave character development into the main plot. Anecdotes and side conversations don't feel forced or misplaced, and one learns about the characters while they perform relevant tasks to their mission.This book is paced slower than some of the previous Trek novels, and it isn't as action-oriented, if that's what you care about. Some of the lines to close chapters are also a bit cheesy.Overall, I highly recommend this book to any Star Trek fan, even if you have not read the previous Titan novels."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I bought and read the first 3 Titan books all in a row, just about as quickly as I could. In my other reviews of the first 2 books, I stated that I enjoyed the stories, but could have done without the whole gay theme. The stories were quite good, in my opinion, though.This 3rd book, written by a new author from the first 2 books, wasn't a very good addition to the series. The author did a good job in writing, for the most part, but he tended to over-describe several situations in which it seemed like he was just adding fluff and words to make the book longer. Most of these rants didn't add anything to the story.And I have to agree with one previous reviewer who said that the \\"star jellies\\" story wasn't all that interesting. This book was the \\"Star Trek 5\\" addition to the Titan series and I hope to see the next few books much stronger additions than this one.The most annoying thing about this story was that Riker was made out to be a weakling. His indecisive actions contradicted the Prime Directive, caused more trouble for his crew, and pretty much left Deanna in charge of being the leader in the story. This is NOT the Riker that we all grew to know in the TNG series. I certainly hope that the next book includes a more powerful Captain to lead the new voyages of Titan."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Great science fiction opens your mind to new possibilities, ideas and concepts. \\"Orion's Hounds\\" by Christopher L. Bennett is outstanding science fiction. Ingenious and enthralling, \\"Orion's Hounds\\" balances scientific theory with character driven adventure in a vibrant story that challenges the Star Trek mythos.Now that the Romulan storyline necessitated by the movie Star Trek: Nemesis has been wrapped up with the previous Titan novel The Red King, in Orion's Hounds the series can boldly go forward with original new adventures and Christopher L. Bennett has crafted the perfect story to do just that.Bennett's prose is spellbinding. The rich narrative enables the reader to clearly visualize some of the more bizarre alien species that populate Titan's crew and I really liked how the author took full advantage of character interactions to help build up a portrait of the varied cultures of the characters. The story allows you to feel as if you're really beginning to know the characters and consequently you care more about them.As satisfying as the character development is, it is the authors extremely vivid descriptions of the cosmozoans and the region of space in which they thrive that makes \\"Orion's Hounds\\" really stand out. Bennett's first novel \\"Ex Machina\\" demonstrated his talent for creating alien species and in this novel he lets his ample imagination loose with the Pa'haquel, the species that hunt the star-jellies.That the author found several ways to effortlessly pay tribute to Star Trek: The Next Generation is just an added bonus when you're reading \\"Orion's Hounds\\" but best of all, on top of everything else, you're left feeling like you can't wait to meet up with these folks again."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"It was like sitting in front of your TV and watching it unfold before your very eyes....I love this series so far. The characters are multi-active and very interesting."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"This was one of the best Star Trek books that I have read in quite a while - and I've been reading a lot of them. I liked the first two Titan books (and I won't go into the whole gay thing, since everyone else has, and I knew that it would be greatly de-emphasized once different authors started writing for the Titan crew), but Bennett has a great handle on the characters and Star Trek in general.While the \\"things are never what they seem\\" theme is used a LOT in Star Trek, it was nice to keep guessing on who or what had which motives. I liked the reappearance of the star-jellies, too. The whole predator/prey angle was very nicely laid out as well, and some more character back-history was filled in for Melora Pazlar, Lavena, Chaka and even Vale (though we really didn't need the whole \\"guns are bad\\" speech from Vale - she's former security/police officer and should not be making maudlin arguments). There is a small \\"pay it forward\\" subplot which I really enjoyed. And Troi (who I have always defended as a character), finally gets to shine and show off her range of talents, rather than just being the resident empath/lie detector, a role which too many writers have shunted her off to.And I haven't seen anyone else comment on this, so I will... the characters of the other counselors onboard Titan make appearances in this book. One of them, Haaj, is a Tellarite, a species well known in Star Trek. The other, Huilan, is identified as a male S'ti'ach, a new species. Or so it would seem. His description (created by Martin and Mangels initially, and acknowledged by Bennett) entailes the words blue, furry, toylike, bear-like, extra set of arms, dorsal spines, black eyes... does this sound familiar to anyone else? Particularly anyone who has ever seen the movie Lilo and Stitch (one of my all-time favorite movies)? Huilan is a dead ringer for Stitch!!! And if you don't believe me, just remove the apostrophes and replace the \\"a\\" from S'ti'ach with a \\"t\\" and tell me what it says. I think the writers are having fun with us! I love it, though!I hope that the powers-that-be keep the Titan series going. Most everyone seems to be enjoying them and there is a freedom in novels that you can't get on television. Star Trek is more than capable of living and thriving in print, under the watchful eye of editors who will keep the continuity in check. I hope that we don't have to wait too long before another Titan book is published, especially if the quality of these novels stays consistent."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I don't know why someone would give \\"Orion's Hounds\\" only 1 star. They must have read a different novel, because the one I read was full of marvelous ideas, wonderful characterization, and a number of exciting action sequences.The TITAN series of novels has focused on establishing a wide and varied crew, comprised of established TV favorites and original characters from the book range. The books use the cast to its advantage, reminicient of Deep Space 9 in how richly developed both the main and \\"secondary\\" characters were. Here, \\"Orion's Hounds\\" does a fantastic job of not only showing us the wonder and awe of space exploration akin to the Original Series, but establishes an amazing view of a cosmic ecosphere including entities and lifeforms in such detail that we could never have seen on a television show. There are a lot of \\"high concept\\" ideas shown in \\"Orion's Hounds\\", and Bennett's wonderful prose eases the reader into them, so that one is never lost. This is not just any other media tie-in fiction- this is true science fiction and can stand up against any other \\"standard\\" sci-fi novel released today. If you love science fiction and/or Star Trek, or want to read something that tops any Star Trek put out on TV for the past six years, read \\"Orion's Hounds\\"."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I loved the first two Titan books. This book however was so so. I the first set of plot twists were good, but after that there are creatures that I think should have been left in the TV show and in this new part of space I was hoping for new \\"monsters\\" or non sentient beings. I think this author was trying to show how clever they are. I just didnt put it down and say. That was a good reading. still that is my opinion. I will read just about anything the franchise puts out."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"ORION'S HOUNDS by Christopher L. Bennett is a book that amply showcases the author's gift for thinking on a grand scale while remembering to tell stories on a deeply personal level.Bennett has conceived a richly layered and complex space-based ecology made up of enormous \\"cosmozoans,\\" creatures that live in deep space, travel between the stars, and experience life in ways that small planet-bound beings never do. The variety of these \\"astrocoelenterates\\" --- some seen in the Star Trek: The Next Generation television series, others wholly original to Bennett's novel --- coexist in a shifting balance of symbiosis, cooperation, and predation. Some are intelligent, while others are more like massive animals.Living among these creatures are the Pa'haquel clans, bipedal avians who lord over a multispecies community that hunts and harnesses the bodies of one species of cosmozoan, then uses those mechanically reanimated shells to hunt other space-beasts and defend worlds from the interstellar giants' ravenous appetites.Then enter the Starship Titan and her crew, led by Captain Riker. Drawn by psychic pleas for help from the sentient cosmozoans hunted by the Pa'haquel, Riker and his crew do their best to stop the slaughter of the beings they affectionately know as \\"star-jellies.\\" But their well-intentioned efforts to foster peace and understanding have unexpected and tragic consequences.The same richness and diversity that Bennett brings to his deep-space \\"ecosystem\\" also informs his wonderful handling of the Titan's multispecies crew. When it comes to describing the points of view of beings that are truly alien and not just \\"humans with bumpy foreheads,\\" Bennett ranks at the top of the current roster of Star Trek authors, alongside Heather Jarman.A welcome discovery is that the crew of the Titan --- though their diversity often leads to misunderstanding, unease, and sometimes conflict --- demonstrate the spirit of tolerance that is at the heart of Star Trek. They don't give in to their fears or their resentments; they confront their prejudices; they reach out to those they don't understand and try to bridge the gap. Bennett understands that exploration is not just about venturing out into space but also about looking into our own souls. Another refreshing trait that they exhibit, with each other and with those they encounter, is one that is not often seen in Star Trek crews: humility.Bennett's seamless fusion of real science with Star Trek's pseudo-science gives the book great verisimilitude, and his deft plotting and snappy dialogue make the book a genuine pleasure to read. Its resolution is one that builds logically on all the pieces of his narrative puzzle, and one that reinforces what many of the best Star Trek tales have been about: optimism, communication, peacemaking, and trying to make the places you visit better and safer for all the life-forms that exist there.This is a book that embodies the noblest, bravest, and most hopeful aspects of Star Trek's enduring legacy. Add this one to your collection now."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I thought when this series arrived; it would portray Riker the way he was in the TV series; which was uneven at best. This series gives Riker and Troi a chance to shine. It makes me wonder why the Next Generation wasn't allowed to remain on the air with Riker as captain. Perhaps this book series will be seen by a writer/producer who will make Star Trek: Titian a TV show!The characters are portrayed better than they were on television. Tuvok is the most surprising of all. I never expected to see him on the ship. I thought he would always be part of the Voyager series.I was glad to see a visit from the Farpoint Jellyfish aliens from the first episode of Next Generation. Melora, from that single episode of Deep Space Nine plays a role in this book. It's good to see the author take characters and elements from the TV show. We get to see where they are today. If the series continues in this direction it will last a long time!"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"Titan: Orion's Hounds by Christopher Bennett is the best of the first three books in the Titan series. Bennett has a better handle on how to use Deanna Troi than Martin and Mangels did, and the crew is finally starting to gel as a team. Bennett also touches on aspects of a multi-species crew that are often overlooked-- for instance, how does a group of carnivorous predators get along with a group of herbivores?However, this series continuing weakness regarding Riker is disturbing. He fares slightly better in this book but is still much too tentative and unsure. Come on folks-- bring back the Will Riker of The Best of Both Worlds!This book revisits a familiar set of aliens, the telepathic space jellies from Encounter at Far Point, and sets up an interesting conundrum regarding the Prime Directive. It also dares to question the wisdom and purpose of the Prime Directive, which, although bordering on heresy in the Star Trek universe, is an idea whose time may have come.I have read several reviews of this book and the first two in this series who are critical of the openly homosexual relationship between two of the crewmembers. I did not feel this relationship was inappropriate or over emphasized, it was treated the same as heterosexual relationships have always been treated in the series. Indeed, much of the first episode of DS-9 dealt with Sisko's resentment of Picard because of the death of Sisco's wife during the Borg wars. Star Trek has always been in the forefront of inclusiveness, and these books continue in that tradition.I could, however, have done without the very public orgasm Troi experienced on the bridge of the Titan during a mating of the aliens. That was just a little too much TMI."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The characters were handled well, with the Starfleet characters demonstrating a good balance between trying to avoid interfering in the development of other cultures and trying to save innocent lives; the opposition were decent folks with a different culture and a different approach to life, rather than being cardboard villains, and even within their group, there was variation in personality and opinion. All in all, one of the best Star Trek books I've read in a while."},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"I picked this up at a book swap. I'm a longtime science fiction fan, also a fan of Original Star Trek, but I have mostly avoided Star Trek novels. I don't like their \\"dependency\\"--the amount of prose dedicated to tying this book in with the whole Trek 'canon', the history of Captain this & that, and most of all I am bored by \\"ship porn\\" (exposition about the layout of the ship, its engineering, Starfleet chain of command and other such geekery.)What I am really interested in is astrobiology. I want to see alien ecologies, races, cultures, and I really hope to see ones that aren't simply Earthlings in rubber suits. This book delivers on that. It is about \\"cosmozoans\\"--beings that are larger than solar systems, beings that exist on neutron energy that floats between stars (or something), beings that eat planets for lunch! Now those are some REALLY alien beings.So this book was a real page-turner! Oh, there were some parts that got a little over the top. The message was pounded in a little heavily. But on the whole this was what science fiction (an almost extinct genre) should be like! I also loved the part Deanna Troi played as a telepathic negotiator trying to understand these cosmic 'jellyfish' and their hunters and get them to cooperate. I never liked Deanna on the show because she just seemed to be window dressing, put there to show off her cleavage. This was the first time I really liked her as a character.I will admit that some of the aliens on the starship Titan were kind of silly, and there were way too many of them. I couldn't keep track of most of the characters, and I didn't care about them either. The only characters that I really remembered or cared about were Deanna, and the Vulcan Tuvok. (I always love Vulcans.)Anyway, after I enjoyed this so much, I decided to order more of the Titan series!"},{"Title":"Orion's Hounds","review":"It isn't that I have a problem with the story so much as the writer. The actual plot is pretty good, and brings together quite a few concepts from the Star Trek universe in an interesting way. Unfortunately Christopher Bennett plays the characterizations of the crew in the same way a toddler plays a piano. He picks one annoying note for each character and hammers it over and over again. Tuvok has had some rough experiences that make it hard to maintain his cool vulcan demenor translates to Tuvok being reduced to the whiny angsty teenager with severe confidence issues. Ra-Havarii's love for the company of women is irritatingly over stated, and the constant bickering of the Rikers is something right out of high-school. There is no subtlety at all. For all Bennett does the same thing in his other novels (Greater Than the Sum springs to mind... a vulcan who wants to be a D&D elf princess?) it seems much more jarring with the Titan. Perhaps it is just that most of the crew is relatively undeveloped and he feels the need to \\"make his mark,\\" but I hope that he learns how tone it down a bit in the next novel."},{"Title":"Savannah Spell","review":"A good read for being emersed in the lives of historically correct characters. The setting of the Revolutionary War South is filled with heretofore untold historical truths that will help you understand these amazing people as the author builds their characters before your eyes. Had a hard time resting this book once I started reading it. Five sittings, I think, and it was consumed. The descriptions of the landscapes brought vivid images that were beautiful,haunting and accurate. Delicately, the author developes the women and through them she builds the men. How wonderful these images play to all, especially a southern man. I speak as one, and thank the author for giving us these images to envision and enjoy. Above all else, she addresses the Southern connection to the British that seems to have been vilanized in history, but was truly an act of loyalty that the South has never quite fully understood. At this time of unity with Great Britain, she gives us a refreshing view of the world that once existed and how God's hand ruled then and we became who we are today. &quot;Hats off&quot; to this author'NYW Peacocke', please give us more from your insightful perspective on the times that have shaped this world in which we live. You've left me hanging with my &quot;Savannah Spell&quot; experience. I anxiously await your sequels."},{"Title":"Savannah Spell","review":"I enjoyed Savannah Spell. The part-Indian, blue-eyed slave girl aptly named Sky captured my interest right at the start and held it throughout. \\"\`By the way,' Charles asked, \`who planted that garden you're digging up?' \`Mostly Sky,' Lucy said. \`That figures; there's a medicinal plant among them that can be deadly.'\\" The author weaves sly, spell-casting, murderous Sky in and out of this account of mixed loyalties, love and casual love, and military and naval skirmishes set in the colonial south of 1773. Not familiar with the history of that period in the southern context, I liked how the author carried me so easily into its 18th century customs, beliefs, concerns, and needs, and felt as though I were living right along with her characters in colonial Augusta, Beaufort, Charleston, and Savannah. I enjoyed the interplay of loyal English colonists and Horse Rangers, disloyal patriots and their French backers, British-protected Indians and their unusual marriage customs, and two childhood friends, daughters of a planter and a parson, who split and spread their loyalties as they follow divergent paths to life and love. Savannah Spell is an engaging rendering of a less-examined but most remarkable time in our nation's history. \\"Although this story is fictitious,\\" wrote the author in her epilogue, \\"many of the characters are historical figures and their fate well known.\\" She has cast southern colonial history on a delightful stage. Sky and her other principal characters live on in my mind, and I look forward to renewing my friendship with them in the author's two planned sequels."},{"Title":"Savannah Spell","review":"I loved this book!

This is so much fun and exciting to read, it's just one you have to read and find out for yourself and see what happens next!"},{"Title":"What It Is, And How It Is Done","review":"A few years ago, I was on a Crispin Glover kick. I watched the majority of his movies, got his album on cd AND vinyl, and bought each of his books that were published and made available to his fans. But even in that fanboy state, I could see that his books weren't anything too special. What It Is and How It Is Done is probably the least interesting of his 4 main books. Yes, the cover makes it look like you're in for a visual treat, but that's about as far as it goes. Also keep in mind that the picture here is of the second printing. The first printing has a standard hardcover with metallic graphics, while this one uses an image from one of the pages. There's also a slight size difference between both versions for some reason.So what's the book about? It's mostly a collection of 'weird' pictures with some text here and there. Basically, this is supposed to be art, and it's up to you as to whether or not it's interesting. A lot of the pictures presented aren't that odd, and I kept hoping for something as weird as that of the cover image's. While Rat Catching and Oak-Mot were original books that Crispin edited into works of his own, this is just pictures (both photographs and illustrations) with text here and there. It's nice to look at once in a while, but that's it. The only people that are going to be giving this thing 5 stars are those who think everything Crispin does is brilliant (they obviously never watched Charlie's Angels and its sequel), and won't listen to anyone who thinks differently. It doesn't help that the book isn't very long either, so it's not like you're getting a really big collection of pictures either.Since the book was so limited, it tends to go for very high prices, even with the reprint. I actually can't believe I paid just a few dollars shy of a Ben Franklin for this book in 2004. If you can get it for a lot cheaper (like 1/5 of that), then you can bump the rating up a star. Otherwise, you're not missing anything by not having this book. There are photo books out there that are MUCH more interesting for a fraction of the price."},{"Title":"What It Is, And How It Is Done","review":"After experiencing Crispin's stage performance of his modified and mutated text works I have to say this should be extremely hard hitting and mind blowing judging from the cover photos and total concept.Glover is the greatest!J.H. in Toronto"},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"&quot;Lit Life&quot; or Lit Lite? That's the question that pops to mind after finishing this pseudo roman a clef.Its formula is simple: take the last half-century of American lit, New York division only, and wrap it around the theme of an artist's struggle between the demands of art and the temptations of commerce.&quot;Lit Life&quot; would make a great party game, along the lines of the one played in the book, in which the first line of a novel is quoted and the players must come up with the book and author. Is Bret Easton Ellis or Jay McInery closer to Kyle Clayton, the brat pack hotshot who's eight years past the blazing success of his debut novel, now infested with writer's block and an adoration of alcohol, on the outs with his friends, his co-writers and his agent? Then there are his potential mentors: the elderly &quot;writer's writer&quot; -- meaning critical favorite but no sales -- Richard Whitehurst, whose last book, in the works for ten years, bombed (let's see, reclusive yet respected and depressive, that's William Gaddis, and the decade-long book that bombed could be &quot;The Tunnel,&quot; by William Gass); and Arthur Trebelaine, the popular writer with the Hemingwayesque reputation (Herman Wouk? Mario Puzo? How about Irwin Shaw? Discuss.)When Kyle's latest escapade made him persona non grata in Manhatten, he accepts Richard's invitation to spend the summer with him at his house on Long Island. There, he finds himself rejuvinated enough to resume writing, but he's also plunged into Whitehurst's crippled family, consisting of his estranged and attractive younger wife, the drug-addicted wild daughter who blames daddy for everything bad that's happened to her (Elizabeth Wurzel! Just kidding.). Kyle also finds himself becoming the rope in a tug-of-war between Richard and Arthur, whose close friendship is unraveling rapidly under the stress of jealousy, envy, paranoia and fear.Don't expect to find sympathetic characters; the three writers are sometimes charming, but all monsters in different ways, and their self-absorption makes me want to hit them with a clue stick. But if you're interested in the tribulations and paranoias of the writing life, &quot;Lit Life&quot; offers a stress-free, sometimes amusing voyage, sort of like the &quot;Pirates of the Carribbean&quot; ride at Disneyland: see the old-fashioned agent dunking pickles into his coffee at a deli meeting with a writer; see the rapacioius publisher threatening to sue to get Kyle's advance back; see the combination of back-biting and brown-nosing that goes on at a PEN party. Some of the story lines don't make sense. Would &quot;The Paris Review&quot; really favor a profile of Trebelaine over Whitehurst? And what did Chevy Chase do to Wenzel that earned him an extended cameo as a buffoon during a charity softball game on the Hamptons that co-starred Martha Stuart, Billy Joel and coach John Grisham?Wenzel displays a wonderful skill at crafting satirical barbs and effortless prose, which writers know takes a lot of work to achieve. &quot;Lit Life&quot; is a slightly pre-chewed chunk of summer fiction that can be read and digested before the weekend's over."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I'm no literary guru or genius, but I know what I like when I see it, and I like this book -- a lot.Without sounding as if I'm saying that the story is plain, this book is proof that sometimes the way a story is told is more important than the story itself. Sure, the tale of the two major writer-characters is interesting, but without Wenzel's extraordinary character development, it might not be satisfying enough; Wenzel's efforts in this regard left me feeling not only that I knew the characters very well, but also that I had summered with them in the Hamptons. And what colorful characters they are! You may not uncover the meaning of life, but you will have a good time -- and isn't that what it's all about?If you've ever even contemplated writing a novel, or if you have a love affair as many of us do with all things New York (City and Hamptons, that is), then this book will give you pleasure.Well done, Mr. Wenzel!"},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Lit Life is Kurt Wenzel first novel, and is centered on three characters: Kyle Clayton, whose first novel was a huge success, but has written nothing else for years; Richard Whitehurst, who is called America's most underrated writer, having failed to achieve success despite a lifetime of hard work and respectable reviews; and Whitehurst's wife Meryl, who after decades of marriage to Whitehurst sees their relationship dying as a result of the writer's failure to achieve the success he has dreamed of. Clayton and Whitehurst could not seem more different -- Clayton has spent the years since his first novel getting drunk and chasing women, while Whitehurst has shown an almost monkish dedication to his work, to the point that he is alienated from his wife and daughter. However, the differences between the two result in a relationship. Clayton has long admired Whitehurst's work, and Whitehurst admires Clayton's work and envies his fame. By the time the two meet, that fame has gone sour -- Clayton finds himself listed in an article in New York magazine as one of the 100 most obnoxious New Yorkers. Whitehurst persuades Clayton to spend the summer with him in the Hamptons, and this intrusion into Whitehurst's settled life has consequences that no one could have expected.This description of the plot makes the book sound like grim reading. It is not. Clayton's escapades at throughout the book, as he gets drunk, behaves (at times) badly, and ponders the possibility of agreeing to product placement in his next book are all very funny. The last idea is not as fanciful as it sounds; a noted British novelist agreed to such a deal (I don't know if Wenzel anticipated it or not). While Wenzel has some interesting things to say about the life of a writer, he does so in a way that has broad appeal -- this is not a navel-gazing book. And Wenzel is quick to see the humor in his other charactes as well. The book is best described as a satire.Wenzel is a highly skilled writer. He moves the vantage point of the novel from Clayton, to Whitehurst, and to Meryl to show how the characters view themselves and each other. This is an effective way to flesh a character out. And Wenzel handles his three main characters well -- none of them are stereotypes.The book moves smoothly from comedy to tragedy, with an very effective ending. I look forward to Wenzel's next book."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"then literature has a red-headed step child in Lit Life!

Right away. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Kurt Wenzel's debut novel is a smashing success. Where is all the buzz? So much is written and spoken about lesser works with this one book having some real moxie. It is both an easy read and an expose on writers and writing. Wenzel makes you laugh and cry about the whole publishing world. The struggle is over writing the Great Novel versus something that can put food on your table (or booze in your belly!) His characters allow him great lattitude in terms of plot but it is essentially their personas on which the novel is predicated. Comparisons are sure to follow (and curse) this budding author. Wolfe, McInerney, Ellis, even a less sophisticated Fitzgerald. Lets just allow Wenzel to be Wenzel and just hope that he keeps on writing, however irreverently!"},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I first saw Lit Life recommended in GQ for summer reading. Seeing that it took place in NYC and the Hamptons and the hero was a young man that crossed the line of bon vivant over to right out drunk, I could not resist. Started the book on a Sunday by the pool, finished that evening at 3 AM &#8230;. meaning I could not put the book down.Wenzel&#8217;s magic with the characters gave me a roller coaster ride of emotions. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I liked or despised Kyle. You wanted to appreciate Richard for always trying so hard and for sticking to his guns, but it was very easy to get frustrated with his inability to live in the real world. The rest of the characters were so complex that when they did something that you would immediately hate them for; they made you think twice and put yourself in their shoes.Mixing the glamour of wealth with modern day NY, Wenzel brings you into world the East Coast literary scene. It&#8217;s F.Scott Fitzgerald meets Candice Bushnell (in a good way). It&#8217;s just great easy to read writing. The kind of book you can read on the beach with distractions and then back at home in solitude.On it&#8217;s day of release Wenzel&#8217;s book gets a glowing review from the NY Times, looks like the critics like him, now will the public turn him a into a success?I hope so because I can&#8217;t wait to read his next novel."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I enjoyed this book. I sat down this morning at 10a.m. and at 5pm, I finished the last page feeling that I'd got my money's worth on the purchase price. Given that I don't feel that way with every new book that I read, I'd say that alone affords it a couple of stars.Wenzel has done a good job of describing the writer's life, presented a cast of characters which stand on their own as interesting, a fun to read story that yes, mixes Cheever and Bret Easten Ellis/Jay McInerney in a fun to read story about publishing, New York, celebrity, dysfunctional families, and the pleasures of making a fool out of yourself at a party of stuffed-shirts.Not only do I recommend this book....I'd buy his next one."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I love this book! It has two writers wrestling their literary demons in the Hamptons which makes it really fun and beautiful. The characters qualities are very likeable, in that if you look to heroes who don't sell out on their art or craft, they are true people to look up to. Especially in a time when everybody is so commercial. I'm a writer and it really inspired me. There are moments of dramatic highs that have you gasping and humor that has you howling. What reviews haven't mentioned is the incredible family drama that unfolds in very intense, sad and beautiful ways. One of the most literary yet readable novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I'll be up front: this book was not what I was hoping for. I'd read in the descriptions that it was about two writers at different points in their lives spending together. I naively thought that meant they would form some sort of bond and learn about WRITING and life from each other. That never really materialized. Instead, \\"Lit Life\\" is a \\"satire\\" that demonstrates all that is wrong with the publishing industry; it is a book more concerned with dishing dirt than building an effective, meaningful story. In a world where sleaze sells, \\"Lit Life\\" is there with all the sleaze a modern reader could ask for. Drugs, drinking, sex, affairs, and ultimately a suicide; this book is like a literary soap opera.\\"Lit Life\\"'s main conundrum is that either you can be a great artist with no recognition like Richard Whitehurst or popular, rich, and not talented like Richard's nemesis Arthur. These two spend a summer trying to bend young, troubled author Kyle Clayton to their point of view. There is no real middle ground if you believe \\"Lit Life\\"; you're either one or the other. You can't be a wealthy and talented writer, can you? Unfortunately I don't know enough famous writers to answer that question, but I don't believe that for a moment. As a writer hoping to get published someday, I CAN'T believe that.Overall, my problem with \\"Lit Life\\" is that Wenzel glosses over important moments of the story. For example, readers never even see Richard invite Kyle to stay with him. Nor do readers see much of Richard and Kyle together during the summer; everything that Kyle learns from Richard is told second-hand instead of actually witnessed by the reader. Take Wenzel's word for it, Kyle was really influenced by Richard. Wait, wasn't that the whole crux of the story? Wasn't that THE story? So maybe it's just me, but I think we might want to flesh that out a little more than a couple paragraphs here and there. No, instead let's talk about another party, that's really what this story is about--parties.Enough of my ranting. If you're in the publishing industry then I suggest you read this book; this \\"satire\\" will probably be right up your alley. Or if you want some light airplane reading and want to believe that all writers are either toiling futilely or selling their souls to Hollywood, then \\"Lit Life\\" has you covered. For those few who want a book more interested in developing a story than dishing gossip, move on to something else.Was this review helpful to you? Nope. Was it helpful to me?

They reminded me of people I've read about, and some are cameos from real celebs (Chevy Chase makes a real ass of himself!)... Wenzel is somewhere between Wolfe, Hemingway, Russo and B.E.Ellis.

In fact, what this book does have, ultimately, is a great sense of humanity."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As the novel begins, it seems you're in for comic satire, as young writer Kyle Clayton wakes up from a night of debauchery. And the book delivers plenty of behind-the-scenes laughs over what the book business is all about today. But the book quickly starts to deliver a much greater literary impact. Its greatest strength is its characters. They're not mere stereotypes or rip-offs of famous types -- Jay MacInerny, John Cheever, Candace Bushnell -- they become full-fledged characters with their own quirks and flaws. Wenzel does have a breezy style, but he can also be quite the stylist. There's a section in the head of the wife of the John-Cheever type -- her name is Meryl -- that is lyrical. The books is a very funny send-up of the way the American obsession with celebrity has overtaken the book business, but themes that transcend that business are also explored -- older men's search for proteges, young men's search for mentors, the attempts of self-absorbed fathers and rebellious daughters to connect, to name a few. There are some very poignant statements here about the limitations others' views of us put on our lives. The characters are likable -- even when they behave despicably -- because they're all so trapped by the public images they feel obligated to fulfill. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Lit Life (Nova Audio Books)","review":"then literature has a red-headed step child in Lit Life!

Both read the book twice and the term 'put a sock in it' has become commonplace in our household.Based on their enthusiasm I picked up the book (commited to science, technology and innovation) and even I found the book amazingly amusing, entertaining and some of the inventions described in the book are definitely food for thought. The exploits of the two inventors and Percy are outrageous enough that the politically unacceptable parts of the book were seen as only part of a fantasy story by both my children and therefore it was considered harmless. I refer to Percy stealing food from their neighbours for a meal for the three of them.The story is broken up into chapters which are long enough to maintain continuity but short enough so that it is not an onerous task for a seven year old.Deeva and Mehr are looking forward to reading other books by Judy Corbalis which we will obtain shortly."},{"Title":"Put a Sock in It, Percy","review":"I got this book for my son; he read it in one evening, laughing a lot.

There are a plethora of quotes from Bette Davis movies (i.e. \\"Mistress Throgmorton, is this your pet swine?\\" from the Virgin Queen), Joan Crawford, Valley of the Dolls and the list goes on. Topics include cheap women, food and drink, history and love, of course.It's pretty funny, and a nice variety of movies are represented.

I recommand it."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"This story by Jarrell is gentle, mythical, and stands the test of time. A short story about a solitary hunter on an island, who meets a mermaid, and together form a family with animals they meet. The tone is warm and soft, kind and at times bittersweet.While perfect for bedtime, cold or rainy days, this book is appealing to me even as i grow older. The subtle lessons about companionship, newness, differences, loneliness, loss, and joy are not forced to the fore. Rather, an old-fashioned sense of creating an environment as a way to tell a story is key here. Inviting wilderness, homely relationships, and just enough magic and mystery to compel the story forward.One of my most treasured books since i was a young child, the is a timeless and infinitely re-readable story."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"This book is truly what you would call a beautifully written piece of literature. It is the story of a lonely hunter who meets a mermaid. She comes to live with him despite being torn between her home in the sea and her love for the hunter. They live happily except that they wish for a child. Since to have a human child is not possible, the hunter first brings home a bear cub and then a lynx who become like their children. This story has a wonderful, dreamlike quality to it. The words and story flow lyrically and almost timelessly and the descriptions are simple and wonderfully vivid and beautiful. It will apeal to all ages. Children will like the funny story and gentleness of the words and teens and adults will find the deeper meaning as well as appreaciate the lovely scenes.

Since then, I havewillingly entered into that wonderfulworld of the hunter and the mermaid on countlessoccasions--and I have never gone awayemptyhanded.

It is short (you can read it in an afternoon easily ) and the writing is simple and straigtforward but also sweet and magical. The author's introductory note captures my heart: \\"say what you like, but such things do happen. Not often, but they do happen\\"."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"What an exquisite little gem this book is. I have been bemoaning the lack of great mermaid stories far and wide, and though I've tried a great many, none have ever even touched on the surface of the enchantment and mystery that I'd hoped for until a friend of mine whispered in my ear about The Animal Family. This isn't really strictly a mermaid tale, however, it's really a deceptively simple but layered story of a family that is not born, but made.\\"Once upon a time, there was a hunter who lived alone in the woods, dreaming of those who have left him behind.\\"In just a few pages, the author shows us the hunter's loneliness and makes us want things for him that perhaps he doesn't even let himself dream of.\\"But when the logs had burnt to embers and the embers had burnt away to coals, the man would lie in his bed, warm under the bearskin, and listen to the great soft sound the waves made over and over. It seemed to him it was like his mother singing...Then one evening, as he stands out by the seal rocks on the shore, he hears a song being sung without words....as the hunter stared into the moonlight round the rocks, a sleek wet head came up out of the water, stared at him with shining eyes, and then sank back under and was gone. It was nothing he had ever seen before. Its long shining hair and shining skin were the same silvery blue-green, the color of the moonlight on the water.\\"The hunter and mermaid of course make a life together, and they add to their family with some very unexpected and funny choices. The imagery is evocative and quite beautiful, and the ideas and language were at times so clever that I was chortling as I turned the pages.This is a story written in the traditional lovely, lyrical prose of old-fashioned fairy tales, and one that readers of classics will very much appreciate. The book was published in 1965 and was declared \\"a timeless and universal story\\" as reviewed for the New York Times Book review by none other than P.L. Travers, who also said \\"Occasionally, very rarely--like the spirit of delight--comes a book that is not so much a book but a kind of visitation.

I lived there for the next nine years exactly, moving out on my 17th birthday, and spent six days a week in the library next door (except for that brief period when I was banned for having 77 overdue books, and had to work off my fines before they'd let me back in). I'd have been in there seven days a week except they were closed on Sunday, which has ever since been my least favorite day of the week.There were several children's librarians there during the years I lived next door, and they all took an interest in me as I was such a voracious reader. One gave me a copy of The Animal Family as a birthday present one year, and it immediately became my favorite book.This story is so simply told, yet so beautiful that it has stayed with me all my life (30 years and counting since I first read it). Before the internet came along, I made it a point to locate used copies through the booksellers' network, and kept several copies on hand so that I could give them away whenever I met a special child who I thought would appreciate it.You can read the other reviews if you want to know the story line... nothing can do it justice, however, except just reading the book.

By passing the standard issue Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys, I wanted the stuff dreams were made of. I remember discovering The Animal Family and being more intreagued by its presentation (a smallish book with wide margins on each page, crammed amid the large, brightly colored books of the children's library). But the opening page drew me in and kept me entranced for days. I re-read the book whenever I could find it in the school library-until it disappeared. Last night, my five-year-old daughter asked me to tell her a story. I searched the depths of my memory and began the story of a &quot;lonely hunter who lived in a log cabin where the woods meet the beach. One night he heard a mermaid singing...&quot; As my daugter's eyes grew wide while she watched my face, hoping, perhaps, to pull the words all the faster from my memory, I knew I needed to find the book that 30 years ago enthralled me with its uniqueness and then stayed in my memory long enough to promise the same for my daughter."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"A librarian gave me a copy of The Animal Family as a birthday present one year, and it immediately became my favorite book.This story is so simply told, yet so beautiful that it has stayed with me all my life (30 years and counting since I first read it).

I could subsist on this type of writing for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"Randall Jarrell (1914-65) is better known as a poet, although probably best known today for his poetry criticism. He also wrote a few children's book, most notablyThe Bat-PoetandThe Animal Family, the later published the same year he died and winning the 1966 Newbery Honor. It is wonderfully illustrated by Maurice Sendak - ofWhere the Wild Things Arefame - in beautiful pen and ink drawings.The story is a sort of fable along the lines of Hans Christian Andersen or Lewis Carroll, but updated with a 1960s message. It is about a lonely hunter who lives in a cabin by the sea who with time comes to gather around him a \\"family\\" of very different creatures, first a mermaid, and then a bear, lynx, and human boy. Each is an orphan whose parents have either died or somehow left the scene. They all are very different animals yet find comfort and eventually identity with one another. It is a story in the spirit of the Age of Aquarius, when songs such asFree to Be You and Me and Free to Be a Familyresonated during a cultural revolution in which boundaries of class, race and, in this case, even species were being explored, when everyone was a \\"brother\\" and \\"sister\\".My reading of the story in its 1960s context is only one interpretation, this is not a heavy handed preachy book by any measure, it is timeless in its message about toleration of differences, the power of love to overcome anything (including for a mermaid to live on land, in effect brining a happy ending to Hans Andersen's otherwise brutalThe Little Mermaid), and in particular for those who seek out love and find it in the most un-expected places. It is a short book, easy to read, and poetically written. Over the past 40 years it has found a place close to the heart of many children and adults, I only wish I had discovered it sooner."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"Every once in a while, an author manages to pull off a novel that carries with it the exact tone and magical feeling of a fairy tale. In the genre of The Last Unicorn and The Princess Bride, this beautiful story takes you into a peaceful world where a lonely hunter lives by the sea.The story follows the hunter's efforts to make a family for himself, and to keep that family safe. I don't want to spoil any of the plot points, but I will say that this gentle fable is going to fill each reader with joy and contentment. The tale is universal, and is just perfect for a shared experience at bedtime.The decorations by Maurice Sendak are also quite lovely, giving us detailed sketches of the landscapes that the hunter and his family occupy."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"This is a beautiful story of a lone woodsman who befriends a curious mermaid before long they become a family of two. A bear is added to their family and the family continues to grow. The most pleasing aspect of this book is the characters. They are written without pretense, they are not contrived, they are real and wonderful. Upon conclusion of the first chapter my 3-year-old proclaimed, \\"this is my favorite story ever.\\" My seven year old has enjoyed it for years - as have I."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"This wonderful, dreamy story of a shipwrecked man, a mermaid, and the numerous additions to their family makes excellent bedtime reading for children. While I enjoyed hearing it that way thirty years ago, it is probably even more apt in today's world of blended families. Each chapter is essentially a complete story, which parents will appreciate, not having to battle over whether or not to pursue the cliffhanger into the next chapter. Maurice Sendak's ink drawings are suggestive, and scene-setting, rather than explicit renderings of the characters, inviting children to participate in imagining the world inhabited by the characters. Randall Jarrell describes the natural beauty and deep emotional connection between the characters as only a practiced poet can."},{"Title":"The animal family","review":"I was ecstatic to see this book, which I quickly recognized, offered on the first page. It is a treasured book in our faimly. It was first given to me by my grandmother in 1970, as is inscribed in the book, and I have read it over and over since then. I recently read it to my chidren for the first time. They loved it; they couldn't wait to go to bed every night so they could hear more. I have protected it carefully and affectionately these past 28 years so that I could pass it on to my children to share with their children. The only question was how would they share the one copy? WELL, Now they don't have to! I have ordered another copy so that they can each have one (maybe I need another for myself) and so very importantly, it is exactly the same as the original, the cover, the size, pictures, etc. Thank you so much Amazon.com for showing this book, I might otherwise never have found it."},{"Title":"Elizabeth Appleton","review":"ASIN B000NXI7EU - Elizabeth Appleton (nee Webster) is the wife of John, a rising star among the faculty at Spring Valley, a college in Spring Valley, Pennsylvania. Elizabeth comes from a wealthy family while John... John does not. She's just in love enough to give up a lot to be with her husband and he's more than enough in love to want to support her without her family's money. Elizabeth's sister, Jean, arrives for a visit and is caught up, by several characters, on the goings-on about the small college town. It is partly through those tellings, and where those stories naturally lead, that the reader gets taken back to the beginning of Elizabeth and John's courtship and brought all the way to the current day.John is being considered for a promotion that would, for the most part, be the first important \\"win\\" of his life. Elizabeth, meanwhile, has conducted an on-again off-again affair that frees her to be more than someone's wife and that appeals to her intellectual side. Still, she knows that she's not going to be leaving her husband any time soon - unless, that is, he happened to have something of his own, some important \\"win\\" that would give him some esteem and self-esteem. Everything you'd expect from a romance novel set in a college town is here: politicking and back-stabbing, gossip and jealousy.Not everyone is going to love this book. If you're a romance reader, especially of modern romances, you have a certain expectation of sex scenes that will not be met here. Here, for example, is the first sex scene between young Elizabeth and John:'The moment had come and there was no more to say. He got up and sat beside her on the wicker sofa. He kissed her and they stretched out together. He put his knee between her legs and she caught her breath in the new excitement. Soon he had his unresisting hand wherever he wanted it to be, and she whispered to him, \\"I can't stop now. John, I can't stop. You have to do it, but be careful.\\"\\"We have to take a chance,\\" he said.\\"All right, all right we'll take a chance,\\" she said. \\"Yes, let's take a chance. Oh, my darling. It is over for you?\\"\\"Yes,\\" he said.'Seriously, that's it. Of course, the book was written in the early 1960s, long before steamy sex scenes became widely accepted. The setting of the 1950s-1960s works the other way, too. A reader in, say, their 40s, will actually have to pause to let this sink in: These characters are your parents' age. A reader in their 20s might have a really hard time thinking that these characters are their GRANDparents' age. The book, read now, certainly makes me look back at my family tree with a different notion of who those people were before I came along.It's well-written, risqu&eacute; for the time and, most of all, heartbreaking. Author John O'Hara makes it very tough to root for one particular winner, which keeps you in suspense because no matter how things turn out, whether or not John gets his \\"win,\\" you know that someone is going to lose. It makes you want to read the last few pages the way you might watch a gruesome movie scene - with your hands over your face, peering cautiously out between your fingers.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Oracle RAC & Grid Tuning with Solid-state Disk: Expert Secrets for High Performance Clustered Grid Computing (Oracle In-Focus series)","review":"I got this book as a vendors prize at Oracleworld and I was suprized to learn that SSD is not just a flash in the pan.

Learning the origin of the famous/infamous &quot;Chicken Ranch&quot; and how it got it's name, was a hoot and a half! The publishers notes on the back of the book said &quot;Jimmy Lee Butts writes these stories to sound as though a friend just sat down and decided to tell you an interesting tale about someone he once knew.&quot; That is a perfect description!

The statement, &quot;Stand by your man&quot;, is quickly dismissed as a simple cliche. These women were tough and real and they take you right along every step of the way.

The author makes it plain up front that although he did his research, some of the stories have details that came from second or third hand accounts. I was reminded of a line from John Wayne's \\"The Cowboys\\". \\"If it ain't the truth, it ought to be\\". If some of the facts are a little grey on events from 150 years ago, so be it. It still makes for a good story. I especially liked the chapter about the Brown family of Springtown as it took place in the town I grew up in. I have lived here all my life and read extensively about the old west but somehow had never heard about this family. I found the book to be entertaining."},{"Title":"Texas Bad Girls: Hussie, Harlots, and Horse Thieves","review":"Great potential for a fun, interesting read is often wasted in &quot;Texas Bad Girls.&quot; The author has some fine story-telling skills, and some of the yarns are genuinely fascinating. Unfortunately, the author seems in love with his own cleverness, and ruins a good many of the stories by inserting distracting quips and jokes. The humor works sometimes, but too often it serves to mark this book as the work of an amateur, one step up from a vanity project.The author appears to have done a great deal of original research, but explains none of it and cites no sources beyond a bibliography of older books and articles at the back. This, along with the wise-acre writing style, robs the book of credibility.

This striking quote is from Ludwig von Mises's _Theory and History_, page 378. Concerning freedom, Mises also noted that economic freedom is such that \\"the individual is in a position to choose the way in which he wants to integrate himself into the totality of society.\\" When a man such as Mises can convey the perplex ideas of social philosophy, economics, and freedom in such a thought-provoking and unambiguous manner, someone ought to do something about compiling and presenting his magnificent words.Well someone did. However, _The Quotable Mises_ is not merely a grab bag of moldable quotes for freedom and against tyranny. This compilation of Misesian courage and his revolutionary mindset, edited by Dr. Mark Thornton of the Mises Institute, is a handbook of good over bad, moral vs. immoral, and man against state.Mises, of course, championed the right of free men acting in voluntary exchange within a free market unencumbered by state intervention or coercion. Interventionism, he knew, would necessarily develop into full-blown socialism, and thus did he deviate from traditional, twentieth-century political thought, in spite of the career consequences that would come to pass.First off, _The Quotable Mises_ is beautifully bound in a bright, colorful, printed cover sans the traditional dust jacket. The \\"textbook\\" look is pleasing as well as durable. Nearly 300 pages, it's only a handful of the eloquence and brilliance that Mises gave to the world over a span of many years. Thornton has provided a topic-centered table of contents wherein Misesian quotes are found on everything from antitrust to bourgeoisie to Lenin to sex. In regards to Lenin he is quoted as noting that Lenin was akin to a \\"filing clerk\\" building \\"a nation's production effort according to the model of the post office.\\" And sex? Mises says that no activity that staves off extinction shall be called a vice! Anyone that has read a great deal of Mises's work knows that few topics escaped his ability to engage them: not Ghandi, not Prohibition, and certainly not the Historical School.The book includes a bibliography and a valuable index, which is especially helpful for writers looking up quotes by topic or keyword. In essence, _The Quotable Mises_ is a joyous and useful presentation of the words of one of the greatest scholars of modern times.Telling the truth and challenging the powers-that-be rendered Mises academically powerless for most of his lifetime. But his glory lived on with Hayek's Nobel Prize and the revival of the Austrian school. The truth is in Mises, a great man who dared to challenge the status quo with the consequence of rejection and obscurity. Thankfully, his lifetime of rejection from academia was not followed up with subsequent obscurity, but rather, his legacy was revived via the rebirth of Austrian economics and the discovery that he, indeed, was more comprehensive and significant than his peers dared to declare.As Mises noted in his magnum opus _Human Action_: \\"History speaks only to those who know how to interpret it.\\" Mises spoke, and thanks to projects like _The Quotable Mises_, many generations of inquiring minds will certainly interpret."},{"Title":"Basic Italian","review":"This is the best basic Italian text ever written, it has been used for decades.

She wrote such wonderful memories.The second paragraph reminded me that my mother too, was ready to go Home, just as if she was ready to go to church on Sunday.&quot;The Lesson of Loss&quot; reminded me that there were those who were ready to comfort me if I would let them. My grief became easierto bear and my tears started me on the healing process.&quot;Be Still and Know&quot; helped me realize that my mother was healed now and no longer suffering.And &quot;The New Dimension of Love&quot; thrilled me in knowing that I would see mother again in heaven.I am now a Pastor's wife and I have tried to find this book to give to several of our congregation who have suffered loss.I triumphed over my grief with the simple prayers and passages in this book. I want to share it with anyone who has suffered a loss, especially of a mother.Thank you, Marjorie Holmes, for giving me strength."},{"Title":"I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God; A Woman's Conversations with God","review":"I first found this book (an earlier edition)on my mother-in-law's nightstand after she died, and loved reading it.

The book is almost twice my age! However, after just a few minutes of reading, I was enthralled. Holmes is brutally honest, saying things that most of us never want to admit even to ourselves. Hearing her words validated me in so many ways and made me realize that other people feel this way too! I felt like I could relate to just about every page, and though it is dated, it is still so relevant today. I highly recommend this book :)"},{"Title":"I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God; A Woman's Conversations with God","review":"I came across this book recently and got sucked into it. It's a rare, honest peek into one woman's thoughts during her years as a housewife and mother. There's a lot of pain, possibly depression, in her prayers. It made me very grateful for not living in her time, for not having that kind of marriage, for having a career and no kids.

Recently one told me she found it in her bookcase and it was so helpful dealing with grief following the sudden death of her son (age 61) and thanked me. I took a look at it again and realized that Holmes' offers support and inspiration on many topics. It seems as current for women today as it was in the 60s. I'm glad I found a few copies left to give to two more friends."},{"Title":"I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God; A Woman's Conversations with God","review":"What a chance taker Ms. Holmes was.

A nice balance of technical fact and background/historical information is maintained. The author does an excellent job of explaining SONET frame structures, pointers, overhead usage, etc. In addition, he provides a valuable introduction to the antecedents of SONET (the Bell System T-carrier networks and so on) and provides reasons for many of its architectural and design choices.While the book does have its faults (various errors, too much devoted to non-SONET topics, no details of concatenation beyond STS-3 levels, etc.) and needs some updating to accommodate modern SONET practice, I would recommend this book to anyone with some knowledge of communications who wishes to gain an understanding of SONET and its architecture. (Prospective readers are warned that little information will be found on SDH - the book does remain true to its title in this regard.)"},{"Title":"SONET: A Guide to Synchronous Optical Network (McGraw-Hill Computer Communications Series)","review":"The book provides good coverage of the evolution of SONET and the intricacies and &quot;problems&quot; associated with PDH. There's even good coverage of SDH. However, beware of the sections on SONET rings. They are poorly written, misleading and in some instances downright wrong! Unfortunately, one or two inaccuracies can make one leary about the entire book."},{"Title":"SONET: A Guide to Synchronous Optical Network (McGraw-Hill Computer Communications Series)","review":"This book is recommended for all Sonet and telephony related people. Not only does this book go over Synchronous optical networks, but goes into detail about the differences between SONET and SDH(sychronous digital hierachy) which is used in europe. It also goes over the different vendors equipment and thier good point and bad points giving you a better understanding of Sonet from all angles. ITS A REALLY GOOD BOOK!"},{"Title":"SONET: A Guide to Synchronous Optical Network (McGraw-Hill Computer Communications Series)","review":"This book is excellent for people both new to and experienced with SONET. It covers history, general and detailed implementation, applications, the future of SONET, and practical factors (such as pressures from competitive companies and technologies, and the slow adoption of some network management standards). It includes details of individual OAM&amp;P overhead signals, internode communications use of the DCC, rings and failures, delay and timing issues, etc. It has coverage of present SONET implementations by various companies, and future directions for SONET. It covers the issues of concern to me very well, and there is much more in the book to cover your issues also. The book is easy to read and very informative. I frequently refer back to it in my SONET-related work."},{"Title":"1911 Best Things Anybody Ever Said","review":"I've read and reread this book of quotations by mostly modern wits.

The book makes a great gift."},{"Title":"1911 Best Things Anybody Ever Said","review":"Robert Byrne's collection of the &quot;Best Things Anybody Ever Said&quot; does not disappoint. It is a brilliant mix of politics, social commentary, absurd metaphor and timeless truisms that delight, enlighten and keep the reader laughing out loud. This three-part volume of one-liners, crammed with wisdom of the ages, will never collect dust. It's likely to move from room to room, never finding its way to the book shelf. &quot;Best Things&quot; should be required reading for all students of comedy and other members of the human race. Indexed by author, subject and key words, it is both an indispensable reference for all occasions and a wonderful escape for anyone who enjoys laughing again, again and again."},{"Title":"1911 Best Things Anybody Ever Said","review":"This book is an outstanding collection of thoughts, sayings, and quotations.

Many are so demeaning to women and take the base, low-road. I wanted something helpful and uplifting and did not get it. Dear Abby really liked this book?"},{"Title":"1911 Best Things Anybody Ever Said","review":"Apparently this quote from Barry Commmoner was correct. Where on earth did Byrne find some of this stuff?There are dozens of well-known compilations of quotations, and hundreds of lesser known ones. This book tends more toward the humorous or cynical side than the more serious collections such as Bartlett's or the Penguin Dictionary of Quotations. And though those two volumes belong on any professional writer's collection, it's a toss up whether you need these 1,911 quotes, especially given how mean-spirited many of these quotes are.For instance, we have Bhagwhan Shree Rajneesh noting, \\"Jesus was a crackpot.\\" Or Leo Tolstoy opining \\"Nietzsche was stupid and abnormal,\\" a quote the author was so fond of that he included it on at least four different pages. Of course, there are those moments when material of this ilk fits the bill.One big strike is that the book is not that easy to use. You have to rely on the indices to find quotes by either the person's name or by topic. Then, the topics sometimes do not seem, in my estimation, to match the quotes. The author also saw fit to cram a bunch of his own quotes throughout the text. Oddly, he didn't bother checking with you or me to see what wit we might have dispensed.If you run across this book used, find one in the remainders section, or see a discarded copy on a city bus, you may wish to snare it. Otherwise, you can do just as well with some of the Web sites that provide quotes.

There's been much debate about the subject but Fiol-Matta takes it further and amplifies it. In the book, she touches on Mistral's possible Lesbianism or in a White-Race supremacy belief before turning into the defender of Native Americans and Mestizos. She also talks about the use of pictures and other visual elements to create Mistral's image. The book is not easy to read, but brings new aspects on Mistral's life to counterback her \\"Mythical\\" and \\"Sanctified\\" Image. And as the author says, it is an opportunity to re-read the author's work, one of Latin America's Finest."},{"Title":"Queer Mother For The Nation: The State And Gabriela Mistral","review":"A work of scholarship accessible to all. It reads like a novel. Queer Mother is fresh, creative and audacious in its analysis of Gabriela Mistral's historical importance.

It is only then that you can truly enjoy a lot of the backstory that is alluded to in these three stories. They are very good stories, written by other authors of Charmed novels, but they integrate quite a bit of the tv show storylines. If you watch the show, you'll love these, but otherwise, you might get lost in the details."},{"Title":"Seasons of the Witch, Vol. 1 (Charmed)","review":"Charmed is a great TV show and I love the fact that each sister has their own unique story in this book! Although I love Charmed and I am a huge fan of all the sister's, my favorite one is Piper, played by Holly Marie Combs. To me Charmed is not just a show about how three sisters fight demons and warlocks everyday, I watch Charmed because in a very big way, they are just like us, and that is exactly what this book implies. Piper wants to have children and have a normal life with Leo, but with a sister's power's gone awry and with the fact that they are indeed the Charmed Ones, Piper feels like maybe having a baby might make things more difficult. Pheobe and Paige's stories were also very good, I enjoyed the whole book very much and I would definately say that if u love Charmed as much as I do, to go ahead and buy this book, it is well worth the money!!!!"},{"Title":"Seasons of the Witch, Vol. 1 (Charmed)","review":"it has three stories one for each of them. imbolc yule and samhain. phoebe's was about one of their ancestors going into her body to save her husband. paige's is about one day when she went to a nightclub for an all-nighter and a demon drained her powers and everybody's soul. piper's was about her wanting to have a baby and paige's orbing goes wonky and she orbs everywhere like her middle school."},{"Title":"Seasons of the Witch, Vol. 1 (Charmed)","review":"I am a very huge fan of this show so I was absolutly interested in this book.

I agree entirely with every word.I took this away with me on holiday, relishing an imagined previously undiscovered Rankin treasure. I was gutted when I realised I'd been had.I actually read the book as I had nothing else to hand, and it is pure, unremitting drivel, a teenage boy's dross fantasy porn movie script.It is entirely plot driven, the characters have no depth at all. The central character is a drop dead gorgeous, highly sexed woman, and the author is clearly living out his fantasy of being her, showing no understanding of women or men or emotions or behaviour. For example, at one point she has a pregnancy terminated, then is immediately gagging for more sex, crowing about paying the doctor by sleeping with him. Any woman will agree that this is not normal behaviour(!).All the way through I was cringing and shaking my head in disbelief at this uneducated male view of what it's like to be a woman. Or even a man.I'm no prude, don't get me wrong, but the sex scenes are so badly written and full of cliches. I could almost hear the dodgy 70's lift music as I read.Finally, it is littered with spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, plus constant repeated use of several words, luscious and sweet to name two. On page one, he uses \\"boxcar\\", \\"box-car\\", then \\"boxcar\\" again in quick succession."},{"Title":"The Great Spy Race","review":"OK, THIS is the actual edition that I read, but apart from the Gosnell cover art I'm sure there's no difference from the others. Like Diment's other books, this is a cheeky noir-hip thriller in the style of \\"The Italian Job,\\" with its flash hero playing all sides for a shot at lots of lolly while all sides take shots at HIM. Bedding the birds with ease, our mod man on the job has little less difficulty with the lethal lads who are variously a step ahead of or behind him in this too-short plot-ticket adventure.Philip McAlpine, a walking advertisement for Carnaby Street couture, is a very well-paid asset of Rupert Quine, the head of 6NC/NAC (New Countries/Non-Aligned Countries,) an MI6 subsection with ambitions. McAlpine isn't officially a g-man, can fly a plane, and has a casual attitude toward vice, so Quine finds various uses for him - in this case entering him in The Great Spy Race, a contest created by a retired spymaster to celebrate his art. Contestants must rove Europe in pursuit of clues to a fortune in intelligence data (and a pot of cash on the side,) and Philip finds himself blackmailing a gay banker in London, wifeswapping with a French warrior on the Riviera, and hounded by hitmen in Ibiza as he tries to stay ahead of the competition. The problem is, the front runner gets more than the goodies at the finish line!I was disappointed by this fairly short thriller, which is pretty light on the plot tickets and consequently misses a lot of opportunities to cover ground rife with comic possibilities. Nevertheless it's a mildly entertaining period piece that's similar to the Modesty Blaise books. Diment's stories are cynical rather than comic and are definitely in the Len Deighton/John LeCarre school of antispy fiction, but with a much lighter touch. The hip-Chelsea talk is fun, and there's some arch description of the contemporary scene, so if you have any interest in the swinging-sixties it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Night Moves","review":"Gray, Christine, and Amanda's story, in Night Moves, is a good book to read if you are looking for a contempary light read. Ms. Canfield tries hard to have a plot with many twists and turns but I found them pretty predictable. I did like the fact that there were a lot of charaters involved with the story and that they all hold an important piece of the puzzle.My biggest problem was with the characters themselves. They were a bit on the flat side with not too much depth. Christine struck me as a shallow, self centered heroine. She wanted everything and used two men to get it. I honestly don't know how she can justify keeping the fact that you fathered a child from someone. If I was Gray, I would be livid, especially since he WANTED to have kids. I think what Christine did was unforgivable, and if I was Gray, I might have taken Amanda and left (although Ms. Canfield tackles this point, I think I would have gone, not resolved it). Peyton got my complete pity, what a pathetic character. How he could stay with someone for 10 years when they loved someone else is beyond me. As for Gray, I liked him. He is down to earth (literally, since he is a gardner), and patient, and if I was him, I think I would have reacted completely diffrently to the whole situation. I don't think I could lose my bitterness so quickly (even with all the threats being thrown around).I wouldn't discount reading Night Moves completely, just be ready for a pretty average book."},{"Title":"Face To Face: A Reader in the World","review":"Ms. Schwartz is an essayist of astonishing perception, skill, and power. She has taken the simple notions of being face to face (and its opposite) and explored them with a thoroughness and thoughtfulness that will probably guide you in all your relationships to make them ever richer.I like books of essays because they provide more diversity of perspective than a nonfiction book or a novel can. This one was exceptionally rewarding in this way.In 'Only Connect', you will learn about the cons and pros (there are mostly cons) of the telephone in Ms. Schwartz's life, along with an interesting description of how our use of the telephone is changing. I share her dislike of telephones, so I was cheered by her thoughts on this subject.'Absence Makes the Heart' is a sensitive discussion of how friendship changes when you are apart, and how it differs when you are reunited again.'On Being Taken by Tom Victor' describes photography sessions with a master who later dies of AIDS. His great gift as a photographer was &quot;to talk . . . to give something.&quot; After you received his gift of himself, you would show yourself to the camera.'Found in Translation' is a fascinating story of the author's experience in translating the memoirs of Lana Millu about Ms. Millu's time in Birkenau, the women's part of Auschwitz, during World War II. Since the author's Italian was weak, she found a person to help her who she had first met when the helper was a small child in Italy. The two problems that almost threw Ms. Schwartz turned out to be typos that the publisher was slow to alert her to. As a novelist, she had cooked up some very imaginative solutions that were, alas, all wrong. She wonders how many translations suffer from the same problem. I do too.'The Spoils of War' describes an experience of teaching a Vietnam vet who has an amazing mind. The author cannot make any sense of it. &quot;You write like this and sit in class like a statue?&quot; The man is a parking meter reader. His war experience has left him inhibited in his dealing with people.'Help' is the most deeply affecting essay. It is about the friendship that develops between her family and Mattie, the cleaning lady who also took care of her children. If you don't read any other essays in this book, be sure you read this one.'Drive, She Said' looks at her ambivalence about driving, and her attempts to develop an independent attitude from those of her parents towards driving. &quot;I am terrified and elated.&quot;'Two Fashion Statements' juxtapose an experience of wearing a new dress while young on a date to Radio City Music Hall with her reaction to house dresses coming back into fashion years later.'Face to Face' recounts her cat-sitting experiences for four months, and her reactions after it was over. &quot;I missed the cat with my heart.&quot;'Listening to Powell' is a powerful description of listening to a modern classic book on tape, A Dance to the Music of Time.'At a Certain Age' considers the differences between her mother's attitudes towards growing older and her own.'The Page Turner' is a tour de force in pointing out how the page turner in a concert can embody the whole experience for us. &quot;The very banality of her task lends her a dignity . . . &quot; that will cause her to be remembered along with the music more than the musicians will.After you finish these essays, I encourage you to consider how you can use being present and absent in different ways to expand your relationships with others. Overcome your bias in favor of assuming that more physical closeness is all that is needed. Proper distance can bring more closeness in many ways."},{"Title":"Face To Face: A Reader in the World","review":"Don't be fooled. You may at first think you are having a quiet, informal conversation with Ms. Schwartz. You are, in a sense. But the ease with which she &quot;speaks,&quot; the depth at which she enters the conversation, and the apparent mundanity of the subject matter belie the profundity. This is one of those conversations--they can occur on a Fall afternoon after enjoying some wine in a cool wine cellar or reuniting after many years one summer morning in a Village cafe with a friend from abroad. As you listen, you know the words you hear are peeling off layers of your long-held intellectual skin.Other reviewers have recounted the content of these essays. That's fine. What matters, though, is the at once soothing and disturbing voice which uproots you from the seat you are occupying,the sleep you are sleeping, the beliefs you are treasuring. Finally, you are grateful.You can probably hear Ms. Schwartz from her works as I did when she signed copies of this book at a New York bookstore. It's an enjoyable, moving experience. It's pale, though in comparison to listening in isolation to her voice as it lifts off the pages into your processing mechanism and turns it once again into a heart."},{"Title":"Face To Face: A Reader in the World","review":"This is an excellent collection of from the author's life. The one that affected me the most was about the relationship between the author and an African American woman she hired as her maid. She always looked down on people who said the maid was &quot;one of the family,&quot; she wrote: obviously there were lots of differences. And yet, the two of them got very close. This is a tough issue to write something sensible about, but Ms. Schwartz has written something thought-provoking and moving."},{"Title":"To Desire Differently","review":"Dr. Flitterman-Lewis has truly written a fabulous well-researched book about three very different French female filmmakers. Germaine Dulac films are often lost in today's film criticism because they were silent films. She was ahead of her time even without sound. The images itself are memorable. She focuses Marie Epstein's La Maternelle about motherhood, poverty, abandonment and life in the streets of France. La Maternelle was one of the first film using dialogue. It would have been more interesting to read about the live of these two women who are no longer around particularly why Marie Epstein never became a mother herself. Germaine's life is even more interesting for other reasons. Of course, the final French filmmaker is Agnes Varda and her film, Vagabond. While I loved all the films presented in her book, Varda speaks to us about why she directs and her motivations.

But this book is strictly for film buffs and French enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The Trigger (Code Red (Harlequin))","review":"Finally, a book that doesn't toss the hero and heroine into matrimony two weeks after they meet. I noticed an inordinate number of Code Reds had couples who had split up and reunited through their experience in the book as a way around time constraints. The whole approach this book took was different.The story begins when, after the latest in a series of bombings, the police department decides to pair its bomb squad specialist, Nora Keyes, with the fire department's arson investigator, Sam Prophet. Nor and Sam are opposites-she's Oscar and he's Felix. At first, sparks fly and they argue over who's boss. Their professionalism soon has them working as a team, however, and they develop respect for one another's talents. As they track down clues, they also develop a strong attraction to one another. They have a few heated moments, but decide to ignore their feelings and do their jobs. One night, just before Nora faces danger that could take her life, they give in and burn up the sheets. They don't have time to moon over it, as danger looms. But, when both face close calls, they realize just how much they enjoy each other and how much they want to be together. But...Sam doesn't propose! He asks her to move in, and a quick mention of their wedding six months down the road wraps it up.Nora and Sam are delightful characters. Nora likes excitement and danger and drives a sports car. She fears nothing. She's also cool and in control, wasting no time dithering about her feelings. They're there, and she deals with them. Sam is sweet, handsome, and wonderful. What else do you need?The mystery progressed nicely along the way, too, as Sam and Nora go about interviewing people and researching files to solve the case. It all seemed pretty first-class until it was all over and Sam wondered how they could have caught their serial bomber earlier. Suddenly, I thought, \\"They probably could have solved it the day they connected the three companies if they'd accessed the civil court files for the past five years-a matter of public record-and looked up plaintiffs in lawsuits against the companies involved.\\" But...I deal with civil lawsuits at work every day so maybe my mind makes that leap faster than others. It was one flaw, and one that appeared at the end of the book.Nora is definitely my favorite Code Red heroine so far, and she had tough competition with Shannon and Jackie. This book has definitely restored my interest in the happenings in Courage Bay."},{"Title":"The Trigger (Code Red (Harlequin))","review":"The basis of Harlequin's CODE RED Series is \\"ordinary people, extraordinary circumstances.\\" Nothing could exhibit this better than Jacqueline Diamond's contribution of THE TRIGGER. Even if you haven't read the other books in the CODE RED series-which, by the way, I have!-you won't go wrong picking up a copy of THE TRIGGER. Suspense, intrigue, sexual tension, and a couple who at times make you want to smack them silly, this book has it all.Sergeant Nora Keyes is Courage Bay 's Bomb Squad Specialist. Called in to investigate any crime scene that shows evidence of a bomb-one that hasn't been detonated, or one that's caused damage-Nora's been busy working the case of what is quickly turning out to be a serial bomber. Someone has been planting explosive devices in a cell phone and detonating them from a remote distance. In Nora's opinion, it's her job to find out who the perpetrator is.Unfortunately, Sam Prophet, Courage Bay 's Arson Investigator, feels that finding the bomber is his job. After all, the detonation of the cell phone bombs cause fire, and fire is his business. When Nora keeps showing up-unannounced and unwanted at what he considers to be his crime scene-the temperature of the left-behind ashes and burnt-out buildings aren't the only thing that's boiling.Nora and Sam had been paired together during a training seminar shortly after Nora's move to Courage Bay from Los Angeles , and they both found out the hard way that oil and water do not mix. Sam prefers facts, painstakingly linking together evidence to follow the natural order of events. Nora, on the other hand, has a built-in sense of how things work, and she has no qualms about seeking out the truth based on nothing but her gut feelings. Needless to say, their very different styles of following a case to its end have Nora and Sam butting heads.This time, though, their bosses have conspired to throw them together, working as partners on a case that has the small town of Courage Bay shaking in terror. A bomb, on any given day, is scary enough, but when it's hidden in a cellphone-of which most of the population owns one-scary turns into a nightmare.As Sam and Nora butt heads, battle a spark of attraction that can't be beaten down with a fire hose, and work to find the serial bomber before someone else becomes a victim, you'll be drawn into Ms. Diamond's story. THE TRIGGER is an intriguing blend of real-life characters, harrowing situations, an evil protagonist, and the search to find justice-before it's too late."},{"Title":"Four portraits: Studies of the 18th century","review":"I picked this up from a second-hand stall, not sure if I really wanted to read short biographies of four important writers from the eighteenth century, but it is so well written it was hard to put down. Quennell gives a subtitle 'Studies in the Eighteenth Century', and his 'pen portraits' of James Boswell, Edward Gibbon, Laurence Sterne and John Wilkes give a wonderful sense of what life was like around the 1760's to 1790's. These writers are picked for the different aspects of life which they and their writings contributed to the spirit of that age, and which go together to give the flavour of the culture of late eighteenth century England. To quote his conclusion:\`To each portrait can be attached some distinguishing features of the latter eighteenth century. Wilkes typifies that passion for personal and political freedom which Englishmen had inherited from the preceding epoch and were to carry on triumphantly throughout the next; Gibbon, the ironic detachment with which classicism mined away at classicist foundations. Boswell, inquisitive and introspective, tormented by the desire \\"savoir tout au fond,\\" represents a new revolutionary mode of thinking and in literature. As for Sterne -- it was his function to introduce the cult of sympathy and, whereas the Augustan Age had condescended austerely towards the weak and miserable, to discover in unhappiness and helplessness a positive moral charm, thus anticipating the age of Jacobin enthusiasts who for the sake of humanity would sign inhuman sentences, till the tyrannous reign of good intentions was at last replaced by the relatively mild despotism of a military dictator.London, September 1944'"},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"I used this book as part of an art lesson on the use of warm and cool colors to set a scene.

In order to prove himself, he has to pass through four chambers: the Kiva of Lions, the Kiva of Serpents, the Kiva of Bees, and the Kiva of Lightning. Upon his return to the pueblo, he is recognized and acclaimed by the people, who tell his story in dance. The story is firmly set in the American Southwest: characters have traditional occupations such as Corn Planter, Pot Maker, and Arrow Maker; the illustrations of many of the characters are reminiscent of traditional kachina dolls. Even the Boy's challenges are completed in kivas, ceremonial rooms found in the ruins of cliff dwellings in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado. The illustrations not only reflect this heritage with bright colors and geometric designs, but they also are integral to the story, always identifying the Boy by a special symbol and filling in the details of his journeys.

I wouldn't say don't read it, but I would not say definitely read it."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"I don't think I can judge Gerald McDermott's 1975 Caldecott winning picture book, \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" fairly. You see, I am a child of the 80s. I remember the early days of Colico Vision and Atari. I have very clear images in my head of some of the first arcade games, like Q-Bert, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Brothers. Why do I invoke such images when I'm (supposedly) reviewing \\"Arrow to the Sun\\"? Because like these games, \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" suffers for its time period. Author/illustrator Gerald McDermott strived very hard to make this story both deeply original and timeless. In many ways, he has succeeded. But if you, like myself, played a single pixilated arcade game in the late 70s or early to mid 80s then you'll take one look at this book and notice its video game aspects. It's a beautiful story. It's just tainted in the eyes of the children of the 80s.In this retelling of an ancient legend (or so the bookflap assures me), we learn about a boy unlike any other. When the Lord of the Sun sent a \\"spark of life\\" to earth, it found a young woman in a pueblo. The woman then gave birth to a son who found himself desperate to know his father. The boy leaves home and finally comes to realize from whom he is descended. To prove himself to the Lord of the Sun he withstands numerous video game-like trials and finally is transformed so that he may bring the Sun's spirit to the world of men.Echoes of this story have been found around the world in everything from the birth of Christianity to ancient Zeus-appears-as-a-shaft-of-light type tales. This particular rendition of such a story is a little more tasteful in its presentation. McDermott has always had a keen sense of storytelling. This is apparent in everything from his fan-freakin'-tastic, \\"Zomo the Trickster Rabbit\\" to the more contemporary \\"Creation\\". \\"Arrow to the Sun\\" has just the right tone of voice and increasing urgency one needs in a good story.As for the pictures, they look like characters from a Commodore 64 game. According to all-knowing bookflap, this tale, \\"captures the stylized look of Pueblo Indian art\\". I'm fairly certain I've seen Pueblo Indian art before. And I'm almost certain it didn't give me urges to go play Load Runner or Frogger. While much of the art in this book is very beautiful (the design on our hero's chest is a lovely geometric shape) it suffers from its form. The colors are beautiful, no question. The designs on many of the pictures is great. But the odd blocky pixel-like look is jarring and (to my mind) overly familiar.So unfortunately, McDermott ended up doing something he didn't want to. His intentions, I'm certain, were to create something timeless. Instead, he make a picture book that remains firmly stuck in the age of Pac-Man. If arcade settings and characters don't disturb you, you may be the perfect consumer for this tale. If, on the other hand, you prefer your picture books to be a little lovelier and a little less circa 1983, you might want to pass this puppy by. Just a warning to you Gen X parents out there."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"The story here is a Native American Pueblo tale. It begins when &quot;Long ago the Lord of the Sun sent the spark of life to earth.&quot; &quot;It traveled down the rays of the sun, through the heavens, and it came to the Pueblo.&quot; &quot;There it entered the home of a young maiden.&quot; &quot;In this way, the Boy came into the world of men.&quot;Growing up alone with his mother, the boy is derided by the other boys. &quot;Where is your father?&quot; Finally, the boy could take it no more. He left to find his father. The Corn Planter and the Pot Maker could not help him. But the wise Arrow Maker could. The Arrow Maker made the boy into an arrow and shot him into the sun.The boy claimed to be the son of the Lord of the Sun, but the Lord of the Sun demanded proof. Tests were involved, but the boy was not afraid. He successfully went through the four kivas of lions, serpents, bees and lightning. After the kiva of lightning, he was transformed and was filled with the &quot;power of the sun.&quot; The father and his son rejoiced.The Lord of the Sun said, &quot;Now you must return to earth, my son, and bring my spirit to the world of men.&quot; He was sent back as an arrow. &quot;The people celebrated his return in the Dance of Life.&quot;As you can see, this story is a very conceptual one that deals with spiritual matters involving cultural traditions that are probably unfamiliar to your child. The book will be easier to understand if you explain a little about the religious beliefs of the Pueblo Native Americans before reading this book to your child. You will also need to explain the point about how not having a father present can create a stir. The arrow transfers can be explained as magic, and the search itself can be likened to a quest of the sort that knights often undertook. The spiritual connection can be explained in terms of your own religious beliefs or tradition.The story is also a metaphor for the planting cycle, as well as the cycle of life and death.The key reason to read this book is to see some of the most remarkable modern renderings ever created of classic southwestern Native American pictograms. These pictograms are built from stylized geometric components combined into other geometric forms in a palette built mostly from yellow, orange, red, brown, and black. As accents, turquoise and green are added. These images are created with gouache (a thick form of water color) and preseparated black lines. These geometric shapes take literal beings and turn them into spiritual, conceptual ones. If you are like me, the transformation of the boy into the power of the rainbow against a sky of black will take your breath away. Not surprisingly, this book won Mr. McDermott the coveted Caldecott Medal in 1975 as the best illustrated children's book.After you finish enjoying the story of the book, I suggest that you also help your child understand some of the legends of other peoples in other times about planting and harvesting, as well as the manhood tests. If you are not familiar with any, The Golden Bough can be a good source for you. I remember being impressed as a child by how similar the beliefs are across cultures about common experiences like those related to agriculture. That impression helped me be more open about what appeared to be differences when I met people from other cultures. I was inclined to assume that we had more in common than our different clothes, manners, and languages would have suggested.Connect to the funamental way the sun serves as the ultimate source of food and power for us all!"},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"With dismay, I read the customer reviews of this book. There are 19 Pueblos in New Mexico, and more in Arizona. Which Pueblo is this book about? There is great variation from one to the other. Most troubling, however, is McDermott's presentation of the kiva. Our kivas are not places of trial. They are more akin to churches and temples where cultural knowledge is passed on from one generation to the next. Finally, extended families are central to Pueblo culture, and there is no stain of illegitimacy conferred on those who don't know who their father is. This book should NOT be used to teach about Pueblo Indians. These errors are major ones."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"Arrow to the sun is a fascinating story of a boy's trials to find the answer to a question. A skill you can emphasize with your reader is to retell the series of trials. Questioning during the telling of a story also reinforces comprehenhsion: What was the boy in search of? Why did the boy become an arrow? What other story can you think of where a character must go through trials to prove him or herself? Who are the Pueblo people? This last question will lead to a study of other Native American cultures and folktales. Teachers: run with this! Use this story as a springboard to the study of the Anasazi,LaKota,Aztec,or Mayan."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"This children's book is based on an old Pueblo Indian tale about a boy who is son of the Sun and who wishes to meet his father.

The book won the 1975 Caldecott Medal for best illustrations in a book for children. Children will love the story and the colors of the book have a great appeal."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"My mother read this book to me when I was a child, and I remember loving it, but hadn't seen it in probably 15 years until I bought it for my nephew. It is as good as I remember.I can attest to the fact that the high contrast, brightly colored drawings are mesmerizing for a small child. The best part of the book is when the boy must complete four tasks for the sun god to prove himself. The tasks are not narrated, you get to see how the tasks are completed from how the drawings change. It's so cool! I felt very smart as a little kid being able to discover what he did and figure it our for myself.On a cultural note, the narrative is similar to the Christ story. Mother gives birth to the boy (a virgin birth) after the sun god sends a ray of energy to her. The boy grows up and wants to know who his father is, and goes on a quest to find him and prove that he is indeed the son of the sun god. (That's why he becomes an arrow to the sun!)I think it's good for a child to be exposed to this story to begin to understand the universal elements of religion and that all cultures have a lot in common. Even those that seem strange are not so different from our own."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"To those who pay attention to the myths of various cultures, the fundamental premise of this book comes as no surprise. The Sun, in this case a god to the Pueblo Indians, sends a spark of life down to Earth and impregnates a woman. The child is a boy who is ridiculed by the other boys because he has no father. He then goes on a search for his father and gets no results until he consults the arrow maker.The arrow maker understands the situation and turns the boy into an arrow. He then shoots him into the sky so that the boy can converse with the Sun. After he claims to be to be the son of the Sun, the boy is given a series of trials, which he passes. He is then returned to the Earth and acknowledged by all as the son of the Sun. There is great rejoicing among the people as they now appreciate who the boy really is.This is a delightful tale that is illustrated in the style of the Pueblo Indians. The drawings are made using almost exclusively lines drawn at right angles. Most shapes are made from a combination of rectangular figures, yet so well done that it is still possible to detect the emotions of the characters. It is an excellent story for young children, it will teach them something about another culture and that is always a good thing."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"This book captured the eye of my 3-year old and his daycare friends as soon as it was opened for the first time.

One of George McDermott's best; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"This book just calls to me. I love the words, I love the pictures.

The reader really gets a feel for how the strange boy feels when he gets picked on because he is different. This is a fictional and adventurous book with such great details that it almost seems real as you're reading it.This story is set in a little pueblo where a mother is giving birth. Suddenly the God of the Sun sent down an arrow to the women and she gave birth to his son. As the little boy grows up, all the other boys make fun of him because he looks different and has no father. Then finally one day he sets off to find his father and to truly know who he is.The author does such a fantastic job on his voice and sentence fluency that when you're reading the book it seems like you are the strange little boy. This is my favorite children's book because I read it over and over since I was a kid and I enjoy Indian myths. I also enjoy this book because the pictures are phenomenal and the colors are amazing.People who like adventure and can relate to the little boy would love this outstanding book. This book is very inspiring and shows that you can do anything you want to if you try. I gave this book five out of five stars and I hope you'll like this awesome book just as much as I did.By Tanner"},{"Title":"Arrow to the sun: A Pueblo Indian tale","review":"Arrow to the Sun is a 1974 children's book by Gerald McDermott, adapted from Pueblo Indian myth. Here, the son of the Lord of the Sun strives to find and be accepted by his father.The story is straightforward, as these folktales go. On its own, it's largely unremarkable. But McDermott's illustrations are mind-blowing.Done in gouache and ink, the art features thick curves and right angles in a somewhat abstract style that's reminiscent of Pueblo art (it's also reminiscent of Atari 2600 graphics). McDermott's judiciously limited use of color heightens the art by drawing the focus to its texture and focusing on the mood of the story.Arrow to the Sun is a fine children's book with some of the most spectacular illustrations ever; it's certainly McDermott's best work."},{"Title":"9/11/2001: OTHER POEMS AND SHORT STORIES","review":"I had so much pleasure reading this book.

The first addresses the development of globalized capitalism within Chile; the second, very briefly, addresses the \\"Indian Problem\\" (quotes used by Frank as well as me); the third is on the development of globalized capitalism in Brazil, and the last is on the role of foreign aid generally.This is one of the more prominent authors on the subject of underdevelopment theory, and I give the book four stars because it is fairly essential to any student of alternative economic theory.The two shorter essays, on American Indians of Latin America and on foreign aid to Latin America by the rich countries, were generally unsatisfactory to me. In particular, the first did not address the challenges posed by American Indian populations to conventional populist politics, and generally avoided specific case analysis--Frank's principle strength as an economic thinker. The second, on the foreign aid, was vital since this book was published just around the time that a large foreign aid package to Latin America was in its early stages--the Alliance for Progress. Unfortunately, the book scarcely mentions the Alliance for Progress, and instead merely discusses foreign direct investment (FDA) as if it were not structurally distinct from civil aid programs like US AID. Considering that an impartial history of the Alliance (such as *The Alliance that Lost its Way*) is extremely supportive of Frank's thesis, this is disappointing and a missed opportunity.The longer essays--on the cases of Chile and Brazil--are concerned with the early years. For Chile, Frank's story is pretty much about the years 1541-1826, when the country was a part of the presidency of Peru. The essay on Brazil is more thematic, and extends up to the 1964 military junta. A core theme in Frank's analysis is that Brazil and Chile--as well as the other countries of Latin America--were never feudalist at all, but rather, from the very beginning, were exemplary capitalist economies. The institution of slavery (as practiced in the Americas) was perfectly compatible with modern conceptions of capitalism, and was only abolished when more powerful industrial interests prevailed.Frank introduces the ideas of capitalism as an inherently global system, involving a hierarchy of centers (metropoles) and peripheries (regions of underdevelopment). The center is served by a large number of subordinate \\"centers,\\" as, for example, Madrid was served by Lima, which was served by Santiago, which then had subordinate centers of capitalist expropriation in the countryside. Each of these subordinate centers was both a focal point of accumulation, and a target of exploitation by the one higher up. At the same time, the process of capital accumulation creates underdevelopment by draining each region of the means of production.Frank argued that the calamity of underdevelopment, exploitation, and the racial violence that characterized the history of the Americas was an inherent outcome of capitalism. Frank was very much aware of the philosophical controversy this position aroused: if he claimed that capitalism was identical to all the negative things that coexisted in space and time with it as a system, he later conceded, then it ceased to have any analytical value. The socialist system was later acknowledged by him and others on the hard left as having been in reality another distortion of capitalism; which meant that no control group existed, except perhaps extremely tiny isolated societies in Africa or the South Pacific.He was also aware of the more urgent controversy of equating a system of economic organization that was virtually inescapable with certain large historical events that occurred in societies that hosted it. It's rather like saying the use of SQL relational database management--now universal--is to blame for the late invasion of Iraq and global climate change. While a technical feature of computer software may not be as significant as capitalism, they both require some distinction from contemporary events if they are to have any usefulness as conceptions. Otherwise they become merely lamentations of the human condition. Unfortunately, this awareness came later than the book itself, and I was never convinced that it was capitalism per se that was underdeveloping Latin America, and not the outcome of historical struggles peculiar to the European and North American metropoles."},{"Title":"Small Animal Internal Medicine: Case Management Test Booklet","review":"This book is useful as a self test, but the way the book is designed makes it difficult and tedious to follow.

Recommended as a start for a novice interested in the US's achievements and success that has generated it current tremendous economic power.My only negative opinion is this: the book, as other reviewers here have allude to, glosses over and even completely dismisses critical events in US economic history. One striking example of this is Henry Poor, whose company today is one of the three major credit ratings agencies in the world (Standard & Poor's). Nonetheless, Poor began his career in mid-19th century as one of the pioneer financial analysts providing research information concerning the emerging railroad industry. Without his efforts, the lack of transparency of a railroad company's financial progress would have severely dampened enthusiasm and reduced the number of actual investments that were made during that period."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"American Economic history is an amazing story and this is one of the few books that chronicles it well.

The author says that John Adams and Andrew Jackson both considered bankers creating money out of thin-air to be theft and the author then goes on to say they were wrong. His explanation for them being wrong is as follows: he claims that because the money created and then borrowed is backed by the collateral of the borrower the money is actually monetizing a dead asset and perfectly legitimate. So what does the borrower gain for the consideration of allowing his property to become backing for the bankers printed dollars? Nothing but the opportunity to pay interest. The author then goes on to say that the bankers can print as much as they want as long as they don't print too much. He never says how much is too much, but he mentions that bank after bank failed because they printed too much.Anyone who thinks that it is okay that bankers are permitted to create money from nothing when the rest of the population has to work for it has been brain-washed.The author of this book diminished the plight and suffering of millions at the hands of these avaricious and greedy bankers all while making heroes of these very bankers and chalking their amoral plundering up to the \\"greed is good\\" mantra. Look up Ferdinand Pecora and the history of the Glass-Steagall Act to understand how deeply sociopathic these bankers truly were and, now that Glass-Steagall has been repealed, have resumed being.\\"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks...will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered....

If you're looking for a victim tinged, class conflict scenario here, where the have-nots rise up against the haves against a back-drop of economic determinism, you won't find it. What you will find is the story underpinning America's greatness.Unfortunately the information in this book is not widely taught in the universities today just as it wasn't taught at Michigan State where I was in attendance some 45-50 years ago. What we got instead was the labor movement theory of history, but then Michigan is a labor state with the auto unions in control so what should one have expected?Though the author doesn't mention it, labor unions have always started with good intentions only to eventually destroy their host and their union specific - railroads, steel, airlines, automobiles, trucking, etc; they eat their own, witness GM and Chrysler today. The only growth in unions is with government workers and they don't need them due to civil service rules. But then their true purpose is to contribute mightily to the political party that represents them.In this tome we hear the story of American ingenuity where unbounded energy has operated within a legal system that protects private property, one where human capital has been allowed to develop and flourish. From exports like tobacco, sugar, rice, indigo, livestock, timber, cod and cotton, we're told of the development and importance of the corporation, double entry accounting, the steamboat, the locomotive, the railroads, steel, oil, automobiles, medicine and the computer. It can be said with no exaggeration that America has truly led the world.Too much academic attention and exaggeration has been applied to the parts of our system that have disenfranchised or harmed workers, and too little has been given to reporting how those like Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie relentlessly lowered prices which allowed consumers everywhere to earn a surplus which upgraded their lifestyles and that of their families. The development of this empire of wealth and its success should be compared to every other country on the globe. It's no accident that the rule of law has contributed to the majority of developed countries in the world being of English origin or former British Colonies. Wouldn't it be interesting to look at England's impact on the nine million patents in the PTO, comparing it with all the other nationalities? They don't provide those stats, but one has to wonder why so many other countries have held their citizens back? The story here is that America didn't. It explains why people around the world come to America, still the land of opportunity (Hernando de Soto's, \\"the Mystery of Capitalism\\" offers poignant insights in this regard.)But nothing will stem the naysayer, the same type who stands in a howling blizzard in June trying to convince us that the globe is constantly warming due to mankind's' (read, \\"America's\\") development of carbon using industries. Sophistry is their routine and exaggeration of the negative, their method.This is a book on how America became the great nation it is, and everyone should read it. Perhaps the government will subsidize that exercise too, do ya think?"},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Exciting. Filled with stunning statistics meshed with lively interpretations and many surprises. This book is really a survey of American history, but from one perspective: the development of America's capital wealth and influence. What is fascinating is that this string of events that made the USA what is is were largely unrelated. Stuff just happened, although sometimes one need prompted an opportunity or solution. No grand plan drove the events, inventions, improvements, developments. They happened because of the relationship of need, opportunity, and free enterprise.This book should be in every historian's library. Do yourself a favor and get it.

I highly recommend this book to everyone who thinks they might want to have a better understanding of how the US economy developed from founding to present day - and doesn't have a degree in economics or math. I find myself referencing this book constantly as I discuss the current economic situation of our country with friends and family. Given the current situation with the automakers in Detroit his chapter on the development of GM and Ford and the auto industry should be required reading.

Besides,it is beautifully written and never dull. By reading this book, I was able to fathom America's economic might. Amid praise, I have to say that I object certain comments made throughout the book by Mr. Gordon because, more than fact, they seem to convey his bias as a deeply conservative thinker. Nevertheless, the story that evolves through the pages of this book is truly an epic. This book manages to be informative and entertaining at the same time. The book itself is easy to read (close to double space between lines) and has a handsome cover. I am looking forward to read other books authored by Mr. Gordon."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Gordon is a fine writer and An Empire of Wealth is a not too demanding read. But it is also not too demanding in another way. Although interesting in parts and sweeping in scope, the book is basically a 419 page (I have the paperback) puff piece. Most red-blooded Americans will find Gordon's boosterism infectious (I did), but what is significant about the book is what it doesn't say and what Gordon chooses to leave out of history.Acoording to Gordon, all of the U.S.'s wealth was (1) essentially built by great men, (2) come by honestly (or through charmingly ingenious roguery), (3) a matter of simple addition, with little downside. Anyone even slightly familiar with the history of the industrial revolution, the westward expansion, the struggles of trade unions, Government corruption and favoritism, or monopoly practice will need to check their intellects at the door.

When you want a book on U.S. history that goes beyond wars and presidents, this is the book for you. However, he covers a lot in a relatively small book and I wish more time was spent on topics such as the great depression and the stock bubble of the 90s (which was neglected completely). Also, I wish he spent less time measuring economic prosperity with such quantitative measures as GDP growth and more time talking about what the general sentiment was among the public. However, for those that just want a primer on the U.S. economic machine, this book is perfect. Note that like most history books, this one is shaped by the author's own ideologies. Arguments are made throughout the book and though most would label Mr. Gordon as a conservative, he doesn't pretend to be an impartial observer of history's events (which is an impossible feat), which is refreshing and often enlightening. Try this book. You couldn't possibly be disappointed."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Forests have been cleared for all the books that have been written on American History. While a few stand out from the pack, it is harder to find one that is fresh, interesting, and informative. \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" is all of those things and I strongly recommend it to you. Instead of being a military, political, or diplomatic history, John Steel Gordon has written an economic biography of our country. Do not mistake this approach for a dry treatise on economics. Far from it, this book is full of struggle, wild success, bitter failure, dislocation from wrenching changes in the economy due to the rise of new technologies, and marshalling resources for war.He begins with the resource rich, but hostile wilderness that the early explorers found. The British made the first permanent settlement at Jamestown in what is now Virginia. The settlers had come for gold, found mica that they mistook for gold ore, and only 38 of the 105 survived the first winter. They kept coming from England and they kept struggling until they began to grow and export tobacco. Mr. Gordon then takes us on a fast paced, and amazing journey through the nation's founding, the movement west, our major wars, depressions, and the rise (and fall) of technologies such as steam, the railroads, machine supported agriculture, banking, and international trade. He ends the book with the horrible events we experienced on September 11, 2001.Not only is this a fun read for anyone interested in American History, it would be a fine addition to the history readings for high school or college students. I especially like the author's honesty about the good and the bad in our history without making us the bad guys or the source of all pain and suffering on the planet. The reader comes away with a richer understanding of our history and feels good about our place in the world.The book has a particularly nice bibliography in addition to the chapter notes. The readings offered in the bibliography would enrich anyone and I also urge you to look at them and read as many as you can. There is also an index to help you find certain topics. (I am a big fan of indexes and cannot understand any modern book without one - given how easily computers can create them and allow the editor to work them into something useful. Yet, we still get books without indexes because people think they will be more popular. What I want is useful!)"},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I purchased \\"Empire of Wealth\\" to address the glaring deficit in my knowledge of American history from an economic perspective. At the same time, I was dreading that this history would be boring and dry.It is anything but. Gordon's effort is downright gripping, a compelling read chock full of information. Gordon has a knack for finding the most intriguing aspects of history and explaining difficult concepts in a manner that is quickly grasped. He is able to get to the heart of a concept without dragging along pedantic baggage. His writing is flawless and the raw historical material is seamlessly synthesized with consummate professionalism.Gordon wraps his discussion of larger economic themes around the impact that invention, infrastructural development, and politics had on the burgeoning American economy. Examples include the Erie Canal, road and railroad building, the cotton gin, or the bessemer furnace.From an \\"ideological\\" perspective, Gordon falls into the typical free-market, pro-deficit camp, which is consistent with the vast majority of economists today. However, he is far from dogmatic or simplistic, as some reviewers maintain. He acknowledges that unregulated capitalism is \\"red in tooth and claw\\" but that labor unions have overstepped their bounds, for example. Gordon devotes much time to the monopolies, oligopolies and collusion of post- Civil War America. At the same time, he fairly points out that not all political attempts to defang raw capitalism were the panaceas so keenly hoped-for.A nice feature of Gordon's approach is his recognition of less-appreciated historical actors. For example, he gives the much-derided Hoover some credit for helping make possible the New Deal, insofar in that he tried every means possible short of big-government alphabet-soup to stem the growing depression. FDR would not have been able to introduce his heavy-handed methods, Gordon contends, without voter experience with Hoover's more gradualist and ultimately ineffective policies.The author narrates far too much in \\"Empire of Wealth\\" to describe here in detail, but particularly stellar is Gordon's discussion of money supply, deficits, trade balances, the role of a national bank, Northern vs. Southern economies, income tax, the history and role of Wall Street and the pernicious boom-and-bust cycle engendered by Jeffersonian opposition to Hamilton's central bank.\\"Empire of Wealth\\" surpassed all of my expectations. Gordon's effort is a surprisingly enjoyable and very necessary history that will not disappoint."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This has got to be one of the best history books that I have read. The book chronicles the start of the United States and the inovations and trials that made the nation great. I particularly enjoyed how it intertwined the innovations with information on the thoughts of politicians, businesmen, and others of the era, and how events such as slavery impacted the economics of the time.This was a very well written book. I initially picked it up from the library, and then purchased a copy to add to my library."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"There are many theories as to why the United States rose to economic dominance in the world. To some, this result was inevitable, but that success was achieved in spite of some major setbacks. Gordon describes the history of the United States in economic terms, and from many of the events, we can see much about what has been done well and that which was done poorly. From these events, we can also find some guidance concerning how things should be done in the future.There were three major economic crises in the first two hundred years. The first was the aftermath of the revolution for independence. Since most of the colonial trade was with England and many of the wealthy were opposed to freedom from England, there was a major economic downturn after the war ended. Many types of currency were in circulation and the new country was an economic basket case. Fortunately for the future of the country, there was a person who knew how to solve the problem and had the stature to carry it out. That man was Alexander Hamilton and his program of establishing and funding a national debt was a resounding success. In 1789 the United States government was financially insolvent, yet five years later it had the highest credit rating in Europe. Hamilton also established a central bank, which served as a financial anchor for the nation as long as it existed. Gordon gives Hamilton his due credit for this, noting some of the opposition by other founding fathers who couldn't fathom it and what it has meant for the country since then.The second major crisis was much more long term, namely the abolition of the central bank by Andrew Jackson. His actions led to the deepest and lengthiest economic depression that the country has ever seen. The early years of the 1830's were a boom time, all government debt had been retired and there was a revenue surplus. His executive order in 1837 requiring land be paid for in gold and silver led to a banking collapse, interest rates skyrocketed and in less than a year, 90 percent of the nation's factories were closed. The bottom of this depression was not reached until six years after Jackson's order. As Gordon points out, the lack of a central bank was a problem that continued to fester until the Federal Reserve System was established in 1913. Even then it was not up to the task and it was the depression of the 1930's that led to the changes that molded it into the form we know today. It can be argued that the greatest single mistake ever made by an American president was Andrew Jackson's destruction of the central bank.The third major crisis was the great depression of the 1930's. What made it so much more devastating than the depression of the 1830's were the different demographics of the country. In 1930, a much larger percentage of the people worked in factories and fewer could rely on subsistence agriculture to survive. It was also a time when there were political alternatives that seemed more effective. Fascism appeared to have solved many of the problems in Germany and Italy and the communist faade of success in the Soviet Union was attractive to many.What makes this book outstanding is how Gordon treats problems such as these, in explaining the causes and why the solutions worked. It is easy to see many of the reasons why the United States has grown to economic dominance, such as an abundance of natural resources, very low military spending for most of time, the large influx of a labor force determined to succeed and a legal system that protected individual rights.One other fundamental lesson that can be derived from the book is the value of targeted government spending and support for critical infrastructure. The Erie Canal and the transcontinental railroad were both incredible achievements that cost a great deal but returned enormous economic advantages. Fully one-third of the capital in New York was used to fund the Erie Canal, yet it took less than ten years for this debt to be paid off. Government support was critical in steering those projects to success, and we also have the modern example of the Internet.To many, the rise of the economic power of the United States was inevitable. As Gordon points out, that is probably, but not necessarily the case. In any case, this is an epic history of the rise of American economic power."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"What a great effort by John Steele Gordon. Empire of Wealth covers the history of the economy of the United States from Jamestown through today and does so in an insight-filled, page-turning manner. Even as a fairly avid reader of economics and history, I found myself learning something about why our country is the way it is on almost every page in this book.A great story of people, culture, technology, money, and a country - this book truly deserves its high rating."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This is an excellent historical treatment of economic change from the settling of the American colonies through the economic policies of the Reagan presidency. Savvy citizen investors and consumers need to understand economics and the economy, and Gordon definitely helps us do that.Major strengths in this book:* How the original American colonies were established and grew economically. Have NEVER seen this material so well put together. It's an economic genealogy of the states.* How changes in transportation and manufacturing impacted economic development (rivers and canals, steamboats and railroads, steam engines and cotton gins, etc.) LOTS of insight here.* How the American economy went through not one or two but many recurring depressions over time. Good treatment of differing policies of presidents and congresses. Good treatment of historical conflict about having a central Bank of the United States. IMPORTANT changes in American mindset here.* Good review of changes in money. This was a wild and crazy topic in American practice.* How the American economy went from few to many stockholders. Good treatment of changes in regulation and deregulation.* Good start on oil. How it came in. How it became dominant.Weaknesses:* Depth of treatment suffers after Reagan era. No mention of Clinton or Bush(es) even though book is copyright 2004.* The switch from nuts and bolts topics like steam engines to abstract topics like fiscal policy could use more elaboration. This is a valuable and critical point he's making in the history of the country's mindset and it needs more treatment.* Treatment of computers and internet lacks subtle analysis and is \\"gee whiz\\" - would like the author to apply same depth of thinking here as he applied discussing impacts of earlier technologies.Author's bias?There is a bit of \\"rah rah\\" especially at the end, however it is not a major distraction.The comprehensiveness and insightfulness of the material from Colonization through Reaganization is excellent. I know there are conflicting opinions about politics but savvy citizen investors and consumers need to understand economics and the economy. Gordon helps us do that."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Empire of Wealth.\\" It was an easy-to-read book. The little nuggets of information in it were fascinating. There is no doubting Gordon's central premise: the economy of the US, which is based in capitalism and the pursuit of wealth, has allowed the nation to become the most powerful in the world. At the same time, getting to that position of power caused a LOT of pain in many regular folks. Gordon appropriately points out slavery, but the pain has been constant. That is not to say it hasn't been worth it, but there is always another side to every story, and Gordon - as well as those who have made lots of money - focus more on the positiive side. The section on the 1980s offers me a little more of an ability to comment. In pointing out the magic of de-regulation and tax cuts under President Reagan, I am sure much capitalistic energy was released. At the same time, Gordon doesn't mention how Reagan increased taxes, Bush increased taxes, and Clinton increased taxes. Any or all of those moves should have reversed positive economic trends that Gordon celebrates. Of course, we know it didn't happen that way. Even after Republicans in the early 1990s cried that Clinton's tax increases would send the nation back into recession, those Republicans were wrong. And the Reagan-80s also left a lot of regular folks without any gains, if not losses. Those stories are no less important. There is far more to a successful nation than unbridled capitalism. But I don't doubt that a country is more likely to be successful with more capitalism rather than less. In fairness to Gordon, he does an excellent job in highlighting FDR's New Deal and how it helped bolster the US when the nation was in difficult times.I highly recommend that after reading this fine book, everyone looks up Jeff Madrick's fantastic review essay from the New York Review of Books (V 52, # 4, 03/10/05). He makes some excellent points that need to be considered along with Gordon's book."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"\\"An Empire of Wealth : The Epic History of American Economic Power\\" by John Steel Gordon is an absolutely fabulous work of History and Literature. If this fast moving and exciting survey of the greatest nation the world has ever known was placed in the hands of American students it just may revive the study of History in this country. In an age of political correctness and horribly written text books John Steel Gordon proves that history is not boring, only that there are boring teachers and badly written history books.

And in addition to the heroically innovating entrepreneurs, the book also serves up political heroes including notably Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan.I was disappointed, however, with the author's treatment of the Great Depression. No mention is made of the fact that the 1929 stock market crash was transformed into the Depression, because the Federal Reserve under Treasury Secretary and ex officio Board Chairman Andrew Mellon refused to increase bank reserves for four years thus nearly destroying the banking system the Federal Reserve was created to preserve. And that his successor, John Eccles, appointed by Roosevelt turned the economy around in 1934 by increasing bank reserves by 50 percent in 1933, then 25 percent in 1934, and then another 25 percent in 1935. Schumpeter had a better appreciation than Gordon does of economic institutions.I also found the book's title misleading. When I saw the term \\"empire\\", I expected more about how the U.S. influences international politics and especially the other great powers of the world. There is little about empire until Gordon's last chapter where he describes the Soviet Union as the last of the old-fashioned empires based on military force in contrast to the American \\"empire\\" based on wealth. In fact I still don't know just how he applies the term \\"empire\\" to this nation or its world situation.Thomas J.

You can learn much about not only the history of American economy, but about American history as a whole. The best part is that you will enjoy the reading, which I found to be page turning. Not many historical books can be put in that category. Reading this book is a must!"},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I first heard Mr. Gordon on 20/20 talking about the 1987 mini-crash of the stock market, and when he said, \\"The Fed did the right thing then, it injected huge amounts of liquidity into the market.\\" If people believe creating money out of thin air and giving it to the politically connected helps the economy, they really need to go back to Econ 101. Oh wait, Econ 101 these days says exactly that in almost every government run school in America. For a much more detailed and insightful look at the History of Banking and the true cause of the booms and busts (hint: The Federal Reserve itself), read Murray Rothbard's \\"A History of Money and Banking in the United States,\\" or his \\"The Mystery of Banking.\\" There you will find sound logic, as opposed to this trash."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"this book is very nationalistic and pro-america in the phrasing. which made me want to stop reading instantly and i couldn't take some things seriously. there were some claims about america that were made in the book that were just included and unexplained while things that is common knowledge to most people were given detailed summaries."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Do you like Republicans? Do you believe that we owe our very existence to the capitalists? Do you think that Thomas Jefferson was a fool and that a central bank controled by moneyed interests is the only hope for the future. Do you believe that William Jefferson Clinton did not exist? Do you hang on every word that was uttered by Ronald Reagan whether formulated in his mind or the mind of his political handlers? Do you believe that when tariffs no longer serve the capitalist elite that they may turn to \\"free trade\\" without even a glance back at their history of tariff support to bolster big business? If you can answer \\"yes\\" to these and countless other questions contrived to create the impression that J.P. Morgan and the like rank above all other inhabitants of the earth then this book is for you. It is a thinly disguised promotion of unbridled capitalism over all other beliefs and values. It is a sordid attempt to justify greed and avarice as \\"American\\" values."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This is review is EXTREMELY partial, as the third sentence of Gordon's AN EMPIRE OF WEALTH was so thoughtless, tasteless, and incorrect, that it took alot of patience for me to pick it back up and read it for a class assignmet. Had I not been required to write about this particular book, I would left it where I had flung it after reading Gordon's thougtless, tasteless, and incorrect statemant that Abraham Lincoln's reputed formula for gaining knowledge of a nation's character by learning of its land, laws, and people is made difficult by it utter lack of ancient history. I have never before seen such a bad foot put forward so quickly in the writing of an authour whom I usually find to be more tolerable."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"As an avid American History enthusiast, I've read many books in an effort to greater appreciate where we come from, but none have impacted me in quite the same way as this, John Steele Gordon's masterpiece. Gordon begins the book explaining the nature and background so desperately needed to understand the colonist movement of America, and ends describing to us the situation we currently live in.I am an economics student, and I enjoyed Gordon's insight into the free market/capitalistic system that we live in today. Doing a wonderful job of being accurate and fair, this book will give you the insight you need to understand the economic events that transpire today, and perhaps why they take the shape they do. We live in a troubled world where opinions on the future direction of the economy overtake our ears from every side, both logical and not, and some semblance of understanding, historical background, and perspective is needed. I cannot recommend a more wonderful book to accomplish the perspective, and general knowledge that must be had in order to make informed arguments to what is heard on the news these days. Gordon is perhaps at his best when he points out the little (and perhaps counted by us as insignificant) achievements that have advanced us so far:\\"Accounting had been known since civilization arose in Mesopotamia. Indeed, writing, the defining attribute of civilization, was in all likelihood invented to help keep the books. But accounting did not advance much for several thousand years thereafter, until double-entry bookkeeping was developed in Italy in the 15th century. Double entry makes it much easier to detect errors and allows a far more dynamic financial picture of an enterprise to emerge from the raw numbers. Because of double-entry bookkeeping, it became possible for people to invest in distant enterprises and still keep track of how their investment was doing. \\"While the book might entertain (if only slightly) a certain bias against other forms of economic thought, the overall effect is a wonderful presentation of history and economics. Many people will shy away from anything having to do with economic theory remembering their own college professors lecturing for eternity about supply and demand, but the practice of the theory has been pervasive throughout our own American history. Gordon gives a fun and entertaining way to view it! This certainly isn't your college course of American economic thought, but a vivid stroll down the roads of Jamestown, the Streets of the 1930's, and even our own homes and how they came to be."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"If you are hungry for understanding history, this is a book for you. The information included ranges from the construction of the first cotton gin, to the origin of our current time zones. It is written in a concise, informative manner that peaks your interest with each chapter. If textbooks in school were available with this type of information, our youth would be in a much better position to understand our history, and perhaps be more successful in their endeavors. I highly recommend this book to any student of history."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This comprehensive economic history of America highlights the benefits of economic liberty, and the advantages of free markets, across every period of American development.

Charming humor -- John Steele Gordon is worth reading."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This is a great book about the economic history of the USA. It gives great insight about how this country became such a super power.

You will not be buried in technical language. He also has a great way of discussing the politics of the historical time without taking sides that will make you chuckle. You will also be shocked at the similarity to stuff that goes on in politics today. All in all a great read."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"John Gordon Steele's an Empire of Wealth is a very good book about the history of capitalism in this country and the vital link between America's greatness as a nation and the free-market capitalism it has always practiced. Steele's book is a good antidote to the constant stream of anti-capitalist thinking permeating today's Washington politics, especially that represented by the current bombast from the political left. He testifies to the importance of free markets in both ensuring economic growth and personal liberty, a truth which our Founding Fathers and later-day economists such as Milton Friedman readily grasped. A very good read for those who still admire and love this country (and want to be reminded why we all should)."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This book is a one volume \\"epic history of American economic power\\" that focuses on the fantastic capacity of the United States as a machine to create wealth (if not to redistribute it); its approach is surprisingly similar to what a 19th century bourgeois apologist might have chosen, that of a believer in a vision of \\"progress\\" that would now appear old fashioned and naive, especially to the more left leaning readers. But one has to admit that one of the most striking aspects of American history is the sheer speed and size of all economic developments, and that, from the very start.Of course this is due to the immensity and diversity of the territory and its natural resources, in wildlife, agricultural lands, timber, minerals, oil, etc. But also, as this territory filled with people, to its huge size as a market for industrial and later consumer products and services, combined with the absence of the many cultural and political obstacles that some may say still characterize \\"Old Europe\\".As a consequence, America was and may still be a land of incredible opportunity for entrepreneurs, native or immigrant, and capitalists. This gave substance to \\"the American dream\\" and it is this powerful, seemingly unstoppable march that the author has chosen to emphasize and dramatize. He succeeded in writing an enjoyable book that reads like a novel. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject who prefers not to be bogged down in charts, graphs and econometrics. American economic history written in this way is fascinating and I picked up at least two anecdotes that are quite revealing. First, every stock exchange boom in American history attracted a lot of capital from abroad (this includes the 1990s dotcom bubble); European investors lost a lot of money each time, financing American growth without gaining much from it. Second, American farmers suffered a lot from the advent of the automobile. All the crops that used to feed horses were suddenly made \\"available\\" for humans, which depressed agricultural prices for decades and caused the State to intervene to support farmers. With the current development of biofuels (the new name for fodder), this trend is now going the other way..."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"If you were put off U.S. History by your High School text book read this book book it could undo the damage. It could create a new history buff.The author believes in capitalism and the ability it has to exploit new technology. But he also sees the need for a goverment that will help capitalism to thrive. Franklin Roosvelt is a hero in this book, because he helped save capitalism by reducing the pain from the more exreme side-effects of the workings of the economic system. John Gordon also likes Alexander Hamilton. If Hamilton had prevailed politically over Thomas Jefferson and we had had a strong cental bank back then, who knows we may have not had to suffer the Great Depression? The author further implies that many years later on, if a number of key officials/bankers had not been sick at just the wrong time, or had done just the right thing at the right time (expanded the money supply more or sooner) at key moments in history the Great Depression could have been reduced to a big financial crisis or a recession. But that might not be the correct impression, depending upon what else you read. If you read Ben S. Bernanke's (new Fed. Chairman) \\"Essays of the Great Depression\\" you get the impression that something much more fundamental may have been wrong with the U.S./Global economic system (a badly flawed gold standard and sticky-wages) and so even if all the things that Mr. Gordon \\"indicates\\" that should have been done had been done, it may have not made a diffrence -- The Great Depression was on the way anyway, not preventable just like Katrina. Today we have the strong central bank that the author wants and Hamilton wanted. So now, are we safer from economic disaster? Not if you listen to some \\"experts\\". They say the the Central Bank has more controls and tools to work with, but the leader of the Fed. could be flawed in his judgement as to the important role Gold (now priced at about $570),of all things, still has in the economy.This book may not solve anything for you but it can make you really think about many diffrent aspects of our economic history, and now health books tell you thinking is good for you.k"},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"An Empire of Wealth - The Epic History of American Economic Power, by John Steele Gordon, is a marvelous one volume narrative on the economic history of the United States. While Gordon's work is clearly not ground breaking in terms of research, he synthesizes four hundred years of progress into a very readable and even entertaining book. Writing anything on this topic in such a fashion is clearly a challenge and one the author certainly aces.Gordon writes about the root causes and pivotal events, inventions and American ingenuity that propelled the economy upward. He also handles the precipitants of economic downturns and depressions very concisely. His ability to put into context many statistics is something that more academic writers could learn from. The book is loaded with \\"gems\\". Include are: \\"Considered as a \`public work,' the GI Bill proved to be the Erie Canal of the new, postindustrial economy that was then, quite unrecognized, coming into being\\". On capitalism and industry (with specific regard to Standard Oil), \\"Monopolies, like everyone else, want to maximize their profits, not their prices. Lower prices, which increase demand, and increased efficiency, which cuts costs, is usually the best way to achieve the highest possible profits\\". Gordon also handles the political aspects of all periods very well with valid criticisms of Jefferson and Jackson and insightful writing on Hoover, Roosevelt and Reagan. While he is obviously a free market thinker it does not cloud his reasoning about the need for a central bank, missing after Jackson disbanded the Bank of the United States. He also notes Keynes \\"General Theory\\" and the role for government spending in a depressed economy.The reader is given a bibliography of some great books about American history that, while largely not academic in nature, are intellectually stimulating and allow for further reading on a topic that perhaps was covered in this book in less detail than might have been desired. This is a very well written and fascinating read. If a reader has any interest at all in this topic, it is very much a must read."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I found this book to be extremely interesting. It covers the history of the US's economy from early colonial times right up through the current day. The book is written in an informative yet entertaining way, not like a dry college text book. If you're looking for a good book that explains how the US was built, then get this book."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"As a student of both history and economics, I find the analysis and writing to be simplistic and dry, at times. It appeared to me that this book is writen at a very basic level, without fundamental analysis. Although I consider myself a libertarian I found Howard Zinn's liberal account of American History and progress (although not a text based on economics)to be much more engaging and enjoyable."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Hindsight is 20/20 and the human element of our memories, whether personal or historical significance is involved has a way of filtering out the negative and magnifying the positive. The same could be said of \\"Empire of Wealth\\" by John Gordon Steele. The book is very entertaining and insightful even though at times it seems to forget the human element of suffering caused by times of economic down-turn. That being said, if you would like to learn how luck, self intrest, good leadership, bad leadership, yankee ingenuity, exploitation of foriegn and domestic native peoples, and war made America what she is today, read this book! If you are an American it will make you more aware of how fortunate you are and what potential you really have to maximize your legacy, what ever it is. If you are not an american, sorry about you're luck."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"This easily read history of the U.S. does a good job of picking topics that give interesting insights. I know a fair amount U.S. economic history, but was surprised to find many good insights that I wasn't aware of, e.g. the effect of autos on the need for farmland (much of it had been used for horse fodder).His understanding of economics is good compared to typical historians, but mediocre by the standards of economists. His erratic biases are generally not hard to see through. His worship of central banks is rather annoying.His attitudes toward wage and price controls are bizarre. On page 371 he says \\"political pressure brought wage and price controls to a premature end in 1946. The result was a roaring inflation\\". He later gives a competent description of why wage and price controls are bad when describing Nixon's imposition of them. Then a page later he seems to imply that the long gas lines in the U.S. were caused by Arab refusal to ship oil to the U.S. rather than by price controls.His claim that Hoover and Roosevelt differed little in their proposed policies might have been true during the 1932 election, but he overlooks an important policy difference that became clear before Roosevelt was inaugurated which had at least as much affect on the 1933 banking crisis as any cause that Gordon hints at - Hoover remained committed to the gold standard, but Roosevelt's advisers hinted at a devaluation of the dollar relative to gold. Given a monetary system under which bank deposits would get devalued in that case, but deposits withdrawn as gold coin would not get devalued, it's clear why the impending inauguration triggered a strong motive to withdraw deposits."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"The author cheer leads for the wealthy and powerful yet never examines the human toll or condition of the American people as a whole. His Bias is obvious in such inaccurate statement he makes..pg.339 \\"Glass-Steagall had been a mistake\\"..this book was published in 2004..wonder if he still believes Glass Steagall was a mistake in 2008 after our financial bailouts of the Banks?

And as I continued through the answer was - very little.The South chose to not build railroads or factories - WHY? The battle to fund the transcontinental railroad was a major political fight for decades - no discussion of that fight. I could go on about point after point.I'd say reading this is like watching the TV show Friends. It's an enjoyable experience but afterwards you haven't learned anything."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I had higher hopes for this book. After seeing its excerpts quoted elsewhere on the 'Net I expected a richer, more insightful, overall of American economic history than was present in the book. I am willing to put the confusion down to my own incorrectly set level of expectations.Overall, the book seems to rely on multiple anecdotes, some interesting and most less so, and mostly context-less numbers to make its point -- that United States developed quickly, powerfully, and is now the most powerful nation that ever was. Since I generally have trouble with blanket statements of the \\"richest ever\\", \\"most powerful ever\\", I was not too crazy when the author repeatedly threw these phrases out without ever qualifying them in some strict numerical sense. Moreover, there is precious little comparison in this book to see how American economic development was different from that of England, or Germany. The chapters I found most interesting was a brief overview of the issues surrounding the revocation of the charter of the Bank of the United States and some of the anecdotes centering on the trade in ice and market panics.That said, the book is a quick and painless read. The writing is very straighforward and easily comprehended. I got the hardcover edition as a gift, and am glad I did not have to pay for it."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"One of my favorite books I read was \\"The Great Game\\" by John Steele Gordonwhich is the reason why I bought this book, it was very informative but it got me upset a lot for some reason that I haven't been able to identify yetI had to quit reading it with 75 pages leftIt would be a great book if I were a Capitalist which I am not, I think I got really angry because I was reading about how Capitalism really is I did learn a lot about my country though which is more saddening than anything though1. money-stock market and corporations2. beauty-Hollywood and whores"},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"I agree that Gordon is what we call a \\"coffee table\\" historian, whose work is much wider than it is deep, and heavily shaded by his blatant pro-free market leanings. Compared with other historians of the Great Depression like Galbraith, for example, the writing is turgid and leaden.A good illustration of Gordon's neoliberal bias is his blithe conclusion on NPR the other day that the notion that suicides increased in the aftermath of the 1929 financial crash was nothing but a \\"myth.\\" A similar claim is recited in this book. But in this case Gordon simply doesn't know what he's talking about. First, suicides are notoriously underreported, especially by middle-class families for whom they remain something of a scandal. Second, according to the CDC, the official US suicide rate did indeed increase dramatically in the wake of the 1929 crash. The median rate for 1920-29 was 12.2 per 100,000. It was 13.5 in 1928, 13.9 in 1929,15.6 in 1930, 16.8 in 1931, and 17.4 in 1932. Obviously it took some time for the negative wealth effects of the 10/29/1929 crash to register. The fact that, as Gordon claims, there were few extra suicides reported in the \\"last quarter of 1929 in New York City\\" is irrelevant -- most wealthy speculators lived elsewhere and the effects took time. Third, A simple check of the New York Times and Time Magazine archives for that period will confirm that there were indeed many individual cases of reported suicides by prominent investors. Fourth, the aggregate suicide rate then retreated gradually, to 14.3 in 1936, before jumping to 15 in 1937 and 15.3 in 1938 -- consistent with the lagged effects of 1937's steep slide. Similar increases in US suicide rates can also be found for the steep 1907-08 recession, for later US recessions, and for other countries. It's not surprising the 1987 stock crash didn't produce many deaths; it was over quickly, and didn't produce a recession. Would be scholar Gordon needs to do his homework."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"... you feel that Gordon's portrayal of U.S economic history, especially since the end of the 19th century onward, is compelling. Let me just say this -- Arthur Laffer, of the Laffer curve fame, receives a brief mention in this book given all that the author could have written about. Need I say more? If you're of the right-wing persuausion, you'll like this book. Otherwise, I'd pass."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"the author is another apologist for central banking, regurgitating the pablum he was fed undigested. his book is nothing more than one inconsistency after another - he seems to be completely unaware of what he is saying.written before the most recent economic debacle, he would most likely blame it on thomas jefferson or andrew jackson, maybe even the lack of a saving hero such as j.p. morgan (one of his heroes). he certainly would never blame it on fractional reserve central banking.don't waste your time or money. buy a book that tells the factual story - try\\"the history of money and banking in the united states\\" by murray rothbard.i would have given a 0 rating had that been available."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"How did America become the unparalleled economic colossus of the modern world? John Steel Gordon puts it all together.\\"The American economy in the first six decades after the adoption of the Constitution had proved one of the wonders of the world. The country's territory had more than tripled, and its population had increased eightfold.\\" The economy, however, increased an unbelievable eighteen fold.But this was nothing compared to the growth in the post-Civil War period. \\"Railroad mileage doubled in a mere eight years, while wheat production did likewise... And as the railroads grew and spread across the land, their suppliers and, increasingly, they're freight customers became larger and also became corporations.\\"And then there was steel. Once Andrew Carnegie learned of an English discovery, the Bessemer converter, to make steel in quantity, he set out to become a lowest-cost producer in the country. And so he did. By 1897, the United States was out producing Germany and Britain combined.At the beginning of the 20th century, America had one third of the world's railroad mileage, 40% of its steel production and it was the largest exporter of agricultural products. Even on a per capita basis, Americans were way ahead of even Great Britain, the number two country.And this was only the beginning as the 20th century truly became the American Century.John Steele Gordon analyzes America's peculiar historical, cultural and geographical circumstances which made all as possible. And he does it in a way that is fun to read. If this were the textbook of American economic history, college students would be graduating with an infinitely better understanding of our unique history."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"Gordon's intent is to present an accessible yet highly informative history of American business and in this effort he largely succeeds. I especially enjoyed this book because I have a strong interest in American history but am far from an expert in economics matters. Yet Gordon was able to educate me on issues such as the gold standard vs free silver debate of the late 19th century. He writes in a clear, simple prose that enables potentially complicated subjects to become more understandable to the lay reader. Basically, I learned more from this book than any other I have read so far this year.But Gordon is a pro-business conservative and his writings are clearly a celebration of America's financial and technological truimphs without much interest in the shortcomings of our especially \\"individualistic\\" form of capitalism. For example, he hardly mentions the environmental degradation often caused by unregulated business practices or the extreme inequalities of wealth and poverty that exist in our nation.Still Gordon is far from a dogmatic thinker and he does provide criticism about the excesses of unregulated capitalism when he considers it appropriate. For example, he makes a convincing case that Andrew Jackson's decision to close the central bank was a disaster that led to numerous financial panics and economic downturns until the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.Yes, Gordon is a bit biased and perhaps too celebratory about the virtues of American business. But still the book is very well written and offers so much useful knowledge that it deserves to be read."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"An Empire of Wealth is one of the most interesting American history books you can find. It encompasses the entire span of time of the nation, from early exploration to the present. The focus is on the history of economics in America, with a dash of political history tossed in where applicable for more understanding. The book is well written and easy to read, which is a lot more than can be said for the vast majority of history books.The real problem with the book for me was that there was no major theme proposed to unite this broad look. Topics were covered in chronological order with not much logical connection beyond the preceding few pages. Maybe that's the point of the history of America's economy - it has no unifying theme other than progress.At times Mr. Gordon did interject his love of unions and big government, even in the face of historical evidence to their detriment. Thankfully these minor defects did not ruin an otherwise well written book."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"If you're looking for a book on the history of American economics, then look no further. John Steele Gordon takes two subjects that don't exactly arouse the most excitement in people--economics and history--and creates an informative, page-turning collaboration on United States economic history dating back to colonial times. Mr. Gordon gives us an insightful look into the economics of the colonial era, how the nation's fiscal structure was established following the Revolutionary War, the effects of the American Civil War on the Union and Confederacy's economic well-being, and concludes with more recent economic issues such as the Great Depression, the World Wars, and the effects of newer inventions such as the Internet on the American economy.Of course, a book summarizing the entirety of American economic history is bound to read like a college textbook at times. The abundance of information in this book makes it hard to absorb much information in one sitting. However, this is probably inevitable due to the nature of the topic. Taking the subject that Mr. Gordon had to work with into consideration, I'd have to admit that he did a remarkable job in making \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" an enjoyable read for the average reader who may not be well-versed in history or economics.If you are interested in the rise of American economic power, this is a must-read. Mr. Gordon's book is guaranteed to give you a solid foundation of understanding about the history of the United States, and may leave you with much appreciation for some of the great players in history who helped build this country to what it is today."},{"Title":"An Empire of Wealth: The Epic History of American Economic Power","review":"SOUNDS BORING, BUT NOT THIS BOOK. \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" answers the question how did the USA become such a powerhouse of wealth and opportunity. It skips over the political and military history and fills in the overlooked story of finance and inventions. The book is interesting because it gives the human and often humorous side of the story. It covers common things found in your home such as indoor plumbing, credit cards, and home computers. \\"An Empire of Wealth\\" explains the inter-relationship and progression of technology from gas lights to electric lights.The best part of the book are the never ending bits of information that will make you say, \\"I didn't know that\\". Where did George Washington bank? Why was the Model-T car only painted black? How did Bill Gates get rich? The only criticism of the book is that it covers a lot of ground going from 1492 to 2004 in 460 pages. The section on the Great Depression was weak as was the economic events of the 1990's.

We had to buy a set for ourselves when we moved. My son is 3. He listens to it at least once a week and it never seems to get old for him. The book is just so-so for me, but the CD is funny. Even my 1yr old daughter tries to sing-a-long. Too cute.I agree... great gift idea."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"Marsupial Sue has a good message and is truly fun for the entire family to sing along to. My 3 yo daughter loves to sit and listen to the CD while trying to learn the words. The only downside is the song goes through the pages quickly and a 3 yo doesn't really know when to turn the pages. Overall, however, a great book/CD. We will consider this a gift for friends in the future."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"The kids I teach LOVE this book. It is a must in my classroom. It has a calming effect on the kiddos! LOVE LOVE LOVE"},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"\\"Marsupial Sue\\" the book and CD is another brilliant production by the immensely talented John Lithgow, actor-singer-performer extraordinaire and multiple Tony and Emmy awards winner. The heart of the story is about a kangaroo named Sue who wishes for something other than being a kangaroo, but of course discovers in the end that being a kangaroo is not so bad after all. The accompanying CD is a sing-along to the text, recorded in Lithgow's voice and has such a catchy tune that my 3.5 year-old requested I play it over and over, and I didn't mind! I loved singing along to this rhyming song with an infectious beat.This is a wonderful book not just because of the lesson inherent in it, that of being comfortable being oneself, but also because it helps with early literacy skills, as all of Lithgow's books do - one can sing-along with the text, read-aloud, have discussions with one's child about the different animals found in Australia [kangaroo, koala, platypus, wallaby] and so much more. Plus, it's so much fun!!! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"My kids are two and one and they LOVE this book.

Adults will find themselves singing the tunes long after they listen to it too."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"Poor Marsupial Sue, she just hates being a kangaroo. All that hopping around gives her a backache, headache, sideache and even a tummyache, so she sets out to try and be something else. The life of a Koala looked good, until she fell out of the tree and living by the sea as a Platypus seemed nice, until she got sick eating all that seafood. She'd just have to try something else. Just then she sees a Wallaby. He looked a lot like Sue, only smaller and was having such a great time bouncing and flouncing and jouncing along, that she just had to join him and it was fun. So Sue learned the most important lesson of all: &quot;Be happy with who you are./Don't ever stray to far from you./Get rid of that frown/And waltz up and down/beneath a marsupial star./If you're a kangaroo through and through,/Just do what kangaroos do.&quot;..... John Lithgow has written a silly, funny, joyous song and picture book, with a gentle message, that will delight youngsters with it's bouncy energy and lilting rhyme. His humorous text is complemented by Jack Davis' bold, bright and expressive artwork, full of charming detail and kids and adults alike will giggle as they watch Australia's sunglassed, hat wearing, Birkenstocked denizens do their thing. Complete with sheet music and CD, Marsupial Sue is perfect for youngsters 3-7 and is a book the entire family will enjoy reading and singing together and with its catchy waltzing rhythm, even dancing, too."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"This is a great story for kids.

I hope John does more."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"This is a charming book! I read it nightly to my daughter, but once we began listening to the CD, the book took on a new tone.

In the end, she realizes being a kangaroo is really pretty great.It's amazing that Mr. Lithgow can deliver an important message (\\"be yourself\\") that you don't realize you're learning because you're having SOOOO much fun.I must also HIGHLY recommend \\"I'm a Manatee\\"."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"I first found this book at our local public library, and checked it out because of the fun, colorful illustrations. Although it was somewhat hard to read the first few times, due to the irregular rhyme scheme, it because progressively easier after listening to the CD several times. My daughter absolutely loves the book, and after only having it a week, could sing the entire story (she's three). It is a fun book that really sticks with kids, and I love that my daughter is learning, \\"Be happy with who you are\\" at such a young age. This book would be great for kids of all ages, especially those who have had a rough day or experience and are wishing for a moment they were somewhere or someone else."},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"I love this book and do not get tired of reading it.

On the way home from the library, my four year old son discovered the CD in this book and we began to listen. We LOVED it from the start. We also enjoyed the instrumental version that followed John's singing because it immediately encouraged us to recall the song and the words and to learn. What an ingenious idea for encouraging children to learn and sing something that is definitely a little challenging, different and fun, all at the same time! We were highly impressed with Mr. Lithgow's awards for this book and for its support of the Save the Music Foundation - a non-profit organization supporting music education for children.We are buying this book and will next seek out each of Mr. John Lithgow's other works - the Manatee and Farkle McBride and any other that he produces - to own for our son's personal collection. A TREASURE.Bravo, John Lithgow & Jack Davis! Encore, please!"},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"I bought a copy of this book for my 6 year old daughter and also purchased one for her kindergarten teacher for Teacher Appreciation Week. My daughter loved it. She read it everyday for over a week. That was over 6 months ago and it's still one of her favorites. The story is great and delivers a great message in terms of self-acceptance. The illustrations are wonderful. And the best part of all is the CD that comes with it. The story is sung by the author, John Lithgow himself. You can't listen without smiling. The book and CD were also a great hit with her kindergarten class. The kids asked for it on a daily basis!! They all soon learned the lyrics of the song! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"When I picked this book out of our Library at school to read it to the Kindergartener's I never thought much of it. But, once we read it, and then listened to the CD, we were hooked. Not only did it get me singing all day long but 48 others were too. It is such a special book that I am purchasing three for my children this Christmas so they can have it to read and listen to with their children someday. Thank you John Lithgow!"},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"I don't know what it is about this book and cd, but my 2 and a half year old daughter picked up the words very quickly.

This is so much better than reading Barney and Disney I wish there was a whole series!"},{"Title":"Marsupial Sue Book and CD","review":"A music cd and a score comes with this zany story, with fun drawings by Jack Davis, which tells of a young kangaroo who doesn't like being a marsupial. She tries tree climbing, swimming, and other activities which don't appeal either - only to find some satisfaction in her original design. A fun story."},{"Title":"Human Rights of Christians in Palestinian Society","review":"Justus Reid Weiner's latest monograph Human Rights of Christians in Palestinian Society is essential reading for anyone interested in the universal recognition of human rights. Tragically, as Weiner writes, the voice of one significant community, the Palestinian Christian community's voice, is consistently lost in the politics of the region. Despite the international importance of the community as the guardians of the most cherished holy sites of Christianity, the community suffers from the reality of a society governed by increasingly radicalized, fundamentalist Islamist beliefs that do not accommodate non-Muslims.The community has dwindled precipitously as emigration rates rise to the point that the community now faces an existential threat. In Bethlehem alone the once 60% majority Christian population is now only a 20% minority i.e. 30,000 of the 130,000 residents. Weiner extrapolates that this reduction in numbers has impact on the political influence of the community in election outcomes thus reducing their say even further. The dramatic decline has occurred despite the community having had a long history in the region, in fact hundreds of years before the birth and spread of Islam.Part of the problem is the little known specific statute for non-Muslims defining them under the discriminatory status of Dhimmitude. This status allows the Christian community in theory to survive as long as they pay their taxes, forgo self-defense and accept the protection of the Muslim leadership. Thus they live as \`imperfect citizens'. Weiner explains that the fact that the Palestinian Authority draft constitution states that Sharia law will have primacy over other legal sources. This will only exacerbate the suffering and unease of Christian and other minority communities as they fear the potential official repression of religious minorities. The families already worry that they could starve due to their non-participation in the intifada violence and are forced to enroll their children in expensive private schools to avoid the indoctrination of their children in a \`culture of death'. The right to sell your property to whomever you wish is proscibed by Palestinian Land Law - there is a death penalty for anyone found selling land to Jews. Vandalism and desecration of holy sites and cemeteries in the West Bank and Bethlehem occur without consequence. PA security officials do not follow existing laws in the West Bank and Gaza regarding arrest and detention procedures. Mosque sermons malign Christianity and its Arab followers. Christian women feel virtual prisoners in their own homes due to the rise in sexual harassment and rape. Many have had to adopt traditional Muslim clothing to avoid rape, which in Middle Eastern countries has the added trauma of the girl then being seen as unfit for marriage. Weiner writes that Evangelical Pastor David Orviz feels that rape is thus yet another effective method of reducing the Christian population. In one case some Christian males came to the rescue of a girl about to be raped and when one of the attackers were injured only the rescuers were arrested whilst no action was taken against the attackers.Yet the international agencies report only alleged Israeli violations in detail and give vague and superficial criticism to the Palestinian Authority. One can only wonder why the international community ignores the Palestinian Authority's lack of Rule of Law and the general victimization of religious minorities. If there is so much systematic persecution of the Christian population under the Palestinian Authority now, what will happen once statehood is achieved? Weiner in Human Rights of Christians in Palestinian Society and is a must-read to gain an insight into the increasingly dangerous vulnerability of the Christian minority under the Palestinian Authority."},{"Title":"Ninja Justice: Six Tales of Murder and Revenge","review":"The original title for this book was &quot;Master Assassins,&quot; but I suppose they changed the title to something they thought would sell better. As a student of ninpo taijutsu, I was a little disappointed to find that the protagonists were merely assassins, not the mythical ninja. But, that disappoinment aside, I have to admit that I was drawn in to the story by the author's wit, simplistic writing style, and interwoven plots.Master Assassins (as I choose to call this book, out of protest more than anything) is a compilation of six short stories about Baian, a doctor and an assassin, and his counterpart, Hikojiro, whom Baian trained as an assassin. The two of them travel around Edo, Kyoto, and other villages, fulfilling contracts taken out on people the world would be better without -- rapist ronins, cruel bureaucrats, evil samurai, etc. Surprising twists in the plot keep the reader enticed and enthralled, and I often found myself reading until very late, just to get to the end of the story.Warning: if you're looking for a thick, literary masterpiece, I'd recommend that you keep reading Eiji Yoshikawa books. But if you're interested in an entertaining book with easily read text (minus a couple of translation errors here and there), pick this book up. You'll be through with this 184-page page-turner in no time at all."},{"Title":"Ninja Justice: Six Tales of Murder and Revenge","review":"Baian is a healer by day and a professional killer by night - but only if the killing the \\"mark\\" fits Baian's sense of justice. None of his victims are innocent, or he wouldn't accept the job.There is only one negative: There are 20+ books in Japanese from Shotaro Ikenami, but I could find only 2 in English. Actually, I bought three, but only to find out that \\"Ninja Justice\\" and \\"Tales of Murder from the Shogun's City\\" are one and the same.PLEASE publish more of Shotaro Ikenami's books!It's a very quick read, very entertaining, perfect fun!"},{"Title":"Ninja Justice: Six Tales of Murder and Revenge","review":"The original work by Ikenami Shotaro, \\"Koroshi no Yonin, Shikakenin Fujieda Baian\\" (Four Killers), was very popular in Japan. \\"Ninja Justice\\" is not a good name for the book. The 1973 adaptation of this book into the movie \\"Hissatsu Shikakenin\\" was also quite successful. In fact, I first came across these tales from watching the movie. Many subtleties in the original writing were lost in this English translation, but the storylines have been well captured.All the stories are interesting, and from one chapter to another they slowly bring alive the character of Fujieda Baian. At the end of the book you begin to like Baian, and you wish that there were more. Another seven volumes were published in the series, only the direct sequel, \\"Baian AriJigoku\\", was translated into \\"Master Assassin, Bridge of Darkness\\", but it has been long out of print. I believe that many readers would welcome a softcover reprint of this."},{"Title":"Ninja Justice: Six Tales of Murder and Revenge","review":"I loved it!

IT reads like a movie or tv show and I can't wait to move on to his next mission."},{"Title":"Ninja Justice: Six Tales of Murder and Revenge","review":"This book isn't the longest book you can find, but it is very entertaining. Baian is an assasin who is a doctor at the same time, and he trained Hikojiro. This story starts in Edo and goes to Koyoto and ends in Edo. Its a very entertaining fast action story, about life as assasin in ancient times in Japan. It's a fast paced book and it doesn't take long to finish the book. If you would like an amusing book I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Maitland","review":"Closing in on forty, Evan Maitland is co-owner of Collette's Antiques, a store that specializes in seventeenth and eighteenth century French and Italian furnishings. In spite of this being a younger man's game; Evan also works as a bounty hunter for Chicago bails bondsman Charlie Mead. Charlie asks Evan to bring back lawyer Barry McDermott who skipped the Windy City with a $300, K bond to free him from jail as he is charged with statutory rape having sex with a fifteen years old.Evan tracks Barry to Oklahoma City, but before he can bring the jumper home, the Jamaican Raetown posse of \\"Jim\\" Collins arrives to kill Barry and to recover the $800,000 he failed to launder. In a shootout, Barry and a Jamaican Richard Lawes die while Evan is wounded. Back home recuperating, Jim informs his other two posse members they must clean up the Oklahoma City mess by killing the surviving witness.MAITLAND is a terrific urban noir starring a tough in your face hero. He shows his grit and intelligence whenever he is chasing a jumper. The exciting story line is action-packed caused by the star; Evan is at his best bringing in those who have fled their court date rather than the exhilarating High Noon showdown with the posse. Hopefully, Maitland ignores his promise to his antiques partner Bianca to concentrate on their business and continues to chase down skippers. An anthology of his cases would make quite a plum for suspense readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Maitland","review":"This is a fast-paced novel set in and around Chicago. The main character, Evan Maitland used to be a cop, but circumstances made him \\"retire\\" and become an antiques dealer. Go figure. However, he still keeps his body in shape, and his skills as an investigator honed by doing the occasional bounty hunter job for a friend who is a bail bondsman.In this episode, Maitland is after an attorney who skipped out on his bond. His crime: on the surface it was diddling with an underage girl, but we all know the plot cannot be that simple. The lawyer is also tied in with the Jamaican mob out of Chicago, and even when he flees to Oklahoma with a ton of their money, they track him down.Its Maitland's job to bring the attorney back, but he doesn't get the chance, since the lawyer gets murdered in Oklahoma. Now the mob is after Maitland thinking he has the money the lawyer stole from them, and he has to deal with this, along with the prospect of not getting paid for the bounty, since the skipper has been killed.Rough days for Maitland. Every one should get shot up for a good cause, not because the skipper pedophile got himself shot up.This is a quick read, but fast and the action is good. The conflicts Maitland faces are challenges he will have to resolve in a sequel."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Maitland","review":"When books written by women get unreal, things like otherwise rotten characters having a change of heart and becoming angels happen; when males go outside of reality, you get books infused with the aggressive delusion that each character is an effigy instead of a metaphor. In this one, a guy is wronged and must get revenge. Many aspects of its understanding of crime are accurate and even more, highly artistically persuasive and insightful. However, as a whole the book seems (much as happens in Robert Parker books) like a cartoon that keeps trying to re-enter a dark alleyway although all of its characters are drawn in primary colors. This is a good book for airplanes or waiting in lobbies for job interviews."},{"Title":"Night Terror","review":"Arcos, Maine is a small quiet town where people know their neighbors and doors are never locked. Yet in the space of four years two boys disappeared without a trace and most people, including Sheriff Virgil Milche, think they will never be found. Zach Bock has been missing for over a year now and his parents, Richard and Audrey, remain tortured by his absence. Audrey, who had a very strong bond with her son, has begun suffering night terrors and episodes where she hears her son's voice.Richard thinks she is near a breakdown and insists that she visits a psychiatrist. To pacify him, she agrees to go. After speaking time with the doctor, Audrey realizes that the aunt who raised her after a traumatic childhood with her mother has brainwashed her into forgetting her salad days. If she hopes to find out what happened to Zach, Audrey must be willing to face the demons of her own past.Chandler McGrew has written a masterful work of psychological suspense with some paranormal elements intertwined into the story line. The heroine is facing every mother's worst nightmare while fighting for her own sanity. She is a character that readers will identify with and take into their hearts. NIGHT TERRORS is a fascinating reading experience because like Memorex readers don't know what is real and what is a figment of the character's imagination.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night Terror","review":"Chandler McGrew's \\"Night Terror\\" is a witty and lithe combination of plots that intimately intertwine and play off one another, as well as characters that seem to continually get themselves in deeper and deeper trouble. Just when you think all is lost... Well, you read if for yourself! I thoroughly enjoyed the unfolding of the characters as they came together to thwart evil at it's darkest moments! McGrew has succeeded in giving us another novel that is hard to put down. Another must-read from Chandler McGrew!"},{"Title":"Night Terror","review":"Not a bad book. Kept me interested throughout.

If you like Dean Koontz and Stephen King, you will love Chandler McGrew."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"Battle Neverending is one of the most important books you'll read. Enjoy!I just finished reading, Battle Neverending by &lt;a href=\\"http://www.saablofton.com\\">Saab Lofton&lt;/a>, the radical columnist formerly with the Las Vegas CityLife. What a read! As I followed the fictional interview between Tomorrowman and Bill Moyers, I found myself wishing that what was written here would be historically true. Meaning, we'd look back on that story and see what really happened: Nader as president, all nuclear weapons are destroyed ... it sounds like a world straight out of the utpian future we hope for.Lofton has a special way of connecting to his readers. He's honest with us. The dialogue between the characters is realistic. I could easily visualize these interactions taking place even though they sometimes take place in fictional places. And yet, Lofton is up front about this being a work of \\"edutainment,\\" or \\"infotainment.\\" It is an effective and intelligent blend of fact and fiction.Scattered throughout the fiction are bits of the real world; quotes from Stephen Hawking, Ronald (6) Wilson (6) Reagan (6) --- 666, Ray Bradbury and others. This blur between the world as most of us see it and the world that Lofton envisions induces a whirlwind of fruitful green energy that plants the seeds of change deep within the consciousness of all who read Battle Neverending.This is definitely a book that folks will point to at some point in the future as an influence on their lives. A book that radical organizations will be sure to stock on their shelves so that new members might get a sense of the vision they feel. This book is a must read, not just because it's written by Saab Lofton, but because it will reignite the smoldering flames within you and encourage you to keep fighting against the corporatist, capitalist elite."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"The plot moves along very smoothly, and the content is exciting and inciteful. When I had finished the book, I felt I knew much more about the experience of being African American in the US. I was, in addition, enamoured by the metaphorical use of Super Heros to increase interest and complexity of the content. The introduction of sci-fi elements was also important to my enjoyment of the book even though I've never been a fan of science fiction. This is truly an important book and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"This collection of short stories peppered with poems is committed literature in the truest sense of the word with a much needed sense of the fantastic thrown in to blow your mind all the more. Here, Lofton is a one-man anthology, smacking you upside the head with outrageous tales that are only driven by the man's outrage at the outrageousness of Empire, all that comes with it, and all that it leaves behind.\\"Rapture\\" is Heaven, Hell, and The Hereafter as reimagined by Howard Zinn or an American History lesson as told by Dante or a yarn about an angel named Dudley who tries to resist the advances of a demonic temptress named Jasmine. It's a subversive, metaphysical fable in which you'll learn or be reminded that the military/industrial complex has its tendrils in everything.\\"Make Love Not War\\" explores miscegenation through through the eyes of H.G. Wells and Cornel West. We discover that it is a lofty goal not without pitfalls. Lofton not only attacks white supremacy in this tale of sex and racism, but black supremacy as well, and asks and answers a very important question. If The Melting Pot is the ideal, can and should we accelerate its inevitable realization?My favorite story however would have to be the last one, the \\"title track\\" of this literary rekkid if you will. Lofton proudly wears his love of comic books on his chest and on the back of his jacket as he introduces us to Tomorrowman, a black Superman with Michael Moore's politics and Che Guevera's sense of action. Oh, and get this, the story is actually an \\"interview\\" conducted by none other than...Bill Moyers! Genius. You'll laugh, get schooled a bit on the science of superheroes like Larry Niven would, and be left wishing that Huey Newton could fly, had the strength of 1,000,000 men, and...was bulletproof. :(Saab Lofton isn't a science-fiction writer. He is Nostradamus reincarnated as a struggling artist, geek, and leftist revolutionary (evolutionary?). Hopefully Lofton will gain a wider audience with Battle Neverending acting as one helluva calling card."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"There's probably not too much to add to the reviews already up. This is a great book that everyone should read. If you like reading works that actually have something to say, this is the book for you. Intelligent and inspired, Lofton's latest piece is sure to please."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"After years of incisive work writing a column for Las Vegas' City Life, Saab Lofton has distilled his views and aims into Battle Neverending. Despite its sometimes rough, sometimes cartoonish dialogue and Lofton's own bouts with paranoia, Battle Neverending encapsulates Lofton's views on the collaboration of seemingly antagonistic organizations, the master race, and what humanity would do if we were finally faced with a unifying enemy other than ourselves.Battle Neverending's first short story, \\"Rapture,\\" delivers Lofton's views on The Nation of Islam and its collusion with White American Capitalism. In it, a guardian spirit named Dudley who dares to question the Collective Consciousness's (God's) ways is sold out to the Garbage Man (Satan). The story reads more like a comic book at times, but Lofton makes excellent use of both the Biblical book of Job and Heinlein's Job: A Comedy of Justice. Ultimately, Lofton very entertainingly tells us that we are all pawns in the larger game.\\"Make Love, Not War\\" is hands-down the best story in the collection. Written as a diary of the starving-artist, J.B. Stoner, \\"Make Love\\" relates how Stoner was kidnapped by a Dr. Moreau-type mad scientist, ironically named Dr. Noah, and taken to \\"Paradise Island.\\" Dr. Noah's breeding experiment involves mating black men and white women (Frederick Douglass would be proud). This story carries one of Lofton's primary theses: the inevitable mingling of the races into, as Lofton puts it, a world of Lenny Kravitz/Halle Berry look-a-likes who no longer oppress or exploit on the basis of race; however, what Lofton ultimately shows his audience is that while, in his mind, this ideal race may be laudable and unavoidable, it cannot be externally forced by Dr. Noah types. It takes true genius for an artist/philosopher to see a dark side in his or her own all-encompassing view and deconstruct it, and Lofton absolutely nails it here.The title story, \\"Battle Neverending,\\" is another piece with a comic book feel involving a fictitious interview between Bill Moyers and Tomorrowman, an appointee of the typical intergalactic anthropologist-type aliens who had almost all given up on mankind ever being civilized enough to join the \\"Interstellar Community.\\" The whole story reads as a Socratic dialogue wherein Tomorrowman voices Lofton's views on contemporary politics. The real gem in the piece is Tomorrowman's explanation of why governments cover up alien contacts.Saab Lofton is a very promising writer and thinker who will, in time, take his rightful spot between Octavia Butler and Robert Heinlein as an important critical commentator on the persistently pernicious divisions of class and race in our world. Until then, Battle Neverending is a worthy sojourn."},{"Title":"Battle Neverending","review":"Saab Lofton is simply one of the most important writers of our time. His undertanding of the plight of the oppressed of this world is second to none. The way he conveys his views with compassion & humor & wit to spare ....... we'd live in an entirely different world if more people found themselves opening up to the truths which this writer describes. I cannot recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"The Power of the Lamb: Revelation's Theology of Liberation for You","review":"This is a dynamic and enlightened perspective of the Kingdom of Light verses the kingdom of darkness.It is more relevant to life today than when it was first published in the 90s. Ward Ewing gives a lucid and comprehensive exposition of the Christian need to conform to biblical principles and practices for a successful and victorious life.His injunction \\" When most of lives are formed by and through the contractual communities of the beast, it forms the basis for which our perception of reality is based upon,\\" is very insightful when we consider the present and constant economic crisis Christians are entangled by. This Book brings to life the Book Of Revelations in a way that none other has done so that we can understand,no longer suffering from a lack of knowledge, take constructive and prudent steps to overcome the world,live a balanced Christian life and proclaim Thy Kingdom Come, Thy Will Be Done In Earth As It is In Heaven."},{"Title":"Tony and the Cows: A True Story from the Range Wars","review":"This book explores what happens if you take envrionmental zeal to the extreme, while also laying out the reasons why caring for the earth is a critical concern. The author is looking for a middle way between thoughtless corporate resource extraction and armed assaults by protectors of nature. His story is about a local Sierra Club president and loner, who, based on the evidence available, decides to shoot 32 cows grazing on public land in New Mexico in an effort to rid the landscape of exotic species. Mr. Baker explores the literary and societal roots of environmental activism and the development of the view of &quot;nature&quot; prevalent in our society. There are so many actions being taken today that reflect the conflict between our consumer culture and the preservation of the natural world. Deciding how resources are to be used is essential to our survivial and this book looks very closely and very critically at the issue. It is a mind opener, and could certainly offend true believers on both sides. A must read for our times."},{"Title":"Esther: Her Murder Haunts a Small Town in Oklahoma","review":"I have relatives who have live in the town where this murder occurred,so I thought I knew the whole story.Was I ever wrong.This book is not just about the brutal rape and murder of a 73 year old retired school teacher.The investigation into Esther Steele's murder made the people of Granite,Oklahoma aware that criminals had long ago invaded this small,peaceful town.Most of the towns residents had no idea that drug dealers were living in their nice,safe little town.Or that respected members of law enforcement were criminals themselves.This book tells of loss on many levels.Loss of life,and a towns loss of innocence.But the focus of this book is about one thing.The rape and murder of a woman who had done so much good in her life.Please remember that if you read this book.By the way,the author of this book,Leonard Sanders,was born and raised in Granite."},{"Title":"Changing cultural practices: A contextualist framework for intervention research","review":"This book provides a practical scientifically based approach to changing cultural practices as a means of addressing what are arguably some of the most important and intractable problems in our society. These cultural practices include patterns of attitudes and behavior in relation to key social phenomena including childrearing, the environment, gender relations and smoking. Our cultural practices in relation to these socio-cultural phenomena have a significant impact on the lives of individuals and have huge implications for the success or failure of our society. Furthermore, our current practices in relation to these as well as other social issues leave much to be desired - causing significant problems and costing us massively in terms of time, energy, money and, ultimately and most importantly, the possibilities for human happiness and progress. But how do we go about changing these practices so as to improve out society?This clearly written and very logically structured book presents the outlines of a pragmatic behavioral approach to changing these practices in socially beneficial ways. The first section starts with an introduction to the concept of changing cultural practices. It then introduces the philosophy (functional contextualism) and science (behavior analysis) that can provide the underlay to this endeavour. Just the first three chapters alone make the book worth reading by the way, since to my mind they make some otherwise difficult-to-understand philosophy and theory rather easily accessible. The book next explains how these approaches can be used to address behavior at the social cultural level by integrating these forms of analysis, which are traditionally more suited to addressing individual behavior (and, research suggests, are very successful in this respect), with cultural materialist analysis. After that it examines the logical practicalities as well as the ethics of applying these forms of analysis to cultural practices. In the second major section of the book we are shown how these forms of analysis can be (and indeed are starting to be) brought to bear on the particular issues listed above. In the final section of the book, we get an overview of general issues to do with these endeavours.It is difficult to overestimate the impact on humanity of the cultural practices that this book addresses. The problems that these practices produce are arguably some of the most important and intractable that the human race faces. This book makes a contribution by highlighting these problems and using science to clearly describe them in a way that suggests realistic and logically structured solutions. This book only provides the outlines of a scientific approach to solving these problems, but that in itself is a huge contribution because these are such incredibly all embracing issues and traditional thinking about these issues has failed us time and again and continues to do so. This is an inspiring book because it suggests that such problems are not beyond our grasp and that empirically based science can indeed be brought to bear on solving them. No doubt, and indeed as this book also demonstrates, the suggested solutions will not be easy to implement. On the contrary, this is difficult and complex work that might ultimately take generations to accomplish. However, this book at least points the way to doing the kinds of things that need to be done, and that can have a real hope of success. The rewards of such success would be truly transformative."},{"Title":"Berlin and Sans-Souci; or, Frederick the Great and his friends: An historical novel","review":"What a pleasure to see the novels of Louise Muehlbach finally being brought back. Muehlbach, the pen name of Clara Mundt, was the daughter of one famous historian, and the wife of another-both professors at the University of Berlin - but in the early 19th century for a woman to become a professional historian was virtually impossible. She therefore turned to writing historical novels, and was one of the best-selling writers in German during the mid-19th century, producing over 100 books, about two-thirds of which were translated into English. This in addition to raising 5 children, managing a large household, and being involved in literary and cultural society! Her work remained popular as late as the first World War, but as with many popular writers - especially women - has never been regarded as &quot;serious&quot; and therefore has not survived. This is regrettable. Her work has, by today's standards, numerous historical errors - probably unavoidable under the circumstances - and she firmly displays opinions and prejudices of her own. On the other hand, most of her novels deal with persons and times only vaguely known to the average English-speaking reader, and offer a fascinating glimpse into strange worlds. And most important, she has the one indispensable gift of the novelist - she is a wonderful storyteller, who keeps the reader turning the pages and wondering what will happen next. Any reader who enjoys historical novels, or who is interested in German history should give her work a try.This particular item - &quot;Berlin and Sans Souci&quot; - is part of a long series of novels on the Prussian Royal Family. Readers who are not familiar with the time period may find some of it puzzling. The publishers probably selected this volume for reprint due to one of the subplots, which involves a medical student &quot;Lupinus&quot; - who at the moment of his final exam is revealed to be a woman, and who is nevertheless granted her medical degree! This is the kind of side excursion the author always loved, and which adds an erratic charm to her work. Here's hoping the publishers continue to add to the series."},{"Title":"Die Kinder-Uni.

I require easy-to-follow recipes that don't call for obscure ingredients and any sort of yoga-esque contortions to produce a finished product. I bought this cookbook a few years ago, and it's wonderful! It's a hardcover, but the covers are padded; I've spilled things on this cookbook, and all I need to do is wipe it clean. The index in this book is one of the best I've seen. The great thing about these recipes is that they use products that you probably already have on your shelves. The book has several sections covering chicken, casseroles, tuna, barbeques, Mexican, and Oriental. Then comes the good stuff--about 200 pages are devoted to desserts alone! There is also a kids' cooking section. I especially like the section on Children's Party Delights...I can make some of these creations, and my nieces and nephew think I'm a genius! Try the Deluxe Fajita Nachos, the Santa fe Potato Salad, the Korean Beef &amp; Vegetable Salad, or the cute little Chocolate Teddy Bears. Oh, I can go on and on. By the way, don't buy this cookbook for low-fat, low-sugar, healthy recipes. You can convert some of the ingredients yourself, but these recipes don't focus on health--just comfort and good food.

A professor of mine recommended it to me as an undergraduate, along with Terry Eagleton's Literary Theory: An Introduction, and I found this one to be the more interesting, the more original, of the two. It is at once a history and a critique and has much to offer students and scholars alike. Unfortunately, Graff seems to have fallen prey in his later work to some of the sophistries that he criticized in this early work."},{"Title":"Literature Against Itself: Literary Ideas in Modern Society","review":"In LITERATURE AGAINST ITSELF, Gerald Graff sees literature in a war against itself. This \\"war\\" is far from a new one. How the reader sees a book is largely a matter of how a reader sees himself. The war occurs when competing ideologies attempt to claim the book as one of their own. The New Critics, Graff notes, tended to view texts as autotelic independent bodies that had a \\"core\\" of meaning--more or less. This core was what the deconstructionists would later term as a logocentric 'metaphysics of presence,' that would function as a totalizing grounding that anchors text to culture. The leading deconstructionist of modern times Jacques Derrida absolutely opposed any such grounding and in 1966 gave a speech at John Hopkins University that upset the rather neat anchored world that the New Critics had created a few decades earlier. Graff's contribution to this conflict is less an explication of competing theories of literary discourse than engaging in a meandering walkabout covering such disparate fields as the then current status of English education in America's colleges and universities and some trenchant comments on \\"How Not to Talk about Fiction\\" and on \\"How Not to Save the Humanities.\\" (Graff's last two chapter titles)What I find refreshing is Graff's openness concerning his ideological stance. He is an unabashed leftist, one who is deeply suspicious of all matters both literary and non-literary related to conservatism and the autotelic philosophy of the New Critics. He writes in his revised Preface to the 1995 edition that though some readers praised and assailed him \\"as a conservative, more alert readers saw clearly enough where my political sympathies lay.\\" I was not surprised at his numerous cheap shots at conservative writers like Dinesh D'Souza, whom Graff accuses of spreading \\"untruths\\" about the growing left-wing radicalization of America's schools of higher education. Nor was I upset over Graff's denigration of the right as those who \\"do no scholarship research themselves and mostly produce partisan political polemics.\\" What did surprise me was the general thrust of his book. There was no central 'metaphysics of presence' holding the chapters together. What Graff used to organize his text was a loosely bound set of dictums that while individually both revealing and provocative still did not fulfill the promise of conflict engendered by the title. What I got out of LITERATURE AGAINST ITSELF was a hop-skip-and-a-jump book, one that said a great deal but one that did not tie up the loosely threaded tendrils of thought. Perhaps this was not accidental. Since deconstruction is proudly hailed as a de-mystifying attempt to show the disunity lurking under the surface of a seeming core of coherence, then Graff's book can be seen as a living breathing example of how the reification of abstract notions like lack of referentiality can be made concrete in a book, then LITERATURE AGAINST ITSELF emerges as exactly as its author intended."},{"Title":"Literature Against Itself: Literary Ideas in Modern Society","review":"In his early books,Literature Against Itself: Literary Ideas in Modern Society(1979) andProfessing Literature: An Institutional History, Twentieth Anniversary Edition(1987), Graff took as his main subjects literary theory and the institutional history of departments of English and literature, respectively. LITERATURE AGAINST ITSELF continues to be of interest and value for its discussion and analysis of competing schools of literary theory; and the historical narrative of the history of the post-secondary teaching of English that informs PROFESSING LITERATURE continues to enlighten anyone interested in curriculum design and canon-making. But perhaps these two early books can also be appreciated for their having afforded Graff the opportunity to work out the foundational arguments and historical perspectives that enabled him in his later books --Beyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conflicts Can Revitalize American Education(1992) andClueless in Academe: How Schooling Obscures the Life of the Mind(2003) -- to effectively argue and explain why students across the curriculum would benefit from a more critical style of pedagogy.In LITERATURE AGAINST ITSELF Graff analyzes the premises, conclusions, and implications of various literary theories and contemporary schools of criticism in terms of their validity and effectiveness for pedagogy and criticism. And in PROFESSING LITERATURE Graff shows how the various teaching methods and choices of texts in departments of literature from the nineteenth though the early twentieth century suggest that new methods and new canons of study-worthy texts will continue to appear. In the more recentBeyond the Culture Wars: How Teaching the Conflicts Can Revitalize American Education(1992), Graff foregrounds the conclusions and pedagogical injunctions proffered in his earlier books. In the decade following the publication ofBeyond the Culture Wars, Graff himself decided to put the pedagogical injunctions based on his conclusions into practice, coediting, with James Phelan, two \\"critical controversy\\" textbooks:The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Case Studies in Critical Controversy)andThe Tempest: A Case Study in Critical Controversy (Case Studies in Critical Controversy). Both of these textbooks are in their second editions. In his most recent book,Clueless in Academe: How Schooling Obscures the Life of the Mind(2003), Graff continues to explore the pedagogical implications of what he discovered in researching and writing his earlier books on theory and the institutional history of literature departments.Teaching the controversies or conflicts has ironically even been taken up by a group which eschews rational argument -- a sine qua non of Graff's critical pedagogy: religious fundamentalists. I would agree to a certain extent with anyone who thinks it unfortunate that some religious fundamentalists -- in their efforts to get creationist mythology (intelligent design) taught in public school science courses -- have co-opted Graff's phrase \\"teaching the controversies.\\" But consider what violence religious fundamentalists of all faiths have resorted to when discussion stops. So, however ironic or unintended, part of Graff's legacy is to have afforded educators the pedagogic means to obviate the conditions in which thoughts of intellectual, political, or outright physical violence might flourish. So, by all means, let the fundamentalists, in good faith (interesting word!) teach the controversies -- but in their religious schools not in public classrooms. Let the conflicts continue to be taught and discussed by everyone -- rational free-thinkers and fundamentalists alike.Let the controversies and the conversations they engender continue."},{"Title":"Plato's Euthyphro, Apology & Crito (Theater of the Mind)","review":"Yesterday I worked with the students again on the Apology and they find it very instructive to hear the dialogue.

I purchased it to get a lay person's view of string theory but the book hardly refers to string theory at all. It covers a lot of material in the first 90% that I was already familiar with and did not need another book to explain it all to me again. I was expecting a book that concentrated on events over more recent years, and not another book going right back to the beginning of quantum theory. In my opinion, the title misrepresents the content."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"Stick with Michio Kaku if you want a overview of unification theories. Use The Search for Superstrings, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything if you want specific details on how the unification theories are developed.The Search for Superstrings, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything is a loosely organized treatment of the search for a unification theory of &quot;natural&quot; forces. The book covers the modern history of unification theories, subatomic particles, wave/particle theories, string theory, etc. While the book does have some good explanations of subatomic &quot;particles&quot; and forces, the book is overall a difficult read because the organization is somewhat confusing. Only in the last chapters is the unification theory finally addressed and the reason for the apparently unorganized layout somewhat evident -- ironically, the book is unified in the last chapter.The ending was odd and brief -- to say the least. I literally turned the page and the book ended. The sudden ending appeared more like a hasty close than a normal ending to a book of covering topics of this magnitude."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"I discovered John Gribbin relatively recently and have been going through any of his books that I could find. Even though his enthusiasm leads him into the realm of speculation at times, he is a very competent source of exciting and important information and remains a consistently good writer for whom clarity comes naturally.This book is shorter and more succinct than many others by the author, and he mostly remains within the mainstream boundaries. It can serve two purposes: as a quick refresher in modern physics, and as an overview of some of the latest developments in force unification efforts.For me, the writing was of just the right level of difficulty to make it worth-while to put in the effort necessary for the enjoyment of understanding the ideas it is trying to convey. Usually, they made good sense on the second reading of a given section (allowing for some inevitable vagueness of the subject as explained in words without the underlying mathematics).I would advise, however, that the complete neophyte starts elsewhere (maybe some earlier books by the same author); on the other hand, people who are interested in much more detail of string theory in popular form could read e.g. &quot;The Elegant Universe&quot; by Brian Greene."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"I was so enthused after reading John Gribbin's &quot;SCHRODINGER'S KITTENS AND THE SEARCH FOR REALITY&quot; that I placed an order for Dr. Gribbin's latest effort on August 24; that's four momths before its scheduled release....that's enthused! I started reading the book just as it cleared the shipping container. Pure unadulterated and uninspired fluff! There's nothing in the book that an interested layman (that's me) doesn't already know. One could live with &quot;already knowing&quot; but the writing is so uninspired and so dull that getting shot at sunrise would be an eagerly anticipated option to having to read this book more than once.... I can only guess that Dr. Gribbinn and the publisher wanted to immediately cash in on the success of his previous books, particularly the superb &quot;SCRODINGER'S KITTENS AND THE SEARCH FOR REALITY.&quot; Unfortunately their hell-bent haste for economic rewards is reflected in the final product. This book is not worth the money. It's hard to believe that the guy who wrote this book also wrote &quot;...The Search for REALITY&quot; which is worth every penny of its selling price!"},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"If you haven't had a solid introduction to quantum physics, this book is not the place to start -- Gribbin's excellent earlier book (Schroedinger's Cat) is the place to start. However, if you've read about the Cat and have a decent conceptual grasp, this book is a good update. Gribbin's strength is explaining the concepts, independent of the intense math that's involved in physics. The science is so complicated that this is clearly not an easy task, yet Gribbin is, in my opinion, quite good at bringing the concepts to a level that I can mostly, usually, get a grasp of. On this level, this book covers what's happened in physics from the quantum revolution up to the present. Superstrings, Symmetry, &amp; TOE is really not the best title for it though, because I read the first half of the book waiting for Gribbin to get to any of the title concepts.I don't think Superstrings is nearly as solid an effort by Gribbin as Cat was. I had a hard time grasping the symmetry concept. I was solid on the review of quantum mechanics (which was well done, but was not enough information to make me suggest skipping Schroedinger's Cat). I was right with him through the spin function, and I was doing pretty well all through quarks. When he (finally!) got to strings, I could understand again. Unfortunately, all through the discussion of symmetry -- which I read and re-read several times -- I just wasn't getting it.All in all, I think this is a pretty solid book for covering the physics concepts of the last 70 years or so, but I recommend reading Schroedinger's Cat, or at least having a conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics first."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"Recently I have found myself a student of all things science with a tremendous appetite for the abstract. I've enjoyed the works of many talented authors such as Richard Feynman's \\"Six Easy Pieces\\", Stephen Hawking's \\"A Brief History of Time\\", James Gleick's \\"Chaos\\" and of course Albert Einstein's \\"Relativity\\". As a laymen, each of the above books presented it's own challenges in appreciating and understanding the text. However, each was gratifying, fulfilling and difficult to put down until the last page was finished...Contrary to the good writing I've grown addicted, is John Gribbin's work in \\"The Search for SuperStrings, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything\\". I found the book to be like a visit to a planetarium that insists on keeping the lights on during the show, interesting facts but impossible to follow. Worse, I was insulted by the authors frequent references to his other works; this book felt like a cheap commercial."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"Yes, perhaps a little slow on the introduction and a drag for those of who had a beginners course in quantum physics or a college physical science background. But the author does an excellent job, in my opinion, of explaining in detail WHY it is that we're searching for SUSY, not just the buzzwords of this science for the impressionable readers. It also keeps a good psychological reality check, and defends certain theories over others; a very honest and unbiased book, and an interesting one too. Thanks!"},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"I've been a Gribbin fan for a long time, and am of the opinion that each of his offerings is better than the last. I concur with the professional reviewers': this meets the very high standard of Gribbin's other work and easily exceeds the average for the genre.In a conversational style laced with wit, an ability to *write* that is unfortunately lacking among some of the scientific intelligentsia, he addresses some of the most exciting issues in physics in this decade. It's a book about what we don't know, our thrilling ignorance and tantalizing hints, guesses, glimpses of an awesome explanation just around the corner... The field in itself is intoxicating, and one suspects that Dr. Gribbin must have enjoyed the process of researching and writing the book as much as his readers enjoy the results.This is a complex subject, and requires a thorough grounding in quantum theory. Readers who, like myself, are familiar with Gribbin's other work, will find that while the first section covers some of the same ground, it does so on a higher level of technical detail. This is presented in a quick, concise summary, and makes a good refresher, though it may go a bit over the heads of some who are completely new to the subject (they might want to read another of his books as an introduction, and then treat _Superstrings_ as a sequel of sorts, picking up where earlier attempts to explain the quantum world leave off).From there, he moves onto the tricky ground of modern theoretical constructs, the ever shifting leading edge of research. This is subtle stuff, but Gribbin is a competent and confident guide. Follow him closely, and you can be sure of your footing.Adventure metaphors aren't miss-placed here, the subject is exciting, especially rinsed of the dry language of journal publications and deftly displayed by a very articulate expert. Anyone with an appreciation for conceptual beauty will enjoy this, I think. I certainly did."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"If you are looking for an introduction to the newest theories in astrophysics, this is not the book for you. It has nearly the same brief intro to quantum mechanics as all the other books on the topic, then Gribbin simply wanders from topic to topic discussing weird phenomenon and theories and never really tying them together. He's got a ton of speculation about String Theory, but he never really provides any reason that you should believe in it other than that it sounds really cool.He is also a bit behind the times (not necessarily his fault), for theoretical physics has (mostly) moved past the particular theories he presents, though they are helpful for understanding the most recent theories.In all, this is not a book I would recommend. String Theory is beginning to collapse, and there are a few books coming out this year detailing the rise and fall of String Theory. One of these books would probably be a better introduction to String Theory that this one, even if you disagree with their conclusions.Overall Grade: C-"},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"If you are looking for more than &quot; Oh, Golly&quot; physics with some real mathematics, then this will be disappointing, but if you like Richard Feynman type informative lectures that name the names and give an understandable overview, then this is a well written book with history and facts and references. I got is as a gift from a friend who was trying to be of help! It was more help than some of my Google searches on the Internet!"},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"Popular books on quantum theory are like cheap toilet paper, they fall apart easily. Gribbin's latest book is a triumph for the quantum wanabees who think they know some of the basic concepts, but in reality can only recite what they've read. Gribbin has a way of giving the reader an insight into what can only be properly understood mathematically. This book was written for those who don't know the math, but wish they did. The only thing &quot;cheap&quot; about this book is the price. Excellent!"},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"This book was a disappointment, while there is some excellent background on the structure of matter and quantum mechanics, there is very little on the topic of superstrings. In reading through it, I got the impression that the segments on strings were an afterthought, something that needed to be mentioned but in no great detail.If you need some knowledge of quantum mechanics and the historical development of the understanding of matter, then this book is worth reading. However, if your interest is first and foremost that of the current theories of strings and superstrings, then quite frankly this book is not worth your time and money."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"This book is a little thin. And expensive for what little it offers. The first part is included in his better book on the Big Bang. The last two chapters are an update of that material. And it is mostly chatter. This book will give you some feeling for the new buzzwords, but no useful understanding. I hope this book does not damage Gribbins otherwise good reputation."},{"Title":"THE SEARCH FOR SUPERSTRINGS, Symmetry, and the Theory of Everything","review":"I enjoyed &quot;In Search of Schroedingers Cat&quot; and &quot;Schroedingers Kittens&quot; &amp; was really looking forward to this one.

Thanks so much."},{"Title":"The Little, Brown Reader.","review":"The book arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was in perfect condition just as promised."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"I've used a number of approaches to architecture, including the Zachman Framework, the RUP 4+1, SEI's ATAM, and a plethora of others. I was skeptical that this book was going to add anything of value to the art and practice of architecture. I was wrong. This book gives a realistic approach to architecture. Better, with minor tailoring it can be applied to any of the more mainstream methodologies, and does so because it is a toolkit of methods more than a formal methodology. Of course, if you are not using one of the plethora of architecture methodologies, this book's approach will also serve nicely as a standalone methodology as well.The approach is based on &quot;Infomajic Enterprise Architecture Toolkit&quot;, which was developed by the author's company (Infomajic). In some ways the approach is a scaled down version of the Zachman Framework - indeed, there is a fairly detailed comparison between the two starting on page 11.There are three main stages to the architecture toolkit, (1) connecting the architecture to business, (2) developing the architecture itself, and (3) implementation strategies. The latter is what sets this book apart from many which focus on 'fun' stuff and gloss over the gory details associated with implementation. Each step within these three stages are thoroughly discussed in great detail, yet the author's brisk writing style makes even the most mundane aspects highly readable.Key aspects of this book that I particularly like include copious real world examples, width and depth of the content, and outstanding use of charts and tables to convey information. In addition to the detailed approach in the body of the book, the nine appendices are invaluable aids, ranging from interview outlines, to estimating work effort guidelines, to sample job descriptions and architecture assessment workshop outlines.Regardless of which architecture methodology you are using (or are committed to using), you'll gain many useful ideas from this book. If you are searching for a viable methodology, this one is complete and has been proven in the real world."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"This is a great book with a ton of practical advice, examples and exercises. I think the test with any IT book is can you apply the information easily to what it is you do, and the answer here is certianly \\"yes\\". Thr infomation is presented in the context of an imaginary project, and leads the reader through each step in an easy to follow format. A well done book that is well worth a sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Carbone takes the role of the enterprise architect and lays out a step-by-step approach for success. She breaks down Zachman's theoretical framework into a practical how-to manual. Zachman taught you what data to collect; Carbone teaches you how to use that data. By using examples and exercises, Carbone guides you through the sometimes overwhelming process of identifying the business problems; then helps you develop key actionable items in order to solve these problems and meet business objectives. I strongly recommend this book as well as her training course that covers the same subject matter."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Jane Carbone provides a practical guide to implementing Enterprise Architecture. The book is drawn from Jane's extensive experience of developing enterprise and data architectures.It defines a best practice Enterprise Architecture approach using the Zachman Framework. The book is organised to describe:1. A business framework for collecting and analysing key enterprise business information. This entails defining current and target business states and, identifying gaps and opportunities.2. An IT framework for translating business opportunities into plans. This entails defining principles, models, listing key IT resources and standards.3. An implementation framework for delivering Enterprise Architecture projects. This entails identifying, selecting and prioritising projects.4. Key implementation activities including defining and establishing metrics, gaining buy-in from executives and IT staff and, detailing governance processes for enabling compliance.5. Key architecture processes, roles and human resource policies.6. Enterprise Architecture deliverables. This includes: the IT plan (updated at least annually); an annual financial plan for IT; a project architecture assessment; a quarterly update and presentations.This book is an asset to anyone who is grappling with the implementation of an Enterprise Architecture capability within a large organisation. It provides a holistic view of information governance centred around data. It is particularly relevant for people engaging in regulatory and compliance initiatives such as Sarbannes Oxley and Basel II.Lastly, Jane has written a handbook for practitioners, it is written in a clear and concise manner. It exudes the experience of someone who has learnt Enterprise Architecture the hard way!"},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"My first impression of this book was poor due to its aesthetic problems: although it's a hardcover, it appears to have been \\"printed\\" on poor quality paper by a photocopier low on toner. Certain diagrams are rendered unreadable by the lack of color, and gray backgrounds are uneven and splotchy.Aesthetics aside, the content of this book does deliver on its promises. It presents a reasonable architecture development framework. Each aspect of the framework is explained and justified with examples from the author's personal experience. It covers the people management roles of an architect too, and includes some useful advice on how to \\"sell\\" architecture changes throughout an organization, and how and when to involve the client's IT staff.The book details a step-by-step approach, best read start-to-finish. I imagine most architects who read this already have their own frameworks, and won't want to swallow Carbone's methodology whole. But nearly anyone will find bits and pieces useful.What this book doesn't include is much technical detail. There is no discussion of architecture or integration design patterns, and little advice for conducting vendor evaluations for architectural components. But if the framework / methodology angle is what you're seeking, this book delivers."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"This book is rather thin, but very dense. I can't remember reading a book that had so many bullet points and lists. While many books on the subject of Enterprise Architecture focus primarily on discussions, this book omits wordy definitions and usual fluff and \\"cuts to the chase\\" on how to analyze company's baseline, synthesize its target state using business drivers, and deliver a roadmap for transitioning to it.Unlike with many books listed on Amazon.com, it's not currently possible to search inside this book or view its Table of Contents. Therefore, I have decided to list some of the chapter titles below:Connecting Architecture to the BusinessAnalyzing the Business Current StateConstructing the Business target StateAnalyzing the Target State--Identifying Gaps and OpportunitiesArchitecture ModelsStandardsEstablishing MetricsPresenting the Plan for Buy-inCompliance and Other Key ProcessesThe entire book is a template on how to approach an overwhelming task of restructuring a company into a better entity that will enable it to achieve its business goals. Thus I would recommend it to someone who is fairly familiar with the theoretical underpinnings of the subject and is ready to try it in practice. I am sure it will be as helpful to you as it has been helpful to me."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Jane's book is highly recommended to everyone working with enterprise architecture. Experienced architects should check the toolkit out, and will probably find at least a few good hints from a fellow practitioner, but also students and learners in the EA field should consider the book. I personally use it as the mandatory textbook at the EA course I teach at the Danish IT University, and the students love it.Jane should write more books!"},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Finally - a book about Enterprise Architecture that steers clear of theoretical discourse and provides a practical, useable and clearly achievable approach! The components of the Toolkit are formidable and pragmatic - the guidelines and advice on Architecture Models (chapter 7) and Project Implementation (chapter 10) alone are worth the price of the book. And I was delighted to see data given equal time with functions and platform - this is an area that so many IT architecture plans either totally miss or grossly underestimate. But it's the lessons learned (provided throughout the book) that really drive the points home.Ms Carbone's conversational style makes the approach seem more credible and the examples more resonant - it's the literary equivalent of standing around the water cooler and discussing the latest IT strategy, warts and all! This is ultimately a good thing, because it's presented in a constructive fashion - it makes the reader assess not only how they approach IT architecture, but also the pre-conceived notions they have about it, and provides realistic solutions to typical roadblocks. Ultimately, this book should be required reading for both IT architects and their business clients, because it provides a common understanding of IT Architecture's purpose and the important role that each group plays."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"This book is the first that succinctly get to the heart of enterprise architecture, the benefits, the reason to take the time to plan. This book is perfect for both the business side of the house and the IT community to come together and realize the benefits of doing it right the first time. This book will never leave your desk and will serve as the model for everyone to use and follow."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"I was quite disappointed, with the publisher not amazon, because the entire book is a photocopy. I wanted to keep this book in my library and something of this sort is just not acceptable. I even went to barnes and nobles to see if they had a good version of this book, but they sell a this photocopy for around $59. Sad isn't it!No issue with amazon. Never have had. Timely arrival, no damage etc. I am glad I paid a discounted price for this on amazon because paying around $60 for a photocopy is definitley not worth it."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"This book had the benefit of not only being educational, but a fun read (written, I'm sure, in a style similat to that in which Ms. Carbone speaks). Taking the perspective of a self-professed &quot;charred&quot; Architect, Ms. Carbone carefully takes you through a description of not only what Enterprise Architecture is, but what the deliverables should look like and, most valuably, how to develop them. If you're famailar with Zachman or the Zachman Framework, Ms. Carbone clearly explains where she &quot;overlaps&quot; with the Framework, and where she doesn't. The value added to this book is in its almost cook-book style approach (while indicating where a thoughtful chef might &quot;flavor to taste&quot; - my words). My only complaint is that an Amazon search on Enterprise Architecture doesn't identify this book (I had to find it through other searches)."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Anyone interested in learning more about how to think about developing software systems in a large corporate environment needs to read this book. Short and to the point it outlines how to think about and develop an architecture for the enterprise."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Over the past year, this reviewer has spent some time catching up on some of the more recently available texts on enterprise architecture, and quite simply this one by Carbone is one of the best. It is a testimony to the effectiveness of this book that this author is able to bring together in just over 200 pages what other authors are not able to do in two or three times this volume: get to the heart of what enterprise architecture is really all about, provide clear no-nonsense examples of how to reflect the needs of the enterprise in its software systems, and guide the reader along a cumbersome-free step-by-step process that focuses on results. While Carbone does not view the enterprise as holisticly as T.S. Graves in his recently-penned \\"Real Enterprise-Architecture\\" (see my review for that book), this book is much more practical. The author explains in her preface that there were two factors that motivated her to write this book: \\"the need to plan how data is collected, flows through the organization, and is transformed into information the business can access, is vital\\" even though there was a time when her opinions and passion about business information \\"was not always popular\\", and she has had her \\"own religious experience...having been honed (some would say charred) on the altar of architecture\\" and \\"having learned many lessons the hard way, [she] is anxious to help [the reader] benefit from those lessons\\". The \\"enterprise architecture toolkit\\" presented here is much simpler than the Zachman Framework, focusing on the upper left-hand rows and provides methods for filling in the cells, and unlike that framework addresses strategies for implementing the target architecture. Carbone is persistent in her communication throughout this book that enterprise architecture is comprised as the business and IT functions working together, unlike some books of this genre which present IT architecture as enterprise architecture, although this reviewer does find it interesting that her \\"enterprise architecture toolkit\\" got renamed for the title of the book. Chapters 2 through 5 focus on the \\"toolkit business framework\\" portion of the overall toolkit: the current state of the business and an analysis of that state, and the target state of the business and identification of gaps and opportunities for that state. Chapters 6 through 9 focus on the \\"toolkit IT framework\\" portion of the overall toolkit: current and target state architecture, IT inventory, and standards. Chapters 10 through 13 focus on the \\"toolkit implementation framework\\" portion of the overall toolkit: projects, metrics, buy-in, compliance, and people. Essentially, this last aspect of the toolkit places a focus on strategies designed to address and mitigate what the author views as often-repeated mistakes that contribute to solution failure: \\"attempts to implement too much, too quickly\\", \\"inability or lack of willingness to tie implementation to business success\\", \\"underestimation of resistance to change\\", \\"no commitment and/or buy-in from the entire organization\\", \\"lack of supporting enterprise-wide processes\\", and \\"insufficient focus on the people issues\\". Nine (very lightweight) appendixes, A through I, follow the overall presentation of the toolkit. A recent client of mine indicated very fervently that \\"the business doesn't know what they need, IT knows what they need\\"; this book provides an antithesis to that philosophy."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"This book offers a straightforward approach to IT architecture and a very practical framework for implementation."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"Jane's gift for teaching is apparent in this clear and concise book. Novices and experienced architects alike will find it an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"IT Architecture Toolkit","review":"I feel regret to spend the money and time on this book"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"In hopes of one of the stories being good, I kept on reading each woman's story, and it never got better. No doubt this is the only book that I have been inspired to throw in my fireplace. The way she wrote these characters, it seems that Bushnell is a misogynist: 1) is a whore, 2) is a despiteful bitch 3) is crazy, 4) is boring and unoriginal. And most of the characters are so underdeveloped, like the Princess - supposedly she turned crazy and hooked on prescription drugs after her in-law offered her a Xanax. Pa-lease. If you are looking for a good read, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The four stories range from mildly entertaining to mind-numbing. I found the first and the last the most readable (\\"readable\\" being a relative term). I should probably call these \\"vignettes\\" rather than \\"stories,\\" as \\"story\\" implies some sort of character development and plot occur.The first vignette centers on Janey Wilcox, a minor celebrity who's \\"employment\\" consists of modeling occasionally and sleeping with rich, powerful men frequently. Janey likes to summer in the Hamptons, so each spring she finds a wealthy man with a nice beach house and installs herself as his girlfriend for the season. Some of her liasions are quite amusing, but after a rather unpleasant season she resolves to get a beach house on her own and \\"do something\\" with her life. Her attempts at \\"doing something\\" (screenwriting, real estate classes) don't quite materialize, but then she gets a lucrative modeling contract with Victoria's Secret and can afford her own summer house. Janey is not entirely unlikeable and there is some amusing dialogue; however, I finished the story thinking \\"Huh? What was the point of THAT?\\" I guess at that point I was still expecting some sort of coherent storyline.The second story is about Winnie and James Dieke, well-known Serious Journalists. They are also Seriously Pretentious. Winnie didn't seem to fit in with the \\"blonde\\" concept as she struck me more as self-righteous brunette. Winnie and James are a successful couple with a nice apartment and a child (who is never named and seems not to intrude at all into their lives), and they hate each other as Winnie is a control freak and James a wimp. Eventually they sleep with other people, and Winnie gets a promotion. Once again, \\"story\\" is too strong a word -- \\"bunch of random stuff that happened\\" might be a more accurate term. Winnie and James are quite unpleasant people, and I found myself disappointed that nothing terrible happened to either of them (other than they remained married to each other).I confess I didn't make it all the way thru the third story due to extreme turbulence which made reading unpleasant. It seemed to be about a woman named Cecelia who, as far as I could make out, is married to a prince, has an eating disorder and takes a variety of \\"medications\\" a la Courtney Love. Cecilia is quite paranoid and convinced her husband is trying to poison her. I really couldn't make it thru this one at all.The last story is rather entertaining, and mercifully brief. It is the account of a 40 year old columnist who goes to London to find out why English women can find husbands, even though they are so very unattractive (what with their lank hair, sensible shoes, no makeup, and short nails) -- while beautiful, successful Manhattanites can only find endless casual sex. Turns out the Englishwomen are unfazed by small penises, poor technique, and premature ejaculation, while the Englishmen are so baffled by women that they can't conceive of having more than one in their lives. This vignette came the closest to a humorous satire on the mating habits of the Manhattan elite, and was probably the most enjoyable out of all. It is also the briefest.All in all, the book did keep me occupied during a flight, but I probably wouldn't recommend spending any actual money for it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"It's difficult to rate this book. It's well-written with clearly defined characters and it flows. However, it's a real downer to read. The characters have terrible, depressing lives. If you read for entertainment, take a pass on this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was excited to read this book as a huge fan of \\"Sex and the City\\", and I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but a random episode of \\"Sex and the City\\" proves to be more thought provoking. The four stories all seem to end abruptly as though even the author had no idea what to do with these troubled women. The first story starts the book off to a great beginning, but the second story is simply awful!!! It goes nowhere and the characters are despicable and it is written in an irritating fashion none of the other stories shares. The third story is my favorite; it does not apologize for its respective blonde or for her actions. A guilty pleasure. And the fourth is a cute, 30 minute read that I couldn't help wanting to be stretched out in length and replacing the second. A breezy read that will not have you thinking much afterwards."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"In 3 thematically-similar novellas and one short story, Candace Bushnell gives us some interesting studies of how the other half lives. The tone is that of a modern day Anita Loos (&quot;Gentleman Prefer Blondes&quot;) -- an author more intelligent than but not condescending to her characters. The tales deal with the moral challenges and manuevers of 4 women with the same hair color but widely different agendas. The first wants to use her looks and charisma to get ahead, the second wants to use her brain, the third just wants to escape from it all, and the fourth doubts that what she wants exists -- a man who is worthy of her love and admiration. Each woman finds that there are circumstances which she cannot fully control and she must deal with them...or let things happen for better or worse. This book is quite entertaining. A good ability to pace and a steady prose-writer's hand make Ms. Bushnell an author worth reading. This may not be the deepest book you'll ever find, but it does manage to be moderately thought-provoking. Pick it up for a change of pace and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Ok, this book is written by the same woman who wrote \\"Sex and the City\\". Naturally I assumed it would be a fun, energetic read that I would thoroughly enjoy. Especially since the back cover of the book said things like \\"Hysterical\\" and such. I was not impressed by this book at all. Ask anyone, I enjoy almost every book I read, but this one didn't do anything for me. It was four stories told separately about four different women. The language was choppy and hard to follow, the characters were one dimmensional, and it was very difficult to become involved in their conflicts. In most of the books I read I find myself sympathizing with the main character and I start hoping that certain things will happen for them. Not the case with this book. I found that the women were bitter, unhappy, angry, rich snobs. I could not relate and did not want to. Some of the books I read have wealthy protagonists, but I feel like I can still relate to them as women. Again, not the case with this book. There was no plot development, no character development, and no story line that I could find. Overall, very disappointed with the book.-not recommended"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"What a waste of time. I only kept reading it because I thought something redeeming was going to happen. The characters were not at all likeable."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"It seems to me the only reason this book was published was to tout the name of Candace Bushnell, who inspired the popular television series, Sex and the City. But if you read it (and Sex and the City) you will learn that the writing is no where near as good as the writing on the television show. The trampy characters in Four Blondes are boring and clich&eacute; and give the reader no reason to like them.Chick lit is fun when it's well written and the characters have some redeeming qualities. This is just a weak attempt to entertain by exposing four bimbos with a repulsive lifestyle.Sorry."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.Literally.I had never read Bushnell before, but as a HUGE sex and the city fan (it is like my bible), I figured her books had to be pretty amazing as well. I was wrong. \\"4 Blondes\\" is not funny or hilarious, and does not contain any of the sex and the city style I was expecting. I borrowed it from a friend, who has amazing taste in books, and after reading it, I asked her how she could possibly have enjoyed it. She looked at me and said \\"you borrowed 4 blondes? Why? I HATED that book?\\"I've never met people who are even remotely like these women. Not one of them has the sort of life that I would even want to relate to. The stories are not only completely unrealistic, but they piss you off. To think women like this actually exist makes you want to just kill youself now. And the fact that they are blond is only a minute detail in it's relevance to the stories. In fact, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't picture the character \\"Winnie\\" as anything other than a ... brunette.The only story I even remotely liked was the last one, which seemed to be about 12 pages long.If you are looking for a fun, easy, sex and the city type read, look elsewhere. \\"4 blondes\\" was not only a waste of my time, but it affected my mood. After finishing it, I was disgusted and saddened by these women. If these women are any sort of reflection on the kind of people that Ms. Bushnell associates with, I feel extremely sorry for her.If for some reason you still decide to read this book, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am a huge fan of HBO's SEX AND THE CITY so I was excited to see what Ms. Bushnell would have to offer in this her latest book. All I can say is the FOUR BLONDES is desperately in need of a brunette, a redhead, or SOME form of diversity.The characters in the book (four shades of blonde) are completely flat and uninteresting. From the ditzy model to the career girl writer to the hopeless social climber, Bushnell's attepts at satire and humor are weak and dated.Don't get me wrong, I love clothes and shoes and vacations as much as the next girl but somehow the pursuits of these women come across as so superficial or mind-numbingly uninteresting that I didn't care one way or the other about the outcome.I'm an African American woman so I don't need to identify with these women but I would like to be ENTERTAINED! This just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I rarely put down a book once I have started it, and my reputation is intact with 4 Blondes, but how I ever got through it, I'll never know. The first segment, Nice N'Easy got me hooked, despite the trashy sex element (no, I'm not a prude, but this was a little over the top). The subsequent three segments went downhill, until I started skipping pages. Based on this reading experience, I will not be looking for Bushnell's next novel."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell, creator and writer of SEX AND THE CITY, returns with 4 novellas in this collection.

What she yearns for is what she gets...realizing that it wasn't what she needed.\\"Highlights for Adults\\" is a downer of a tale describing in stark detail a woman's troubled marriage and the consequences of choices she and her husband makes.\\"Platinum\\" shows us what a woman will do to be accepted in high society while fighting her own demons.\\"Single Process\\" is the most SEX AND THE CITYish. It reads like a column. Dealing with a life without a husband, a writer travels to England to see if the wife's tale of \\"Englishman are bad in bed\\" is true.

These 4 blondes are the most shallow of shallow from the ditzy former model whose claim is to find boyfriends for the summer based on what house they are renting in the Hamptons. The second is the married power wife, who has an affair with a movie star that her husband roomed with in college, not realizing that her husband wants her sister. The 3rd is a real princess who is on a paranoid rant due to drug usage and the 4th, I have no idea, because I didn't finish this book! Save your money!Thanks for reading!**Pandora"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell still seems to have a great knack for taking a modern day satirical look at dating and relationships. Some of the critics of Four Blondes seem to be taking the book too seriously. This book is suppose to be fun. I will caution, however, that it is not up to the standards of Sex and The City. While Sex and The City was a fun and witty book, it also had some interesting and enlightening insights into the different ways men and women view sex and relationships. (For those interested in books of that type, I would also highly recommend Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf and Fried Calamari, two very original well written and funny books about modern relationships) But if you're in the mood for a lighthearted witty read, I recommend Four Blondes. If we could only get Ms. Bushnell to team up with Aaron Spelling, they could create a terrific Fox TV series."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"If you're already in a low frame of mind, you'd be doing yourself a favor to avoid this senseless, dull and depressing book before you do harm to yourself.This really is a horrible book. The four stories (well, okay, I'm not a liar. I could only bring myself to read three of them) are so bleak, so pointless and just so...so...NOT good.The character development of each blonde are stereotypical, to say the very least. But the plot lines. Heaven spare me. It's not that the stories are unoriginal (which they are.) It's not that they're uninterestingly written (which they are.) It's just the dogged, relentless plowing through each dull, degrading life that begins to wear on the reader (which I am). There are no plot turns. There are no twists. Each novella is a total flat line.Which brings me back to the title and first line of my review. If you're already feeling pretty down, stay clear of this one. What was Candace's editor thinking? What was Candace thinking?"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"While I enjoyed the television series SATC and have all seasons of DVDs, I thought I was looking for a great easy summer read. The back of the book and the reviews inside the front cover looked promising and interesting. This book consists of four stories, each one about a different blonde in NYC. This book really had nothing to do with living in NYC and I was very disappointed in the plot lines. The stories didn't go anywhere. The book seemed to go downhill from the first story about Janey. I am getting ready to start the fourth book, but I am afraid of how horrible it will be if the other three were so bad. Do not recommend reading this one!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am addicted to the show Sex and the City so I naturally thought I'd like the book it was based on. Wrong!! This book is awful. While the show has endearing characters that you love despite their flaws the characters in this book are all flaws and you feel nothing for them. If you are going to have meaningless sex stories then it should atleast have good sex scenes but this book didn't even have that. Just annoying self absorbed characters. I couldn't even finish the book all the stories and I NEVER put a book down unfinished. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"First off, I thought this book was one story, but in fact it is 4 different stories on 4 different blondes. I only made it through the first two. I thought this book was horrible. The stories didn't even finish in any kind of satisfying way (at least for me). Very disappointed!!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"4 Blondes was not exactly realistic, but it was entertaining. Though it's true that the characters do not act like I would expect any real people to act, I would not consider this book a bad book. It's fiction: it doesn't necessarily have to be realistic. I read several other reviews on this book and, for the most part, they presented negative opinions. If you're looking for a book to make you laugh and maybe entertain you for a few hours, this book would work. If you want a book that's very down to earth and that you can relate to, this book would probably not be your best bet. Over all,I liked the book and would recommend it to a friend...as long as they were old enough, since this book does deal with information for a more mature reader."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I love the way she writes. It's not complicated, it fresh and normal. For once I know what the heck this writer is writing; life and it's up and downs. The characters are all smart, witty and sophisticated. Yes somethings may be a little taboo still but each character faces choices and sometimes our choices are not suppose to proper and prim. The human behavior is indeed something to read about. The characters all work together but then Bushnell throws us a odd duck of a person or those feelings we don't want to hear, which makes the story happen. A must read book if you love humor and life rolled into one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The first story was funny and held my interest, the second one I found to be hysterically funny (in a dark way), the last one was funny, but it was too short. The third story (Princess Cecilia) was way too long, lacked humor and had no plot. Get the book from the library, read the three good stories and you will have some fun, light reading."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"In light of Summer coming up I would give this book four stars, though as literature three is probably a generous rating. Still if you enjoy \\"Sex and the City\\" you will probably get some serious guilty pleasure out of this one as \\"light reading.\\""},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Is Candace Bushnell a misogynist? Because in this \\"novel,\\" she writes her characters as shallow, vapid, worthless [women] who do little more than waste space and complain, though not in that order. I got through the first story waiting for it to become interesting. It didn't. I threw the book in the trash where it belongs. I'm highly disappointed--I loved some of her other work but this one is truly horrible. Don't bother. I'd have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option.

What a disappointment - it's nowhere near as good as the series. What looks very good visually on screen (Fendi bags, designer shoes) just ends up being an exercise in name dropping in the book - and ends up being exceedingly boring by the end of it all. To top it off, the main characters come across as heartless and cold. Skip this one - there are much better things to spend your money on."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The first story was funny and enjoyable. The second - not bad, the third story is where I stopped reading and haven't picked up since.I think she is a good writer, she is smart with a lot of wit. But, I think this book probably doesn't show case her talent like Sex in the City (which I haven't read, but probably will at some point)."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Garbage! Halfway through the book and bored to tears, I took it back to the store and demanded a refund. And guess what! I wasn't the first one to do so. Please don't waste your time and money on this book! It is nothing like SEX IN THE CITY!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun summer read. I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, but found this book to be overly pretentious and depressing. I kept reading thinking it might get better, but it never did. I don't know any women who will relate to the stories, much less enjoy them. Buy Sex and the City on DVD if you want fun stories that you can relate to, don't waste your money on 4 Blondes."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was expecting a bombshell of a book, no pun intended. It kept my attention, mainly because I wanted to see if it would improve. It did, somewhat. Still, I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I'd be with it. Good beach read, but that's about it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I found this book really refreshing! I'd recommend it to anyone who might like to dip out of their own boring life and dive into one of the four characters Candace Bushnell has written all too well. Pick it up-- *4 Blondes* isn't as dumb as you think :)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought that Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes was absolutely wonderful! Being in a world of the rich and famous is a daydream for many of us, but Ms. Bushnell creates a wonderful escape into the &quot;elites&quot; world for four great chapters. She makes one think that having all the wealth and all the fame isn't what makes a person and that those who have it aren't always happy. I thought that it was a great follow-up to Sex and the City. They are both rauchily classy books!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is excellent...it is a wonderful book to read when it is a rainy afternoon. If you think your life is bad, read this book...it is funny and theres lots of sex!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is a great follow up to Sex and the City. It is different women but it's in the same great tradition, More love lives, Sex tales and general women of the day's anguish! It will have you up late reading to get to the next story. Everyone can identiy with at least one if not more or all of these women!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the worst book I've read in years. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. I'm even more sorry that I picked it for my book club. No one in my book club will forgive me for picking it because we all hated it. The characters in the book are sad and twisted. Don't waste your time"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"After enjoying SEX AND THE CITY, I bought this book, Bushnell's second, in hardback. I was disappointed. The women of FOUR BLONDES are shallow, superficial and vapid, even more so than the models that litter SATC."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was extremely pleased with Four Blondes. I had very much enjoyed reading Sex and the City for its dark humour and wit, and had assumed that Four Blondes would be unlikely to live up to the same caliber. However I was proved wrong.Like S&TC;, Four Blondes is a collection of short stories, this time focusing on the four women in the title. Divided into four stories, that of the ageing party girl/model, the anorexic princess, the high powered businesswoman and a writer looking for love, Bushnell paints each story with a satiric brush. Despite having money, looks and power, the first three women are seemingly insecure and unhappy. Four Blondes shows how each woman tries to regain a sense of control over their seemingly overwhelming, highly pressured lives, and how different personalities are more effective at this than others. Some women prosper whilst others fall short.If I can find a fault with the book it is with the final woman's story, obviously based on Bushnell herself. I found her story rushed and pointless, as though it was added only to bulk up the book. It seemded more of a footnote than a story itself. It wasn't unenjoyable, but it was not as superb as the previous three tales.The relative shortness of each woman's tale (compared to an entire book) was refreshing as it meant that the reader does not becomes bored with each story and is always left wanting more. A great read for anyone who lacks the concentration to read lengthy novels with a running narrative.Somehow managing to be more glamorous than its older, expectionally successful sister, Four Blondes is a very dark, sometimes depressing look at New York woman who have it all. All that glitters is most definately not always gold.An absolute must read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm surprised at all of the bad reviews for &quot;4 Blondes.&quot; It's really not a bad book at all - it's a very enjoyable read. The stories aren't meant to be intellectual, they're meant to be fun and entertaining, which they are. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading dishy novels about the lives of the rich and beautiful. If it teaches any lesson, it's that those who seemed to have charmed lives, really aren't so happy after all."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I think every woman should read this because in some it will change their life. Or you have a good time laughing at all the crazy lifestyles of the four girls. Everyone should read this once. I love it and suggest everyone to read it!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The cheesy cover and silly title belie what a good book this is. IMHO, this is Bret Easton Ellis but better. Bushnell has said in an interview that she likes Henry James and Edith Wharton, and 4 Bs could be seen as a modern version of their books. Don't look for the meaning of life from this book, just enjoy reading about some glamourous people by a very skilled author who writes from experience."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the worst book I've run across in years -- boring, pointless, and flat. Someone else said the characters are unlikable, and they are, but they're also hopelessly dull. Bushnell intersperses passages of the most sophomoric dialogue imaginable with sudden descriptions of unconventional sex acts, perhaps in a vain attempt to wake the reader up. At the end of the second story -- Winnie and her husband -- I wanted to throw the thing against the wall in frustration. I settled for throwing it in the trash.I didn't even pay for &quot;Four Blondes&quot; -- it came bundled with some magazine or other. But I think someone should pay _me_ for the hours I wasted thinking it couldn't stay this bad, that it was going to get better. Pheh. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Don't make the same mistake I made and get sucked in by the Bushnell name. If you are looking to get your Sex In the City fix with this book, don't bother. The first character introduced was fun but I struggled to get through her story. As the book went on, I actually felt cheated by the lame-o storylines and going-nowhere plots. Thank God I got it from the library and didn't have to shell out $$ for this one.Just be patient and wait for the new season to start on HBO."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A reader of this book shouldn't (and wouldn't) look for deep, sharp observations or artsy, elevated style. It is expected to be naughty, catty, titillating and exploitive. Nothing wrong with it, such a book would have its place under the Sun (as in beach reading) as well as on bookshelf, and can be truly enjoyable and witty. Alas, &quot;Four Blondes&quot; delivers the goods only partially at best.It starts with the juiciest story, most profusely sprinkled with a sugar-and-spice combo of glamour and trash. Its heroine, Janie Wilcox, an aging model, is drifting in society circles without a family or a stable career. Seems like a poor pretty girl whose time is fast slipping by, reminding me of the lines from &quot;Casanova&quot; by &quot;Nautilus Pompilius&quot; (somewhat lost in translation): \`...Where have you been when they've been building a raft / For you and all those who're drifting on ice-floe...'Not quite. She is actually &quot;empowered&quot;, not in a classical feminist sense, but in judicious gold-digging ways, granting sexual favors to useful rich men seemingly at leisure and at her own discretion, and not looking too desperate at it. Still it seems contrived. There is nothing wrong with some choosy gold-digging, yet her case looks a little cheap. All this trouble just for summer free-ranging in Hampton, going to the same parties with the same people that, as admitted in the story, long ago bored to death with each other? She could be aiming higher, even in her own glittery/trashy ways.We are treated with fascinating revelations, such as &quot;all rich men she'd been with turned out to be freaks and perverts&quot;. Of course they are, readers will appreciate this insight. It's a valuable piece of knowledge that makes the lives of many of us who don't own houses in Hampton bearable enough. Still these &quot;rich men&quot; are not complete waste, just enough to provide a few juicy sexual tidbits for the story.In one respect the author is slightly old-fashioned - the rich and predatory (and, of course, perverted and insecure) men in her stories are the &quot;old money&quot; of entertainment and media executives, publishers, producers, etc. A whole stratum of overnight dot-com millionaires is touched with a 10-foot pole: &quot;Aren't those Internet guys boring?&quot; - as the heroine refuses to attend one of those dot-com launch parties. Of course they are, but sorry, Ms. Bushnell, this is simply running away scared. Just imagine, what an opportunity for glorious trashing of snotty rags-to-riches (and by now satisfactorily back to rags) asocial geeks is missed! To the author's credit, however, the second chapter contains some really witty observations of the ...(dot).com (authors and reviewers) crowd.Candice Bushnell definitely has problem with endings. None of them in these four stories are great, or even passably good. They aren't lame enough to be either classical mushy happy endings, or stern morality tales where flighty sinners are punished for their empty lives. Nor they contain any good surprises. Each of them is fairly OK, in a small way, but so uninspiring and anticlimactic.The second story is probably the best written of the book - because it is so merciless in mocking its main characters. It introduces &quot;very important people with very important jobs&quot; - a power couple in NY media circles. They are so right and politically correct, from the first paragraph the edifice of polished blandness towers over a reader like a generic NY skyscraper. Author proceeds to wickedly deconstruct them as a couple for several pages, stripping both of any vitality, by itinerating things that they don't like or approve in other people. And then she continues to prune them separately, until only empty skeletons left, with things that they don't like about each other. They both engage in brief affairs that don't even have an aura of a furtive sin, desperation or even genuine boredom. Instead they feel like an episode of a job-training program, a corporate seminar \\"7 ways to exhibit your human side\\". Suits them well.The third story, about a young beauty that married a prince (not Dark or Charming, just his official title), is completely forgettable. She discovered that the nuptial package includes life in a fishbowl, nosy reporters, lack of friends and so on. Yeah, right. Haven't we heard this story about a poor bird in a gilded cage thousands times before? It would be more appropriately called \\"Platitude\\" instead of \\"Platinum\\".The last chapter, set in London, is the most catty of all. At first Candice Bushnell describes English sex appeal (male and female) in such wicked terms as to warrant bringing back Her Majesty expeditionary corps to hang all of New York's society and gossip columnists at every available lamppost. In the middle of the story the heroine meets some true British blue-blood noble, who surely must be the epitome and quintessence of all these unenviable qualities. Then Ms. Bushnell suddenly flips on her back, paws playfully up, and ends up purring something utterly tame (and lame) along the lines \\"... three days later they crawled out of a bed\\". I suspect Albion dwellers don't deserve the trashing the author gave them at the beginning of the story (at least not all of them). But even nastiness could be more consistent, presented with honor, perseverance and a stiff upper lip. Besides, exactly who gives a damn about rehabilitation of sexual reputation of some British heraldic fossil with a ridiculously long compound name? Alas, the end could be more interesting..."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Oh, my! This was one of the worst books I have read. It was shallow and smarmy! I finished the book, but really am not aware how that could have happened. There has to be some redeeming factor with the women in the book, but it is difficult to surmise from reading the book. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I feel like Bushnell is making fun of people she knows via characters in this book. There are two types of characters- the sex addicts or the people that think sex is horrible. Regardless, all of their lives revolve around sex, either loving it or hating it. I can't imagine a world where these people exist. It is depressing to read about people with such meaningless lives. Yet, it is insightful to see how people hit rock bottom, even if they are rich and beautiful or seem to have it all. A bit of a social commentary but I'm not sure if people in the &quot;fast lane&quot; do really live like this."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read and my book club agrees. I'm a huge fan of the show &quot;Sex and the City&quot; so I don't think you need to be from New York to appreciate New Yorkers, but how anyone could appreciate the characters in this book is beyond me. I didn't make it to the end of the third story or on to the forth because I just couldn't stomach any more of the self-absorbed, money-crazy insanity. If you like to be able to find something about which to empathize in the characters you read about, then I doubt this book is for you. Unless you're one of them."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I wouldn't recoomend this book to anyone. The whole book is shallow, the women only have sex, money, designer clothes and off the wall fantansies on their minds. This book was not worth the money or time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Based on the success of Sex in the City but never having read the book, I was expecting more of Ms. Bushnell's writing. Her characters are extremely one-dimensional and not at all believable. Her writing style is simplistic and irritating. The stories seem more like gossip stories which have gotten out of hand, perhaps developed towards someone's object of derision. It was a big waste of my time and my money. I gained nothing from reading the book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was hoping this book would be as humors and enjoyable as Sex and the City. Instead I got four stories about characters that were so one dimentional as the book I was reading. Each story ending leaving me feeling I was stopped in the middle of an intersection. Their was no closeure on anyone of the characters. This book is being sold mainly on the authors reputation and is not worth the money. Stick to watching &quot;Sex and the City&quot; on HBO. It is much more enjoyable than wasting your time on a book where the characters have no personality or life of their own. This books leaves you feeling let down and suckered into buying a book where the anticipation ends on page one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is NOT a chick lit book! This is not fun, light, fluffy, or empty. It is about women and their demises and in a few stories, their uprises. This is not the usual fluff that most female writers are pushing down our throats. These characters are not here for you to \\"like\\", there is no mindless blab of labels, designers etc, listed off just to show the author has fashion sense. The reason this book was panned by so many is because they thought this was a fun chick lit book. The characters are deep and for each novella inside the book, the writing style changes to depict the personalities of the new character(s). I loved each one. Sure it was disheartening and a little depressing at times, but everyone loves a good drama once in awhile! Surely a welcome break from the Valley Girl meets New York fashion list books with mindless dribble and emotionless fashion columnists running around in Monolos. The mention of Manolos in this book actually had importance to the plot.Loved it! read it twice!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The books sounds good, and looks good. When I heard it was about the story of four \\"elite\\" blondes, I thought it would be fun and sassy, like Sex and the City. However, none of the blondes know eachother, the book is accually four independant stories. The characters are shallow, and a good author should know that it is essential for the reader to feel a connection with the main characters. That connection, as a matter of fact, is negative. While reading the book I developed a great dislike for all of the characters. They are stupid and shallow, and they all use drugs and complain about life. They are also very flat characers; the reader does not know anything about them exept that they are stupid and shallow. I personally do not enjoy reading a book where I have nothing to relate to. Even the simplest books have some kind of a \\"point,\\" or if you prefer, a theme/moral. you feel some kind of emotion from reading them, or gain some kind of insight, even if it is simple (such as friendship, hardwork, raising children, etc.) However, this book has NO point, NO theme, and the only insight the reader gets is how they do not want to be like the characters. Absolutely pointless. I was dissapointed...this book could have been a good idea if the characters were more interesting and developed, and somewhat connected. I recommend you to stay away."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book with every belief that it was going to be good (if not great) but I was sadly disappointed! These women need serious psychological help at the very least. The book goes absolutely no where with absolutely no plot. I hung in there and read it until the end but boy was I ever sorry I wasted my eyesite."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Readable and witty, but it's virtually impossible to empathize with any of the characters. There are struggles in each story, but none of them ever get resolved. Another reviewer called it predictable, but I disagree. I didn't expect all of the stories to be depressing (which I blame the jacket for...it's misleading). In fairness, I've only read 3 so far. I'll change my review if the 4th is OK."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was expecting 4 Blondes to be a fun read just like Sex in the City is fun to watch. Boy, was I wrong. The four blondes are self-obsessed, egotistical, and conceited. The four stories had nothing to do with each other (well, I haven't read the last 5 pages it's been so boring). It's written like 4 short stories that don't end, they just stop. My advice: if you must read it then borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"These four blondes all lack character. It was a painful read. Each of these women is unlikable and all they seem to care about is their beauty and men with money. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Ok.... So I really really really wanted to enjoy this book. As a blonde myself, I thought it would be a fun book, sort of like a combination of Sex and the City and Legally Blonde. I thought perhaps it would place blondes in an important position where they prove everyone, including themselves, wrong about some sort of stereotype. Perhaps it was because I had these expectations that I was seriously let down by the book. These blondes are not heroines... they don't even come close. I honeslty could have cared less about these four girls, none of them are relatable (is that a word??) at all. Perhaps Candace Bushnell does normally write for newspapers... but has she never read a novel in her life?? Where's the intrigue, the importance, the plot?? Anyhow, if its an interesting heroine you're after, buy Bridget Jones, not 4 Blondes"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Being a fan of the TV show Sex and the City, I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was sadly disappointed by the characters, which were shallow and cold. You don't establish a connection with them and their troubles seem rather unimportant. You just don't care what happens to them. I found the writing style unreadable in the second story due to the authors constant use of parentheses to add information to the text. I was unable to finish the book.I have tried on several occasions to pick up the book and finish it, but sadly, it is just a waste of time.Sex and the City"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is my first book review. I felt moved to write about 4 Blondes simply because it was such a BAD book...and I want to try to spare anyone thinking about buying it from wasting their money (trust me, it's not even worth buying used for a dollar). I was really put off by the shallowness of the 4 pathetic blondes in the book and the total lack of character development. After each story ended, I thought, \\"okay, what was the point of THAT?? The next story can't get much worse.\\" Unfortunately, I was wrong everytime. This book became more painful to read with each turn of page. SKIP IT."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell, author of Four Blondes, created her reputation with her novel Sex in the City, which inspired the current, prosperous television series, Sex in the City. Bushnell is also well known due to her role as a columnist for the New York Observer, an editor for Vogue. Her newest novel, Four Blondes, is a compilation of four witty short stories focusing on the love lives of New York women. Bushnell cleverly intertwined her wit to display some truth about the absurdity and humor of society, which has allowed her work to be considered a satire. Janey Wilcox, one of the four women Bushnell writes of, spends each summer selecting a wealthy man to date in order to insure a vacation at his house in the Hamptons. Janey soon realizes all the luxuries she is receiving are not really what she wants, similar feelings to those of Cecelia. Cecelia appears as though she would be living a happy life married to a prince, but soon sees that even with a royal husband she is not completely satisfied. Much like the other two, Winnie Diekes searches for happiness in a place that is unable to return any to her. After Winnie&#65533;s attempt to coerce her husband into writing a book for the benefit of herself, her marriage and love life fall apart. The final character of the novel, an anonymous writer, perhaps held the most interesting role, but was not written thoroughly on. I found that Bushnell used her talent in characterization fairly well here, but was disappointed with the end of the anonymous writer&#65533;s story. I feel Bushnell&#65533;s work was somewhat entertaining simply because of the topic that was covered. Although her humorous style is distinct, I found the book required more character development, as well as plot expansion, in order for it to be classified as a good read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the one of the WORST books I've read in a long time! The writing was disjointed and repetitious and the characters were boring and self involved. This book should have been called &quot;When Good Things Happen to Shallow, Underserving People&quot;. As a major fan of Sex and the City, I was SERIOUSLY disappointed with this effort. Hated it!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"There are two things I know about Candace Bushnell. The first is that she is every bit a beautiful as her characters (judging from her photographs). The second is that reading her books is great fun. When SEX AND THE CITY was published I read it as soon as I could get my hands on it. I wasn't disappointed by it at all. (Sidebar: Unless you have been living on Mars, you know that this was turned into a very popular series on HBO and several of the bits in the book made it to the screen.) I was amongst those who eagerly awaited FOUR BLONDES to be released. Once again, I wasn't disappointed.The first story is one of those in which I found myself rooting for the heroine, Janey Wilcox, as she traversed the delicate and somewhat deadly social/sexual world of New York City and more precisely, the Hamptons. Janey is so well presented that I had to remind my self that she wasn't real (although may be based on real people), and that I couldn't actually ride to her rescue in real life. I won't give away how Janey's story ends, but it is a great ending. The second story is about a (somewhat) high powered media couple, James and Winnie Deike, What was fun for me is that I actually know a man like James Deike who behaves in a similar manner in real life. The other stories are every bit as much fun as the two mentioned above. But, even for the reader who isn't fully involved or even very aware of the world of New York and it's environs, this book is still a fun read. In fact, it could even be something of a primer for those who are moving to NYC anytime soon and plan to (or aspire to) play in the big leagues.I gave up novels years ago because I seldom have the time to read them, but I always make an exception for Ms. Bushnell. Four Blondes is worth the time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought that this book was great. I have read it several times and it doesn't seem to get old. The last last short story was a little blah, but the others got my attention immediately. My favorite is the story of the miserable married couple. The descriptions were were so accurate and perfect visually."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am also a huge fan of Sex in the City and was expecting Four Blondes to be equally funny. Funny it was not, more like pathetic. The characters in these \\"stories\\" (and I use this term loosely) were self-absorbed and I could not relate to them on any level. I highly recommend NOT reading this book. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I cannot believe how insipid and tasteless this book is. It depicts women as vapid, directionless bimbos who only exist to be seen in the right shoes. I can even decide if the author was maybe lampooning this type of woman, because there was no sense of tongue-in-cheek to this. It was just horrible. If you see this book, run the other way."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I liked the first story of the book Four Bondes. The last stories sort of tappered off at the end, but held my attention. I enjoy the stories of such different women. The high class life style in which each of the women enjoy is fun to read about. This would be a good vacation read, a little trashy, but fun."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Being a huge fan of the TV show, I thought I'd check out this novel by Candace Bushnell. Boy, was I disappointed. I only really enjoyed one of the segments...the rest were so silly & unbelievable.Anyway, I guess I'm lucky, because 1) I checked it out from the library and 2) it was the audio version (read by Cynthia Nixon, who plays Miranda on the show). So, see if your local library has it!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm a big fan of Sex and the City, so I thought I would give the novels of Candace Bushnell a try. Either I had too many expectations for this book or it was just plain dumb. I say 50/50. The main charcter was horrible and rude, I could not relate to to her and her stupid antics. I gave the book two chances and the second time I tried to read it I wanted to use the book to give myself a paper cut, that would've been a better pain than what I was going through reading this \\"book\\""},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am sure the only reason this book was even published was Candance Bushnell's Sex in the City success. This book isn't worth the paper it is written on. After the first story I skimmed the second and couldn't even finish the third or begin the fourth. This book isn't even worth 1 star. Stick with Sex in the City!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was highly disappointed by this. The Sex and the City series was so good I thought this would be too. I was looking for a fun read, alas. I did not find one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"It is not horrid it is just not good. Borrow it from a friend or something as it is not one of those books that you'd be happy spending cash on. The writing seems primary and there is no real satisfaction in the characters. It was fluff ...but not even good fluff. It was like fake whipped cream over real whiped cream.If you want to indulge in a easy read book like this pick something else."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"What a disappointment! I wish I'd read these other reviews before reading the book. I love Sex and the City, so I actually read the entire book in the hopes that the author would bring everything together in the end in a clever way, but she didn't. I don't identify with any of these characters! They are drug addicted prostitutes, all the male characters are total jerks ... It's a parade of horrible people that you just don't even want to get to know better."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I started this book in an aiport bookstore and somewhat enjoyed the first story. When I arrived at my destination I bought thinking the other 3 Blondes would have interesting lives. Unfortunatley, they didn't. Don't bother reading past the first quarter of this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am not suggesting that everything Candace Bushnell writes should be just like 'Sex and the City,' but this book is pretty awful. I was looking forward to a juicy and witty end of summer read, and instead found myself bitterly saddened by these empty and somewhat contrived stories. The last story about a journalist writing about sex and England was the worst. I would only recommend this book to the most diehard fan."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought that the book was very good. It kept my interest from beginning to end. I like how the book had different segments w/differnt characters. I thought each character was very interesting especially Princess Cecelia who thought everybody was out to get her. Her life was just so hard (yeah right) that she had to cause problems for herself.Then there was Winnie & James Dieke also very interesting people. I could go on and on and on about the charcters in this book but you should read it for yourself to get the full effect.Absolutely a thumbs up on this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was expecting \\"Sex and the City\\" and got nothing of that. I was expecting the tale of 4 friends, not 4 separate people who's lives are linked together by 1 man or another. I would have expected Bushnell to have a more witty, humorous take in this book. While I didn't expect a happy ending for each woman, I at least thought there would be a positive message. Instead it was wrought with the vanity of 4 women who can't seem to deal with the lives they made for themselves. I was really dissapointed."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.Literally.I had never read Bushnell before, but as a HUGE sex and the city fan (it is like my bible), I figured her books had to be pretty amazing as well. I was wrong. \\"4 Blondes\\" is not funny or hilarious, and does not contain any of the sex and the city style I was expecting. I borrowed it from a friend, who has amazing taste in books, and after reading it, I asked her how she could possibly have enjoyed it. She looked at me and said \\"you borrowed 4 blondes? Why? I HATED that book?\\"I've never met people who are even remotely like these women. Not one of them has the sort of life that I would even want to relate to. The stories are not only completely unrealistic, but they piss you off. To think women like this actually exist makes you want to just kill youself now. And the fact that they are blond is only a minute detail in it's relevance to the stories. In fact, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't picture the character \\"Winnie\\" as anything other than a ... brunette.The only story I even remotely liked was the last one, which seemed to be about 12 pages long.If you are looking for a fun, easy, sex and the city type read, look elsewhere. \\"4 blondes\\" was not only a waste of my time, but it affected my mood. After finishing it, I was disgusted and saddened by these women. If these women are any sort of reflection on the kind of people that Ms. Bushnell associates with, I feel extremely sorry for her.If for some reason you still decide to read this book, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"this book was very confusing, very repetitve, and overall didn't have that great of a plot. it wasn't that great and i lost interest very quickly"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Bridget Jones with less heart and more money. Bushnell never gives a character an even break. Everyone is made unlikeable. Some parts are funny and perceptive but the overall effect is somewhat depressing. Her satirical targets are so remote from everyday life (even in New York and London) that the effect is more glitz than humor. One of her best riffs is on Amazon.com reviewers. \\"Anything that doesn't appeal to their narrow little minds they pan.\\" Hmmm."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although the woman are very shallow and bitchy, I think this book is a great escape. It was fun to read about these troubled woman. It actually made me laugh. It is nice to read about such unstable women. It makes us realize that beautiful women aren't perfect. If you want a great laugh, I say try this book out. I thought it was a lot of fun."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I know most of the reviews have pretty much hit the nail on the head with this one, but I had to throw in my two cents. This book is, in a word, horrendous. I picked it up at a Goodwill store for $3, and I want my money back (not from Goodwill, of course. From Candace herself.) Besides the incessant whining, it seems that all rich people in the Hamptons want to do is snort cocaine and think about butt sex. No joke. I made it almost 3/4 of the way through and have yet to find an interesting character. They are all flat, boring, useless and pathetic.I never read Sex and the City, just watched it on TV and in the movies, but this literary abortion has made me not even want to."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I do not understand how books like this get published? If this book can get published, ANY book can! REALLY the worst book I have ever read. I actually did not read the entire book as it was so bad and made no sense it was impossible to finish. It became nonsensical jibberish...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Having read One Fifth Avenue, with Four Blondes I had great hopes of being entertained by Candace Bushnell's trademark ironic wit and insight into the weird world of New York City culture. What I got instead was a quartet of unappealing ladies, the last of which, a \\"princess\\" of dubious royalty, spent so many pages drunk, self-destructive and confused, that I couldn't finish this book.It's possible that some readers will like this offering. In her popular series, Sex and the City, even the little red-headed lawyer had her fan club. For people like me, self-involved, navel-gazing, insecure women are for avoiding in my local post office - not for reading entertainment. This book is a testament to the truism that blond does not always equal fun."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I made the mistake of reading Trading Up before I read this..It follows one of the blondes..Janey Wilcox on her quest for Mr Right!!**( sorry Mr Rich**!) while this was not too bad, Four Blondes is a complete waste of time and money!!Four pieces of utter drivel...a real disappointment......."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"There should be a law banning Candace Bushnell from writing in the first person. When she does, she's annoying, screechy, and unbearable. Unfortunately, she chooses to write two of the four novellas that comprise \\"Four Blondes\\" in the first person. The other two are decent and entertaining reads, and both stories could be interpreted as forming the basis for Bushnell's best novel \\"One Fifth Avenue.\\" One deals with an over-the-hill model's attempts to settle down with a billionaire husband, and the other deals with a power couple that somehow find to hate each other humanely. The second story is by far the best of the collection, and the couple's story is continued in \\"One Fifth Avenue.\\""},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"THIS IS THE WORST BOOK....I THOUGHT TRADING UP WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD.

Sex and the City should not be allowed to be written in such large print. The four separate stories seem more like summaries about future books than a stand alone book itself. Small factual errors are scattered throughout the stories. Skip it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is simply snippets of unfinished work! I bought it at an extremely reduced price, but it still wasn't worth the price. You have to know the characters from her other novels to even understand what she's talking about!

However, I really enjoyed Bushnell's Trading Up and Lipstick Jungle so figured that this one would be good as well. I couldn't WAIT for it to be over. Can't really put my finger on it but I hated it. However, if you haven't read Trading Up or Lipstick Jungle, you should! Don't let this one stop you...however, don't read this one. :)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I really wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this book. I just finished Candace Bushnell's Carrie Diaries which I loved. That book was an easy, enjoyable read. This one started off ok then just kept getting worse. The book is a series of 4 different stories of New York Women. The first story wasn't that bad. But the second story was a total waste of time reading. I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. I did not like the style of how that story was written either. It was just weird. I am onto the third story now, only a few pages into it and so far it has started out as bad as the second story. I hope her other books are better than this one. I wouldn't waste your time reading this book unless maybe you got it for free!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As a huge fan of \\"Sex and the City\\", I was so looking forward to reading this book. The first \\"novella\\" about Janey, was painstakingly boring. I found it impossible to sympathize with her character, and the ending was pat and unsatisfying. The other three stories were a little better, the last one about the nutjob princess being the most interesting of the book. Being a native Californian, I found the author's descriptions of New York society lifestyle very amusing and curious. Overall it was interesting enough for me to finish it, but it left me somewhat disappointed and unfullfilled."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I picked up this book because I was looking for something light and fun. I love the show Sex and the City, and as a single girl living in Manhattan, I thought this would fit the bill.I hated this book. The characters were mostly shallow drug addicts and alcoholics who all thought they were too good to be with anyone who was \\"just a regular guy\\".I actually felt bad for men in NYC after I read this because these characters made all women look like they are trying to be manipulative to get what they want, but ultimately not that smart and not in touch with reality at all.Please do not even waste your money"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Since I don't have cable, I only see Sex in the City when at a friend's house, but I think the show is entertaining and can certainly see why it is popular. Four Blondes, on the other hand, proved to be a difficult read in that I had to discipline myself to finish it. The fourth and last section was the best and is worth reading on its own, but it couldn't make up for the lengthy third section which was the weakest piece in the book with wooden characters, who are difficult to identify with, and an overblown plot.

Didn't finish it and threw it away. Didn't think it was worth bringing back home."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"4 Blondes is written by Candance Bushnell, the creator of Sex and the City, but it's most certainly not the same. Sure, there are similarities, 4 ladies, very different personalities, but do not be fooled, it's just not as good as the original.The novel is broken up into 4 sections, each one dedicated to a different shade of blonde and the woman who the corresponding shade belongs to. When I think back and try to recall all 4 of the ladies names and their stories, I honestly cannot remember the 4th one without a memory jog from the back cover. The first woman, Janey, has the best story in terms of being interesting and the fact that it could end in an unconventional way. However, by the end, I'm disappointed by the Hollywood ending that is meant to be empowering but is completely unrealistic.Which brings me to the next point: suspend reality to enjoy this one as the second story, while it features an empowered and powerful woman, glorifies some behavior that is, well, less than nice. Winnie (the second story feature) is a mean, bitter and obsessive compulsive. So that gets you nice and welcoming for the third story, where, suspend reality please, Princess Cecilia comes in. Yes, a real princess. Being able to connect with the neurotic, spoiled princess is a little difficult.And like I said, I can barely remember the 4th story of woman who's name is never really made clear. Annoying and I loved the novel Rebecca, where you never find out what the main character's name is. That mystery left me in a wonderful delicate suspense. This left me in a state of \\"is this story over yet?\\"While there were some guilty pleasure points, the overall taste left in my mouth was one of \\"meh.\\""},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A cleverly presented book in which each of the 4 blondes has her own 80 or so page short story that moved along at a very breezy pace. This book reminded me of the Jackie Collins stories I enjoyed in the 1980s! Although very witty and well-written, I fear I must be getting old because reading about the excessive sexual behavior and drug use of wealthy, but very shallow charracters, didn't fascinate me as it once did."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book makes me so happy that I am not single, living in New York City. I didn't find this book funny, interesing or entertaining. It is not worth the money to buy and not worth the time or paper to read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"My 16-year-old cousin loved this book and lent it to me. As a 30-yr-old it looked like a sassy read. Boy was I wrong. I read about 1/4 of it and had to stop. I didn't want to waste another moment of my life reading this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought this would be about 4 different women, leading similar lives and how they interconnected. I didn't realize that it was supposed to be separate, disjointed short stories. There was no plot or theme to either story. Each gave the reader some background about the main character ( the blonde), but then it went nowhere. There was no resolution of the plot. I didn't even finish reading the last story because it was going nowhere when I realized that there were only 5 pages left in the book. I knew that the whole book couldn't be saved in the last 5 pages, so I just stopped reading. I read her other book Trading-Up, and it had its own problems but at least it held my interest and told a story. I agree with the other reivewer, I thought that Bushnell probably had little to do with the success of the Sex and the City series."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book for only a couple of euros, which was definitely a good thing. These four stories are good light entertainment, though not much beyond that. Bushnell writes in a very distant style which keeps us from getting to know the characters too well and also prevents the reader getting too absorbed in the story. No big problem, that. Bushnell hasn't really mastered the whole \\"Show, don't tell\\" thing (I suppose that there's not much room for that in a short story), and instead resorts to blunt statements like: \\"Janey was scared.\\" \\"She was usually never this frank.\\" Having said that, she does have a knack for dialogue (not that you would want to associate with anyone who acted the way that her characters do), and there is *some* sort of character development going on. Three stars (actually more like 2.5) - an okay book, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm a fan of &quot;chick lit&quot;, however when I read this book I didn't think it was good at all. The only parts I liked were the smart quotes or one-liners.

I bought it because I am a big fan of the Sex in the City tv show, so I thought I would enjoy a book by Candace Bushnell. Ya right! This book is so boring and has no point at all. In fact I only read half the book and couldn't force myself to read anymore I was so bored. The character development was awful- you don't even care who you are reading about. Honestly I can't think of a book I have read that I hated more!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"HBO's Sex in the City is a great series, so I thought I would pick up this book because the reviews on the back were pretty good. Unfortunately this book is a real failure. I'm a big fan of Barbara Kingsolver who wrote the Bean Trees, Pigs In Heaven, and many other brilliant works. I guess you could call Bushnell a one hit wonder. This book gives you some in depth character depictions of people who aren't really that deep. It rambles, really doesn't have a good writing structure. Every other sentence is in parenthesis. The characters are so shallow and unreal that it's nearly impossible to get through. If you really want to attempt to read it, go to the library. A decent beach read, if you want more sex than cosmo magazine. But hardly worth [price]."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read.The characters are boring, shallow and just plain ugly. The writing is one-note and the reader is left wondering why the author thought anyone would care about such a pathetic cast of characters who mouth hokey dialogue in storylines that are completely static.One has to wonder if someone just threw a pile of cash at Bushnell and told her to write another Sex and the City. Unfortunately, the result is completely charmless. Evidently, someone thought the success of the HBO series and the Bushnell name would be enough to sell this drivel.Even the plots seem dated--the cocaine snorting, the relentless pursuit of the Hamptons lifestyle, the cartoonish studio execs and rich men who use and abuse women. It's hard to tell whether Bushnell isn't much of a writer, or just has nothing worthwhile to say. Frankly, you'd do better to register for a class at Gotham Writers Workshop and read the weekly offerings of the beginners' short story class. You'd be more likely to read something of value there."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"We used this book for our book club reading and we were all disappointed with the book.

Cosmo and Glamour gave it rave reviews.I could stomach it if Bushnell managed to make these characters even somewhat likable, but she didn't. I could have enjoyed it if the author had made pains to invite the reader into her world but instead we are excluded from it. And the stories either ended too abruptly or too neatly.I give her a single star because I thought sections were well written and the book jacket is clever....."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Once again, Candace Bushnell proves her superiority as an observer and as a writer. She accurately picks up on the stereotypes of those personalities which so frequently flourish best in Manhattan and East Hampton. Anyone who hasn't been to these places may not appreciate how dead-on are her portrayals. With a writing style that is spare and distinctive, FOUR BLONDES makes an interesting read. Ultimately, all the heroines in it are empowered, making this is the best kind of post-feminist fiction, thought-provoking without being preachy."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is the worst book ever written. I would rather watch paint dry than read another sentence in this trashy novel. I always finish the books I pick up, but this one was not worth it.

A warning to those looking for a love story in this book, be warned, you won't find it here.Bushnell's satirical take on the lives of the pampered and wealthy of NYC hits it right on the nose and then socks them each in the jaw. If you are a native NY'er (the last of a dying breed) who reads \\"Page Six\\" or waits to see who will be waiting outside on a red carpet anywhere in the city, you know who some of these people are meant to represent, if not then you may be shocked at how whiny and spoiled these 4 Blondes really are (I mean if you married a prince and all he wanted was kids...come that's too easy, right?). Either way, it's a pretty fair representation.The sad part is that people who hate this book are the ones who think rich people live happy little lives just like in the pictures. I really enjoyed peeking behind the curtain and getting a glimpse that no money or fame can substitute for good old fashioned common sense and mutual respect for each other.Everyone can relate to this book since we all have known married or single friends who show one persona and then when the ball drops they are all of a sudden divorced, or depressed or even hitting bottom only to leave us wondering \\"how the heck did that happen?\\"."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm married, do not live anywhere near NYC, watch Sex in the City and was looking for a little tantalizing glimpse into the fabulous single life of Four Blondes.I ran a hot bath, chilled a bottle of wine and settled among the froth and bubbles with Candace Bushnell's nexest book. First mistake. Did not read the Amazon customer reviews. Second: Paid full price for the book. Third: Fell asleep and dropped the $21.00 book in the bath water and had to blow dry the pages to read the last chapter. A waste of trees, bubbles and hot air. The bleak, non-sexy, self-absorbed world Bushnell attempts to glamourize reveals that not only do blondes not have fun, their roots are showing under the bleach. She must know her novel is not amusing, not light and certainly not Sex in the City where at least the chicks have a laugh with their Cosmopolitans. No laughing here. Hard to believe that I was preparing to feel sorry for myself when I started the book and ended up feeling pretty darn lucky to not be beautiful, young, single and blond in NYC. On the other hand, maybe now the general public will understand the difference between Blonde(noun) and blond(adj.) So, hey, there is some redeeming social value.If you want to read about fun steamy sex, dust off an old copy of Valley of the Dolls. Now there is a bathtub read.Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes may do for marital happiness what Fatal Attraction did for fidelity."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Reading Candace Bushnell's new tome, I was transported back to the 1980's and reminded of writers like Jay McInerny, Bret Easton Ellis and Tama Janowitz. Her new collection of stories, &quot;4 Blondes&quot;, is supposedly set in a contemporary setting, but the actions of the majority of her characters (drug consumption, blase sexual attitudes, fascination with celebrity, etc.) feels strangely dated.This said, Ms. Bushnell has a wonderful gift for characterization, and her characters have a wonderful way of not conforming to the reader's expectations of them. My favorite piece in the book is &quot;Platinum&quot;, the story of a social climber turned princess turned disillusioned, pill-popping mess. &quot;Oh my dear, what has happened to you. You're turning into a little Courtney Love&quot; says her gay friend D.W. Her hilarious misadventures are gleefully recounted by Ms. Bushnell in stacatto prose.In &quot;Highlights (For Adults)&quot;, she tells of a jealous New York journalist who logs on to Amazon.com to peruse reviews of her competitors work. If the sales ranking of one of their new books is low, she feels good.If you are a fan of HBO's &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (which was based on Ms. Bushnell's earlier work), you are sure to enjoy the snappy one liners and outrageous situations of &quot;4 Blondes&quot;. If you're looking for serious, biting, New York wit, re-read Fran Lebowitz."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"4 Blondes, the latest book by Candace Bushnell has a lot in common with her mega-hit Sex and the City. Bushnell covers more of the same ground, following shallow New York women-with-attitude who think about nothing but sex, money and designer clothes. Should be fun - but these 4 blondes are almost frightening in their self-absorption. While Sex and the City was a collection of stories gleaned from Bushnell's New York Observer column, it's hard to think of it as just a book - the actresses on the HBO series have breathed such life into the characters it's hard to separate the two. When reading 4 Blondes, you try to take the good will of the TV program with you, but these new women are so frivolous they should be arrested for taking up air.Blonde's worst offender is Janey Wilcox, heroine (and we use the tern loosely) of the first story. Janey is a former model who spends each spring looking for a man with whom to spend the summer in the Hamptons. The man doesn't matter - it's all about the house. While the story could be said to explore the age-old argument of prostitution (in the broadest sense) - is she using him or is he using her - the story isn't about prostitution. It's supposed to be about a modern, quasi-competent woman who has chosen this life. The fact that a modeling fluke solves all her problems is pretty convenient - and doesn't solve the reader's problems in the slightest.The other blondes don't intrigue us either. Winnie Deike, half of a high powered journalism couple, whose husband is an unappealing as she, freaks out when her husband's career doesn't measure up to her fantasies; Cecelia, a spoiled paranoid who is married to a minor royal and an unnamed American writer who decides she's running out of time and goes to London to try to find a husband take up the rest of the novel.By the time you close the book, you wonder, \\"When will these women stop wining? Get a life - your OWN life\\". The underlying text in 4 Blondes is that it's STILL all about the men. In Sex and the City, it was sporty. In 4 Blondes, it's desperate. And since we're throwing our philosophy back to 1950, anybody's mom could tell you, desperate ain't pretty."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have just five words of advice for all you Amazon shoppers: do not buy this book. I mean it. Even if you don't believe me when I tell you how bad it is, and you insist on reading it, don't buy it. Borrow it from a friend or take it out from the library (if you absolutely must). This drivel doesn't even deserve your time let alone your money or shelf space. Judging from this book alone, Candace Bushnell is a horrible author. I've yet to read 'Sex and the City', but I love the show. If that novel is anything like this trash, I'll have no choice other than to stay away. Not only is every character blonde, Bushnell must have run out of ideas because every character is either a model, an actor, a writer, or a business person. Oh, and they're all addicted to cocaine, like it's normal to be carrying around a vial of coke. It's sick, really.As you may or may not be aware, 'Four Blondes' is not a novel about (as the title suggests) four blonde friends (much like 'Sex and the City'). Rather, it's four short stories about four different blondes. The first two stories are complete wastes of time. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't even bother with those two. Even if you've already taken the time to take the book out from the library. Of course, if you've taken the time to visit the library and pick this trash up, you've obviously decided against heeding my advice anyway, in which case, you may as well go ahead and continue to ignore me. The second two stories arn't much better than the first, but I found them to be the lesser of two (or in this case, four) evils.The first story is about an ex-model named Janey Wilcox. She's a manipulative sleaze who cares about no one except herself. She also loves using men for their summer homes in the Hamptons, and doesn't care if she dispises these men, she'll still sleep with them. Janey is shallow, vain, and wants to do \\"something\\" with her life (here's an idea, get a job you trashy, evil woman). She loves ruining other people's lives and then expects them to, not only care, but actually come running to her aid when she's managed to dig herself into a situation she could have avoided if she was a decent human being. She hates her sister, Patty, because Patty's successful, happy, and a good person. I liked Patty. Usually, arn't readers supposed to like the primary, rather than the secondary, characters?The second story is about Winnie and James Dieke. They're a married couple who never should have gotten married in the first place. You think Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson are a match made in I-can't-believe-how-unbelievably-stupid-spoiled-and-annoying-we-are Heaven? Well, then you've never been introduced to the Diekes. They're both journalists and, basically, they hate each other. Winnie is over-controlling, and wants desperately to be successful and famous, whilst James has basically given up on life and is annoyingly frightened of everything. He's a wimp, a pushover, and an all around lazy guy. He's terrified that Winnie will leave him (oh, how will he go on without her telling him how to put on his socks!?), but she won't because she's still determined that being married to him with further her career. Oh, did I mention they have a son? Probably not, since they basically pay him no attention, and his name is never even mentioned in their story. What great people the Diekes are!The third story is about Princess Cecelia. She's a self-absorbed snob who acts horribly to everyone, even her husband, Hubert. She seems to think she's head and shoulders above everyone else in the world because she's managed to marry the Prince of Luxenstein. She's basically insane. No, seriously. She's completely paranoid and is convinced her family is trying to kill her. She treats her husband like scum, even though he does absolutely nothing wrong. She's jealous of every other woman who's ever been in Hubert's life, and is convinced he's having an affair. She relies on other people for, basically, everything. And, even when they're trying to help her, she's discustingly rude. She does whatever she wants, whenever she wants, and when she doesn't get her way she complains about it and acts like an idiotic snot.The last story is the shortest, which is unfortunate because it's the least offensive of the lot. It's about a journalist who refers to herself simply as \\"grasshopper\\". She writes for a magazine, answering women's questions about sex. She's been sent to England to compare the sex-lives of Londoners with those of New Yorkers. She basically meets a lot of different people, has different conversations with both men and women, and picks up a lot of different veiwpoints on different ideas and beliefs. This story isn't funny, but it's hilarious compared to the first three (in case you were thinking this entire book was going to be a \\"laughfest\\").Well, I obviously don't recommend this book, as I've made perfectly clear. If I had to (and by that, I mean, if I was forced at gunpoint, because there's no other way I'd ever willfully open this garbage again) read it again, I think I'd start from the end. That way, if I somehow died halfway through, I wouldn't have had to read those first two again. I'm going to warn you all one more time: STAY AWAY!THE FINAL VERDICT: 10%"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Before I purchased this book, I read a few of the customer reviews here on Amazon.com. The harsh, negative tone of almost every review I read surprised me. I usually like - or at least find something good in - most of the books I read. Because of this, I thought to myself, \\"This book can't be THAT bad, \`Sex and the City was alright' this one can't be much worse...\\" Guess what? \\"Four Blondes in worse than \\"Sex and the City,\\" a lot worse.I'm under the suspicion that Candice Bushnell simply does not know much about writing fiction. \\"Sex and the City\\" worked because it was a freewheeling collection of her columns based on (supposedly) true events. But Bushnell's doesn't have the ability to be effective in anything more than small doses: elements of fiction such as plot, character development and natural dialogue elude her.As many previous reviewers said, Bushnell gives us no reason to like - or care the least bit about - any of her characters. For example, the first story is about gold-digging model with few likable characteristics. In the last few pages it looks that this girl is going to give up her gold-digging ways and become a realtor. This would have been an acceptable ending. Instead, Bushnell has her character luckily get some big time modeling contract and all her monetary problems are solved.Bushnell wants us to be happy for this character for finally \\"making it\\" on her own even though the author doesn't give us any reason at all about why we should like her. This is amateurish writing. Sorry to give away the ending of the first story, but if that makes you feel less inspired to read this book, I'll have done you a favor. Don't read this book, it really is that bad."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"It's a Jackie Collins novel without a plot. I'm sure Bushnell has a point to make somewhere but the novel is so unengaging you just can't be bothered to think too much about it once you're done.If you haven't read it, don't. Rent Sex and the City instead of reading any of Bushnell's novels and you'll have done yourself a huge favour."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I don't know what possessed me to finish this book, which showed its vacuity within the first 10 pages. The characters are one-dimensional (not to mention sad and pathetic), nothing happens to them to transform them from their sad and pathetic states, and the most I can say I learned from this book is a greater understanding of the social dynamics of the Hampton Jitney.If you already have a negative opinion of the Botox and Beemers set, this book will only reinforce it. Makes one wonder how Bushnell could've been the one behind \\"Sex and the City.\\" Whatever made that series click is totally absent here."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A quick read of the reviews here has me wondering what the other readers were expecting from this book. Bushnell writes (or has been known to write, I guess) for the New York Observer. It'd be a tall order to line up expectations of literary ingenuity or deep mystique about the characters that 4 Blondes is about. Three of the four leads are single, all live in NYC, and all socialize with (or aspire to socialize with) the type of people who read or appear in High Society sections of leading dailies.This is a novel of manners with no manners, pop literature that smartly captures the mores and obsessions of our times and does so with wit, insight and a lot of unshackled talk about sex. We read about enough penises to make Philip Roth blush.It's a snappy, quick breeze through modern urban pop culture. And yes, there ARE people like this in all megapolis urbanscapes of the world, from NYC to Tokyo. And it makes no pretense of being otherwise. Which makes for a fabulous fun if you don't suffer from a Moralizing Itch."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I must agree with the majority on this one. It has to be the worst book I've ever read in my life.I made the mistake of buying a used copy online without reading any of the reviews first. Of course, I'm thinking, &quot;Hey, she wrote SATC, she's gotta be pretty good&quot;. But, oh, was I ever wrong! Now I know why the book itself was only sold for 89 cents and I SERIOUSLY regret paying the S&amp;H for it. What a waste!!Don't think I've ever been unable to finish a book, but I just couldn't torture myself with this literary garbage any longer. I never made it past the 2nd part about Winnie. I was so disgusted with the first character, Janey, and I HATED the way the second part was written.I just received a copy of Bushnell's 'Trading Up' as a part of an online book club and I returned it immediately. If I didn't like Janey in 4 Blondes, I'll hate an entire book about her upper-class wannabe lifestyle. Hello, she's a shallow, self-absorbed prostitute!!!Please, I beg you, don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"You love HBO's Sex &amp; the City, and maybe you've read the book or even Bushnell's Observer columns. With Bushnell's Blondes you get what you paid for: A light interesting read with quirky characters set against a glamorous but sharp edged backdrop. The first and second stories have some substance and keep your attention - then just when you think Bushnell might actually have a message, bam, an easy ending. The third and fourth stories seem like she just tossed something off to meet her 100,000 word contract.In the end, though, the stories are light and fun - perfect for reading at Sag Main Beach and sparking conversation with the crew from your summer share."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The new tales from author Candace Bushnell, pick up right where she left-off. While this isn't a sequel to &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (which, I might add is WONDERFUL) it has the same tone and demeanor. These tales of New York City women and their lives are filled with sex, money, and well.....being shallow. Yes, these are the shallowest bunch of people I have ever read about. And, I loved it. It's the perfect way to escape into a world that very few of us will ever realize or experience. This hip and wealthy world of New York celebrity is full of ego's and the people who &quot;rule the world.&quot; While this isn't the BEST book I've ever read, (it's divided into sections with different characters) I found it exciting and a delightful and naughty treat. Recommend for the less adventures readers. It's not difficult but, fun all the same."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I found most of this book very good with a few exceptions. It is definitely just for fun and not an excellently written book! I love Sex & the City and enjoyed a couple of the characters in this one. I would definitely read Candace's next book! It's a guilty reading pleasure."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Dreadfully disappointing. I love the HBO series, SEX & THE CITY, and assumed that it was a reflection of Candace Bushnell's writing. How wrong I was! These four are neither sophisticated nor witty. Instead they are smug, judgemental and utterly devoid of warmth or empathy. I know that casual sex exists, and I am mature enough to know that this doesn't automatically result in blindness or punishment by God. I also know that major cities are populated by fashionistas. (I live in Chicago myself -- a wonderful, completely alive city that these four would only fly over en route to LA.) But what I have seen in my own life, and on the HBO series, as well, is that attractive, hip women who unabashedly enjoy sex with men also enjoy friendship with other women. No one in this book actually LIKES anyone! What a depressing quartet to have spent time with! Camaraderies seems as foreign to them as shopping at Sears. The only entertainment I got was figuring out that Diane Moon/Courtney Love connection. Still haven't a clue as to who Tanner is. (Jack Nicholson? Nah. These four would make fun of him for being bald and paunchy.)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"If you want to read a book for it's literary quality, this book is not for you. If you want to read a book that reads the way you think (but never would admit it), than this book is it. Bushnell builds up the characters enough to make the reader hate them and ends each novella with just enough to make you pity the respective blonde. I would've liked to find out more about James' secret obsession with the anus, though. Witty and introspective into lives none of us know, or admit we know, this book is nothing more than a fun read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was very excited when I bought this book, as I am a huge fan of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, but after getting only halfway through the book I had to stop. The characters in these stories are shallow and stale caricatures of real women. They are selfish and empty, and wander through Bushnell's weak storylines without any real purpose or ultimate goal. The language Bushnell uses is too crude for my taste, and really paints a bleak portrait of life in general. Honestly, I was a little depressed after reading this book and had to wonder how anyone could go through life like these four women and the various men that inhabit their worlds. If you enjoy the strong female friendships and witty banter in &quot;Sex and the City&quot; then don't buy this book, it will only be a waste of your time and money."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This was a book that had funny, sad, happy, and yes at times (more often then not) raunchy tales of four blondes. I skimmed over half of it. The characters where shallow, self absorbed, and unlikable. I really enjoyed Sex In The City, but this one really let me down. It will be a long time before I pick up another one of her books."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I so wanted to like this book. At first I did. Like the supermarket tabloids that detail the downfalls of the rich and famous, you can relish feeling superior to the shallow model of the first story, Janey Wilcox, who will endure any humiliation in the interest of mooching a Hamptons summer. As someone who hates the Hamptons and everything they stand for, this story was at first gratifying. However, here, as in two of the other stories, the writer fails to provide a believable resolution -- things happen, but the character doesn't really change, or if she does, superficially, it's only in a way she should have figured out long before her age of nearly 35 -- don't be dependent on a man. Duh. Not exactly a stunning insight.I also relished, at first, the portrait of the phony upper west side liberal couple, Winnie and James. [...]-- snobbish, judgmental, \\"for\\" poor people and blacks, though they know none outside their Jamaican nanny. Hoping for a Tom Wolf-like skewering of these typical elitists, I thought, I could read a whole book on these people. Unfortunately, the author does not pursue the more interesting theme of their essential political hypocracy, but drags the story down to the level of not very believable sex. James \\"happens\\" to have a former roommate who is now a movie star. Winnie has an affair with him, for vague revenge for her husband's wimpiness. James likewise has an affair with a young vixen who turns out to be rather a gross-out. At least the woman had the better time, but the story failed to resonate, because, well, wouldn't these people have cheated on each other long ago? And in Candace Bushnell's world, does adultery even matter? An interesting premise that went nowhere.The third piece, which I took to be a take off on Caroline Bisset and JFK Jr., was so badly written I can't even believe an editor didn't take it in hand and redo it herself. It just rambles on aimlessly, dropping designer label names, cigarettes, drugs. No characterization at all. Read like a really early rough draft. Again -- no consistency to the characters, an interesting idea that wasn't developed into anything.The last piece was more like her old newspaper column than an actual story -- funny little tidbits on British men, vs. Americans. You could take it at it's own level, which was light, and at least you had the gratification of her hooking up with a romance at the end.Overall, the existence of this book is a reflection on how greedy the publishing industry is to capitalize on temporary fame. They should have demanded the author write a real book. I really wish Bushnell had the talent and patience to be this century's Edith Wharton. [....]"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I LOVE the TV series, &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; Sharp wit, tight editing, a bit of profundity. How did this smash hit come from Candace Bushnell??? There must be some highly-paid scriptwriters working overtime.Four Blondes is a bomb. It is not easy to express how BAD it really is. The writing is below par, the first character so sad and pitiful that the reader fears it may be autobiographical. Unless you're compiling a &quot;Worst Books I've Read,&quot; list, leave it on the sale table. Guess why its there!Confession time: I couldn't even finish it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"It must have been a fit of madness that led me to check \\"Four Blondes\\" out of my local library (& thank goodness I didn't BUY it!). Actually, I was under the spell of one of the only shows I watch on TV, \\"Sex & the City\\". I truly should have known better.\\"Four Blondes\\" (or, as I prefer to call it, \\"Four Bores\\") is four novellas about four self-absorbed New York women & their various \\"dilemmas\\" regarding love & career. Now, the average reader out there would probably think that rich, beautiful New York women who are variously: 1) a model 2) a famous op/ed writer married to a famous journalist 3) an American-born beauty married to a Prince 4) a thinly disguised Candace Bushnell herself would have few dilemmas, much less reason to whine. After reading the novellas, the reader doesn't see any reason to change their mind. The so-called heroines are so unlikeable that the reader really doesn't care whether or not the \\"problems\\" get resolved. The second story (about the famous op/ed writer) was so pointless that I didn't bother reading more than 10 pages or so, & the third story (the Paranoid Princess) just made me want to slug the protaganist. Hard.In addition to writing about people who have no reason to take up space on this planet, Bushnell airs a few of her own hang-ups. Every story somehow works in references to the derriere & it's possible uses.... Politically correct it's not. Nice it's not. Interesting it's not. A waste of paper & time it is. Don't bother!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I found this book a chore to get through. In all fairness to the author, it was loaned to me by a friend who loved it, so there must be an audience out there she is reaching. But I'm not a part of it.The book comprises four stories, one about a model who spends her springs scouting out men who can give her a summer in the Hamptons (though as we're told several times throughout the book, the Hamptons are dead), one about a yuppie couple with marital difficulties, one about the American wife of a European prince, and one about a writer who goes to London to check out the men there. All four women are shallowly drawn; the only facets of their personalities that come across are their self-absorption and their fascination with sex. Since the character who is a writer is a sex columnist this last makes sense in her case, but otherwise it becomes both boring and annoying. None of the four are likable; none of them learn anything; and all of them are rescued -- if you can call it that -- in contrived endings. This book was advertised as a satire and as a social commentary, but it's a snooze."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is NOT a chick lit book! This is not fun, light, fluffy, or empty. It is about women and their demises and in a few stories, their uprises. This is not the usual fluff that most female writers are pushing down our throats. These characters are not here for you to &quot;like&quot;, there is no mindless blab of labels, designers etc, listed off just to show the author has fashion sense. The reason this book was panned by so many is because they thought this was a fun chick lit book. The characters are deep and for each novella inside the book, the writing style changes to depict the personalities of the new character(s). I loved each one. Sure it was disheartening and a little depressing at times, but everyone loves a good drama once in awhile! Surely a welcome break from the Valley Girl meets New York fashion list books with mindless dribble and emotionless fashion columnists running around in Monolos. The mention of Manolos in this book actually had importance to the plot.Loved it! read it twice!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Witty and delicious. Never watching an episode of Sex and the City I decided to take an interest and try a book by the author. Definitely entertaining. It gives the reader an inside look of romantic intrigues among the elite. The book is split into four sections each with a different story about a beautiful blonde woman- a model, a columnist, a socialite, and a writer- as they face turning points, each must deicide among her passions. The reader sympathizes with each woman no matter what trouble they enter into."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I loved this book and am a bit mystified that so many other readers have slammed it the way they have! I think I can go someway to clearing this up - this book is a satire, folks! A satire that's as sharp and as vicious at dissecting the lives of the super-rich Manhattan glitterati as Bret Easton Ellis' American Pyscho was a decade earlier. Anyone who read Sex And The City (read the book, NOT the TV show which paints an entirely different picture) would know what to expect here. The fact that we care at ALL about these people goes some way to explaining Miss Bushnell's superior skills as a writer and moralist. This book is fun and ultimately, very, very dark! I keep picking it up ever since I first read it (Blonde 2 Winnie Dieke was my favourite) and I wait for baited breath for her next novel. Superb."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Not a bad way to spend an afternoon......if you're bored and have nothing better to do, this book will suffice as light entertainment.

I came across it when a coworker found it in the trash (it's rightful place), and we decided to form a joke book club around it. Even as a joke, however, we couldn't get halfway through the second story. This book is unbearable.But lest you assume that this is the opinion of some \\"moralizing\\" Puritan who can't handle the subject matter...It's not the floozy New York social scene or graphic sex that's the problem here. It's that if you're going to write about these subjects - or any subject - for God's sake, make it coherent! And interesting. Ms. Bushnell manages to make even cheap sex as boring and unreadable as a vacuum cleaner manual translated from Chinese.As for the writing itself, your average high school student could do a better job... over a weekend, if they had flunked 2 grades, were high on inhalants and learned English from watching Beavis and Butthead. It's not that this book isn't literary - it's not even literate.What Candace seems to have done is to capitalize on the success of Sex & the City with a sick joke on the book-buying public: to see if it's possible to scrawl off a trashy, unfinished and unedited outline for a book (complete with notes to herself still in the text and typos galore), publish it without ever bothering to write the book itself, and challenge people to buy it. Well, you did, in droves, and you've made Candace rich. She thanks you!I'll say one thing for her though: she seems to know her subject matter well. Only hard core booze binges and a serious cocaine habit could explain this book and its publication.I am now happily returning 4 Blondes to the trashcan where it was found."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought I was a fan of Candace Bushnells because of Sex and the City, but this book was a waste of time.

So, while they were playing in the lake, I would read the book, too. After the trip, I checked it out from the library. I read a few more chapters and turned it in by the due date. Then 7 months later, I finally checked it out again to finish it. It was all right. I have never seen \\"Sex and the City\\" on HBO, so I am not used to Candace Bushnell's writing style. I was surprised at all the profanities in the book and immoral, shallow, druggie women, but for some reason, I came back to read more. The worst chapter was about Winnie and her husband James, I think. It was so annoying how Candace OVER used (parentheses) and very short sentences in that chapter. And is it me, or is she a terrible writer? Plus, all these blondes were pretty much the same type of people! I don't care about the fact that they packed Prada shoes in a Gucci bag. Whatever! So, I suggest you check this out from a friend or your local library before buying it... unless you're a fan of Sex & the City. In that case, you'd probably enjoy the book more than I did."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"When I picked up this novel, I expected it to be a flimsy summer read, containing no more than girlish fluff that would make time at the beach go by a little faster. I had no idea what I was in for. yes, it was a funny read, with not too much thinking required, but the complexity of the characters kept me intrigued enough to finish the book in one sitting. Its hard to say that I honestly LIKED any of the four women- they arent the kind of gals I would want to hang out with, but what I did like was the transitions each one of them made throughout their novellas. I looked dowm upon Janey's behavior in the first section- but cheered her on as she suceeded in the end. Four Blondes was more than just a book to pass the time- it was well written and more complicated than meets the eye."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell's previous Sex and the City, and the resulting HBO series, propelled her into the public eye. In Four Blondes, she tries to expand her repertoire, while sticking to the motifs that made Sex and the City so popular. The format is simple-- four novellas, each about a woman drifting among New York's moneyed classes, each striving unashamedly to the gratification of a basic desire (the list runs to love, lust, financial comfort and a sense of self). The works are heavily plotted (Wodehouse-ian, musical comedy plotted), and read like a cross between the early 20th C. late realist novelists (a bit too much has been made of the Edith Wharton connection, though both chronicle manners in upscale NY), 60s trash fiction like Jacqueline Susann or Harold Robbins, and the sense of illustration by amusing caricature of Armistead Maupin. Each female lead character seems like an Ellen Gilchrist passionate heroine grasping for fulfillment. But all the literarey references are really a bit beside the point (indeed, one of the amusing ways in which Ms. Bushnell shows her own self-awareness is by having her own characters reflect on their reflection in two other &quot;similarities&quot;--the works of Bret Easton Ellis and the movie &quot;All About Eve&quot;).I do not typically enjoy the &quot;god isn't my social clique interesting&quot; form of semi-autobio fiction. Heaven knows that some of the particularly dreary assumptions about life without huge sums of money seem to be not only afflictions of the characters, but also of the author, which would ordinarily turn me off. One can't help but miss in this book of virtues a few of the middle class virtues not displayed in great profusion by the folks portrayed here--humility and altruism come to mind. But it's undeniable that Ms. Bushnell has worked her particular form of genre fiction into something that transcends the Valley of the Dolls influences that permeate her work. Is this great literature? Absolutely not. Is this an entertainment? Absolutely. This is not uproariously funny, though it has some witty bits. Instead, this is a fluid read about odd people who, on reflection, may not be as odd as one initially thought. I read an interview with Ms. Bushnell in which she termed &quot;pathetic&quot; a reviewer who had dared to term these women protagonists &quot;pathetic&quot;. But, really, it appears to me that Ms. Bushnell shows not only the exuberance but also the thread of pathos in us all, and that's something the 60s trash novelists did not accomplish nearly so well. This is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have been a fan of Sex and the City for quite a while, so I decided to give this book a try, hoping it would hold my interest for a bit... I was not dissappointed!Finding a good stopping point was rather difficult, as each page developed a new twist to the story.This book did not sugar coat any aspect of human, in particular female, nature: obsession with looking good, being successful and popular, and having money, lots of it! As much as we try to deny it, these thoughts circulate in our minds, but almost no one ever has the guts to say it all, exactly how it is...In this book Candace B. does exactly that, boldly and with an amazing sense of humor and sarcasm at all of this.If sex is not something you would prefer to read about, this is not for you. Otherwise, this book is time and money well-spent. Can't wait for the next book from this fabulous (and gorgeous) author!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I can't say that I am a fan of Candace Bushnell, but I did enjoy Sex in the City, so I was intrigued enough to read this book. Seeing as how the first novel was so good, it was truly hard to follow, and unfortunately, this follow up wasn't all that great.Four Blondes brings us the stories of four women. The only one that I truly found mildly interesting was the first one involving Janey Wilcox, a former model who is constantly looking for a man to support her and take her to the Hamptons for the summer. It was mildly humorous and she was, by far, the most interesting character of the four.I can see how Bushnell was trying to continue with what worked for her in her other novel with the four main characters, but I honestly could have done without the other three. In fact the last woman doesn't even have a name, and her story was so short, I felt as if this section was just put in to make the quota of four.As always, her language and writing style was very crisp and clear. The storylines were alright, considering the actual length of them. However, the character development could have used some work.On the whole, the book is not as bad as some of the other reviews on here, and I am hoping that Winnie Deike would approve of my on-line review (see the story on blonde #2 to get that joke). Although it was a fairly entertaining read, Four Blondes did fall somewhat short of my expectations."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have to say I was truly disappointed with Candace Bushnell's 4 Blondes. Yes, I read it until the end to make sure it never got better and trust me, its just not worth it. The characters are such shallow and rare beings that if you don't \\"know these people\\" already, you'll never want to. What I liked least about the book is that as you read about the lives of each woman, you'd expect an ending that was clear and that made sense; expect some kind of finalization. Each of the four parts of the book was cut off before readers got a sense of how the lives of the characters would turn out. Will the characters continue cheating on their partners? Will they get divorced? Do they ever find happiness? Do they accept their lives the way they are? These are things you'd expect to learn after reading the pretty lousy tales but all the stories just end- suddenly- with little indication as to what will follow. I have shelves of books better than this one. If I had the chance, I wouldn't waste my time on it again."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Sorry, but this book does not even warrant a One Star rating. It was a big waste of my money and my time, and reading is one of my favorite pastimes. Not only does everything jump around, but the author's constant use of parentheses and/or all capitals to make a point, really really made it hard to concentrate on the story (if you could call it a STORY) LOL."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Why is it that Bushnell's characters are inevitably and mind-numbingly devoid of any warmth, kindness or likeability?I didn't take to ANY of these (horrible, vitriolic) women; they were all shallow and vain and self absorbed and NOTHING AT ALL like my fabulous self. (A wee joke.) Who wants to read about thoroughly flaky women with completely skewed perspectives on life? Ugh. I'd rather watch paint dry.This was excruciating and I actually found myself angry and annoyed while reading it. Who needs the aggravation?Kbye."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Four Blondes&quot;. It's a fun book to read, but I think it also says a lot about our times. Some may think the book is shallow, but I don't think so at all. Whether or not it was intended to be, it's a social commentary on the times we live in. I think it's definitely more geared toward a female audience, but men might find it interesting if they are curious about the way women think.Even in this post-feminist era, women still seem to be looking for happiness in a man. Candace Bushnell's book shows us the folly in that path. The women are happier when they are independent and take care of themselves.The book is also very funny."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As I read Candace Bushnell's work I feel inspired and depressed at the same time. She focuses on the paradox of the outwardly talented, attractive and well-connected woman who at the same time, hasn't been brought up to know herself outside of the Cinderella/Sleeping Beauty fantasy and maybe never will. I did not find Four Blondes &quot;hysterical&quot; (as the jacket said I would) but the stories brought up, in Candace's typically breezy style, many of the issues I and other friends of mine have faced as single girls in 90's Manhattan. I love the flashes of insight I get when I read her writing, into myself and people I know.Candace does not seem to be looking to shock or entertain, just describe. Her stories (or rather, extended observations) do not contain situations of tension and release, discovery of life's purpose or transformation of personality. Atypically (from the usual fiction written for/about women) her characters do not feel pressure to change from within but mainly focus on how to get more of what they want, clueless about what to do in the areas of their life most lacking. Through it all, Ms. Bushnell does not try to steer her characters into an honorable direction. They can be self-centered and hopelessly superficial, yet she does not judge them and their choices but instead sticks to portraying them truthfully, with all their warts. Though she writes with a light hand and hip dialogue, her characters come through seeming at once powerful and sad."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"i love sex and the city as much as the next person and was pretty excited about reading this book, but when i did, what a surprise i got...not only was it shallow, but depressing and rather boring. the only thing in its favor is that it's a quick read. the stories continually portray women as helpless floozies who have no other cares than men. i'm far from a staunch feminist, but after i while i got totally sick of the reiteration of patriarchal standards. don't waste your money, just stick to watching the series"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"But I settled on throwing it in the trash instead, literally. Reprehensible characters and a writing style completely devoid of any imagination. How on earth did this get published? I don't know what social circles Ms. Bushnell is in, but I haven't met any woman who would prostitute herself in order to spend a summer at the Hamptons. Ms. Bushnell, you are &quot;soooo over.&quot;"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"...of an author who must've won her book contract in a sweepstakes. With so many promising and aspiring writers out there, I cannot believe she continues to receive the support of a publishing house."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought that this would be an easy, light-hearted read, but it SO was not. It was easy, but one of the most dysfunctional books I have ever read. Maybe because I don't snort cocaine, drink obsessively, or whore around I didn't really feel the book.The first and fourth stories were easier to read and laugh at some of the character's actions. The second and third stories were full of pain and hate...something I don't find fun to read about. The characters in these two stories brought out physical feelings of disgust.Not a light, easy summer read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"4 Blondes is three novellas and a short story about the beautiful and aspiring women in New York City. The cast of characters also include those who admire, lust for, marry, and earn a living from these blonde goddesses. Each of the four women has defined herself in terms of social position, physical goods, appearance, and how others relate to her. They each lack a core of who they are, as defined by their own inherent natures. In these stories, the women get what they think they want . . . and are disappointed in many ways. Life really begins when they move beyond their initial illusions to create a more appropriate direction for themselves. Many will find a peek into the minds and boudoirs of these women appealing, but few will find them sympathetic. It is that lack of sympathy that makes the book far less appealing than its potential to please the reader.The book's subject is graphically portrayed by the large image of Ms. Bushnell on the back of the dust cover. Seeing her and her credentials, you immediately know that she is writing about the real people she meets in her social activities and writing work.A number of my friends have inhabited this world at various times. Although the satire may seem broad, it isn't as broad as it would first appear. I remember being told about a well-known woman reporter who would not go out on a date until she had seen a balance sheet for the man in question that proved that his net worth was at least five million dollars.New York has long been the capital of attention for those who aspire to be rich, famous, thin, and admired. This book needs to be compared to Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, because it is the female version of that same subject.Of the stories in the book, I enjoyed Nice N'Easy by far the most. Janey Wilcox comes closest to being a whole person among the four heroines in the book. She is trying to find what she wants, and is a little confused about the best way to get things. But she persists, and emerges to a new plateau of maturity and effectiveness. If the whole book had captured that level of character progression, I would have rated it at four stars.Single Process is a short story that had great potential, but left it unrealized. Ms. Bushnell has focused primarily on making jokes about English men, and creating a fairy tale. As far as she goes, the story works. To have worked better, she should have steered a little closer to reality and defined London as something more than anti-New York.Platinum is simply a joke about being a real princess. This novella would have worked much better with a lot of editing down of the story.In all four stories, Ms. Bushnell gives you lots of details about various psychological disorders, drug addiction, unpleasant sexual practices, and various forms of humiliation. She would have done better to focus on fewer dysfunctions and portrayed them better. The way these are written, the reader is assumed to have had first-hand experience with most of these practices. Such a reader would be unusual in my experience outside of the social circles being described here.For those who don't like to read about extreme forms of depravity, skip this book.On the other hand, her prose is well crafted and moves the stories along smoothly. She knows her subject. So if you think of this book as a longer version of tabloid writing, you will like it very much. I suspect that those who will like 4 Blondes best are readers who will take the fictional characters and ascribe them to a real celebrity, and feel excited about knowing the inside scoop on these people.After you finish reading these stories, I suggest that you step back a bit and look at yourself in the mirror. Who do you see? Does it matter who you see? How does it make you feel to see yourself? Then change your perspective, and think about what the mirror would show if it reflected your inner self. Draw a picture of that new image. Keep it in mind!Pursue worthy goals in worthy ways!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was better suited for a magazine article. Each story was more boring than the previous one. These women were either bimbos or bores. The first story was so-so with a quick, wrap-it-up ending. The second was silly and dull, and by the time I got to the third one I was forcing myself to read. I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"More tripe from Bushnell, who makes Tama Janowitz (the woman with big hair who wrote Slaves of NY) seem like Tolstoy. Reading about the shallow inner lives of people who dwell on the fringes of the rich and famous makes us feel good about ourselves-- we may not have the house in the Hamptons or know Brad Pitt, but at least we're happy. It's a style, and Bushnell has got it down pat. Three of the stories are readable in a &quot;thank God that's not me&quot; kind of way. The fourth, about a married writer, is sort of sad-- it almost seems as if Bushnell is jabbing back at all the &quot;serious journalists&quot; who think she's some fluffy little slut. In the autobiographical final story, I couldn't help but wonder (as I often did with her NY Observer columns): &quot;If you know better-- and you obviously do-- why do you keep hanging out with all these pathetic status-obsessed losers?&quot; While it's sometimes a fun read, this book does not give us the answers."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A collection of four loosely linked stories featuring, as the title pronounces, four blondes. The blondes in question are Janey Wilcox (\`Nice \`n Easy'), a model who isn't famous enough to call her own shots so she spends most of her time looking for a rich man to take her to the Hamptons every summer; Winnie (\`Highlights'), a brainy columnist who has begun to hate her journalist husband for not being successful enough; Cecilia, (\`Platinum') a model who marries a European prince and is terrified he's going to leave her; and lastly, an unnamed blonde journalist (\`Single Process') who trolls London looking for a man because she's positive that English men have got to be better than American ones.It's the ultimate in satire as well as a disturbing look into the many people who really do live such vapid, meaningless, extremely superficial existences, but who are at least sensible enough to be aware of and frightened by their own lack of substance. Bushnell is also the author of Sex and the City, but don't let that turn you off (as it did me, initially). I haven't read the book SatC, but after reading this I'd be willing to bet that the few bits I've seen of the t.v. show don't even begin to do the book justice, because Bushnell is absolutely brilliant, scathing and right on the mark when pegging these desperate, pathetic, yet somehow occasionally likeable women. Strange as it may sound, her writing style immediately put me in mind of Bret Easton Ellis, particularly Rules of Attraction and Less Than Zero. Bushnell's wit and timing is razor-sharp, and I was very pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As a voracious reader I feel qualified to say that this was an unreadable book and I did not finish it. The characters were ones that I could not care about and the book, in general, made me wonder how the really terrific television series could possibly have been based on the writing of this author. I then read Sex and the City and decided that the author had very little to do with the series."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"You get four mini-novels here, each featuring a NY City blonde. The first blonde's story reads like chick lit with extra sex thrown in. Janey parlays her looks, her 15-minutes-of-fame, and sexual favors to gain a male with a summer house in the Hamptons each year. It's a peek into the world of NYC's rich and famous and the wannabes, like Janey, and titillating enough to keep one guiltily reading.The other stories feature a columnist disappointed in her husband's status, a socialite overwhelmed by the position she worked so hard to achieve, and a writer sampling London society and British men's sexual ability while researching an article.A thoroughly gossipy glimpse into high-powered big city lives. Some of the endings wrap up too quickly, solving the blonde's problems rather simplistically with a sudden infusion of cash (or of a man with cash). Fun reading anyway."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I can't believe I wasted my money and time reading this piece of crap called literature. It does not deserve to be published. It's full of rubbish. The characters were not likable, they were selfish, self-absorbed and snobby. Candace Bushnell does not know how to write. She uses (...), millions of times for no point, in trying to be funny, it was not funny. I suggest avoiding all her books, no matter how much acclaim the show, Sex & the City receives. Her books fail to measure up to the show. Avoid this book at all costs!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I fell helplessly in love w/ that series. The girls felt like my extended girlfriends. I could connect with them on so many levels. But not here! I am not a blonde, but please tell me that my hair color is not the only thing to keep me totally enthralled. The characters were really too dumb & too shallow. I can't imagine anyone thinking like these four blondes did on a regular basis. I was looking for some bubblegum for the brain here & some laughs. I saw glints of Bushnell's humor & spicy wit, but felt my bubblegum had been scraped off from under a subway seat somewhere!Sorry, folks- I do hate do be a downer, but there's no way to compare this w/ S&TC.; If you're still led to venture into it, buy a used copy & forget this same author introduced us to Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, & Samantha!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I found Candace Bushnell's writing style scattered, awkward, and at times difficult to follow.

Taken as a whole I'd have to pan the book, but if you break this book down story by story I think you'd find a few that weren't that bad. Except for Winnie and James story.

You feel you know them, can relate to one or all of them. I never got that with these 'Four Blondes.' It just felt empty. I'd suggest reading through it more carefully at the bookstore before buying, or that you borrow it from a friend or the library.

Candace Bushnell's book is a collection of four short stories. The common thread tying the narratives together is that every protagonist is a blonde from New York City.The author employs completely different writing styles in each of the stories. Her characterization and plot development are solid in the first story about Janey Wilcox, a struggling model. But none of the other stories were near impressive. The most unenjoyable of the four was the story told second about the married journalists Winnie and James. The writing in this story was not only hard to follow, it was strange, including parenthesized side notes every third sentence. The third and fourth stories were unmemorable; and the fourth story, about a New York reporter working on a piece in England, seemed hugely out of place in the collection.Bushnell follows the traditional short story structure, ending each narrative soon after its climax. But unlike well-written short stories, these do not have succinct endings that provide insight and finalization. The reader has no idea what has changed about the characters or how their actions will affect them.There is not a single admirable character in the book's 371 pages. All of the characters are shallow and snobby sex fiends, and many of them are drug users. This book does \\"reveal the tarnish beyond the glitz,\\" as one People critic stated. It shows what might really be going on in the life of the \\"it\\" couple or the city socialite. More than anything, the stories proved to me how much I do not desire to be a part of the social groups in a bustling city. I was really disgusted by how petty and superficial most of these scandalous characters were.I picked this book up for a pleasurable Labor Day weekend read and was vastly disappointed. If your time and money are valuable to you, I do not suggest wasting either on 4 Blondes."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Don't waste your money. This book is sold at airportswhere a person like yourself may be desperate to buy somethingto read on a plane. Hmm, same author as\\"Sex and the City\\", which is a very popular and frequently hilarious TV show. Does that mean that Candace Bushnell can write a novel? As I soon learned, emphatically, no. Does that mean that this book has any relationship to a TV show that is written by whole team of other people who may actually be decent writers? Well, your honor, no, not really. Good scam for Ms. Bushnell and her agents. I wonder if she spent more than a week on this. I cannot even imagine how much she got paid.

So, I purchased this book hoping for some feminine insight. Not only was I disappointed in this book, but wasted a good seven bucks I could have spent on an iced mocha latte.

I had purchased it at the last minute before I boarded a plane on a business trip and what a waste of [money]. The characters are self-centered and unrelatable to. There is also never resolution to the situations ( if you can call them that) the characters face. The book outline leads you to believe that they resolve the situation that they are in, but it never happens. Their major concerns in life are still sleeping around for a summer house, and going back to cheating/miserable husbands and taking drugs. The characters never develop, and the women are portrayed kind of like Allie McBeal, needy and doing anything they can to get attention while destroying the people and relationships around them.

The stories seemed to be incomplete, yet I was not left wanting more -- I was just glad that I was one story closer to the end.

The author really missed on this one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"If only I knew what i was getting myself into when I decided to read 4 Blondes by Candace Bushnell. I chose to read this novel with three of my friends as an outside reading requirement for a class. The four of us, being blondes, thought it would be fun to read and do a project on. I was unfamiliar with Candace Bushnell and her tv show, Sex and the City. However, this was not what I was expecting at all, and I cannot begin to express my disappointment and dislike for this book. Each girl was extremely over-dramatic and superficial. Spoiled and helpless, their world was about the size of a pinhead. They seemed unable to live life and appreciate it for what it is. Their worlds revolved around themselves, and consisted primarily of sex, drugs, and men. The book was divided into four parts: the life of each girl. They did not have anything to do with one another, and seemed completely pointless. This is not how life is. The first character introduced is Janey. Her biggest problem in life was finding a new guy each summer to sleep with and live with in the Hamptons. Janey was incredibly shallow and knew nothing of real problems. Each section, though, ended with a bit of hope for the character and their sad lives and issues.This book was easy enough to get through. Some of the stories were so pathetic they were amusing, and others were dreadfully boring. I was unable to identify or compare myself with any of the characters. I find it more interesting when I can relate to a character in a book. It makes the story more appealing and may provide new opinions and outlooks on life.

One of the short stories had its slow parts, but I got threw it. It was the tale of four diffrent blondes, with four diffrent problems or habits in there life. Bushnell didn't hold anything back. She said what she wanted to say about sex and drugs. Some parts were funny some parts were sad. It leave you wondering what the charters are doing now. It almost leaves room for more information but it doesn't. It is a good light book to read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"An easy, entertaining book. If you're looking for something that's fun and not serious, then this is a good choice."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"If I could give this book negative stars I would. I kept forging ahead thinking there must be some redeeming episode, but there was nothing the slightest bit amusing in any of the 256 pages. If I'd read the Amazon reviews I would have known to steer clear of this ..."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book a long time ago, but I just got the opportunity to read it recently. I have to say, one way that I judge a book is how I feel after reading it and whether I could do the same thing. This book had nothing that special about it, and, honestly, after I finished reading it I starting planning my own book (maybe about 4 brunettes?) I thought the characters were pretty annoying, and I thought that after reading the very first chapter of Janey Wilcox's story. I think if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the third one with Princess Cecilia; the story was the most interesting. I gave it three stars because it provided pretty good entertainment for the morning commute, but it is definitely not a book that I will be re-reading and recommending to others (though I do have some friends who would definitely appreciate it)."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I rarely right reviews. However this book was such a disappointmemt I felt compelled. If you're looking for a disjointed, slow read then you will love this. Being an avid reader this was painful to finish. I kept thinking it was going to get better as I've read several of Ms Bushnell's book previously. Yuck what a disappointing mess. It appears as if she wrote the book only to meet an editors deadline without a thought or plan. Just words. I wish I'd saved my $9.99. Trust me don't waste your time or money!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"...You are the FIRST \\"book\\" I never finished. Thank goodness I never paid a dime for this mess, it is essentially awful. The characters in this book are scum of the earth whores, and the men are almost just as horrible. After Highlights I stopped reading, I couldn't put my brain through any more torture.How is it that an author who created the hillarious SATC created such a mind dulling, putrid mess? Was she that desperate for money? If so, she obviously didn't reach her goal with this crap. Every copy should get burned.Stay far away from this book, it will put your brain in a coma and make you feel want to toss your breakfast."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I keep wondering why intelligent hardworking women keep buying books about spoiled over indulged vapid women. I read this book and wanted to put it in the grill during the summer so it would not be inflicted on anyone else. A friend was horrified so I said here, you read it. We have a date to torch the thing together. She too thought it was one of the biggest travesties in written word. Think of all the trees that gave their lives for this minutia. It would be totally forgettable if it were not so horrifyingly bad."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Sex and the City\\" tv series. It was funny, witty and you honestly cared about the characters.Because I liked the show so much, one day I decided to buy a book by Candace Bushnell.The first one I read was \\"One fifth avenue\\". It was....ok.Recently I purchased \\"Four Blondes\\", believing it would be more in the spirit of \\"Sex and the City\\", but much like many other readers, I am glad I only paid one dollar for it. It was so boring and empty that it made me wonder how Candace is such a famous author.All the female characters were deplorable role models, people you feel absolutely no sympathy for. They have no essence.Very little sex, which I believed to be one of her trademarks, judging by Sex and the City, and the little she wrote about, very brief mentions of penetrations and such, were mostly sad and pathetic.I don't hate the book, but wouldn't recommend it to absolutely anyone, and am actually kind of ashamed of placing it in my book shelf, beside great authors like Daniel Keyes and David Nichols.Really, unless you are a die-hard fan of Candace Bushnell, don't waste your time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am a huge fan of Sex and the City, so I started with high expectations. Unfortunately, this was one of the worst books I read in my life. Each story was bland, and there was no real conclusion at the end of each story. When I finished the book I was wishing I spent my time reading something else. These women were neurotic, paranoid, and completely self-absorbed. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Trashy is the best descriptive word I can use for this book. The book is about four women in New York City. They do not intermingle, nor do I think they even know each other, and each woman gets her own section (like a short story). The characters are very unlikeable, whether it was because they were narcissistic, paranoid, or hypocritical.I know this is just chick lit, but it is poorly written chick lit. A character should be someone we are interested in, whether we care about them or hate them, we WANT to know what will happen to them. Maybe it's even someone we relate to. Either way, we have a vested interest. I had none of that with this book. There were also times that I became frustrated with Bushnell's writing style. The conversations were often clunky or awkward.I do not recommend this book, not even for a fun summer read at the beach. There are many more novels out there that can give you simple enjoyment, but without being trashy."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Bought this book at Goodwill and quickly realized that the $2 I paid for it was too much. Read the first story and skimmed the other three. Utterly obnoxious and quite disturbing. Definitely not a relaxing and humorous chick lit read that I was looking forward to."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I should have read reviews before purchasing. I read the first section and then put it down. Even the first section was just ok."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"All I have to say is that I could only make it to page 66, and I took a 3 month break in between all that. Its completely unrelatable, and the \\"sex\\" is disturbing, not sexy. I'm extremely disappointed. Gonna try to get store credit. This only became a best seller because of who she is, not the content of the book. HORRIBLE."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Don't even bother with this book - a total waste of time and money. I quit half-way through. The writing is sophomoric: you know you are reading a bad book when 99% of the book is dialogue, and mindless dialogue at that. The storyline is boring. You'd get a better read from &quot;Teen Beat&quot; magazine. The characters are pathetic. As a huge Sex &amp; the City fan, I was duped into believing this book would entertain me in the same or similar fashion. Bait and Switch!! I guess the flourescent pink cover and the breasty shot of the author should have clued me in."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Here's what you do:Pick up the book (don't BUY it just pick it up)Turn to page 98 (hardcover edition)Under the passage entitled &quot;Winnie's Bad Habit&quot; is a sentence:&quot;Boring and Utterly Pointless&quot;A precise assessment of the book &quot;Four Blondes&quot; if ever there was one....And just so you don't think &quot;sour grapes&quot;...I'm a beautiful blonde from NYC (who hopefully won't have a building collapse on my head after that last remark!)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Each chapter/section was worse than the next. Painful and boring. The final story ended midsentence. Was this a binding error in the edition I bought, or did the author realize the futility and just quit?"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I took this book with me on my European vaca and there was no other item that wasted more space in my luggage, including my oversized polar fleece jacket that wasn't used because the weather cooperated.I will always read a book from cover to cover - to at least give it a chance. I did this for 4 Blondes and never once did I lose the sense of dissatisfaction and distaste.If you have a burning desire to have your intelligence diminished, or wish to be subjected to the sordid and depressing tales of four women who fail to distinguish themselves away from the influence of a man, then by all means, read this book!I left my copy on the ag burn pile in a local Bordeaux vineyard."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"All of the reviewers got it right. This book is awful! Long, boring, repetitive, inane...these stories are not highlights, and they are not entertaining."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was awful. Early in the book I noticed a mistake where the author uses the wrong name for a character. It is where Janey is dating Harold but she mistakenly puts howard in the middle of a paragraph surronder by harold everywhere else. After that I noticed many other small errors to the writing in which I thought \\"Where is the editor?\\" On top of that the book really had no point and seemed unbelievable. I love the series Sex and the City but hated the book Sex and the City. I thought I would read this book and give the author another try but now I am going to just throw away her books as I don't think they are worth passing on to someone."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Like everyone else, I love Sex and the City. I wasn't sure what to think of these four stories, though. I wasn't sure if I wasn't \\"hip\\" enough to get them, or if I was missing their message on some level. On the whole, I didn't like any of the stories, the characters were more annoying than anything, and the worlds they lived in were so over the top I almost thought they verged on unbelievable. There's no doubt Bushnell can create a certain kind of world, I guess I'm just not the kind of person who likes the world she created here. I was left really unsatisfied."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"By the way as a native New Yorker (the greatest city in the world by the way!!!), I know a lot of &quot;smart blondes&quot;.....The characters are well crafted as Candace Bushnell does, it was disappointed in the Janey story, Janey should have got the real estate job and worked her way up to the top seling houses ine which is what i thought was going to happen... all of the sudden she gets a Victorias secret offer and poof! she has her own house in CA... it was good that she bought it on her own and no man bought it for her but would have been better if she worked her way up selling real estate in the Hamptons.....that was a bit disappointing, but maybe that would have been boring"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm in the middle of writing my master's thesis, looking for a job, relocating to another state, working two part-time jobs as well as being a mom and a wife. I needed a light, easy read this summer, and I found it. No, this isn't a thought-provoking, insightful look into human character. If Bushnell's characters lack depth, it's because the characters themselves won't allow themselves depth. They live in superficiality, and I find them to be believable characters. I enjoyed this book. When life settles down and I'm ready for something heavier, I'll turn to Irving, Anne Tyler and those ilk. Four Blondes is fun."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I highly doubt that any of us went into reading this book for its literary content. In that assumption we were correct- this is no Gustave Flaubert or Jane Austen. Nor is it something that will cause you to engage in deep thinking (unless you count casual sex and the Hamptons to be deep thinking material).There are many things this book is not. However, there are many things that this book IS and I will choose to share those with you since other readers have bombarded you with numerous complaints about this book, which by now we are all familiar with. Candace Busnell's \\"Four Blondes\\" IS...1. Full of dry, dark, sexual humor. One has only to look at the characters to see the irony- Janey Wilcox, possibly the most dependant character you will meet in your reading history, who's only goal in life is to find a wealthy man with a huge Hamptons home and an expensive but blonde-friendly car to live with over the summer. Winnie & James Dieke, journalists with celebrity connections, a failing marriage, and a cocaine problem (due to the celebrity connections). Princess Cecilia, obviously the wife of a prince, who is insecure in herself, her position in life, and her marriage (her husband's family wants her to be next Di. No brainer there). Finally you have an anonymous writer in a quest to find an Englishman decent in bed.2. Amusement purposes. This is two of the stars- there are seriously some lines in here that are laugh-out-loud hilarious. Candace Bushnell is the Queen of one-liners. However, for all the humor and amusement that these pitiful and pathetic characters provide, the book barely salvages three stars.There are many things this book is not. I did not expect this book to be the greatest read of my life. However, I DID expect more fully developed characters and that is my main complaint with Ms. Bushnell. The characters seriously lacked development in several areas, making them at times too whiny and difficult to relate to. Amusing as they were, and they did have their lucid intervals of genius, I found them not up to par with the standard Bridget Jones, Becky Bloomwood, Jemima Jones.I was especially disappointed in the last of Bushnell's protagonists, the anonymous writer. She was very possibly the best developed character, and I was most unbelievably disappointed when her story was cut far too short. I could have read an entire book about HER instead of one crowded with mini novellas of three other psycopathic women.In short, this book is a guilty pleasure, and a guilty pleasure with a warning sign stamped across the front. If you are REALLY looking for an enjoyable read about smart, sexy women, read \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\", \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\", and/or \\"Jemima J\\", which are MUCH more well written novels.3/5 stars. Be glad I gave you that, Ms. Bushnell."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am an avid reader and a fan of Sex and the City but this book was a big disappointment. Don't waste your money or time on this one. If the author had not been involved with the popular tv show, I don't think this book would have even gotten a second look from book publishers."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"While this book is not the fun-fest promised by the professional reviews, I think there is some merit to be found inside the covers. The women in these stories are not like any of us, this much is true. They are all rich and/or famous. However, there are parts of all of us in these women; insecurity, anxiety, ambition, even lust and love. I did not laugh at any of these womens' lives, but I did empathize... at least in part."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have been watching Sex and The City since episode one and had high expectations for this book. What a disappointment! These are the worst characters ever written. I've read that Ms. Bushnell writes from her own experiences. If this is true I feel very sorry for her. What a shallow, useless life the women characters lead. These four blondes give women everywhere a bad name. I enjoy a good, fun trashy novel once in a while. If this is what you are looking for look elsewhere. The author does know how to tell a story, she just needs to go back to the drawing board and completely start over."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is boring, plain and simple. The characters were vapid. The stories were niether sexy, funny nor thought provoking. One of the characters said, &quot;write about what you know.&quot; This is a sad commentary about the author. I was in the mood for an empty book; but this was just too empty. Even the writing was bad (VERY BAD). Don't waste your money or time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I can't believe I actually spent money on this. Desperation at the airport is the worst thing, but i'd rather read the inflight magazine (including the ads)13 times and speak to the annoying woman beside me for 6 hours instread of subjecting myself to this book. Who prints this stuff?"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"4 Blondes just may mark the end of Candace Bushnell's 15 minutes of fame. One reviewer wrote that Bushnell is a satirist showing &quot;the growing chasm between sex and romance.&quot; A satirist, I don't think so. No, just a writer throwing together four stories in haste in order to meet a publishing deadline. Was I supposed to like these women, or hate them? Was I supposed to empathize with them, sympathize with them or just wish for their deaths? Reading this book equals 2 wasted hours, 2 hours I will never get back. Finally, the 3rd story was an obvious roman a clef of John and Carolyn Kennedy. Heartless."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell has a knack for telling stories about the rich and fabulous, but her stories aren't about fake cardboard cut-outs of Barbie-like creatures. Her stories are about real people -- people with insecurities, relationship problems, and trouble at work.FOUR BLONDES is a collection of stories, each about a woman with her own set of personal and professional issues. While these women are glamorous and gorgeous, their stories sounded like things I hear from my friends. The characters' insecurities and disappointments will ring true to anyone who reads this. Perhaps more important is that these ladies are FUNNY -- and that will have you flipping pages well into the night...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As a faithful watcher of Sex and the City I really thought I was in for a treat to read Candace Bushnell's Four Blondes. But I soon learned I should stick to watching HBO reproduce her idea.The books is actually four short novellas about young, wealthy, beautiful and glamourous women and their sex lives. And little else. The author leaves each of the four stories unfinished with loose ends. There was little substance to each story and then an arubt, but certainly welcome from the boredom of reading it, botchy ending.If you have heard of Candace Bushnell and are thinking of giving her books a go, I would definitely suggest skipping the author and going straight to your television set and watching an episode of Sex and the City."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is defnintely not worth the time reading. I love Sex in the City but I think the author just decided to write \\"nothing\\" and call it a book. Four short stories about nothing women, doing nothing with life and sleeping with everyone. It was very poorly written. Ugh!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I note that in this book the author has one of her characters - also an author (how inspired - NOT!) - check her own reviews every morning on Amazon. If the author informed the \\"blonde author\\" I suspect she will have given up on the habit long ago. For I have never seen so many terrible reviews for a single book before in my life. And deservedly so. Four Blondes is a total stinker of a book. No, not just bad, it's awfulAwfulAWFUL!So many terrible reviews and still they keep a-coming. I'm not surprized. Seldom does a book disappoint to the level that this one does. It actually offends!The only surprize is the odd good Amazon review slipped in amongst the overwhelming tide of bad ones. The ones that give it four stars and enthuse about it's fabulousness. Excuse me? Are we even reading the same book???I repeat: Four Blondes is a total stinker. But don't just take my word for it - there are about 250 people (at least!) who appear to agree with me below."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Ok, first, do like me and borrow it from your local library. Is not worth to pay for it. Second, read fist the last story, sadly, the shortest, but the only one really worth your time. Fun, dynamic, interesting. If you want, adventure on the third story. Princess Cecilia have all what we dream and still she is terrible unhappy. Her character stayed with me for some time. But I'm still traying to forget Winnie Diekes, protagonist of the second story. I guess Candance herself does the same than Winnie and came to Amazon to read the reviews. Sorry Cand, just 2 stars here, and only because the last 30 pages of your book. I just hope your sex is better than hers. And if you dare, read the fist story, about Janey. Boooooooooooooooooooooooooring. And if a short story wasn't boooooooooooooooooooooooooring enough, Bushnell when with a loooooooooooooooooooooooooong booooooooooooooooooring book about here, Trading Up. Not even worth the trip to the library. Characters that are ugly and then magically get beautiful (Janey) Characters that are beautiful and then suddenly became ugly just to latter, magically, get beautiful again. (Janey's sister). Ridiculous situations every page. Please...Stick to Carry Bushnell, she is your best (and only) good creation."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Right after reading $eXz In The City, I tore into Four Blondes, looking for a happy extension to the reading pleasure I previously received from Candace Bushnell. I wasn't disappointed, for the most part.Bushnell keeps up her frantic, fragmented pace in Four Blondes that she mastered with SITC, but takes a closer, edgier look at four women in particular. While I thought these four women would interact throughout the book, they really don't. It is actually four separate stories of New York women, and I think that let me down just a tad.First we have Janey, a model, who realizes her only ambition has been getting a man (any man) to pay for her summer in the Hamptons. Of all four stories, I liked Janey's the best. Though she is a ambitionless leech, I found myself actually liking her.Next is Winnie Dieke, married to James, no children. Winnie is a journalist, as is James, and after seven years of marriage is wondering if James is the best she will ever do. They don't care much for each other, but can't seem to let go of their relationship for mostly selfish reasons.Third is the story of Princess Cecelia, a beautiful girl who marries a real Prince. This was my least favorite segment, and the reason my rating dropped from 4 stars to 3. I simply could not relate to Cecilia at all, she had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I felt it was a little beneath Bushnell to not have come up with at least one, since she is so very good at making likeable personalities out of despicable people.Fourth and last, is the story of a writer to travels to England to write about how the English have bedroom relationships. The first person narrator of this story is never named, except for what seems to be a nickname of \\"Minky\\". Minky was definitely a fun personality, and someone I could see myself liking to be around.All in all, Four Blondes is a good book, but definitely better if you accustom yourself to Bushnell's style first with SITC. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"There is little to say about this book that has not already been said. So here it is: One of the worst books even written. Period. Don't say we didn't warn you."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As an avid viewer of HBO's \\"Sex and the City,\\" I was curious to read from the author of the book which the show is based on. I picked up \\"Four Blondes\\" hoping to find memorable characters like Carrie Bradshaw, frankness with social-taboos and biting humor. Instead I found four stories with characters that, for the most part, make you want to scream because they are so stupid and shallow. Their stories are pretty dull, too. Sure, the open sex-talk is there, but it didn't open my eyes the way \\"Sex and the City\\" does. \\"Four Blondes\\" is totally devoid of anything meaningful."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Ms. Bushnell should be ashamed of herself. Riding on the tail of the success of \\"Sex and the City\\", she released this piece of garbage. I picked this book up hoping to find realistic, honest, and witty banter between four blonde girls, much like the conversations from \\"Sex and the City\\". I am sorry to report that you will find nothing resembling this in \\"Blondes\\".First off, I want to say that I am outright offended by the behavior of these women, especially the first story, Janey Wilcox. Bushnell had the audacity to have Janey refer to herself as a feminist due to the fact that she openly slept with men for no other reason than to stay in a nice beach house in the Hamptons. This was the only trait this character had. She was not fleshed out anymore than that. Janey slept with rich and powerful men to get a nice house. That's it. At the end of the story, she hits success in the most contrived way. As sad as this character sounds, she is the most interesting of the four.\\"Sex and the City\\" in it's own way let the world know that yes, women have the same conversations about sex as men do, and that doing so was OK. \\"Sex\\" did not due much harm to the image of women, .... However, \\"Blondes\\" paints the four women out to be gold diggers and/or women who married/dated a man for his power and name. The word \\"love\\" is used a couple of times in this book, but Bushnell failed to convince me as a reader that any of her characters are capable of such a thing."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Bushnells &quot;Four Blondes&quot; is an easy read, while providing some humor. While &quot;Sex and the City&quot; jumped from character to character, this book provides four Chapters each centering around a different character, painfully similiar to &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. Each chapter is fun to read, but I was somewhat dissapointed with the last one. It didn't quite seem to &quot;fit&quot; with the rest of the book. It was very vague and much shorter then the previous 3. I liked this book for its sharp wit and typical New York sarcasm. In short, if you enjoyed &quot;sex and the city&quot;, I reccomend this book for a fun summer read, but don't expect anything too different."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The book is split into 4 different stories revolving around 4 different (blonde) characters. The first story is pretty good. So I quickly moved onto the next blonde. Not as good as the first. It seemed to drag. And the longer it dragged, the less sympathy (and at times, interest) I had for the characters. The third one made me continually question why I was reading the book. I kept going because I was sure that something major was about to be revealed to make the reader understand the characters actions. Never happened. I feared my face would retain the bewildered expression that it had taken on during the third story. The final story was the worst. It was boring, pointless and ended very abruptly to be immediately followed by me hurling the book across the room."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This has got to be the most utterly boring book I have ever read. I struggled to get past the first story let alone all four. Admittedly it was fairly amusing in parts but the characters were so depressingly dreadful that I couldnt have cared one way or another what happened to them or their whinging oddball lives. I thoroughly enjoy Sex and the City, hence buying the book for my holiday, what a disappointment. Save your money!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I could not find a single character in this book to like, or even remotely care about. But as I got further into it, I realized that maybe that's the point. None of these &quot;blondes&quot; cared about anyone but themselves, so why should we care for them? I guess I just couldn't see the point. Are we supposed to feel bad for, or identify with, wealthy New York social climbers with voracious appetites for sex, drugs, and Manolos? Reading this book just made me feel content with my life, and glad that I did not live in a social world where appearance is everything and sex is used as a weapon and a tool. Like most people, I picked this up because I enjoy &quot;Sex in the City,&quot; but I'll stick with Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte anyday. At least they have at least a few likeable qualities."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I gave this book two stars only because I figured the first two stories--stupid though they may be--still could get 3 stars while the last two were just completely boring and pointless. I don't mind tabloid-y, gossipy, trashy novels one bit, but for heaven's sake don't make them boring! That's the cardinal sin. I also found myself wondering how the author felt about the 4 main characters in each of the stories as well as the society they all lived in. The reflexive answer would be that she would probably be just as repulsed by them as all the readers. But I wonder about that. First of all, she clearly seems to know the world whereof she writes inside and out. And how could she know it so well unless she lived it? And second, look at that photo on the back! It looks as if she is EXACTLY like one of the characters in her little novellas (with slightly less blonde hair). With her come-hither expression and attempted seductive pose, I was thinking, maybe this is Janey Wilcox and Princess Cecelia. So maybe her view of these women is more understanding (maybe even approving) than all the readers seemed to find them."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I wish Amazon.com had a 'zero stars' rating, because it doesn't even deserve one star! I can only think of one other time I have tried to read a book as bad as this. I couldn't even get past the first 10 or so pages of each chapter, the characters were so abhorent. The writing style is completely devoid of imagination. I hope Candace Bushnell is taking a gander at these reviews, maybe she'll pay attention and retire from writing. I want my money back!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Unfortunately, the acerbic wit that was so evident in the first of the four stories did not carry over to the other three stories. In fact, Janey in the first one was the only character that held my interest.Candace Bushnell failed to get the reader to care for any of the characters in the remaining three stories and I can only say that I am glad I checked the book out of the library and didn't waste my money on this book. I cannot believe that she thinks this book is much better than &quot;Sex and the Single Girl.&quot; I think that I will probably watch the program on TV instead of reading the book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I think it is unlikely that the reviewers are giving bad reports on this book because they are jealous! It is just a tedious, shallow book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Sorry Candace, but your 15 minutes are up.

Hard to believe it was the same author...not at all the enjoyable experience of her debut. Sad...but best skipped."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is without a doubt the worst book I have read in a long time - if not ever! The characters were one dimensional, uninteresting and there was not a protagonist to be found. The prose was stilted and the timeline wandered all over the map. Where was her editor when Ms Bushnell handed in this book?I am a faithful watcher of the TV series Sex and the City and I find it hard to believe that Ms. Bushnell had anything to do with the smart and witty characters we see week in and week out. Save your money and watch an episode of the TV show and stay far away from this awful book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Very enjoyable book. It's four stories. The first was a little too neatly wrapped up at the end. The second was deliciously evil. The third was kind of disconcerting. The fourth was sort of abrupt, too.But, all good. I'm a New Yorker and I don't live a life like this (but I have worked for womens magazines!). I'm glad I don't live a life like these women."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"After reading the utterly insipid FIRST of the FOUR BLONDES - the one who wants a summer rental in the Hamptons - I was ready to proclaim Bushnell a one-hit wonder. (which I hated to think was the case!) The FIRST BLONDE was so UNINTERESTING and UNINSPIRED what with CLICHE'D and DATED characterizations and dialogue that I wondered if someone else helped her with Sex in the City... a la Milli Vanilli. After reading the entire book I think Bushnell simply erred on the side of &quot;over-spoofing&quot; the first blonde - which made it appear there was no satire at all, just genuine vapidness (as if the author could do no better than rework a Jackie Collins character from 1985.) FORTUNATELY, HOWEVER, the &quot;blondes&quot; get savvier and wittier (employing increasingly shrewd conflict resoluton) as their CV's improve. Bushnell is at HER VERY BEST with the FOURTH BLONDE which just happens to be the BUSHNELL HERSELF. It was superb writing, superb POV, superb dialogue. Unfortunately it was the shortest. I hope she makes the 4th blonde the focus of her next book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was a waste of money. There were some good parts but not enough to merit the cost. Each story starts out slow, gets a little interesting and then abruptly ends. We are only given glimpses of the lives of the people in the book and you feel as if you are still waiting on the &quot;climax&quot; when each story ends."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Do not waste your money on this trash. It was totally obnoxious, hard to get into, and a waste of time. Bushnell really sunk low to write this novel, which mirrors cheesy, tacky, and AWFUL romance novels. DO NOT READ- SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"If you want to read a book about a bunch of completely self-absorbed and uninteresting characters, pick this up. I was so dissappointed I was horrified that this was written by the woman whose claim to fame is my beloved HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\". Having not read the book, I can only hope that it is far better than this one. The characters lack any depth whatsoever, and don't even actually do anything interesting except sit around all day complaining, and waiting for something magical to happen. It's so stupid I'm shocked anyone actually published it. Note to self: Do not keep reading terrible books that you think have some fabulous moral at the end. Just put it down, and walk away."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was a total disapointment. I am a &quot;Sex and the City&quot; fan. My husband and I have watch the T.V. serie for years, we have also bought the first and second season on DVD to watch it again. That's why we bought the book.It turn out to be boring and poorly written. The worst of all was the third story, I had to make a great effort to finish it.It's almost amazing how someone can do so well in one thing and at the same time so bad on another one.Well, I guess I will keep watching my favorite &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and forget I ever read this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Like many others, I picked up this book due to the success of Candance Bushnell's hit tv show &quot; Sex and the City&quot;. This book was so annoying it revolves around 4 blondes...enough said! It reveals 4 characters who are all obbsessed with their social status and it doesnt get any deeper than that. There are four sections in the book, each dealing with one of the four characters who never actually meet! I didnt put this book down, because I was so desperate to see if this book could actually get any worse! It did! It was awful. What an embarrasement to Candance Bushnell! I hope she knows that her book bombed!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is nothing but pathetic rubbish and is fit only for the dumpster. Most surprising of all is that I thought I'd relate to the characters as I'm a pretty savvy, late 20's blonde in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, the only time this would be mildly amusing is after one too many cosmopolitans."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was so bad...I read a lot of books and I don't have time to write a review about them all, but I couldn't even get past the second story....what possed Candace Bushnell to write this book....I mean Sex in the City was great....this was a total loser...just hope I can get something for it when I turn it in to the used book store...This is NOT one I want in my collection"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I'm sure many of you are like me - once I start reading a book, I can't stop...even if it is dreadful. So condsider yourself warned - if you're like me, don't start reading this book. Just take a look at the majority of the reviews on here and you'll soon agree.The stories in this book follow the most shallow and self-consumed women I've ever read about. Since I wouldn't be interested in knowing these women in my everyday life, I can't imagine why I'd want to read about them.Since I'm a humanitarian by heart, I'll save you from the same torture that I inflicted upon myself and not sell this book on Amazon's used book option. You can thank me later."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I received this book as a birthday present, but should have returned it after the first one hundred pages. Since reading this book I can barely stand to watch Sex and the City anymore. Bushnell's accounts of these four rich, socialite blondes were pretty disturbing because it seems as though these women are SUPPOSED to be viewed as glamorous by readers, which in most cases, they just come off as [...]. I could just imagine if her characters were real, instead of being on the society pages of Vogue, they would be on a trashy talk show. All in all, I almost am considering dying my hair to not be associated with her fair-haired brood."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Let me preface this review with three little words: &quot;waste of time.&quot; With each and every story, I found myself asking, &quot;Wouldn't it be more interesting and productive if I tried to learn how to play the piano with my elbows?&quot; I was mislead into reading this book because I enjoy &quot;Sex and the City.&quot; Trust me, this book is that bad. I can't believe this book was published."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"OK. I walk into the bookstore. I pick up 4 blondes, thinking that it won't be anything but entertaining....a simple read that may be enlightening. How bad can it be right? It's on the bestseller list. It can't be THAT bad, can it? Was I wrong. Don't get me wrong. I like mindless entertaining books too, but this is a mindless one without any laughs, any direction, and the stories drag on, for what it seems like forever. To say this book was bearable is being generous. These women depicted in the stories are money-hungry, sex animals, and without value, ambition, etc. This is seriously not a good depiction of women whatsoever. Read it and you'll be sorry."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am a big fan of the show, Sex and the City, so I thought this book would be the same mix of humor, strong characters, cosmopolitian style and heart.The book was a big dissapointment. The characters were all shallow and the stories seemed pointless. The reader does not become invested in the characters at all. I would not recomend this to anyone. Meaningless fluff is suppossed to be fun and this book was not. If you are a fan of Sex and the City either read Candace Bushnell's book, Sex and the City or watch the show. Either experience would be better than wasting time to read this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I admit, I bought the book because I love watching the HBO series. I wish I hadn't been so fooled. After wasting my time reading about a model whose biggest problem was getting to the Hamptons every summer, and a snobby journalist, I tried reading about the third character. I decided I would stop torturing myself and threw the book away. The characters were pathetic bores, I only wish that my problems were so trivial. There was no drama, no humor and no point. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I see this book as a contemporary masterpiece. It is told in a voice that somewhat echoes Jacqueline Susann's vivid descriptions of New York's high-speed social life in the seventies. Like Susann, Bushnell writes of people whose lives are sometimes unfathomable to some, because tucked in the routine of everyday life, characters such as these can not possibly seem to exist. Anyone disregarding this book as trash is perhaps to close-minded to see what it really is; entertainment. Lifestyles and people that are different from us are innately fascinating, and this book allows us to indulge in what most people will never experience. After reading this book you are left satisfied and also reassured that at least you have some morals. This book is not a guide for how to have a good life, it is for the sake entertainment, and allows a temporary escape from the rules of social etiquette that we must abide to."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"With wit as stiletto-sharp as a Manolo Blahnik heel, the captivating stories of four women celebrate various aspects of womanhood from love to loneliness, from power to paranoia.One of Four Blonde's strongest characteristics is Bushnell's painfully clever and witty writing. Hilarious anecdotes and character's sharp comments kept me laughing out loud throughout the novel, which also held my attention and kept things interesting. To keep things even more interesting, Bushnell shifts writing styles and techniques according to the personality of each character. While refreshing to be introduced to a new style in each story, it is most important because it sets different moods with a reflection of each character's personality to better understand her and the lesson she will learn.While the writing is entertaining and alluring, Bushnell's well developed and surprisingly relatable characters outshone the writing. Although all four women lead extraordinary lives, seemingly extremely unlike that of an average woman, Bushnell gives each woman universal concerns and problems. All are powerful and driven, yet vulnerable as well, further legitimizing them as real people. The characters are also captivating because, viewing them superficially, they are extremely diverse. However, all of the women are really the same and similar to all women. A bitter washed-up model, a high-strung journalist, a paranoid princess, and a desperate writer come to life-altering realizations by facing the obstacles of their extraordinary everyday lives to find out what will bring their common and universal goal of happiness.Four Blondes is a novel for all women because it shows the power, intelligence, perseverance, strength, and vulnerability that make all women special. It is also great for any woman or man searching for a quick-paced, hilarious, unconventional read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"In my busy life a book has to have a magnetic pull to reel me in and keep me hooked. This novel allowed me the luxury of escaping my own life to live vicariously through these 4 women. Although none of the characters seemed to have had any values nor did I identify with any of them beyond my affinity for the finer things in life, they held my interest. Each one of these women in a different time or place could have been a Jane Eyre or an Emma-women who exploited their looks and charm to get what they wanted. I loved every minute of this novel because these characters did things I only wish I had the brazeness to try. For all those naysayers, learn to live a little. I would rather curl up with this novel and some wine than dine or drink with any of you."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I like watching Sex and the city. So I thought why not read Candace Bushnell's work and I did. I started reading 4 Blondes and it was even better than the show. It was very entertaining. This book tells the story of 4 Blondes. My favourite is the one about the journalist who has to go to England to explore British sex. I also recommend Sex And The City and Trading Up both by Candace Bushnell."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I LOVED this book. Finally I book that says what we successful women already know, don't be afraid to go after what you want. In the end, you only have yourself, so make yourself happy. The best story in the book is Platinum. The other people who rated this book obviously don't know what it's like to live in the world that these women face everyday. It's hard to be beautiful."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Bushnell's \\"4 Blondes\\" is an insulting look at women in high-society New York, portrayed as souless, careless prostitutes whose only cares are money, sex, and looks. I think this book lowered my IQ - I know where I am going to store my copy.... in the trash where it belongs. If you want to read about rich and famous women, pick up a Vogue, at least they haven't lost thier self-respect"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought this book was well done. Candace Bushnell does a fine job of portraying life in the big city, and gives the small-town person a glimpse into the fabulous life of one who lives in Manhattan. While 4 Blonds does not really hold any true literary value, it does pass the time away with a good plot line and a great set-up.I especially enjoyed how Bushnell uses four different story lines, seemingly unrelated to each other, and combines the four women through mutual characters that influence every main character in the novel. It's a sassy, smart, fresh new look at life through the eyes of the young woman. I find it fascinating to view life from a perspective that is so opposite of my own--living from day to day rather than living with a giant image of the future glued to the back of my mind. These women are adventurous and bold, willing to commit to exciting lives. Reading this novel is a great way to transport your world into a completely different landscape.This is really not a book I would recommend to those who want to challenge their minds when they read. Although this is not a book I would read twice, I enjoyed it the first time. I would give this book 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I loved this book. I found it extremely hard to put down. It was such a fun read for me. This book is perfect for anyone who works outside the home or is a homemaker taking care of the family, and have found it hard to find the time to read a novel. It has 4 short stories compared to being one long novel. It is much easier to find time to finish a story."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I always know a book is written well when I can't put it down, and thats exactly what happened. What I like is how the author went into much detail of what the women was thinking at that exact moment, and it was also interesting how she protrayed the depression of one of them (story #3). It was amazing.I was disappointed in one story and that was the second, their was definetly many climax's in that story but every time I thought something really exciting/horrible thing was gonna happen it didn't.Overall the book was fairly well and I do recommend it to other women, I'm sure you'll relate to at least one of them in some aspect."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"After reading 'Sex and the City' I was compelled to read 4 Blondes. It started with Bushnell's rapier wit and clever innuendo and I prepared for what I thought would be an enjoyable and informed read for the modern woman. However, I was disapointed and angry regarding the constant reference to the Brits...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am often game for light entertaining books. This however, was neither. The characters are impossible to relate to. Overall, there is simply no real plot to this book. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I went into this book *not* expecting it to be like the TV show, and it wasn't. It's supposed to be different as that it is a book, not TV. I liked Candace's style of writing. The only story of the 4 that I didn't like at first was the one where after every sentence, there was something in parenthasis - that was a bit annoying at first. I liked this book and plan to get Sex in the City too. If I wanted a book to be exactly like the TV show, then I wouldn't have to read the books, since I watch the show religiously. All in all, a good book to curl up with before bedtime."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; and thought that this book would be another lighthearted, amusing read. Was I ever wrong. This book was HORRIBLE!! The characters were not developed and the plot was even more superficial. I have never missed an episode of &quot;Sex&quot; so I never imagined that I wouldn't like this book. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I love men. For all their faults, they have a lot to offer a woman. This book doesn't show that men are worthy creatures at all. Don't get me wrong: I LOVE the Sex in the City TV show. I just hate the way Bushnell makes men appear to be a hinderance to women."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A tedious book about unlikeable people.If this is life in the city, I'm glad I'm a hick from the sticks."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"What an utter bore. Characters were flat and insipid. Nothing even remotely charming or funny. Waste of time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell, creator and writer of SEX AND THE CITY, returns with 4 novellas in this collection. Each one follows a blonde who is at a crossroads in her life and must make decisions to change her life in a more meaningful way.\\"Nice N' Easy\\" is the best of the group with a sizzling portrayal of a woman who dates men only in the summer to get a good house in the Hamptons. What she yearns for is what she gets...realizing that it wasn't what she needed.\\"Highlights for Adults\\" is a downer of a tale describing in stark detail a woman's troubled marriage and the consequences of choices she and her husband makes.\\"Platinum\\" shows us what a woman will do to be accepted in high society while fighting her own demons.\\"Single Process\\" is the most SEX AND THE CITYish. It reads like a column. Dealing with a life without a husband, a writer travels to England to see if the wife's tale of \\"Englishman are bad in bed\\" is true. But she finds out a whole lot more.All in all a strong collection with a gossipy, whispered type of overtones. Very good stuff and fans of SEX AND THE CITY will not be disappointed"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Janey Wilcox, main character of one of the four short stories, inspires absolutely no sympathy. The only thing that interested me about her was why she was as money-hungry as she was and why she wasn't looking for love. The rest of the stories are way below my expectations as compared to Sex in the City. The story of the journalists was uninteresting and not very plausible. I skimmed the rest of them and they were similarly boring. If you must read this book, first, don't buy the hardcover, and second, don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Do not let your mother read this! It is wild, raunchy and at times absolutely shocking. It was a great read--I read it on an airplane and it kept me awake and very entertained the whole cross-country trip.But it should perhaps have a warning label on it. This book and its characters make the Sex and the City show look like a Disney program."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This was a great book. Very witty and enjoyable; however the last two stories were not as good as the first. They lacked a lot of substance that the first two had."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"THE BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

'nuff said."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I watched sex and the city and fell in love with it. However, four blondes was a disappointment. I read two of the short stories and found it a waste of time. With the support of glamourous stars and clothings, it may be good TV materials. Without, it is utterly boring and tasteless."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was really pretty boring. The characters were vacuous (although that was the point, I suppose). There were no redeeming qualities to ANYONE in the entire book!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Most of my girlfriends shuddered when they saw this book on my coffee table, saying that they found it disgusting and upsetting. Of course, that only made me want to read it more, and I ended up being pleasantly surpirsed. I picked this up because I had read Bushnell's Trading Up, a follow-on book that follows the life of Janey, a character from 4 Blondes.I admire the style of this book--each of the four sections follows a different society girl, and the storytelling style and overall tone of each section is very different, to match the main character. Bushnell is a talented storyteller, even if you have moral qualms about her characters.The first blonde, Janey, was my favorite, probably because I had read about her in Trading Up. This story really helped me get the background of the Trading Up characters and understand why Janey was the way she was, and why she was in love with Comstock Dibble.The second story focused on Winnie and James Dicks. It was a beautiful satire of a well-educated career-climbing NY couple. It was less of a story than a snapshot \\"day in the life of...,\\" but it was still a good read.The third first-person vignette was the most interesting. Bushnell truly captured the scattered thoughts of a mentally ill woman in diary format. I felt like I traveled on her journey of partial recovery, then sunk back down into the depths of drugs. Bushnell is a master for making me feel the point of view of a shallow, social-climbing, drug-addicted woman.The final story was the least well developed. The writer's commentary was boring, and she thought she was much more talented and insightful than she really was. The English men in this story were one-dimensional, too. Bushell should stick to NY social climber who don't have as many pretentions."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This must be the worst book ever written.All the stories are boring but the fourth one was downright offensive.Mizz Bushnell just used this story to talk aload of [...] about the English.I am English and I found this book offensive in the extreme.Also it's a load of [...] I bet she has never been to England in her life,let's hope she keeps it that way .If I could bring [...] I would for this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This is a good combination of four stories about women at different stages in their lives. It was a nice read and very enjoyable."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Despite all of the negative reviews on here, I thought this book was great. True, it doesn't depict the positivity that you'd expect from the characters, but that's what makes it real. Sometimes life needs to delve into the negative side rather than be the typical perfection everyone is expecting. This book is a great read and I think that Candace Bushnell captured at least most of the essence of how women feel, because I know that I could relate to a lot -- if not most of what she described. Yay, I love this book :)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought this book was interesting and very entertaining. I'm not much of a reader, so any book that keeps my attention is worth recommending. The characters are very different from my lifestyle and yet I find I can identify with their underlying problems / feelings. If you like \\"Sex and the City\\", you will like this book, no doubt!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was honestly awful. There was no plot, and the characters are un-realistic and un-interesting. I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book, and I HATE not finishing a book. Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I don't think that I have ever been more bored or annoyed by a book in my life!I consider myself fairly hip but I must not be because I hated this book. I thought this would be a fun book along the lines of the other book styles that I enjoy. Especially with all of the hype behind it. I didn't even get past the first two characters' chapters.I wasn't offended by the language in the book. I was offended that I paid money for it.I wasn't bothered that the characters were so self-absorbed and shallow. I think that books can have self-absorbed, neurotic, shallow characters that are still interesting. None of the characters in this book were interesting to say the least. I was so bored I used this book to put me to sleep. Now I use it as a coaster.I don't even remember any of the characters' names or their story lines. It is a truly forgettable book. I usually pass along books to friends for them to read but I wouldn't give this to my worst enemy.Like I said, maybe I am not as hip as I thought but if being hip means forcing myself to read this crap I will just stay a nerd."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The four blondes are ultra similar in their self-absorption-for each it's all about me, me, me, men, men, men and money, money, money. Each has boatloads of \\"friends\\" yet each finds herself ultra alone in the world. Each runs with the A-list crowd. The collection of stories could have been ultra-repetitive. But Bushnell deftly chose different literary points-of-view for each story. Janey is searching for her man in third-person limited. The dysfunctional couple, James and Winnie, are written in an edgy present-tense by an all-seeing, all-knowing, unnamed narrator (Bushnell herself of course) so we get healthy doses their thoughts about each other. And nutty Princess Cecelia could only tell us her own story-and she does-in the first person. The seemingly simple, yet important choice of point-of-view, written by a skilled author turns a good, yet potentially repetitive book into an good collection."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I wasn't expecting sex and the city, but I was expecting an interesting, well-written book that I could \\"get into\\". There was absolutely no depth to the writing - and I'm not referring to the morality of the characters (although they're shallow as well). I couldn't lose myself in this book, and trust me, I can read anything. The details that give a story substance and make it come alive were missing. If you're desperate, I suppose you can try it, but don't waste your money buying it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The other reviewers seem to have covered it: shallow, spoiled characters living in some alternate universe that may or may not exist in elite New York. I had to make a correction: \\"Winnie\\" is said to be a graduate of Smith College (ahem, the women's college) but then a few pages later she knew a male doctor because \\"they went to college together\\". [In Sex and the City, Charlotte is said to have gone to Smith then later meets with her \\"sorority sisters from college\\". There are no sororities at Smith.]. As a Smith grad, I don't mind Bushnell using it to exemplify something stereotypical, but how hard is it to find an editor who knows that Smith is a women's college?"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Don't we read &quot;4 Blondes&quot; and similar drivel for the same reasons we eat junk food? They're both quick, tasty, cheap and predictable. And we feel slightly guilty and abused afterwards. I couldn't bring myself to buy this bomb, so I read it at Barnes &amp; Noble in about three hours and left it for some sucker to purchase. Sorry, Candace, no royalties from this reader. Plus, what self-respecting guy like me would want this turkey on his bookshelf, even if I DID read it? Yes, I got sucked into reading this thing, just as I stumble into McDonald's every once in a while. At least nobody I knew saw me reading Candace's dirty little book, just like you hope none of your friends see you furtively ingesting a Big Mac. And I always wash my hands after touching filth.So, listen, I'm a New Yorker who has participated to a small and unfortunate degree in the life that Candace Bushnell describes. For all you readers out there in the hinterlands (where Bushnell is from and which she now detests), I'm happy to report that &quot;4 Blondes&quot; (and the author's &quot;Sex in the City&quot; and the resulting HBO series) are far more of a parody than any sort of reality of our life here in New York. Yes, there are neurotic and conniving people (men AND women) here in New York (and elsewhere) just as Bushnell describes, but I like to think that our vast population operates on a higher plain. Sure, Bushnell creates salacious situations that are beyond the scope of our everyday lives to engage and entertain us. That's what cheap literature is all about. And that's what sells.But &quot;4 Blondes&quot; is pretty superficial, with stilted dialogue, preposterous situations, unconvincing characters and arrested plot development. Bushnell throws four novellas at us in &quot;4 Blondes&quot;, as if she couldn't figure out a way to tie it all together into a meaningful book. And for all of her lewdness, Bushnell's works (and the HBO series) are not erotic in the least. They both obsess about sex and forget love. And, in the end, soft porn is pretty boring."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A perfect book in many ways. Bushnell was eminently readable and sharp at the Observer, and people have tended to dismiss her work out of hand as society fluff, a fun read, etc., because it's so enjoyable. But Bushnell's got it; she's a master satirist, and so subtle, that the level at which she's working seems lost on most people. She's not playing the kind of tricks Wolfe did w/Radical Chic, which walked around with a huge sign screaming: THIS IS A LAMPOON! on its ass. Bushnell writes quiet, and she could be a great satirist, in its great tradition, if she wanted to be. She has an ability to write dialogue and turns of phrase (she describes a character with cystic acne, and i'm paraphrasing, as having the type of skin that looks as if its trying to eat the face), and also hones in on details and background moments (the pimples on a brit's 'bum', the 70's-style east village hooker get-up of one character's plagiarizing co-worker) that i think about now that the story's over. 4 vignettes about 4 blondes: first, about a hamptons summer girl, is probably the best. bushnell enjoys this character, feels sympathy for her, and accurately portrays the nouveau-riche-acts-old money scene. she likes them too, or at least has a sense of humor about them. Bushnell hates her second blonde winnie, a sexless careerist magazine writer, and bushnell's obvious distaste for the sort of person she lampoons creates a sort of flat characterization of her. the third one's great. society princess, a fairy tale. and again leaves me with a few strands of thought that resonate: specifically, in regards to a certain type of man that many women in nyc regard as the 'good ones', that, often, beneath the numerous permutations of looks, wealth, manners, etc., these men are not even assholes--they're not even that--but they're boring. the last blonde was lovely, nice story, nice ending, straightforward, sounds like bushnell's life, etc., but she's always so wonderful to read. i started this book and didn't put it down. i never do that anymore."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was stunningly disappointed by this book. I have been a Candace Bushnell fan for many years and expected better out of her.It has been a long time since I've read about such shallow, self-absorbed characters. It was not at all fun to read about these people and I found myself wishing they'd put themselves out of their misery.Spend your money on something else."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As a loyal fan to the fabulous Sex and the City comedy, I was looking forward to an entertaining tale of four women and their interesting lives, instead I got four cynical, overly exagerated stories. Rather than four women dealing with the successes and failures of their lives, I found four women caught up in their materialistic ways, only to be accentuated by sex, drugs, and their inability to contribute to society. The only remotely sane character was in the final story, but at that point I was too annoyed to care. The only reason I finished the book was in hopes of finding some redeaming factor, however, none was found...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am an avid reader and a fan of Sex and the City but this book was a big disappointment. Don't waste your money or time on this one. If the author had not been involved with the popular tv show, I don't think this book would have even gotten a second look from book publishers."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This sort of New-York-Women-on-the-prowl-for-richer-men thing has been done before &amp;, to my mind, a bit better, by Rona Jaffe in her novels from the 50s &amp; 60s. Funny how the more things change, the more they remain the same - particularly when it comes to those who aspire to pointless, trendy, showy wealth. Still, these stories are mostly light fun reads - with characters you love to hate. I particularly enjoyed the marriage between the 2 soulless Yuppies, but felt disturbed by the ongoing theme throughout the book...do women like this really exist in any sort of numbers? Bushnell's got a strong, on-target, witty voice for this sort of character, but I didn't really, in the end, want to spend THIS much time with them."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Like a bag of Baked Lays. You know it's substanceless but you can't put it down...You have to love the part of the book where the main character rails against Amazon.com customers who have the NERVE to rate books...then looks up all her friends' books on Amazon and reads the readers' comments. Little details like these stick with you even after you finish the book in less time than it takes to flip through your monthly Cosmo."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I read Sex and the City and Four Blondes back-to-back. I loved the clear voice in Sex and the City, and looked forward to hearing it again in the next book; but that was voice was missing in Four Blondes. I was bored and kept asking myself why I kept reading. The disjointed stories were just Sex and the City &quot;Lite.&quot;"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"When I saw that this book was out - I immediately purchased it! While not as entertaining as the HBO series - &quot;4 Blondes&quot; was a great escape in the evenings. While I found the entire book interesting and leading . . .I found &quot;Platinum&quot; very interesting - could &quot;Ceceilia&quot; be that of the late Carolyn Bessett Kennedy? Who knows, but the story was similar to the way her life was portrayed in the media.I recommend reading this one - it is at least &quot;Fun&quot;!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Being a fan of Candace Bushnell's \\"Sex and the City\\" I thought that I would give this book a try. I have to say, I am somewhat disappointed.The first story \\"Nice 'n' Easy\\" was okay. About Janey Wilcox a girl whom every summer has sex with a guy so she can stay in his house in the Hamptons, but in the end is able to afford her own home in the Hamptons. The rest of the stories I did not like. Candace Bushnell has writing talent, but some of her characters are uninteresting and snobby.If you must read this book borrow it from a friend, don't buy it. It's definitely not worth the money. \\"Sex and the City\\" is much better than this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Like many of my girlfriends, I was really looking forward to reading this. I'm sorry to say that Bushnell's writing could easily be outdone by a fifteen year old high school student. She manages to make mildly intriguing characters downright dull. Don't get me wrong, I knew in advance that the novel would not bring enlightenment or have any point at all, for that matter. However, I think its fun to step into a world of people so different from oneself. I loved The Secret Diary of Bridget Jones, and there was really no point to that either. I thought this book was insulting to female readers and writers alike. That a writer as unskilled as Busnell can be a bestseller, speaks poorly of the standards which many women expect from literary works. Material like this is so easy to come up with, you'd think that an author should at least have to write it well to sell a book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have read a lot of bad books in my time but this book takes the cake. Giving it 1 star is giving it more credit then it deserves. I can't believe this book every got published. The writing is horrific and there is no real sense of plot. I thought with all the fame of the TV series spun from her first novel (which I wont even touch after reading this) one would think she has some talent...I was wrong."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was very disappointed with this book...I was so excited to read it, but as I turned the pages it got worse....The stories had no ending to the sad tales of these women....There was absolutely no humor in the lines and above all it was a far cry from the television show...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book does not have the same humor as \\"Sex in the City\\" does. If you're looking for the same funny, lighthearted comedy that takes place on that HBO show, do not buy this book. That said, I personally think this book is hilarious. It's a very, very dark comedy - a great satire of New York \\"privledged\\" life. It's one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Like a car wreck I couldn't tear my eyes from the horrificness of this book. I thought it would be a great vacation read: light, funny, and easy entertainment for a week of lounging around. But it wasn't. Although it was darker than I expected, that wasn't what bothered me. What did bother me was the fact that I loathed every single character in the book. Now don't get me wrong, you need a villian in a good story. But this book had too many; there wasn't a single character that I had empathy for, or felt connected to. Disclaimer: I did only read the first story. After starting the second, I just couldn't take any more of the priviledged, self-loathing, superficial, and self-righteous a-holes that ran rampant in this book. Now again, don't get me wrong, I love to hate a wicked villian or two. But only when they're a supporting character to the heroine, not when the villian is the main charchter herself."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As an avid Sex and The City fan, I figured I would love this book by Candace Bushnell, who wrote SATC and pretty much created the series. How wrong I was.First of all, this is more like a collection of short stories (\\"vignettes\\") than a book. And each short story is more trite and ridiculous than the last. For instance, the first one is about a party girl who sleeps random men to try to snare a summer house in the Hamptons. The barrage of curse words and overly explicit sexual descriptions totally turned me off; they weren't for emphasis, they were for content.These stories weren't the least bit entertaining, and right as soon as you got a tiny bit interested in someone's life, their chapter would end, and you would get a new spoiled socialite (and the total rundown on her outfit). Useless book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"When I received this book as a birthday gift, I was THRILLED, and three hours later, thoroughly disappointed upon its completion. What a horribly dismal follow-up to the spunky, upbeat nature of \\"Sex and the City\\" -- a book and TV series that have spawned more than a slight cult following! The four novellas can't even be regarded as \\"artsy\\" or \\"different\\"-- the style in which they are written, leaving you with four slight glimpses into women's lives do not endear the characters to you, nor do they inspire goodwill. A terribly sad commentary on women and the dating world in general-- better luck next time, Bushnell."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Thank goodness I borrowed this book and didn't spend the money to buy it. While Candace Bushnell is a talented writer, the stories in this book are not worth the time you spend reading them (which isn't much). There is nothing redeemable about any of the characters. They are unrealistic and you don't feel invested in their lives at all. By then end of each story, I felt a pang of relief that I no longer had to be a part of their sad, empty lives. A good short story lets you become a part of the character's life and gives you something to think about, these stories just made think, Why?"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A huge fan of Bushnell's 1997 novel \\"Sex and the City\\" (and its accompanying HBO series), I was really looking forward to reading \\"Four Blondes\\". When I picked the book up, its cover was smattered with reviews like, \\"HYSTERICAL!\\" and \\"BREEZY AND FUN!\\" I don't recall who wrote these reviews or what sort of mind-altering substances had affected them, but this book is none of those things.I can't remember a time when I have stumbled onto a collection of characters that was so vapid, shallow, unsympathetic, and just plain SAD. \\"Janey Wilcox\\", the \\"heroine\\" in the first novella, has never had to work a day in her life and has life all but handed to her on a silver platter simply because she's beautiful. When things start to go bad for her (e.g. she might not get to spend the summer in the Hamptons free of charge), she moans and groans about the possibility of having to get (GASP!) a job (horror of horrors)! The character of \\"Winnie\\" in novella #2 is even less sympathetic. She's power-mad and no longer wants to be married to her husband because he's not important enough in the world of journalism. So, she goes off and has a tryst with his best friend. Charming.In the interviews I've seen with her, Ms. Bushnell seems to think that this is all great satire and that her characters empower women, but she needs to seriously reevaluate her thinking. Save yourself a few bucks and get a different \\"BREEZY AND FUN\\" read!!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As much as I love Bushnell's Sex and the City, I found Four Blondes to be extremely superficial and shallow. I don't want to read about people that I cannot ever relate to. I want to encounter experiences by people who show morale fiber. The seperate stories of four woman and their plights, do however, prove that money doesn't necessarily make you happy, but it sure can buy you a lot of sex, drugs, and alcohol. Pass on this one unless you are filthy rich, happy with your life and would like a good laugh at those who can't handle their social status."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I can only say that I've never experienced a book as bad as the movie &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; - - but this one did it. When we went to that movie, I wanted to leave in the middle of it but my husband said no, we were here and going to endure the whole thing. That's how this book was. I kept reading thinking that it might get better, but it didn't. Then I read it because I just wanted to finish it. It was truly the worst book I've ever read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am an avid viewer of Sex and The City and I truly enjoy the storylines. I was hoping to enjoy this book as much as I enjoy the show. Unfortunately, this was the most unsatisfying book I have ever read. The characters were completely unlikable and the book left you wondering if there was any purpose of their stories being told. The author stopped writing about each of them in the middle of their story and never went back to explain a thing. This was an absolute waste of time and money."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is proof that you don't have to be a good writer with a decent story line to be published. This was an incredible waste of time and money."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Four bores. Four vapid, self-centred, flakey, New York bores. To paraphrase a great line from AbFab \\"Who cares if they are fat or thin? Who cares if they live or die?\\" Reading this book was slightly less interesting than watching paint dry.I normally keep to a 50 page rule. If the book is no good after 50 pages then I bin it. Why, oh why, didn't I stick to that rule? Because this was a gift from a friend who knew I loved Sex And The City. My enjoyment of that book is a measure of my disappointment in this. It has been a long time since I actually wanted to rip a book to pieces but Four Blondes did the trick.I don't care how well observed the characters are. They are bores. Utter, utter bores. Don't buy. You have been warned."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"For those of you expecting comedy like Sex and the City, look elsewhere. Don't trust the reviews on the back of the book that say, \\"hilarious\\" and \\"a riot\\" and what-not. These women (with the exception of the last one) are not funny - they are extremely messed-up and sad; which might have been Bushnell's point. The first blonde is looking for \\"the perfect summer\\" or the perfect life, basically. She's shallow, manipulative, and petty, but throughout her adventures, she sort of learns her lesson - although she gets what she wants. The second blonde is married, unhappily. VERY unhappily. She begrudges, belittles, and despises her husband, and their relationship becomes less and less healthy. The third blonde is a prescription drug addicted, mentally ill woman who. . .I'm not sure, exactly. These women are perhaps meant to be empathized, but they garnered no empathy from me. I found them shrill, annoying, scary, and pathetic. Only the last story, a Sex and the City adventure in London curbed my appetite for the trials and tribulations of dating. Unfortunately, this story is only about 12 pages long."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I expected much more from the writer of Sex and the City. This book has no real plot and horrible character development. There is nothing in any of the characters to identify with and you finish each section wondering what happened. Definitely skip this book and go watch Sex in the City!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is just dreadful. There's not even much one can say about it - it's kind of like a big black hole. Bad characters, bad stories, bad writing. There was literally nothing I liked about this book.As the title implies, the four protagonists are four blonde women, each of whom stars in her own stand-alone story. There's a model who sleeps with men so she can summer in their homes the hamptons, a self-absorbed writer, an insane princess, and another, desperate, writer. All of the women share one trait - a complete lack of any redeeming qualities. I think we're supposed to care about they ways these women are miserable, or at least be amused by their preoccupation with money, stauts and sex, but the author gives us absolutely no reason to. The stories themselves are insipid, and each ends on an oddly jarring note - are we supposed to be happy for each woman as she experiences a (kind-of) triumph? Plus, the author seems to be preoccupied with a particular sex act, which figures (inexplicably) in some way in each of the stories.If you're interested in the dirty stories of the rich and different, read The Nanny Diaries. But don't bother with 4 Blondes. It's not worth the time."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS BOOK: Reading it will be tortuous. It leaves you feeling as bored and empty as the characters in the stories (and I use that literary term very loosely here). I loved Sex and the City, Bridget Jones Diary and The Nanny Diaries. 4 Bombs is a shell by comparison. Full of leftover hollow fragments of pitifully uninteresting and empty lives like the ones Ms. Bushnell has unfortunately grown far to comfortable with since her raving success with Sex and the City."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is as addictive and silly as a cheesy romance novel. The difference? &quot;Four Blondes&quot; is witty and humorous, and the author doesn't approach the subject matter too seriously. The book is made up of four unrelated stories. The women in each of the stories don't have much in common, except for their wealth, their slightly neurotic behavior, and the color of their hair (blonde, of course). My favorite story was the first one, &quot;Nice N'Easy,&quot; which is about a girl named Janey, former model and professional trophy girlfriend. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it took a while to get used to the change in writing style from one story to the next. Overall, though, this book is great."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Don't waste your money. It's depressing and badly written. I hope this isn't how NY really is."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was pretty dissappointed with this book. I adore \\"Sex and the City\\". I was hoping that 4 Blondes would be a cross between \\"Sex and the City\\" & \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" as it suggested on the back cover--a little tawdry, and lots of fun. But this book was not fun--it lagged in parts and lacked any sparks overall.I realize that the lead characters were supposed to be shallow and manipulative.Anti-heroes, as opposed to the likeable crop of female protagonists in many books that are currently popular. I know that you weren't supposed to really like these girls. (I applaud Candace Bushnell's efforts to create characters that were so totally the opposite of the Bridget Jones' and even her own character Carrie Bradshaw, for the sake of trying something different.) But the characters were so soul-less that I felt nothing for them, no empathy, no admiration, no dislike, nothing at all.It just felt so empty. The book was conceptually a cool idea, it just didn't pan out."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Let's see... Spoiled, disturbed, ungrateful and Cinderella. These could be the summary characterizations of the four women in this book. I'm surprised by how much I disliked it.For what this book is trying to say, Steve Martin's book, \\"Shopgirl,\\" is far better, more entertaining and very much more insightful.I also suspect some of Candace Bushnell's concepts were lifted directly from Natalia Ilyin's \\"Blonde Like Me,\\" another book more readable than this."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Read this book if you are looking for shallow entertainment, because that is all you will get! It's short and easy reading (I finished the book in two evenings). If you're thinking of buying it, however, don't! Check it out at your local library."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"As a huge fan of HBO's \\"Sex In The City\\" I thought Bushnell's book would be at least nearly as entertaining. I was sorely disappointed, however, and have no desire to read any of her other works. The book is set up as four separate stories, and I strained throughout my reading to see how they related to each other - they don't. Well, unless you count that the women apparently all live in New York..."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The second story of the four, about Winnie D and her almost-wimpy husband, is the funniest -- it is worth the price of the book, totally. This is an Upper East Sider's bitchy take on the worst excesses of the Upper West Side. I gasped in horrified recognition, laughed out loud and snickered more discreetly at the unladylike rudeness of Bushnell's comments. The last story, about a writer going to London, is interesting but weak.Janey, the *first* blonde, is surprisingly sympathetic. Her plight scared the hell out of me. Her story has a &quot;Custom of the Country&quot; (Whartonesque) feel to it. The third blonde (in no particular order) is bizarre -- she writes this one from the point of view of a drugged up blabbering-to-self misfit, and it is not easy to make that perspective interesting. But she manages to hold your attention (or mine, at any rate) and for this you have to give Bushnell credit. I found the conclusion of story #3 vaguely inconclusive but maybe that's the idea.The backlash against Bushnell is silly. If I have one problem with her style, it's her crudeness -- but it doesn't stop me from reading right through to the end. One word of advice -- don't read this while eating, if you're squeamish. But it's a great book for wiling away the time with during a pedicure."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Being a fan of the show &quot;Sex In The City&quot;, I was looking forward to reading this book. After about 2 chapters, I realized that I should just put it down and find something else. But being an optomist, I pressed on.The characters are shallow and pithy. The storylines are useless and go nowhere. The concept is obviously fashioned by someone who wishes they were inside &quot;New York Society&quot; and not writing about it.If you have begun this book, put it down now and go get Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I enjoyed Candace Bushnell's Sex and the City. I also love her column in the New York Observer, but her new book, Four Blondes, lacks charm and originality. I felt as though I was reading one of her newspaper articles. She brought absolutely nothing new in this one. That's not to say, however, that it isn't a fun and interesting read. I really enjoyed the story of Janey WIlcox. I have met my fair share of gold diggers and she is a very spunky character. The other stories were okay, but they seemed awfully familiar. Bushnell is incredibly talented. She talks about sex, money and lavish lifestyles with a great deal of knowledge and soul. I just wish she'd write something with fewer cliches."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"There are way too many people taking this book way too seriously. First, do not expect &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot; This is a different set of women. Sure they are Manhattanites with killer tongues and great fashion sense, but the similarities with her first four characters end there. These women should know better, they are often unrealistic, horribly self-centered, and perhaps we don't know know anyone like them. But they do exist, even if only in this book. No matter, they are great fun to get to know as characters, even if we don't like them. I think Ms. Bushnell is sharp, witty, has a great ear for dialogue and can certainly spin a yarn. People are calling the work &quot;trashy&quot;. Perhaps. Perhaps Ms. Bushnell is a new-millenium Jacqueline Susann. But I most enjoyed the ride she took me on!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Perhaps the most loved and the most reviled &quot;character&quot; in American pop culture, &quot;the blonde bombshell&quot; is traditionally revered by men and loathed by women....Thankfully, Candace Bushnell blurs the lines a little bit in FOUR BLONDES. Her blondes are gorgeous and rich, but their sharp tongues and bad attitudes aren't designed to win points from all men. And women will be quick to point out that Bushnell's characters are fiercely ambitious and sharp-witted -- a far cry from the trite &quot;dumb blonde&quot; stereotype.FOUR BLONDES is terribly entertaining -- the characters are fabulously flawed and their predicaments in the world of the rich and famous create a fun backdrop. Don't skip it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book was such a &quot;fun&quot; read. You're not going to have any earth-shattering revealations after reading this book, and it will never make the Oprah Book Club list, but it is a great read. I only wish it had come out earlier in the summer....I would have called this the ultimate beach book. You will love to hate these characters. Blonde, beautiful, talented, rich and living nutty lives! The 4 short stories are just long enough. They leave you wanting to know &quot;just a little more&quot;. If you like Douglas Copeland, Bret Easton Ellis, or just like watching Sex in the City, then you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The language is offensive, the waste of beauty and privilege is despairing...the only reason I gave it a star is that the cover is cute.Candace Bushnell should be in Therapy herself--a waste of time and $$. I won't even donate it to my library."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I love love love this book.It's bold, funny, risky and sexy.I was so sad when i was on the last chapter because that meant that it was over.I'm so reading it again!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have read several of Candace Bushnell's books and this one is my favorite.Now, I am not surprised that this book was not given a high rating nor do I fault the majority of readers for being unable to enjoy this book.Candace Bushness generally writes in a way that a) makes no effort to build sympathy for the main characters and b) does not really develop into a plot.Now, depite fully admitting those two things which many people will inevitably see as flaws, I enjoyed the book and I do not have problems with those 2 things.Her writing is better suited for shorter stories like this one has rather than novels because the no plot thing does get tedius. What Bushnell has going for her is that if you live in NYC and hang out with the elite, you know that these characters are damn real. There are no idealized protagnoists, no people getting into action driven adventures that real people dont have, no benefit of the doubt given to the nature of the Manhattan social climber. The characters are believable, totally three dimensional and darkly compelling because this is the side of human nature that people are usually afraid to even think about let alone try to publish.Its chik lit for the misanthropist inside us, but not all of us. Not all of us love our inner misanthropist."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell's \\"Four Blondes\\" is not what one would expect. The cover art shows four thin, beautiful, apparently happy blondes lounging on a bright pink numeral; in combination with the author's \\"Sex and the City\\" credentials this leads readers to expect a light, upbeat read. Those readers will be disappointed, or at least surprised.\\"Four Blondes\\" is a set of stories (named, in an overly cute conceit, after dyes and bleaching methods) exploring the lives and minds of four New York women, all of whom are beautiful, wealthy, and - yes - blonde. These stories are not the happy, blithe quests for self-actualization or career success or a husband that generally fill the space between pink covers. Instead, they are dark and satirical; the characters struggle with a pervasive depression nominally based on their insufficient conquests or fame or wealth but. The characters rarely transcend their superficiality, which makes \\"Four Blondes\\" a challenging read; the protagonists are generally uninsightful and spoiled. The value of this book is the delicate exposure of these characters' thoughts through first person narrative, diary entries, or the intimate third person, as well as Bushnell's highly readable prose which renders even drug-addled diary entries engaging.The four stories vary in content and tone. In the first, Janey, a model, lives in the summer home of a different man each season; her pursuit of a \\"good summer\\" requires finding a rich man each spring and ignoring those who encourage her to marry. In the second story, Winnie and James struggle with their seemingly perfect marriage; their eventual detente rings with humorous insight. The third story follows the wandering mind of Cecilia, a minor celebrity by marriage with a drug problem. The fourth, shortest, story describes a New Yorker's trip to London in search of a husband. All of these stories are interesting in their own way, and their presentation - together, as a single volume, rather than each expanded to its own novel - lightens the weight of the protagonists' pretensions while illuminating how many ways there are to be successful, gorgeous, and miserable."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I have not read Candice Bushnell's books in order. In fact I read Trading Up first. I really shouldn't have picked this one up at all. The first chapter is pretty good. Then you go to the second chapter which get more boring as it moves, rather crawls along. The third chapter was truely draining but did pick up a bit towards the end. Overall, just leave this one alone."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Yes, it's \\"fast-paced\\" and \\"sassy\\", but I think it's more shallow and obscene than anything.I think a more appropriate title would've been \\"Self-Centered Rich White Society Women With Problems\\", because it basically traces \\"adventures\\" of 4 egotistical New York concubines. Not as in street-prostitutes who work for their money, rather pampered and spoiled-rotten women who will do anything and anyone for designer clothes, a house in the Hamptons, or simply fame. These women will stop at nothing to get to the top, which is never high enough for them. The characters are despicable people, and though it is fiction, it is rather realistic(surely we've all known someone like any of the jerks in this book). After all, isn't all art really an imitation of nature.THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH calls the author \\"Jane Austen with a martini\\". Unfortunately, I haven't read enough of Jane Austen's work to make a truly thoughtful comparison, but I don't think this writing is as a fraction of a percent as well done as Jane Austen's. Moreover, the characters in this book are really all the same. What do the 4 women in this book have in common? a given is that they're all probably blonde (hence the title), but they are all desperate to be rich and beautiful as well as to rub shoulders with others who are even more so. I would recommend THE PREPPY HANDBOOK instead of this one.Candace Bushnell is also the author of SEX AND THE CITY, which I haven't read. Although I enjoyed the HBO television show very much, I probably won't read the book. If you liked THE DIARY OF BRIDGET JONES (I didn't), you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book for my long flight overseas and finished it before we landed.

Having read Sex and the City - and finding it not only difficult to follow, but difficult to relate to, 4 Blondes was a breath of fresh air. In a nut shell, it's four completely different novellas crammed into one book. The first two sections (Nice n' Easy and Highlights-for adults), I felt, were wonderfully entertaining and only wrieked of Bushnell's style. However, the third (Platinum) and fourth (Single Process) sections could have used some work... they lacked her usual flare and wit. Not saying they weren't well written, they simply were not as entertaining as the first half. All in all, I would recommend this book to friends (my copy is currently being lent out) and anyone else willing to take a break from life for a few hours."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"A friend handed me this book. It was like someone handing you a box of oreos. I felt like one of Candace Bushnell's characters as I continued reading this -- like I really should run into the bathroom and shove my fingers down my throat so I could throw up.Are these women supposed to be interesting? One is more despicable than the next. Edgy? How about vulgar and trampy (...). The writing style made it very readable but the characters were incredibly gross (...) -- just like Sex and the City."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is absolutely great!! For those of you who are looking for a challenging read - this is probably not the book for you. I brought this book with me on vacation and I could not put it down!

This book gives you a break from the mundane aspects of life and introduces you to a world which always ends on a good note!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I love \\"Sex and the City\\" so I might've expected more than I got from this book. It was great the way she described the lives of four different, yet alike, blondes. Very sexy and made me think. I would definately recommend this book to all who love a good laugh and great sex fiction."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The writing is funny and sexy, and the thoughts of the women in the stories are similar to thoughts we have all had. On the one hand, you can relate to them because they are just trying to understand how to be a woman in today's society. But on the other hand, you are thanking God that you are not like them! These stories say what some of us are afraid to say out loud. That we don't know how to act as women. Should we be sexy, career women, moms, smart, ambitious, dumb?? Although the women in this book were bitchy, it was liberating to read about them and seeing how, in the end, they stayed true to themselves. No, it is not a &quot;deep&quot; literary work, but it is a good, juicy read that made me think."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"REALLY-TRULY, TRASH! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!

Of course the characters are shallow, materialistic and not the brightest bulbs on the tree. IT'S A BOOK! It's supposed to be entertaining just like TV. I loved the book. I love the show. It's hysterical, light hearted and witty. For those who are looking for an educational, inspiring, and depressing book, go read the biography on JFK. Stay away from the fun books."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought this book was great. Candace isnt afraid to be honest and forward. The book shows you a whole new perspective on life through different types of peoples' lives. if you like sex and the city, or if u like sex but not porn, then u would definitely like this book. candace is completely open and does so in a tasteful way. check it out!!! (my fav blonde is janey. shes cool)..."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book, in my opinion, provides for an entertaining read that will keep one anxious to keep on reading and find out more about the complex characters at the axis of the book. Althogough the charachters are shallow at times and often very repulsive, they are interesting, and in my opinion, a book should not be judged on weather it's characters are appealing (as other people on amazon did). Bottom lin- this is a funny book with sad charachter and if they are so ugly to you that it makes you dpresses, just try to laugh at them and maybe then you can enjoy this great book!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I first found out about Four Blondes while watching a television show about The Hamptons. I happened to be at the library a few days later and I saw this book and the shelf of new releases. Once I checked out the book I started reading it immediately. The book was very funny and entertainging. But there were certain parts of the book a bit too raunchy for myself, I am only [12] years old. However, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's isn't the kind of book where you have to read into everything the author writes or have to interpret it. Although the book seems to revolve around sex, it also tells about the relationships of four women. It may not be a book where you can relate yourself to the characters, but you will certainly laugh at all the idiosyncrisies and mannerisms of the characters in the book. Yes, I would definitely reccomend this book, especially for a summer vacation. It is much more interesting than Patriots by A.J. Langguth which I must read for Advanced Placement U.S. History next year....."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This has to be the worst book ever written. Candance Bushnell should revamp her career choices. This is an insult to not only blondes but women everywhere."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Gee, I can't believe that I bought this book as a birthday present for myself! I could hardly get through the first 20 pages without becoming irritated. I can't keep reading. Who wants to waste their time reading about a bunch of spoiled brats with huge egos? I should have known better. Save your money. What a waste of a trees life!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I came to it having read Bridget Jones, The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing, Confessions of a Shopaholic, etc., and this book was not nearly as good.

I don't watch STC, so I can't say how this compares, but as for the growing genre of Gen XX chromosome lit., there are better reads than this one out there."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I thought this would be a fun, light, summer read. But an amusing page-turner it is not. I haven't read a book in a long time that is so silly and inane. The characters are one dimensional; I don't know why it couldn't have been called &quot;one blonde&quot;, because there is no discernible difference among them. There are no real stories, just pages and pages about nothing. I hear that &quot;Sex and the City&quot; is better (and love the series), but I certainly will not pay full price for it as I did for &quot;Blondes&quot;. I can't even believe such a dumb book is selling well; guess more people should read amazon reviews (as I should have done)."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I love HBO's Sex and the City, so I picked up this book for pure entertainment. Although it kept my attention, and had some funny lines, I didn't think it could be based on any reality. Are girls in New York really that stupid? I think not. It was unusual for me to pick up such a book, I like meatier material. But it was a fun read."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Lame, lame, lame! I couldn't wait to give this book away after struggling with the third and fourth stories for several days and virtually throwing the book at the wall in frustration at such drivel. I really enjoyed the first story of Janey and her search for happiness in the Hamptons (Nice N'Easy), but things went downhill from there. The second story featured an extremely unlikeable harridan, Winnie, and Candace has literally lost the plot with the third and fourth stories. I found these two so irritating and unreadable that I would recommend anyone thinking about getting this book to stop reading it after the second story! She's nasty about English men, which really got my goat (what about Madonna and Guy huh!)so for that alone, she gets a big fat raspberry."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book, I am a fan of Sex in the City and had heard Candace Bushnell on several radio stations promoting this book. Boy, what a let down. I could not find anything interesting about any of these women, it was more despressing that witty. These women had the most boring lives, if New York society if like this, than you can have it. I found the writing to be simplistic and flat. I know why I still like the series, Candance Bushnell is no longer involved with it."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed both Bushnell's previous book: Sex and the City and also the series that came out of it. Thinking I would be titillated by this novel I picked it up and was sadly disappointed. The writing style I adore, that's about the only think I adore. The characters are truly BLONDS of the stereotypes they have become associated with: self absorbed, annoying, pretentious, and living in a vacuum. I really would have loved to give this book five stars but my generosity already inflated it to three stars: that of a mediocre novel, which sadly it is AT BEST."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"OK- so the women in this novel are self-centered, insecure and pathetic but they are sooo intriguing! I loved every inch of this novel! I associated in some way with each of these women and their weeknesses. We can't all be these strong, ambitious women where at the end of the novel all is resolved. That's not life and it is definatley not life in New York. Bushnell has an honest view of New York and the women who move here from far off cities with BIG dreams! Her satirical view of people's obsession with celebrity and the press is equally profound! Three cheers for pure fluff and a good, quick read!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"The first few pages of the book seem useless. Then you enter the life of another blonde, then another, and so forth. At the end, it all comes together and you feel a little better about taking time to read this. As with Sex and the City, it took me awhile to realize there is a little of me in each of these women and I began to identify with them, one by one. I remember the uncertainty of the direction of my life, the questions of love and being true to myself, and now the occasional smugness of marriage. If you like Sex and the City (the novel), Bridget Jones Diary, etc. you will like this one. I read it in 4 days."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Overall each of the four novellas were very interesting to read. Bushnell did a job job of giving each character her own personality.But, I kept waiting for these four women's lives to meet up, and effect eachother in some way, and that never happened. Because it never happened, I felt that there was something lacking in each of the stories because the endings were so open, and there was no sense of closure."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I too was looking for a great mindless read and was truly dissappointed. Ms. Bushnell's characters are so uninteresting that I cared very little about what happened to them. The book does offer an insider's glimpse into the life of the rich, but Ms. Bushnell is unable to give the reader any reason to either love, hate or admire the characters. No interesting plots, no great twists, not even a steamy love scene. Just a &quot;month&quot; in the life of ... The worst part, now I must return Trading Up because I can't imagine reading hundreds of pages about one of these ladies."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Truly disappointing.. since i am a big fan of Sex and the City.The last 2 chapter of the book was so tedious to read because it doesn't make alot of sense."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I grabbed this book thinking it would be one of those fun and easy to read books about a single girl (or in this case girls) in the city. While it is about four single girls in the city, it wasn't nearly the fun book I thought it would be. Each of the four stories came across as very shallow, without a message, and overall dissapointing. The characters rairly had any positive traits, and were in general disgusting people one would not want to meet. The plots were pathetic, and the writing was not great either. Anyone would be better with Bridget Jone's, Nanny Diaries, Fashionista, or any of the other hot and GOOD books about a single girl in the city."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"Candace Bushnell's book 4 Blondes, is a compilation of 4 stories all about characters who are really not very appealing, and therefore difficult to relate to. While the first story is okay, the second story is readable, the third is blah, and the final is an absolute waste of time. I did finish the book, so I guess there was something there that held my attention, but overall it just wasn't up to par."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I needed something fluffy to read for the summer and couldn't believe how fluffy my pick turned out to be! The first few pages of the book you're thinking... this is gonna get better- until the first story ends and you realize- it's NOT getting better.She does a good job of describing things, I think that there is simply not enough to describe. No plot- a book to borrow if you absolutely must read Bushnell, not a buy."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"For the people buying this thinking it's gonna read just like the show Sex and the City, your high expectations will ruin the book. But if you are looking for that non-thinking summer read, this is a great one to read by the pool. If the mixed reviews have you wondering if you should buy it, do what I did & take it out of the library for a test drive.Happy Reading All :)"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am a big fan of Candace Bushnell's breakthrough book SEX AND THE CITY which was made into a TV Series. It was explicit, it was sassy, it had personality. The characters were well developed and easy to relate to or root for. Sadly, the characters in Bushnell's 4 BLONDES book, are not. The first story I found interesting enough, about a woman in New York who every year tries to find a man to be with so she can stay in his summer place. She certainly hangs around some colorful men, most times ending up disapointed. It was the only story I could really invest in. The other three, were hard to get into, and to enjoy. I couldn't sympathise with these characters, or even the first. There was little room for character development, which is disapointing, after the great characters that came from SEX AND THE CITY like Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha. With these characters I didn't really get into them or really care, it just felt like they were victims and did little to remedy their situations. Overall, it's an alright book, but definately not up to par with SEX AND THE CITY, which is understandable, since that bar is high."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"This book is not even worth 1 star! Save your money, don't spend it on this garbage."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"I am sure those who published this book never read it!!It's totally awful!!I couldn't go from the second page on...Don't buy it - it's throwing out your money!"},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"...My question is, do you have to like a character to like the book? I don't think so -- think of all the great villians (Iago,...) we love to hate. These characters are not likeable -- they are sad, fashion obsessed freeloaders who have no talents or drive. But, that is part of the fabric of the novel which aims to create an almost surrealistic portrait of these pathetic characters as they struggle along in their own little world.That's what makes the book so terrifically funny! The characters take themselves oh-so-seriously, but we don't have to. With that being said, I really enjoyed all the novellas in this collection. I have not read or watched Sex in the City, so I can only consider this book on its own. The story about the &quot;princess&quot; was priceless -- she's so &quot;on&quot; with her portraits of label-toting egoists that you'd feel at home if you met them. The first story about the Hamptons is excellent as well. Especially if you are familiar with New York, this collection will be enjoyable. I wonder if they were all real blonde or not...."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"To enjoy FOUR BLONDES, a reader really has to love this kind of story--the search for &quot;Mr. Right&quot; (or even &quot;Mr. Right Now&quot;). If you do, then FOUR BLONDES will hit the spot: The four stories are sharp and witty and, most of all, well-written. I liked it much more than other recent &quot;chic chick&quot; books (like BRIDGET JONES or ANIMAL HUSBANDRY) because it dips beneath the surface sizzle of the characters' fancy lives and delves into the sour side of the high life.My favorite of the four stories is &quot;Highlights (For Adults)&quot; and while it's not laugh-at-loud funny, I smiled a lot and nodded my head in recognition of the smug characters--a husband and wife, both writers, whose marriage is falling apart. The wife, Winnie, even aims her acid viewpoint at those of us who &quot;dare&quot; to write customer book reviews...:&quot;Ever since [Winnie] discovered the site, she hasn't known what to think. Part of her is outraged. These people shouldn't be buying books. They are too stupid to read...what right does some git in Seattle who's probably never written more than e-mail have the right to pan it? To tell others not to buy it? Winnie is outraged.&quot;The saddest story is &quot;Platinum&quot; about a woman who ruthlessly climbs the social ladder only to realize she doesn't like the view from the top rung. The writing style reminded me a bit of my favorite Truman Capote short story &quot;La Cote Basque.&quot;FOUR BLONDES won't change your life, but it's a tasty book and compulsively readable. It's like eating one of those small boxes of Godiva truffles---rich, satisfying, sinful and though not &quot;good for you&quot; it's sometimes necessary to get you through a rough patch."},{"Title":"4 Blondes","review":"...vapid.

The fog-shrouded buildings, the rolling streets, and the marked diversity of its citizens seem to have been created expressly for mystery, intrigue, and suspense. Writers from Dashiell Hammett to Robert B. Parker to D.W. Buffa have used San Francisco either during part of or the entirety of one or more novels, and to wonderful effect.SACRIFICE is the third of Clyde Phillips's novels to feature San Francisco Police Inspector Jane Candiotti. SACRIFICE is a study in contrast: it begins with the murder of Philip Iverson, a man wealthy almost beyond imagining, on the most gratifying night of his life. It is followed closely by the murder of Willie Temple, a man whose life has been on a downward spiral for decades. Candiotti's homicide team --- a team that includes her husband, detective Kenny Marks --- is assigned to both homicides. Iverson's murder is given the expected priority, yet Candiotti, despite pressure from the mayor on down, refuses to simply neglect Temple's murder, even when there is subtle pressure to do so. As the murders of both of these very different men are investigated, it is slowly but painstakingly determined that neither their lives nor their deaths are quite what they seemed to be.Candiotti's team, through good, old-fashioned police work, also discovers the tenuous, random connection between the men that resulted in the death of one of them, a discovery that places Candiotti in life-threatening danger from two wholly unexpected sources. Phillips plays the story out against the stark backdrop of a city that suffers from a slow internal decay, while nonetheless maintaining an external beauty and keeping the reader on a roller coaster ride of suspense. Phillips also continues to develop the characters, and relationship, of Candiotti and Marks. Their professional and personal relationships do not always mesh well --- Nick and Nora, they're not --- but Phillips infuses them with a willingness to make things work that is at once refreshing and realistic.SACRIFICE continues the tradition that began with FALL FROM GRACE and BLINDSIDED, while furthering the development and evolution of Candiotti and Marks. Phillips's ability and inclination to keep his characters fresh and yet familiar bodes well for future volumes of this series --- and for Phillips's growing number of readers.

What a mistake that will be! It merits a wide readership. Not only will it inspire teachers and buoy their resolve, it will significantly enlighten those who do not teach ... at least not in a classroom. Of course, all of us do teach children and adults with both negative and positive outcomes, whether or not we are aware that we are doing so, and much of the quoted wisdom is applicable far beyond the formal classroom.The author has assembled observations that vividly demonstrate for the reader just how difficult it is to spend one's workday in the company of young students and to be productive in one's endeavors with and for them. Consider, for example, a teacher's comment that a first day in an elementary classroom was like trying to hold thirty-five corks under water at the same time. That vivid picture makes one wonder why anyone would willingly attempt to teach!A philosopher, who may or may not ever have been a teacher, observes that when children are forced to learn, they acquire a loathing for knowledge. Sadly, too, though many of us recognize that the critically important contributions of teachers to society are neither fully recognized nor credited, very few of us do anything at all to remedy that deficit.So given such a depressing view of teaching, is it possible that the old saw, \\"Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach,\\" might be true? Are those individuals who enter the classroom simply incapable of loftier pursuits? Surely we all know that the answers to those questions for the vast majority of teachers are \\"No.\\" Teachers teach, most often because they are creative, kind, giving individuals, and because there are great rewards for them as practitioners of this worthy profession. Happily, these latter opinions are amply reflected in \\"The Quotable Teacher.\\" The editor has gleaned wonderfully apt remarks not only about teachers but also about the philosophy and creativity of teaching. His comments prefacing each section are insightful and appropriate, and one senses that he knows firsthand both the challenges and the wonders that teachers routinely encounter.Not only do I recommend this book and plan to keep a copy of it on my bookshelf, I also intend to place it into the hands of a young friend who is a new teacher this school year. She feels inadequately prepared and truly scared as she begins a career in a high school classroom. She knows that every day she will find disinterested and rebellious young people among the serious students.She wonders whether her teaching will be sufficiently skilled to reach those who are not willing to invest anything in learning. When she is discouraged, as she surely will be, dipping into the wisdom of this book may help ... at least, a little.A good man, who also is a fine teacher, anticipates with dread the frustrations of another year in a middle school. As he weighs the pros and cons of a midlife career change into the business world, he speaks with some bitterness about the conditions of teaching. His decision may already have been made, in which case this book will be too late. Nonetheless, I will place it into his hands with the thought that something therein might reignite the sentiments that brought him into the profession and might forestall his decision to leave it.\\"The Quotable Teacher\\" is easy reading, the kind of book to dip into for a few minutes again and again. Whether reading it straight through from beginning to end, or opening it to a page at random, the reader almost certainly will find a thought that will linger. I, for one, like that ... a lot.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Ice Man (Frozen in Time, Group 1)","review":"I must have ordered too fast and did not notice this is a children's book. I am going to find a child to give it to. It is sophisticated and interesting with some good illustrations. Its one bad point is that it spends time commenting on the Spindler hypothesis of how this ancient man came to his death.

When he doesn't recognize her, Rose breathes a sigh of relief and doesn't mention that they've known each other.As soon as he hears Rosalyn's musical laughter, Xavier decides he's going to have her. Nothing will stop him. Meeting her face to face clinches his plans. She is Maylyn; the woman who spent a night with him then disappeared without a trace.Knowing that Jaime's grandfather is a stickler for propriety, Rose is asked to be Ann's chaperone while the engaged couple visit Xavier's family home in Spain. Rose reluctantly agrees, although to her way of thinking, anywhere near Xavier is not her idea of rest and relaxation.Once there, Xavier admits to Rose that he knew immediately when they were introduced who she was. Believing a friend's lies about Rose and wanting revenge for what she supposedly did, Xavier blackmails her into marriage. If she doesn't say \\"yes\\", he has the power to ruin Ann's upcoming marriage. Unable to refuse because Ann would be devastated, Rose complies with Xavier's demands. Can a marriage begun in revenge become a marriage of love?A MOST PASSIONATE REVENGE is just that....passionate. It has the ultimate alpha hero, hard and formable on the outside, yet soft and warm on the inside after he gets his ladylove. A strong heroine who has deep feelings for everything she believes in. You will love reading Xavier and Rose's story. Both are passionate individuals who overcome past issues to find love again."},{"Title":"Most Passionate Revenge (Presents Passion) (Presents, 2137)","review":"Ten years ago Xavier Valedspino and Rosalyn \\"Rose\\" May shared a night together. A very passionate night, but when Xavier was called away Rose was given of some hard truths (you know they weren't), and hightailed it out of there. Xavier has never forgiven her and now she is within his reach again. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.It wasn't a bad read. I wished that the older Xavier would have cut her some more slack given her age, as readers do for the younger Hs, but alas he did NOT. He blackmails her to get what he wants and of course can't trust the explanation she gives him. In essence Rose didn't trust one of the parties to hold true and so Xavier very easily blackmailed her. I did like that at least Rose tried to move on from him though. Of course Xavier moved on and even married - this was part of the problem they had all those years ago.Xavier can't trust her and she really shouldn't trust him as he twists things to suit himself. He seems to lie a few times. At one time he says he doesn't need a mistress that he already has one, this implies it is going on now, and yet that changes later as he claims he hadn't made love in 6 months. So why the mistress on the scene that is calling him? I guess it's the old clich&eacute; plot device. Xavier doesn't want to discuss the past, but when it rears its ugly head as it undoubtedly does he is pushed to almost hitting her. And it didn't sound like a slap either. Something about fingers curling into a fist!Also this woman that pops in and out that Xavier couldn't even bother to introduce Rose too, what is up with that? Claims she is a friend of his late wife but Xavier is rude enough not to introduce Rose to her and he seems to allow this woman to cling to him at other times. Why would this woman even attend his father's funeral if she is not even his friend? It doesn't make sense. The truth about their time long ago comes out, Xavier holds true to his grudge holding and all is resolved. Overall it was a decent read and I believed that Xavier cared about Rose."},{"Title":"Most Passionate Revenge (Presents Passion) (Presents, 2137)","review":"Even though the leads in this book did some stupid things, I really liked this book. Maybe it was the humanity of the hero or the fact that the heroine-atyoically for a Harlequin, was educated and self supporing.What ever it was, really worked for me. I will be looking for more works by Ms Baird."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"Zeldin explains his intentions of writing this book to stimulate conversion. It certainly has done this in my life. I have discussed this book with people who have not read it. Passionate conversation has resulted.I have learned quite a bit about myself from this book. For example, I learned I am an elocutionist. Zeldin points out in a historic account that elocutionists focus more on the form (proper grammar/style) rather than depth in conversation. I may now overcome some prejudices I have when people fall out of form.Perhaps one of the most fascinating ideas he presents is that conversation with like minded people can become boring. Upon learning this I went straight to someone with conflicting views and had an argument with them. The emotions that came from that conversation were overwhelming and appreciated by both of us. I have the book to thank for this.36 prints of artwork that are similar to what you see on the cover are contained within the pages. I also have enjoyed discussing this art with people.The book fulfills its promise to stimulate conversation. I highly recommend this quick read to anyone interested in the dynamics of conversation, even if you are shy or quiet."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"This is a beautifully produced small hardcover on glossy paper to include the author's provocative marbleized drawings. The author was described by the Independent on Sunday (London) as \\"one of the forty world figures whose iseas are likely to have a lasting relevance to the new millennium,\\" and is a member of the BBC Brains Trust, the British Academy, and the European Academy. So what's the problem? Maybe I'm just not smart enough to get it, but this book seemed insubstantial to me. \\"We need a new conversation,\\" Zeldin repeats, new ways of talking with each other within and about work, love, technology, family, but the proposals and examples never come. He's studied conversation, and had innumerable conversations with people all over the world, but how would one characterize these as \\"new\\" or \\"old\\"? Unfortunately, the book does not live up to the promise of its subtitle.The final chapter, \\"How Conversation Encourages the Meeting of Minds,\\" on providing hospitality to strangers to enrich the family dialogue, and the 36 conversational topics at the end, were the most practical of the book. But a book I had looked forward to giving as a gift fell short of my hopes for stimulating thought and community through conversation."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"I heard about this book on an old radio interview with the author, Mr. Zeldin. I was impressed enough to buy the book. I think the ideas in the book are way ahead of our times, which is why I'd like to recommend it to everyone. It's a fast read, you can get through it in an afternoon easily. But the ideas are as profound as those in A Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. I'm sure I'll read this book over and over at odd times."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"With this book, Theodore Zeldin reminds us that the thoughts we translate from electrical charges spurting about our craniums into lines of airborne vibrations named WORDS are so powerful. Each composition of sentence can serve as a tool to 'change the world'. This potentiality gives 'gift' to our listener as it gives 'gift' to us. Such potentiality allow transcending the moment of NOW into the sphere of CHANGE. Zeldin's brief historical study of conversation reminds us of the opportunity to affect another person: at mind/soul level. Our thoughts truly are 'tools' to teach others. The randomness of prattle is urged to be replaced by the potent and influential weight of words that may register on the inner recording devices of another human. In that considered act (forming sentences of worth) one learns/relearns the value of Jesus implied when he said &quot;whenever two or more of you are gathered together, there I am with you also.&quot; Do slip this book into your hands and those of your language intimates! It will yield the deepened relationships for which we ALL yearn (marriages included)."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"First, I love Zeldin's manner of thinking. His intellect connects amazingly well with reality! What a joy and an exception. This book is suprisingly powerful in its combination of insight and simplicity. You will find yourself saying over and over, \\"I knew that!\\" but in a way that indicates you didn't know it in the way Zeldin just said it. A MAJOR added benefit of this work is the collection of color plates, paintings by Zeldin that he uses so well to illustrate his verbal points of connection. The colors are amazing and the connections are right on. Superb!"},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"A very objective and well written book.If you want to improve your relationship with people in general so read this book"},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"I recently participated in a book club in which we discussed Zeldin's, &quot;An Intimate History of Humanity&quot;, and a friend gave me his new, little book to compare his approach to a different subject matter. Since I am an artist, she wanted me to also critique the illustrations. I was unexpectedly impressed by the beauty and charm of the original art work, and realize that Zeldin is not only a great thinker, but also an original artist, so the book is now on my Christmas list as a lovely gift for someone who can benefit from his words of wisdom about &quot;talking&quot; as well as enjoy the elegant, colorful expressions of conversation."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"I am very happy with the product, because t is what it said to be, and it arrived timely. That is it."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"Learned in its own way, this book is basically a romantic rumination rather than a scholarly examination of a topic -- conversation -- that today attracts more careful minds. Deriding in its early pages how-to-win-in-conversation books, Zeldin advocates a new form of conversation that involves greater levels of openness, creativity, etc., etc. While it is hard to disagree (&quot;no more creativity!&quot;), this hardly bespeaks any understanding of how conversation actually works, for which one is better referred to research in sociology, sociolinguistics, and related fields."},{"Title":"Conversation: How Talk Can Change Our Lives","review":"When I noticed all the positive reviews of this book, I wondered if the world has gone mad. But then I remembered that the world does have a significant problem with too much use of intellect and too little use of common sense.One sentence should make my point. \\"It's up to us to decide on the kind of conversations we have.\\" Who else might it be up to? Was a less relevant sentence ever committed to print? And he actually opens a chapter with it. He commits far worse sins in this book than that, but there is no need to detail them. All I want to say is that it is rubbish from one end to the other.But others say, \\"extraordinary\\", \\"brilliant\\", \\"charming\\", \\"exuberant\\", \\"engaging\\", \\"delightful\\", \\"stimulating and provocative\\", \\"erudite and funny\\". And on and on. But I'm not taking it back. It's either them or me. Make up your own mind. But don't say I didn't warn you.Finally, I'll quote this, \\"They confirm me in my belief ...\\". In good English this would read, \\"They confirm my belief ...\\". But for disconnected individuals like him, it's all about \\"me\\". You can search inside this book.

I wanted to reduce my rating, because now that I have a better appreciation of typography I realize just how bad this book really is.]You'll find a few clear explanations with useful examples in this book, so, if you're a novice, there's no denying that you'll learn something by reading it.But the author has the terrible habit of treating the reader as if they were complete idiots, and her patronizing tone really got on my nerves more than once. She cautions the reader with \\"don't be dumb\\" at least a dozen times, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.Basically, the author seems to believe that she's the most brilliant genious ever to have walked the surface of this planet and she really thinks she knows what's right and what's wrong. You'll also get advice like \\"you thought that this was right, but now you know it's wrong, so don't be dumb\\" all the time. It bothers me that anyone can behave as if they were the sole guardians of The Truth. This book could have been called The Gospel According to Robin Williams.Another aspect that bothered me is that, in the name of \\"good design\\", the book uses a third more paper than it really should. Its extra-tall format makes it seem to be denser, but in fact most pages have only been printed on the top half. Oh, and Robin Williams also mentions her other books in most chapters, so if you were to follow her advice to the letter you'd end up with the full collection of her books."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I didn't think I needed this book until I saw what I was missing. This is an invaluable reference and resource for anyone who makes their living with desktop publishing. Gracefully designed and presented, this manual concerns anything that anyone reads. The subjects cover a brief history of typefaces (fonts) and all the basics including: legibility, punctuation, spacing, typeface choices , and much, much more. After reading this book just once through, you can advance yourself to the head of the class. You will refer to this book for years to come."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I have been reading Robin Williams' books since \\"The Mac is Not a Typewriter\\" came out.This author gives great, clear information that will help with the look of anything that you produce in print. (Or on the web)If you aren't a designer, or aren't particularly artistic, like me, you will benefit from this book because she gives clear examples of how to catch the reader's eye, and gives examples of pitfalls to avoid.There are also some who are a little too artistic for their own good. This book will help them avoid over-embellishing to the extent that their message doesn't get accross.A good buy for anyone who has to communicate in print. It doesn't matter if it's ad copy, a report for the boss, or your book, web site or menu."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"It was as if the knowledge of a schooled graphic artist gave us the highlights of all she learned in her history of studies on the subject of typography and graphic layout design.

Thank you Robin..."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"A brillant read. This book addresses different typograhic styles, the correct use of grammer, legibility issues of different fonts and the design approaches to adjust fonts in popular design software. I think the title 'non-designer' is a little misleading as this book benefits experienced professionals as well."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"This is a handy basic introduction to type design issues. But it is marred by some of the author's eccentric beliefs, stated as facts.First of all, whatever you think of Helvetica (and I'm not a fan), I don't think it's showing any signs of fading from our public spaces, more's the pity.Second (and related to the above), her fondness for wacky, eye-catching, \\"novelty\\" typefaces is going to lead many people in quite the wrong direction. If you're designing a club flyer or a magazine ad., maybe it's useful advice; but, if taken to heart by a beginner, it would be a disaster for the production of readable, proportioned, pleasing typography in long texts. As for her defence - without a word of caution - of the use of bold italics for emphasis: I'm afraid that just makes me shudder! As a book editor as well as a typesetter myself, I can't tell you how many wasted hours I've had to spend removing such typographical detritus from the texts of authors who should have known better. Now I know where they might have got the idea from...Finally, a smaller point, which may be to do with a difference between US and British usage, but of which UK users of this book should therefore be aware. To my mind, it is ugly and unwarranted (I'll just say it: illiterate!) to follow an italicised word or phrase contained within a roman paragraph with italic punctuation (or bold with bold, or whatever - see p. 67). Punctuation outside an emphasised phrase does not belong to that phrase, but forms part of the scaffolding that holds the phrase in place. Like all scaffolding, it shouldn't bend under the influence of what it's supporting, but should damn well stay put! (Don't just take my word for this - see section 6.6 ofThe Oxford Style Manual.) Lamentably, though, this does seem to be the general advice offered in most US texts on the subject. (And I'm not a knee-jerk opponent of US practice. The so-called \\"Oxford comma\\", prevalent not just in Oxford but in the US, though frowned upon by many UK style guides - and by Lynne Truss, I believe - seems to me like a very sensible thing.)"},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I feel bad for doling out a single star, but as a professional designer in the sales and marketing field, I can't help but be horrified after reading this book. I know that many unknowing individuals who want to learn about design and typeface will find this book, and not knowing any better, decide to base their design approach on the principles within.I'm not sure what niche or genre Robin William's design approach fits best, but one thing I am certain is that it's not in the world of mainstream graphic design. It seems to me that her design theory is stuck in the 1992 desktop publishing era.The most compelling evidence I can offer for my position is the design of this book itself. Compare its design side by side with any modern marketing piece or national magazine. Take a look at her Website \\"ratz.com\\" Do you really want someone who serves up her own Website like this to teach you design?The table of contents is as horrific example as any. It seems a concerted effort was made to pick as many of the goofiest and unprofessional typefaces as possible and fit them on the same page. Turn to page 19-20, the first transition page between chapters. Can you imagine a fortune 500 company publishing a piece with five font changes within a couple paragraph lengths of copy?The single worst piece of advice I've ever read on design is contained with this book. On page 188 she lists the number one \\"telltale sign of desktop publishing\\" is use of Helvetica typeface.The exact opposite is true. If there is one single piece of advice that could be given to a \\"non-designer\\" for making their publication appear professional it would be to use Helvetica.It's an undisputed fact that a majority of professional copy is presented in Helvetica typeface. Look at any major magazine, sign, or advertisement and you're probably looking at Helvetica. Look at the publications of design leaders like Apple, the New York Design Center, [...], etc. Look at the productions of polished professional brands like Crate and Barrel, Target, Macy's, or Nike . . . almost all major brands have one thing in common, Helvetica!The use of Helvetica to establish a foundation of professional design is probably the most established axiom of professional design. It's so substantial, a full-length documentary was recently released on the topic: [just google Helvetica movie]If your goal is to produce a publication that will be perceived as professional and establish immediate credibility please please run from this book."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I have to begin by saying that I have absolutely no experience in design or artwork. I have taken on a project (not exactly voluntarily) which I would prefer doesn't look completely amateurish by the time I finish. I got this book to give me some sort of reference in something I know I'm way over my head on.It covers everything that an amateur needs to know; it is fairly well indexed so I can locate it quickly; it doesn't go into unnecessary detail, just the to-the-point-basics. It is perfect for someone who doesn't have time to read the whole book and just needs to look up specific aspects of design as the need arises; it is not only well-written, but also well-illustrated. So far, everything I've needed is there.Having said this, I think that someone who already knows the basics or has design experience might find the tone of the book a little bit arbitrary or pedantic. In questions of taste or style there has to be a little more leeway for personal preference than this book would indicate.The author does have rather firm ideas of what is right and what is wrong and how things must be done. I tend to agree and do things his way because I don't know anything different and I desperately need strict guidelines since I don't have time to experiment or develop my own style.People who know more than I about the subject might or might not agree with all he says. But I think everyone will find this book useful at least as a source of reference or a starting point."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I had to buy this book for the Graphic Design program I am currently enrolled at Montgomery College in Rockville MD.

The Amazon blurb doesnt mention this but the Peachpit Press website does."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"This book provided me with tons of valuable information on typography, such that even with my experience in desk-top publishing and web design, I learned a great deal.The only drawback for me was that I found the author's style sometimes annoying and demeaning. The book is replete with comments like &quot;don't be dumb&quot;, and frankly, I think the same information could be presented in an equally light and humorous manner without constantly implying that if the reader hasn't or doesn't follow all of the author's tips to a &quot;t&quot;, he/she is somehow stupid, ignorant, etc. I would've enjoyed the book a lot more if Ms. Williams had treated her readers like equals. Teaching is never as effective when the students are being demeaned."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"Robin Williams covers just what you really need to know in this short book. No useless chatter, just important information in a what-to-do and what-not-to-do manner with just the perfect dash of sarcasm and humour to create a relaxed atmosphere for learning.The book begins with a bit of the history and structure of fonts. Very important information for beginners. But it immediately gets into information which results in an immediate improvement in your work whether you are a typesetter or graphic designer. You would now know what makes for tacky typography and what rules you could break to create a more artistic, daring, and edgy piece of work.Every topic is accompanied by an illustration of the wrong way and the right way to do things and a list of the fonts used in the illustration (VERY HELPFUL!)This is definitely a must-have book for anyone in the world of print media."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"In my opinion, the &quot;Non-Designer's Type Book&quot; should just be considered &quot;Volume II&quot; of a boxed set with the &quot;Non-Designer's Design Book.&quot; Its introduction to basic typography--the design and use of letters--is as elegant and understandable as the first book's introduction to graphic design.From a basic history and classification of typefaces, to suggestions for how to mix and match them, Williams gives you all the basic advice you need to ensure that your work will never look like it was created by a chimpanzee hitting keys at random.As always, Williams teaches sound principles, which you can apply again and again, but backs them up with a host of examples and alternatives. First things, first, though: Read the Non-Designer's Design Book first before you &quot;graduate&quot; to typography!"},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"While the title suggests it's a weak primer for amateurs it is actually an excellent read for all those needing to review the basics of typography. Your work will look better and your confidence will improve after reading this book.

I bought it cluelessly as there is no indication on the cover. A bit of a sales scam behind a generally good book."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I generally find typography one of those dry, tedious details I have to know to as part of my job. But THIS book makes it approachable, understandable, interesting, and even entertaining. As titled, this is a book for NON-designers - people who aren't usually interested in this stuff unless compelled to be, and who don't have a lot of time to learn it. If you're looking for something edgier or for &quot;breaking the rules,&quot; this is not the book to start with. However, if you're one of those people with a thousand fonts on your computer and only about 3 you ever use, this book will open your mind to the possibilities."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"I'm a big fan of the author, but I feel this is not one of her best books. She clearly illustrates all the important type concepts, but the book felt too long for the amount of information presented.I love her \\"The Non-Designer's Design Book\\" which concisely covers some of the same information. I've recommended the \\"Design Book\\" to lots of people but cannot think of anyone I'd recommend the \\"Type Book\\" to. I would have preferred it as a quick reference companion to the \\"Design Book\\", maybe at half its current size."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"When I picked up this book, I figured that the title, &quot;The Non-Designer's Type Book,&quot; meant that it was a book about type, FOR non-designers. After reading it, from cover to cover, I now wonder if the title refers to the author's credentials rather than the book's target audience. I love typography. I sit in theaters and watch every minute of the rolling credits if the font used is well chosen and well displayed. I have a Caslon 540 lower-case &quot;g&quot; pinned to the wall above my Mac instead of swimsuit pics. If you love type, you know what I'm talking about. If you love type, avoid this book and do not recommend it to anyone who hopes to someday love typography and master its use. Robin Williams' cutesy and heavy-handed text, while sometimes informative, is loaded with irritating &quot;insights&quot; as well as written-in-stone directives that are passed off as law. For instance, in at least two places, she states that type should NEVER, EVER be underlined. She says that it's a &quot;law&quot; that should &quot;never&quot; be broken. C'mon Robin! I mean yes, underlining is very often misused, but have you looked at the latest PRINT or CA Annual? There is a time and a place for underlining and the sensitive, savvy designer knows when and how to do it. She outright trashes one of the most elegantly designed faces in the history of the printed word, Helvetica, and glibly states that it will be out of style for the &quot;next two hundred years.&quot; What?? Again, has Ms. Williams even looked at what contemporary (and effective) designers are doing these days? Helvetica is alive and flourishing. And, at the same time she is trashing Helvetica, she calls &quot;rendered&quot; type (such as 3D effects, letters that appear to be chiseled from stone or made of, say, salad greens) typography's &quot;most beautiful&quot; trend. She's killin' me!! If you want to fulfill and expand your appreciation for typography, buy Robert Bringhurst's exquisite manual, The Elements of Typographic Style."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"Designers, don't let the title scare you. This is not a dumbed-down guide for amateurs. Yes, it's a great resource for amateurs and they will understand it, but it's also a wonderful guide for professional designers who need to review professional-level typography. It's a must-have reference in my library. Includes lots of ideas on layout, fonts you can use in different situations, fonts that complement each other, increasing legibility and special typographic effects."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"Contrary to the reviewer below, this book is most definitely a book about type for non-designers. I too love typography. Mantis neglects to mention, in his diatribe about underlining, that Ms. Williams makes it perfectly clear that a rule (line) integrated into the typographic design is entirely different from the underline feature that you hit with a keystroke. She advocates never hitting that keyboard shortcut, and she is correct. Ms. Williams also makes it clear she is creating guidelines for non-designers who need clear boundaries when they first begin, and that once you know the rules, you can break them with glee. Like Helvetica -- a very skilled designer can override the 1970s look that inevitably comes with Helvetica, just as a very skilled designer can work with art deco fonts and create a new look with them. But beginning designers aren't there yet, so Robin suggests some boundaries.I found this book to be much more practical for the millions of people who are just discovering that there is more to type than \\"block text.\\" Bringhurst's book is beautiful and philosophical and something to aspire to, but for nuts and bolts and clear guidelines that work on the page, The Non-Designer's Type Book is a must!"},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"Robin Williams does such a great job explaining design concept's to &quot;non-designers.&quot; I feel like she's teaching me. Here, she turns her attention to typography. Anyone could learn a great deal about typography without having read any other books on the subject from this book. Williams, being a designer, takes a visual approach to teaching typography and has a humorous way of hammering important points into your head. Not only will you be more sensitive to how type works after reading this book, but you will know the terminology of typography and, most importantly, know how to use type well and creatively."},{"Title":"The Non-Designer's Type Book","review":"As an avid reader and (some would argue) somewhat-successful writer, I spend a lot of time looking at the printed word.

But it's really hard sometimes to know exactly why. Williams demystifies the whole world of print design in such a way that even a novice like me starts to \\"get it\\". Her explanation of font styles and when to use what should be required reading for everyone putting words to paper. Just because you can use 10 fonts in a report doesn't mean you should. Going a little deeper, you learn about kerning (spacing between letters) and how that can be adjusted for the best visual results. All of these subjects continue to build on each other, and by the end of the book you have a solid foundation on the subject. What makes the book even better is that her writing style is conversational and somewhat irreverent, and there are an abundance of examples on nearly every page. Even if you already know a particular rule (such as using smart quotes or hanging punctuation), the visual nature of her writing can be used to glean ideas for your own work. Reference and inspiration in a single volume is a hard thing to accomplish, but she pulls it off with ease.This is another one of those books that will stay close at hand. This will probably be more of a \\"stay at home\\" book, as that's where a lot of my writing takes place. But it's guaranteed to get slotted in next to all my other volumes that allow me to make-believe I'm a writer. Great book..."},{"Title":"Your Skin and Mine","review":"This book is good for an introduction into hygiene. The lesson on skin gives a good foundation on the body's defense of germs. Used correctly, students will be able to see how hygiene fits into the infection control equation, whether at home, school or play. When they know that the body is better when their defense is high, they can continually act responsibly to have better health. This book is best when paired with a hygiene lesson or other infection control activity (environmental cleaning, hand washing, etc.).OUTFOXOUTFOXprevention.com"},{"Title":"Your Skin and Mine","review":"My two girls loved this book. My 4-year-old really enjoyed looking at her skin under the magnifying glass."},{"Title":"Your Skin and Mine","review":"My five year old is intrigued by this book. Although the book suggests using a magnifying glass to do so, the observations it asks the reader to make can largely be done by the eye. I read it to him at night and, lying in bed, he and I look at our own skins and spot the similarities and differences in a gentle game of observation. It encourages the act of looking at the familiar with a new and curious eye. And the information it gives is solid and uncondescending."},{"Title":"Your Skin and Mine","review":"Detailed explanations on the two layers of skin and feeling your skin. Your Skin and Mine centers around four kids, Mary, Henry, Mark and the other one is a boy who is telling the story and never offers his own name for the reader to learn. On page 24 they go into detail on melanin, which is grains of color to protect the body from the sun. He states that Mark's skin makes a lot of this while Henry and Mary's skin does not. There is no explanation on how he knows this or why it is different.He has freckles on his skin and in the summer his skin does not make enough of melanin so he needs to rub on lotion. It is explained that darker skin can get burned by the sun so all should wear sunscreen. Mary and Henry have light brown skin and Mark has dark brown. This boy with freckles is the only one to have white skin.This little boy and his sister helped their Mother clean the attic while wearing their bathing suits. This seemed funny to my son and he wondered why the boy was not wearing a shirt and the girl almost knocked over a lamp while chasing a spider with the broom. It must have been summer time since the siblings went outside to hose off the dirt from cleaning. He said his Mother thought this was easier than washing more dirty clothes. This is one idea I wish that was not in the book, as my son will want to do this as well. The last page has the kids cooling off with lemonade explaining how they were cool on the inside and out.My son did not agree with the toenails and hair cuts not hurting, he did not learn why his fingers get wrinkled and funny looking after taking a bath. Just the past two days we had a new worker in our house and he was full of questions for her as her skin is darker than ours. He wanted to know why her feet were dark, her hair was another shade, how she did the braids and what happened to her nails since they were red. Then he wanted to know about the things in her ears and if they hurt. I still have a need for a book that will help explain differences to my son as this did not really touch upon that aspect. Your Skin and Mine is a nice book but goes off in directions that are of no interest for us at this present time. It would help to know the name of the fourth child and it was not suggested to wear sun glasses, and my son keeps his in his backpack."},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"We'd bought an Eastlake Victorian which had been restored inside and out. As we desired to furnish appropriate to period (1890), this book was a fine beginner's/general guide to style lines, detail, and what to avoid. Also helpful in choosing furniture pieces, draperies, and objets d'art. No color pictures except the cover, so one might want to purchase another similar book with pictures of restored rooms in similar homes for color guidance, trims, room set-up, etc."},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"Moving from a country primitive home to a 1890's Victorian home that needed restoration in every single room, this book was my bible! Charles Eastlake (credited with wonderful Eastlake style)explains how, why and where to do every room from the screens to the windows to the walls to the floors. His simple diagrams and easy to read explanations made restoring much easier. With still a few rooms to finish, the book never leaves my bedside table (which, of course, is Eastlake style!)"},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"Charles Eastlake, (who is credited, innacurately, with the &quot;Eastlake&quot; style of architecture and furniture design) wrote a serialized guide to interior design concepts and theory. He's very opinionated about the evils of modern (c. 1880-90) architecture. I found this to be an enjoyable read, and got some great ideas about the decoration of several rooms in my 1903 Victorian house."},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"Purchased the book because of its influence of this author on William Morris and the later Arts and Craft Movement. The author spoke as an architect who emphasized purchasing well crafted items and goods for the home, and design the entire home with one simple theme throughout the entry hall to the bedrooms. It had an influence on the Arts and Craft designers who started to incorporate textiles, pottery, furniture, and metal works for all of the customer's needs.Beyond the historic references, the book was revealing to the modern designer and family seeking household purchases. All of us inherit lousy furniture and then buy one item at a time, and wonder why the house does not fit together. The author clearly states that we must know and seek out specific items that fit and go together to create a livable"},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"Well-written and informative, but did not fill the need I had. I was looking for something with illustrations and the few line drawings included did not help. Still, I rate it four stars, because it was well-written."},{"Title":"Hints on Household Taste: The Classic Handbook of Victorian Interior Decoration (Dover Architecture)","review":"Great Seller, this is a good book.
