It seems to be written for the lay person which is great! It is in good condition."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This book does not teach \\"how to read\\" but the method makes it possible to learn to read - and even enjoy it.I have 2 children who experience reading difficulty and other dyslexic symptoms (it does run in the family.) They are now 18 and 21, and their stories are amazing - because of the Ron Davis Method and the information in this book.The oldest did everything to avoid reading. In middle school he gave up because he decided the penalties for avoiding school work were better than doing the work. This included grounding, removal from sports, loss of tv/computer, parent joining him in class - basically everything we could think of. After years of tutoring including a good Sylvan Learning program, he was reading at the 4th grade level and hating it. He thought this was his \\"personal best\\" and stopped trying.My daughter thru 5th grade worked every evening up to 5 hours on homework and reading. She was depressed, ridiculed in school as \\"dumb\\" and reading at the 2nd grade level. No tutor seemed to work. She couldn't remember spelling/vocabulary words studied everyday so each day was like a new set. She was unable to focus to read an eye chart although her eyesight was almost normal.Then I found this method from another parent - researched it on the internet and found the only negative was the lack of valid research. At that time I found no negative annocdotal evidence in any searches - only \\"it helped a little\\" to \\"miracles\\" stories. I bought the book and found a certified instructor.Bottom line - After doing this method and about 60 clay words, both children could basically \\"think the clay in their heads\\" for the remaining words and weekly word lists. (We did continue clay if something was too difficult.)Both children jumped to above grade reading levels (2-3 grades above eventually) with 10-15 hours of additional reading tutoring. Neither has needed a tutor since. My son is in his 3rd year of college and loves to read, and my daughter just completed her final year of high school with a last semester 3.8 unweighted GPA (including an AP class) and is attending a top private college next year with a partial academic scholarship.This was the BEST decision we ever made - and saved soooo much money by it being the LAST tutoring we did. The happiness and success of my children is priceless.I now give this book to everyone I know who has a reading problem - adult or child.PS. My sister is a praticing psychologist. Although this method lacks academic support, the ideas of how people think are not radical. She helped us understand why this method could work."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This is a personal note to Sarah: Your review made my heart sing with joy, so thanks for sharing. And congratulations to your son for summoning the motivation to do what he did after having carried a heavy burden of discouragement for a long time.I can't legitimately review this book myself (since I helped write it). I wouldn't give it a rating if Amazon still had a \\"comments from the author\\" option. However, as the co-author, I also want to give maximum credit to the person who put your son through the Davis program. I don't know who that was, since there are now 355 of them around the world, cranking out approximately 10,000 literate kids and adults per year in 22 languages--including Icelandic, Serbian and Indonesian. That's not counting the teachers and homeschool parents who simply read the book and follow the \\"recipes.\\"I am one of the least dyslexic people I know, but I will take a bit of credit: I made sure the book was set in large type (14 point) and contained only a few hyphenations of compound words like \\"know-how.\\" I also insisted on emphasizing the gifted aspect of cognitive disabilities.If anyone doubts that we as a society are wasting tremendous intellectual resources by teaching mainly to the left brain, I recommend a more scholarly book by a dyslexic author: 'In the Mind's Eye' by Thomas G. West. Maybe your son will want to read it, now that he can."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"What I find interesting is that the reviews of this book are mostly extremes. Either they hate it or they love it. What is interesting to note is from where each of those reviews are coming from. Most of the positives come from parents who have had wonderful experiences with their children. Most of the negatives come from people who are or claim to be a specialist in the educational field, and cannot accept something that is introspection based. True, that most of the claims Ron makes are based on introspection, and not scientific deduction, but it makes it no less true.I believe the experiences of numerous parents who have seen success with their children should be at the very least anecdotal proof that it does work. It is hardly scientific, and neither does the Davis method claim to be the fix for everyone. It is a method not meant to be a self help book. It is meant to be done with someone helping the dyslexic and this is where I think some of the adult dyslexics are having problems with this book.I however agree that the language used in the verbal instructions while performing the procedures can be difficult, and can in fact be in and of itself \\"disorienting\\", however an intelligent or perceptive facilitator will spot this and adjust the language to be more appropriate to his subject.This method does not claim to be effective 100% and in fact there may truly be learning disabled people who will not benefit at all from this method, but discounting the testimonials and anecdotal evidence, just because it is non \\"scientific\\" is insulting to the people who have experienced it."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I am an adult with dyslexia.

He is now in third grade and struggling with reading. I have pointed out numerous times to his teachers that I was confused as to why he was having more problems with short words like and, the, and was yet could comfortably read more complex words like basketball. Now I know why - and soon they will too! I've always recognized the fact that my son is very intellegent, however his teachers have made comments to me like &quot;he'll never be a brain surgeon&quot; or &quot; a lot of children with learning disabilities even go to college&quot;.

My mom (who is a teacher) was reading it, and told me that she thought I should read it...so I did. My mouth was literally agape, and my eyes filled with tears, as I began to truly understand myself for the first time. I always got good grades, won spelling bees, and did fairly well in school. Algebra was terrible for me, but I even remember having troubles comprehending things like the ones and tens column in grade school math. My teachers always seemed to be so impatient with me...frustrated that I couldn't understand something that was \\"obviously\\" so very simple. Those feelings have stayed with me through my adult life, and I have struggled greatly with feelings of inadequacy, or feeling stupid...just having a very low self-esteem. I'm a very artistic person, and have always been gifted in that area...and that is where my confidence comes from. I have a lot of \\"issues\\" I guess you could say, that are actually symptoms of dyslexia, and I still struggle sometimes with feeling stupid. But reading this book, and learning all of the things that dyslexia CAN mean (it doesn't just mean numbers getting mixed up or trouble reading...there is SO much more to it than that!), set me free to accept myself the way God created me. I'm not stupid, and there's nothing wrong with me...I make sense now. I can't tell you how liberating it's been. I'm so glad that this is something we are learning about now, so that future generations of children won't go through much of their life feeling less-than. It truly is a gift, if we make the choice to see it that way and embrace all of the good things that come with it. What an excellent book! Never boring, and completely enlightening. :)"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"My son is dyslexic. For years, reading was a source of frustration and inevitable tears. He struggled, I struggled, his teachers struggled. Little improvement was made for years.Then, for 4th grade, I homeschooled him. My father bought me this book. I devoured it. I learned from it and I put it to use. THe changes were dramatic and faster than I could have ever expected.The book explains so much about the nature of dyslexia, and it gives realistic excercises to do. And they are fun to do, so even my reluctant 9 year old was enjoying himself!Now he is in 5th grade back at his old school. And he loves to read! Loves it! He's read Tolkien. He's on book 14 of the Redwall series. He reads everyday, and every night, in the car, in bed, everywhere. I am so grateful, so very grateful for this book.As well as helping us bring the love of reading into my son's life, it also explains some of the benefits of dyslexia. Yes, benefits! Now, my son doesn't feel stigmatized. He is learning to put the strengths he has to use, and this book will help you do the same!A life-changing book, I recommend it for anyone with even a touch of dyslexia. You will find it empowering!"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I have not only read the book, but was also fortunate enough to find a trained Davis facilitator to help my 9 year old son begin the process outlined in the book. My son , Edward is in the 3rd grade at a private school in Nashville, TN. Edward is very smart, but he couldn't learn to read. Yes, he could read with great frustration and &quot;muddle&quot; through, but only at about beginning first grade level.We had him &quot;tested&quot; on the advice of his kindergarten teacher(auditory processing was the diagnosis)and we began the painful tutoring journey with phonics-based programs(Linda-Mood Bell, Orton-Gillingham, Wilson,etc.) In spite of following the &quot;experts'&quot; advice Edward could not read. His teacher and tutor said &quot;he wasn't trying hard enough.&quot; Not trying hard enough? Baloney! I saw daily the look of pain and frustration on my child's face as he struggled to read. He simply had not been given the right tools to decode the English language. Edward is dyslexic. This program has given Edward the tools he needs to be a fluid reader with full comprehension. His self confidence is high and he's having fun. I am greatful to Ron Davis for sharing this information with my child and me. It has changed my child's and my life forever. Thank you."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"A friend loaned me this book when I told her I thought my 9 year old could hardly read. She is extremely bright (GATE child), yet could barely read a beginner's chapter book. It was a fight just to get her to read 10 minutes a day. Her teacher told me she had identified her for remedial reading.I read The Gift of Dyslexia cover to cover in one afternoon. The next day I did the \\"perceptual ability assessment\\" with my daughter, literally reading the script as we went along. She understood right away. The next day we did the \\"orientation counseling.\\" At the end of the session, she was so excited to discover which words were \\"making her brain jump.\\" After that we did the clay letters and clay representations of her \\"jump\\" words. She was retested at school and she now reads above grade level. She also loves to read and is enjoying the Animorphs series.I also use the \\"orientation point\\" when she works on math, specifically math facts. She can now whiz through her multiplication table, and when she gets frustrated, knows that it is the \\"brain jump\\" that occured.I would highly recommend this book, even if your child has not been diagnosed as \\"dyslexic.\\" It has changed the lives of everyone in our household."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This is the most positive and helpful material I have found for working with dyslexic children.

She progressed from a Reading Recovery testing level of 6 (PP2) in October to a level of 24 (3.2) in May. We will continue the words/definitions in clay this summer. I was amazed that she understood what I was asking her to do. I'm not sure I understand it because my mind doesn't work that way. I tried just using Reading Recovery techniques but it wasn't enough. She seemed to need to discovery and control her mind's eye. Her body is so much more relaxed and she doesn't rub her feet on the carpet when she can contol her mind's eye. This book offers a way to help children rather than label them."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"In January of '99 my first grader was completely unable to read.

By April of '99 (3 short months) my daughter was reading at a second grade level! I have since then gone on to complete the program described in the book for other students with good success. One 9 year old girl went from a pre-primer reading level to a 2nd grade reading level in just 5 days! Furthermore, the book offers hope. While dyslexia clearly causes problems it also offers special talents. Knowing what those are enables me to encourage interests where she is naturally gifted.

I joined the military because I was &quot;not smart enough&quot; to go to college. About a month after its initial publication, this book crossed my path quite by chance. My life has changed drastically since finding this book and putting the theories into practice. The first college class I took after working with this book was completed with the first 'A' of my life. I recently received my first college degree and am continuing on for another. While this book gave me the tools to work through college, it also gave me the appreciation of my gift- my strange lifelong ability to use tools and create things with my hands and mind. It finally explained it all. Thank you Mr. Davis, you have altered my life in immeasurable ways. This is a must read for anybody who is dyslexic."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This book has been very useful in helping my 8 year old son who struggles with reading. I homeschool my son and have been working with him on reading using phonics based methods since he was about 6 years old. Phonics is necessary part of any reading program, but we just were not making progress. He could sound out any CVC (consonant, vowel, consonant, like cat) word you gave him, but he had to sound them out EVERY SINGLE TIME even after having read them dozens of times. In spite trying to keep reading low stress and homeschooling to give him more time to develop, he still disliked reading and it was a struggle anytime we worked on this subject. I have checked into many programs for dyslexia, but most of them address phonics based challenges where my son has no problem.This book is the first resource that I have found that seemed like it might address my son's type of difficulties without spending hundreds of dollars a session on a therapy that might or might not be effective. After reading the book I set aside some time to be alone with my son and we did the assessment and orientation activities. We couldn't do it perfectly and had to take lots of breaks because my son is very squirmy, but in spite of our imperfect implementation it gave my son as sense of control over his mind that I had not seen before. We have now done the clay alphabets and are working on spell-read and he is already showing improvement in word recognition. Now, I will give the critics of this book one point, it is not \\"scientifically proven\\" to be effective and I am not sure whether the cause of dyslexia discussed by the author will ever be proven or not. I don't know if it will work for every type of dyslexia, but what it has done for my son is to give him a sense of control when he is trying to read. He is now able to get back on track and doesn't just \\"meltdown\\" when he starts to get confused. I would say for the price of a book and a couple of hours of one on one time that that is a tremendous result! So just ignore the \\"education experts\\", get the book anyway and use what works for you. Also, don't worry about about the mind's eye thing being wierd, it sounds kind of psychic or something, but you could just as easily think of it as a camera lens. It is just point from which you mind sees things. The best example that I can think of to how this works is when you look at a word and the spelling looks wrong even though you know that it is correct, but when you look at the word again later it looks fine. Your mind just automatically corrects what ever it was that made it look funny in the first place. Well basically what these activities seem to do it help the dyslexic use their mind to make the corrections that your mind makes automatically. Not really so strange when you think about it."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I'm a volunteer in a local school and have been working for 20 minutes a day with two girls, 10 and 12 for almost a year. When I started, they were reading at mid second grade level and having trouble. I began researching to see if I could find other methods to help the girls. As I read about dyslexia I became certain this was the issue for one of them. The school purchased the book and the materials for me to utililze with her. We taped her reading before and after my week with her. It is totally unbelievable that this is the same child doing the reading. She is now saying she likes to read, she feels better about herself, and is doing better in other areas. Her current book is about a 6th grade girl with dyslexia, someone she can relate to. We decided to try the program with the ten year old &quot;just in case it might work&quot; and I just completed my five days with her. The results are phenominal. She is reading a fifth grade book and loves it. She has three more books checked out to read when she finishes this one. Before this week, one page tired her. The girls went into the visualization so easily that I doubted my abilities. But they see their dots and know exactly where they are and how to use the technique. We've got a long way to go on the word definitions and time will tell how well it continues to work for each of them. I wonder if this technique would work with other learning gifts! I will be trying it with others, it certainly can't hurt them, providing we make it clear that it might not work. The school, the parents, and I are overwhelmed."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Dear Ron -- I wish I could express how much your book The Gift of Dyslexia has meant to me. It is like you showed me the missing parts of my life and now they fit in the right places. I'm so grateful for your research. Most books about dyslexia are not written to dyslexics - but yours resonated with me. Your simple explanation of the nature of \`intuitive thought' and how a dyslexic knows the answers without knowing why connected my life the same way in the movie The Empire Strikes Back when Luke Skywalker musters the courage to fight but Darth Vader steps back and says: \\"You can't kill me, Luke ...I'm your father!\\" suddenly you understand back over three episodes why Vader never killed his son, you understand why Obi-Wan Kenobi was worried about Luke and the force - It's that kind of powerful understanding. Sorry I have to write using an analogy but it the way my brain works.Other book insight - Your book explained why as an army Ranger pointman (LCo 75th Rangers 101st ABN) I knew where the enemy would be without being able to explain why. Dsylexia saved my life and the lives of my men. This book should be mandatory reading for every teacher, parent, writer, solider and anyone who thinks they may me dyslexic or ADD. I've ordered books for all my friends, clients and anyone interested in the subject.Thank you again for your gift.Regards,Larry ChambersPS: I almost forgot, today I'm a writer. Why tell you this becuase I couldn't read with comprhension until college. This year I'll top 1000 magazine articles and 50 published books. I created a ghostwriting business for those University of Chicago types that can't write below a PhD level and wonder why no one understands them.

Thank God you were able to find a way to not only help yourself but were willing to pass that knowledge along!!Second, if you are a teacher who thinks this book and/or program couldn't \\"possibly\\" apply to your students because, \\"They're not mirroring their writing\\" or \\"They're not showing reversals like a dyslexic would\\" you REALLY need to open your mind and read this book to realize that the least common (yet, unfortunately, most known) symptom of dyslexia comes in the form of reversals. If your phoenetic teaching doesn't seem to be working for extremely bright kids (or is working slowly but surely), PLEASE, for their sake, consider implementing this program!!Finally, I swear that Mr. Davis wrote this book specifically for my 6 1/2 year old son. My son's IQ was tested in the superior range. He showed extremely early verbal capabilities and has frightened me with his intelligence many, many times. He is one of the smartest people I have ever known, but he can barely read to save his life! My step son, on the other hand, has Asperger's Syndrome - he has zero common sense, can barely carry a conversation, lacks independent thought, etc. - yet, he can pick up anything and sound it out to read it with about 85% accuracy (he just turned 6). Having both boys in my home has underlined my son's reading problems. He has an IEP and is is learning support for his reading and writing. Yet his LS teacher *still* claims my son can't be dyslexic b/c he barely reverses his letters. Ugh! Show my son the word \\"Man\\" and he'll say \\"Guy\\" - show him the word \\"boy\\" and he'll say \\"Kid\\". If that isn't a person thinking in pictures, I don't know what is!!Anyway, we are going to participate with a Davis instructor this summer and I can hardly wait! The assessment showed my son is clearly an excellent candidate and she actually had him spelling his middle name (Alexander) backwards and forwards within five minutes (he couldn't even spell it nor would he try before she had him do it in clay). That showed me beyond any doubt that this program is the best thing to come along for our family and is definitely the answer to our problems when it comes to my extraordinarily bright child's inability to read.Thanks again, Ronald Davis!! God bless you!!If you are a parent, grandparent, caregiver, child care worker - anyone who has the opportunity to help a bright child who is struggling with reading - please consider purchasing this book to see if the reason YOUR bright child can't read is because of dyslexia (regardless of what the school says!).

I encourage any parent who is looking into treatment for their child's dyslexia to look for clinical research and not personal anecdotes about appropriate treatments. An article on this book in the International Dyslexia Association's quarterly journal, Perspectives, discusses this and other controversial therapies. According to Theme Editor Larry B. Silver, MD, &quot;This book is not based on research. The approach relies primarily on visual perception in the learning process even though we have such solid research relating reading disabilities to auditory processing and phonological awareness. The approach described has no focus on teaching to read or even teaching to learn.&quot; (Perspectives: Summer 2001, Vol. 27, No.3, IDA) In order to effectively remediate dyslexia, the underlying processing breakdowns need to be addressed. Research has shown over and over that dyslexia is genetic, not a matter of choice. Teaching compensatory strategies only sticks a Band-Aid on the problem, it does not remediate it. Programs such as Orton-Gillingham, Wilson, or Lindamood-Bell (when done correctly by trained individuals in a clinical setting) can offer such remediation. I have spoken with several parents who claim that this program was &quot;throwing money down the drain.&quot; Again, I encourage anyone doing research on dyslexia remediation to investigate the research--or lack thereof--before deciding to spend thousands of dollars on a program. A reputable, research-based program will not mind sharing its data with you.

Teachers always said he was intelligent but just didn't concentrate on his work - or that if he could just settle down he would be okay. Well needless to say, after the one week orientation there was a TREMENDOUS improvement. Self confidence and self discipline was there for him to control. Don't get discouraged - get help."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I am an educator. This book, written by a man challenged with Dyslexia, is an excellent resource. He gives the reader an insiders view of the way Dyslexics view the world."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Everyone who has had difficulty in reading, writing, or trouble in school should read this book.I am 70 years old and was not aware of dyslexia until I was 40. I failed the first grade and received very low marks in grade school and high school. In fact, my average was a D. When I read this book, I was moved to tears. It was if I was released from my own lack of self esteem. It answered questions I had about myself all my life. I highly recommend this book for anyone who have these difficulties, or teach children, or have children with these problems.I have talked to a number of people, who have some form of Dyslexia, and saw within them the same feelings I had about myself. I considered myself \\"dumb\\" all my life. I took several IQ tests and always scored over 150. I thought the score was a mistake and so did my teachers.Well written and easy to understand solutions that can be accomplished in a short period of time."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"If we started at the kindergarten level with Dr. Davis' techniques - there would never be another dyslexic.

And I'm especially good at it now because I AM DYSLEXIC!!! That is I am a visual thinking!!!Teach kids to relax while they learn instead of stressing them out by yelling at the TO CONCENTRATE and everyone will learn better!

Initially, I wasn't sure it applied to our child. About 6 months later, MUCH more research, professional evaluations, and continued professional tutoring for this child, I reread this book. I found a class in Wisconsin that could teach this program and the results are LIFE changing! Traditional teaching methods with worksheets and 90% teacher talk are not the way a dyslexic student with attention deficit takes in information, nor can they commit it to memory. Even greater, I have learned that they offer this program for school elementary teachers and others to be taught in K-3 programs. Now, we don't have to wait for the \\"wait and fail\\"...behind 2 years before help is granted! All learners can learn this way, right within a classroom setting.

It was mailed off and I received it within a few days of my order. This is a great book and if you or anyone you know has dyslexia you should read this book."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"While this book offers hope for many parents, unfortunately, it's not research based intervention. In other words, it's not been independently studied as a treatment method and then proven to have benefits. (There is one citation of a study done in South Africa that is HIGHLY questionable in terms of being a scientific study with adequate controls and the tools used for pre-post testing are not provided or discussed.) While there may be valuable ideas that help some people, it's information is personal and anecdotal. Unfortunately, I've seen way to many parents in my private practice who have relied on materials like this and their students have not been successful. Take the information with a GIANT grain of salt (or skip it all together) and educate your self through local organizations, books by individuals who have expertise/training in the field or/and by well educated professionals.As an individual diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia in the fourth grade who has studied this for years, I understand the desire for a quick fix. Research shows that brains are \\"plastic\\" and can be re-organized and that we have reading methods, that when administered correctly and consistently, can result in \\"re-wiring.\\" I also personally know, the critical peace to being able to function well in a world that does not understand being wired differently, it acceptance of your brain wiring. When you accept your differences, then you can be open to instruction, interventions, etc.I will also agree with some of the parents comments below that multi-sensory reading programs may not have work for their child. However, there can be many factors that lead to that type of program not being effective (i.e. poor match with instructor, other underling issues that have not been address, frequency of delivery and level of practice, etc.). Thus, their antidotal reports should not lead parents away from those programs. Parents should take the time to do the research about the program, find a good personality match, make sure there are no other contributing conditions (i.e. sleep apnea, AD/HD. auditory processing disorders, etc.), make sure their child is mentally ready to do the work and then invest the time and practice needed for the program to be effective. Be a savvy consumer of any program and realize that NO PROGRAM can be effective without student buy in. You can't just tell a student to do it and expect it to stick.As a professional, I would never recommend this book to a client."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"As a father of a son with dyslexia this book is GREAT - also suffer myself.

This book helped me more than I can put into words! My mom worked with me using the aids Davis describes, and I got tested for scotopic sensitivity dyslexia (which I have) Thanks to this book and colored glasses I can now Read. Not only read but my speed and comprehention is amazing to me and my mother, who is an English and Reading teacher for a high school. Because of me, this book, and her caring personality she has helped identify many of her students with dyslexia and started them on the path toward gaining control. I have help to identify one of my cousins, who is ten years old and after his mom and I working with him his teacher was so impressed that she is reading \\"the Gift of Dyslexia\\" and trying to get the whole school board to take a more active approach in sovling Learning issues, rather than just muddling through them by placing children in \\"Special\\" classes.So yes Buy and Read this book it will help both the dyslexic and those who teach the dyslexic, weather it's a teacher or mom and dad, or a husband/wife, or whom ever. It will help!"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"While I am not one to write reviews, I found myself appalled by the poor reviews that this book received. I read this book while researching dyslexia for a college paper on learning styles. You see I was struggling to describe my own learning style as a person with dyslexia. Mr. Davis has expressed in his book many of the thoughts I have had but have never been able to explain to anyone in words. The stigma of having a \\"learning disability\\" has been replaced with the realization that I have a gift of learning in a non-traditional fashion.I urge anyone who is dyslexic or who has a loved one who is dyslexic to read this book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"My daughter went through the Davis program with a facilitator nearly a year ago. It has changed her life. The Davis methods work. If I had listened to all of the others who left me NO hope, I wonder where my daughter would be right now. I thank God that I did not give up like I was encouraged to do. Many thought I was nuts, and still do, but the Davis methods worked!I see others with her learning style failing miserably in the academic setting---suffering from low self esteems as well, and I am so very thankful that I found Davis' web site. His program isn't a gimmick---in fact, it requires a lot of work from the dyslexic to complete the Symbol Mastery portion of the program.Once you truly understand how dyslexics think, you understand how they learn. Every single day I'm discovering more about the picture thinking process, and I am making new connections as to how to teach those with this learning style. I also have a deep understanding of disorientation and have learned what exactly causes my daughter to disorient---more importantly, so has she.She has an incredible understanding of how she thinks and learns. She also has an incredible understanding of her numerous talents. More importantly, she knows why school is challenging to her right now, knows she is very intelligent, and doesn't mind working hard to correct the difficulties. There are not many 7 year olds who can make those claims!I look forward to meeting Ron Davis someday and telling him what an incredible impact he has made on our lives and so many others."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"08-05-06 (Holly O'Dwyer)&lt;u> The Gift of Dyslexia: Why some of the smartest people can't read and how they can learn.&lt;/u>by Ronald D. Davis with Eldon M. Braun Published by Ability Workshop Press, Burlingame,California, USA 1994.Do you know what Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Christian Andersen, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Greg Louganis, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg, and General George Patton all have in common? They are all talented and dyslexic.Dyslexic children are often negatively labeled as slow and/or learning disabled. This isn't the case. People are dyslexic due to their genius sprouting forth between three and six months of age. Upon seeing mother's elbow, the infant is able to imagine his mother entirely. When a part of an object is seen, the imagination is able to look at the object from all points of view. The baby can also take apart something in their mind, such as a cat rolled into a ball. This forms the entire object in the infant's mind. These babies cry very seldom, probably because their brains are constantly busy.Dyslexia is the imagination hard at work, seeing 100 to 2000 images in one second, while the average person thinks with approximately four words per second. When a child thinks in images versus words, their brains develop nonverbal processes of communication, while average children develop verbal processes of communication.In school, learning to read requires verbal communication. Letters and words are difficult to interpret when a person has only learned to think in images. The letters on the chalkboard don't make sense, no matter what angle the child sees them at. Some dyslexics never learn to read. Others concentrate harder, which makes the letters disorient even more. When sitting in a stopped car and the vehicle next to you moves, sometimes you feel as though you are the one moving. This is disorientation.To aid the dyslexic in everyday activities such as reading, writing, and arithmatic, it is vital the person learns how to turn the disorientation off and on. The book explains the Davis Orientation Counseling techniques. They include many different steps, trying to aid the dyslexic to look at things from one viewpoint only. This is difficult to do, because all their life they have looked at things from about 2,000 different angles within mere seconds. It is important to follow the steps concisely, as not to disorient the person more than they already are. To learn the alphabet, Ronald D. Davis recommends shaping each letter, lowercase and uppercase, using clay. This is how he learned the alphabet.I found the first half of the book very difficult to read. I felt as though I were disoriented, and the concepts were difficult to grasp. Halfway through the book, these thought processes began to come together. I have a new respect for people with learning disabilities. Those who don't get the help they need often struggle unnecessarily through their entire life. Others learn different ways of avoiding their disabilities, such as asking others to read things aloud to them.Dyslexics are people who use their brain nonverbally instead of verbally. They see things from all different angles, which often makes them geniuses. Teaching institutions often misunderstand dyslexics, labeling them as slow or learning disabled. If a dyslexic receives the training he/she needs, I believe many would surpass the average person in school. All special education and early education teachers should be required to read this book."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I first read this book four years ago when my nephew (then 9 years old) was confirmed as dyslexic. The concepts were difficult for me to grasp because I am not a picture thinker, but they made sense! After years of struggling with educators and nay-sayers, my nephew attended the Davis Dyslexia clinic where he learned first hand the methods described in Ron Davis' book. He went from a 3rd to an 8th grade reading level in only four days! His progress was astounding and his self confidence is at a level we have never seen before. My family and I will be forever grateful that we found this book. It has made a tremendous difference in our lives. Thank you, Ron Davis!"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"The author, Ronald Davis, suffered from dyslexia, but discovered a way out--instantly!--when he thought about his inner process of sculpting. He realized that he had an inner focal point that moved around to sense an object...fine if one is looking at a bucket, but confusing if one is turning and flipping each letter to &quot;sense&quot; it. He illustrated by showing 27 ways a dyslexic can look at the word CAT. (This is a lot of information to process on top the frustration.) The roaming focal point also creates hyperactive kids; they move trying to keep in sync with their shifting focal point and may become seasick if they keep still. Davis offers very simple exercises to steady this focal point and provides techniques to help with troublesome concepts of non-visual words (ie, a, the, that, of). It's a very common sense book that both offers a way out of the problems and encourages the creative abilities inherent in the condition. Comes in a taped version if you can't read it. The dyslexics I have loaned it to have thanked me profusely. Davis runs an institute near San Francisco for those who wish to go through his program"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"My now 12 yo son was discovered to have dyslexia, just 2 years ago (after years of frustration in trying numerous \\"how to read\\" approaches, to no avail). He was homeschooled from the beginning, and though I'd successfully taught his older siblings to read, this kid stumped me... every attempt to teach him (no matter what methodology was used), resulted in both of us dissolving into tears of frustration and despair...We tried some traditional/professional approaches -- no results. We eschewed the labels, having gone down that dismal route with our eldest son (language delays), who is now carrying a 4.0 in college.Anyway, the breakthrough for us, was discovering this practical, hands-on book -- I came to see and understand (& believe) that it's not a disability at all -- it's an incredible gift based on innate, insatiable curiosity (even in infancy), and incredible multi-dimensional perception skills. It enables children to see the \\"other side\\" of objects, with their \\"mind's eye\\".Most dyslexic children are inordinately bright. Some famous dyslexics in history have been Michaelangelo, Thomas Edison, and Einstein. Their ability to see \\"all sides of an object at once\\" enabled them to do extraordinary feats. Michaelangelo could \\"see\\" the image of David in that block of marble, and knew how to \\"get him out\\" of it.The problem comes in when a dyslexic child tries to do a \\"mere human\\" feat, such as reading. Letters on a page are two-dimensional, and yet the child's insatiably curious mind wants to see what that \\"E\\" looks like on the \\"other side\\"... the mind's eye will go there, which causes an image of the letters to either \\"dance\\" on the page, or spin, or else swap places with each other.My son learned, from some easy exercises in this book, to \\"re-orient\\" his mind's eye -- to \\"lock it into place\\" in the back of his head, thereby aligning his mind's eye, with his natural eyes... so that both of them were focused on the same thing (the \\"E\\") at the same time. He can \\"unlock\\" that orientation at will, enabling him to do whatever tasks God had in mind when He gave him this particular gift.It's hugely liberated my son, given him a true sense of being unique (rather than defective), and given him the confidence he needed to tackle reading.One day, within a month of so of having discovered how to \\"re-orient\\", he picked up a 300 page novel, and devoured it in 3 days...! This was the same kid who would dissolve into tears, when he couldn't get through a paragraph, only weeks previously.I don't know how many more \\"disabilities\\" are really just misdiagnosed gifts, but I'll bet God does... I'll bet He knows how to enable us to meet our children where they are, and to discover just what He had in mind when He created each of our unique children.My son has morphed into a reading-fanatic...! As I type, he's lying on his bed, devouring yet another thick book -- he cannot get enough; it's as if he's making up for lost time. As a homeschooling/unschooling mom of 8 kids, I've learned that a desire to read is the greatest educational resource at their disposal. I've gone from hopeless despair over this son, to incredible hope and joy...!I really don't care how scientifically accurate this approach is -- I've found it to be incredibly fruitful. In my experience, the scientifically-backed methods were found wanting. This method opened up my son's world! I'm grateful, and I see this method as a Gift from God.Shalom, Dena\\"The unanswered questions aren't nearly as dangerous as the unquestioned answers.\\""},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This book was found by me after reading many other books about learning disabilities. As I sifted through the conventional resources, trying to help my third child to read at something close to her grade level, I discoverd the Davis Reading Program through this book. Having failed to help my older two children with their school struggles, I found this book to offer me renewed hope for normalcy in the educational setting, which had become a \\"bad job\\" for which my children had to show up to each day. Aside from the new outlook on life that has been provided for my children through this program, I recommend this book as a tool to understand the dynamic and unique talents that those who learn differently offer the world.

I started searching to try and understand dyslexia, when I found out that I had it myself, and never knew it!When I read The Gift of Dyslexia, I was so amazed at just how accurately the author described what I went through. I've read other people's ideas on what dyslexia is and what causes it. I usually agree with them about 50% or so. I agree with The Gift of Dyslexia nearly 100%!This book has helped me to understand myself so much better than I did before I read it. I used to think that I was nuts about certain things. (Example: I can read and write well, but at the same time, I have difficulty reading and writing, and that didn't make any sense to me.)Anyway, I really recommend this book to anyone searching for answers about dyslexia. It is very enlightening!"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"The most gripping part of this book to me is the encouragementit provides in knowing that a child with dyslexia is often gifted.They are differently enabled instead of disabled, so they are often mislabeled.Any parent with a child they suspect or know has dyslexia will find this book uplifting and encouraging.This is however, one of many books on how to teach dyslexic children the skills they need. I have found some success in using the described methods (but not the leaps forward that others have seen) and have wondered how much of it is 'just another program's hype' versus 'the answer to the problem'.Still, this book is a good starting point for any parent. It will help parents encourage their children by empowering them with the knowledge that the dyslexic child is very special indeed."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Whether you are a professional educator, parent, or just interested in the world of dyslexia, this book is a wonderfully eye opening read. It shows how dyslexia is not a learning disorder, but a different way of processing information.

The Gift of Dyslexia thoroughly explains the root causes of severe dyslexia, and it then shows how teachers and parents can systematically address the problems associated with it. But it also shows the important spatial skills that dyslexics possess, and how dyslexia should be seen not as a disease, but an intellectual gift that the child must master."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This book is AMAZING!!! My second grader suddenly started having troubles, hiding classwork, feeling inadequate and losing friends... He had been at the top of his class prior to this change. His teacher seemed to think I had unrealistic expectations regarding his abilities, perhaps based on the intellectual capacity of my older child. I finally got him tested and it turned out he was a little ADD, dyslexic (there are many kinds - he was not experiencing letter reversals - as MOST dyslexics do not), and gifted - MOM WAS RIGHT - HE IS A VERY BRIGHT BOY!!! We got this book, notified the school etc... THIS BOOK HAS CHANGED HIS LIFE! We did the exercises included, had a blast and we learned what a blessing Dyslexia is for him! He is a great reader now (his reading changed OVERNIGHT!) and feels so much better about himself. He is able to see things from so many perspectives and right now in the 3rd grade he is doing a big report on Einstein - \\"who is dyslexic just like me!\\" I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH - GET THIS BOOK!

I'm a 33 year old who found-out a year and a half ago that I am dyslexic. I have been doing a lot of reading and research in an attempt to seek answers for myself and help me understand better my condition. Also please note that English is a second language to me.The book \\"The gift of Dyslexia\\" did help me understand better some aspects about my condition as well as other aspects of dyslexia that are not my own. I could relate to a lot of the examples of coping methods or compensating strategies and feelings of disorientations described in the book.However one must keep in mind that this book relates the experiences and observations of one dyslexic person - Since there are no two dyslexics alike, no two dyslexics who share exactly the same set of symptoms, nor do the degree of the symptoms are the same in each case; I am somewhat sceptical regarding the author's claim to provide the absolute solution or answer to correct dyslexia. Although, I believe that the solution offered can definitely be of help to make some aspects of dyslexics lives easier - I believe that the solution provided may very well be more effective on children or younger dyslexics than on adults for whom breaking old coping habits may prove to be much more difficult to do. Perhaps even impossible in some areas, depending respectively on how deeply each of these coping habits have been assimilated.I also disagree with the suggested idea of training, forcing dyslexics to read from left to right while it is proven and well known that non-dyslexic people do not read like so. It simply isn't natural. There are a number of other claims in the author's theory that are contradictive to scientific facts, information and observations that I've read elsewhere from reputable sources.In conclusion, I would recommend this book if you are a dyslexic or know someone who is, and is looking to help his self-esteem and/or is looking to understand better this condition - But it does not provide a an absolute, \\"work-for-all\\" cure."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Ron Davis' personal experience with Dyslexia helped him discover what CAN be done about it. A must-have for any parent desperate to find help for their dyslexic child."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"The Gift of Dyslexia was written by a man who is autistic not learning desabled. Autistics often have incredible visual abilities. Ronald Davis is such an autistic person. To help him over come his problem, he created a method to control his extreme visual abilities. His method may work on a student who has extreme visual skills but will not be effective on learning disabled students. Most students with learning disabilities lack sufficient visual abilities. Futhermore, he uses no research to support his theories and argues against researched and proven theories. He consistantly blames the current education system for creating learning diabilities. Ronald was born with autism, it was not created when he began school.In addition, his treatment gives verbal directions that are complex and difficult to understand. Many learning diabled students struggle with verbal directions. If a learning disabled student has any communication problems they will be lost and confused by the treatment.His assessment tries to determine if the program will work for the student and is impossible to score accurately. An examiner asks the student to imagine and then state if she of he sees what is asked. There is no way to know if the student can actually do this or not. A more accuate evaluation would be given by a specialist to determine the level of visual spatial skills of the student. A student with normal to below normal visual spatial skill would not benefit from his treatment. L.S.

It seems to help some people, but certainly not for the reasons the authors state. People with dyslexia have problems with language and they can be taught to read and write well if their teacher has the ability to use a systematic, structured approach. I advise against this book because it could really lead you down the wrong path. Try Shaywitz's book on dyslexia instead. It is based on science and works for ALL."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Average - but good relations and situations of real life. My partner and I listened in the car on a trip.

The only way a child can overcome dyslexia and improve their reading, writing and spelling is through an Orton-Gillingham based program, NOT by realigning your \\"minds eye\\". The Orton-Gillingham based method is the ONLY one researched by the National Institute of Health. These programs such as Wilson, Language!, and the Susan Barton Reading and Spelling System use an Orton Gillingham based program.

Ron Davis described my son! After years of struggling, hearing teachers and other professionals label him lazy, unmotivated, oppositonal and of average intelligence, I was now listening to someone who viewed him as I did: gifted. He saw the world in ways I never dreamed of, yet he struggled with reading but knew so much. This book gave us realistic hope; we no longer had to believe that &quot;junior college is all you can hope for&quot;. After reading the book and completing the tapes we went to the Davis Dyslexia Center/Reading Research Council this past summer. My son is now confident and a reader. Spelling and math have improved tremendously. He will no longer be in special education as of January-6 months after he completed the program.

He kept saying &quot;Yes, mom that's exactly what it is like!!&quot; The fact that Mr. Davis himself is dyslexic,and has overcome so many obstacles to reach success meant a lot to my son as well.

They say it goes against scientific evidence and they use a lot of big words to make their case. My advice is to buy the book and try the Davis method for yourself. It worked for my 8 year old daughter and it is not cumbersome or complicated. After just the first \\"Orientation\\" session she went from reading one paragraph with 20 mistakes, to reading the same paragraph with NO mistakes. I've also called the helpline at the back of the book whenever I got stuck implementing the program and they were always happy to give advice. If you are wading in a scientific sea of information on how to help your dyslexic child, this is one method you should not be afraid to try. It just might by the thing that works for you. Wouldn't you trade all the \\"scientific evidence\\" in the world for just one book that might help your child to read?"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"What is convincing about this book is that the author is writing from personal experience and that what he writes conforms to the experience of many who have taught or had children of their own with dyslexia or with some identified &quot;learning disability.&quot; As a successful adult, he brings hope and a technique for helping those like him to use their abilities and to meet the demands of the more linear, verbal-oriented world of education and business. This book also gave me an appreciation of the pictorial thinker and the benefits he/she brings to the world. As a teacher and trainer, I believe every teacher, trainer, and parent should read this--regardless of whether they work with or have a child in this category. It gives us another view--an important view--of learning."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"My 24 year old son just went through the program described in this book. He went from a 7th grade reading level with close to 0 comprehension to an 11th grade reading level with full comprehension in 5 days. I wasn't sure it would help him as it seemed his vision was so compromised, and his eyes jumped around so much - I was afraid his problem was largely vision, but now his eyes are rested, and nothing blurs. I am amazed and grateful. He now longer believes he's stupid. So much time was lost, in special ed and then dropping out of school altogether after 8th grade - but now at least he can pursue whatever he wants as an adult."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I found this book very informative as I was wondering whether my daughter was dyslexic or not. And even if she is not, the book gave me insight as to how different people learn and process. It's a very clear book and gives hope, insight, and a means of learning for those who do have dyslexia. The book revealed that dyslexic people learn visually and are usually very creative. I have only read a few other articles on dyslexia and Ronald Davis' philosophies are very fascinating. Since he has dyslexia also, I think the information and methods in his book come from knowing it internally. People overcoming the greatest difficulties usually become the best teachers. This book is worth reading for those with dyslexia, parents and definitely teachers!"},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"I am a professional with 22 years of experience working with dyslexic students.

When I read this book out loud to her she cried. This book is written from the mind of a dislexic, and has insight that a person who does not have dislexia may not believe. There are a few people here who have given this book low marks. Those people may have a different form of learning disablity, so this book may not work well for them. As for my wife, she said 'as hard as it is to believe what is written in this book, it is absolutely correct' (at least for her). There are some educators who have posted that they think this book is 'misinformation'. Those people are well-meaning, but I am writing this to tell you that 'thinking with pictures' is exactly how my wife's mind works. If you know someone with dislexia, buy this book! You must understand that people with dislexia don't realize how different their minds are from those without it. How often do we talk about our mental images and how ours minds work? Not very often. This book talks about it, and helps non-dislexics understand the workings of the dislexic mind."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"Extremely helpful for the parent struggling to understand a dyslexic child - we sought out the therapy -drove a considerable distance, paid a lot of money - therapist was very competent but our child was a little young at the time (8). We thought doing it a year later would have been better, as he was resistant to it because he still wasn't clear how important reading was going to be in his life. We still could go back for a follow up (for free) and we may. Our child now reads slightly above grade level (he's almost 12 now) but he will never spell. (By the way he is also extremely gifted, off the charts in almost all tests and is three years ahead of grade in math). Davis is right about the gifted part - no question. Our psychiatrist works at NIH, says the brain scans on dyslexic kids are just plain different- my theory is whatever makes the brain not see some things correctly (or the way the rest of us see them)enables these kids to see other things more clearly - in our son's case it is spatial reasoning and the ability to understand mathematical concepts. Best thing in the book is the page where Davis shows how many different ways these kids see each letter before they have to decide what it is -and demonstrates how they actually read faster than the rest of us (many times faster)in order to decipher it at all."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"This little book offers some basic testing to determine whether you (or your child) are dyslexic.

While I overcame my difficulties much in the same manner as the author Ronald Davis, and graduated from high school and college with high honors, my son has not faired so well.

I finally began to read about dyslexia. I felt I was on the right track, and after reading Ron Davis's THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA, I knew this was IT! We have since been to see a facilitator of the Davis Dyslexia Correction Method and she, too, confirms, that our son has this \\"tendency\\" and she can help him. We are going this summer for the full week intervention - 4 hours from our home, because it will be worth it! As soon as we finish the course, I will write again and let you know how it helped my son, who also has ADHD. I plan to homeschool him in the fall for 5th grade to help him overcome this intense year and be able to finally use his GIFTS, feel better about himself, build up his confidence, and develop the areas we have been struggling with for the last two years! I am VERY GRATEFUL for having been led to read this book and finally find the better path to solutions and tools that enable children, like my son, who are GIFTED, but \\"tortured\\" by ineffective educational means that do not teach these children.

One cannot dispute his personal experiences, but I find his claims very disturbing and feel that he is preying upon individuals and families who are desperate to find \\"the\\" intervention. The underlying deficit for individiduals with dyslexia is difficulty with phonological processing, which is remediated through direct instruction by highly trained individuals. Successful, approved programs, such as Orton-Gillingham, Wilson, Slingerland, Project Read, Lindamood-Bell, etc. are multi-sensory, systematic, direct, and based on mastery of skills. These programs are supported by current research (Joe Torgesson, Louisa Cook Moats, Rebecca Felton, Hollis Scarborough, Marily Jager Adams, to name a few), as well as the International Dyslexia Association. More food for thought is the \\"Double Deficit Hypothesis\\" studied extensively by Maryanne Wolf. There are wonderful books available about Dyslexia, but this certainly isn't one of them. Please don't waste your money, and more importantly, don't be lured to any of his \\"trainings\\" that will cost you thousands of dollars and even more regrets."},{"Title":"THE GIFT OF DYSLEXIA","review":"After watching my son struggle for 3 years trying to read at a 1st grade level while he excelled socially, physically, and in many other ways I was ready to try anything. The title of this book caught my attention as I was looking for a more expensive product. It describes my son so well. He is SO smart, yet it seemed he could not advance in reading, writing, and math no matter what curriculum was used. It was having very negative affects on his self-esteem. I didn't realize he even had dyslexia, I just thought he struggled with mixing up a few of his letters. I had no idea what was really going on in his mind. I have never heard or read the information that was in this book ever before - despite the fact that my husband is also dyslexic. I have been implementing the techniques he recommends and have watched my son blossom in a short period of time. My husband has also tried some things and has been amazed at how such simple things have helped him. It seems to validate much of the feelings experienced by people with this gift. It also gives language to the frustrations, and ways to eliminate them. I totally have a new respect for my son and husband, and am so appreciative that someone was willing to speak from the inside of this reality. It is helping many others.

Secondly The author Ron Davis gives the tools to learn to shut off the disorientation when it is to the Dyslexic person's advantage. Too many have been labeled retarded or worse, simply because most don't know how to address Dyslexiic ways of learning.

The grubbiness, the gangsterliness, the banality, the bureaucracy and the horror are conveyed in their true magnitude. Yet there is a detachment about it that adds to its credibility. This book is not about left or right, it condemns no political ideology, it doesn't blame the USA - it just tells us what happened and explores deeply how it could happen.

Scilingo was the first naval officer to admit to the military's violation of human rights during the war against &quot;subversives&quot;. He exempts himself of responsibility by claiming that in the process of carrying out orders from the commanders in charge,the officers themselves, had also become victims of the process.

I have definitely found some new favorites with this collection, especially in the few Japanese stories. Uraschimataro and the Turtle is wonderful. I also loved Peter Bull! I wish there were more Japanese stories but, as this is the first volume of this collection I have read, I am hopeful to find more in another one of the series. Depending on your existing collection of fairy tales, this may not be a must-own but it is certainly a must-read."},{"Title":"Pink Fairy Book","review":"In the late 19th century, historian, scholar, and anthropologist, Andrew Lang, began publishing collections of fairy tales from around the world. The first volume was \`The Blue Fairy Book' published in 1887. Lang was not a true ethnologist, like the German Brothers Grimm. He was far more the \`translator' than collector of tales from the source, stories transcribed from being told by people to whom the tales were passed down by word of mouth. In fact, many stories in his first volume, such as Rumpelstiltskin; Snow White; Sleeping Beauty; Cinderella; and Hansel and Gretel were translated from Grimm's books of fairy tales. Some of his \`fairy tales' were even \`copied from relatively recent fantasy fiction, such as A Voyage to Lilliput, the first of the four episodes in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.My inspiration for commenting Lang's series of fairy tale books is for the sheer quantity of tales, the wonderful woodcut illustrations, some few of which may have become almost as popular as the tales (although not quite in the same league as Sir John Tenniel's illustrations for Lewis Carroll's great fantasies), and the fact that I had these when I was young.With twelve of these books, with between 30 and 36 stories in each book, this gives one about 400 different stories. If I were to recommend anything as standard equipment at a grandparents' house, it would be a complete set of these books.Needless to say, there are a few \`warnings' to accompany books assembled over 100 years ago. You will encounter a fair number of words with which even an adult may be unfamiliar, let alone a five year old. For example, on the second page of The Princess Mayblossom in The Red Fairy Book, a character puts sulfur in a witch's porridge. This requires at least three explanations. What is sulfur, what is porridge, and why is sulfur in porridge such a bad thing. More difficult still is when a prince entered the town on a white horse which \`pranced and caracoled to the sound of the trumpets'. In 19th century London, caracoling (making half turns to the right and the left) was probably as common and as well known as \`stepping on the gas' is today. But, if you're a grandparent, that's half the fun, explaining new words and ideas to the young-uns.There is another \`danger' which may require just a bit more explanation, although in today's world of crime dramas on TV, I'm not sure that most kids are already totally immune to being shocked by death and dead bodies. In these stories, lots of people and creatures get killed in very unpleasant ways, and lots of very good people and creatures suffer in very unpleasant ways. It's ironic that the critics in Lang's own time felt the stories were 'unreality, brutality, and escapism to be harmful for young readers, while holding that such stories were beneath the serious consideration of those of mature age'. The success of a whole library of Walt Disney feature length cartoons based on these stories is a testament to how well they work with children. But do be warned, Uncle Walt did clean things up a bit. Lang's versions hold back on very little that was ugly and unpleasant in some of these stories.The down side to the great quantity of stories is that even when some come from very different parts of the world, there is a remarkable amount of overlap in theme, plot, and characters. But by the time you get to another story of a beautiful young girl mistreated by a stepmother, it will have been several month since you read Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper in The Blue Fairy Book. The other side of the coin is that you can play the game of trying to recall what that other story was with a similar theme.There is one very big word of caution about buying these books through Amazon or a similar on line outlet. I stopped counting when I got to twelve different editions of The Blue Fairy Book, or a volume including several of these books. Not all of these editions have the original woodcuts and even worse, not all have a table of contents and introduction. The one publisher which has all twelve volumes is by Dover. Other publishers, such as Flying Chipmunk Publishing (yes, that's it's name) also have all the original illustrations, table of contents, and introduction, but I'm not certain that publisher has all twelve volumes. Dover most certainly does, as I just bought all twelve of them from Amazon.While I suspect these stories may have been \`old hat' for quite some time, it may be that with the popularity of Lord of the Rings, the Narnia stories, and the Harry Potter stories, all of which have their share of suffering and death, that these may be in for a revival. Again, the main attraction is that for relatively little money and space, Grammy and Grandad get a great resource for bonding with children."},{"Title":"Pink Fairy Book","review":"As always, Lang's fairy books are amazing, full of stories that are so interesting because they are the foundation upon which almost all fantasy today rests. These stories, their authenticity painfully researched and maintained, are not only facinating but are slightly different to what we know and love today.This is the reason I've took two stars away from the mark. This is a warning to would be readers. Lang's works are more an academic work and not really a fun to ready collection of stories. In addition, the strangenes of some of these stories and their difference to what we know and love today will make this book unreadable to some readers, probably most of the younger ones.In conclusion, this is an excelent book, just not for everyone. Read the first pages and the first story before you decide to plunge inside. You have been warned ..."},{"Title":"Pink Fairy Book","review":"Andrew Lang (1844-1912) wrote a number of books of fairy tales and differentiated each from the other by color; for example, this one is green, another is pink, another is blue, and others yellow, grey, brown, and lilac. The book contains several dozen tales. They are generally fitting for young children, with one exception. The Danish story The Princess and the Chest should not be read to a nervous child, Lang suggests, because \\"it rather borders on a ghost story.\\" There are also stories from Sweden, Japan, Sicily, Africa, Germany, and France. Lang makes sure that in his tales the good people always win out at the end and the bad suffer. He urges his readers to be kind, for kindness always brings good in fairy tales. Frequently, everything seems to be going wrong, the hero seems to be about to lose what he or she wants so much, a princess or money. But then the hero encounters an old man or an old woman, usually appearing very poor. The person asks for help, such as food or lodging.

Intermittent mode and continuous compression are the top level classifications. Each in turn having several subclasses.The basic principles of any compressor are straightforward from a physics standpoint. There is a quick chapter on elementary thermodynamics, as germane to compressor operations.But the bulk of the text takes us into each compressor type. With useful schematics illustrating the main modes of operation. Along with descriptions of instrumentation. Where here, electronics has vastly improved the sophistication of the monitoring and control devices. Giving an impressive amount of telemetry about vibration data. That can be used to improve performance and warn of mechanical failures."},{"Title":"Compressors, Third Edition: Selection and Sizing","review":"This is a good general overall reference book for compressors.It could have been much better if the author had provided more ofhis own development for various topics instead of using materialfrom other authors and then merely giving them credit (variousvelocity diagrams).In this day and age of 3-dimensional, multicolored graphic images,I think that the author could have drastically improved his presentationof the material."},{"Title":"Soli Deo Gloria: A Daily Walk Through Romans","review":"Transforming the magisterial themes of the book of Romans into devotional stories that touch the soul is no easy task, but Soli Deo Gloria (Latin for \\"glory to God alone\\") provides such transformation. While the author writes in the context of one who has a warm relationship with the God of grace, he also examines the book with the eyes of a biblical scholar and theologian. The result is a devotional work that reaches both head and heart.Anabaptist references throughout Soli Deo Gloria make it a unique contribution to the wide array of devotional books. As a Mennonite, it is comforting to read devotional messages that are graced with the names of past and present faithful believers, such as Harold S. Bender, Stanley Green, and the author's wife Esther, a talented artist whose work adorns the book's cover. Other significant Christian leaders of the past century are also readily referenced: E. Stanley Jones, Mother Teresa, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer among them.Myron Augsburger brings to his writing the advantage of a mature cultural and religious grasp. Readers may know him as the former President of Eastern Mennonite University, as a pastor, or perhaps as an effective evangelist of past decades. But perhaps what most qualifies him for writing a devotional guide based on the forthright book of Romans is the consistent direction his life has taken over several decades. He has chosen to be guided and motivated by the evangelical pulse of the book of Romans.Those familiar with the complexity of Romans might marvel that it was selected as the basis for a book of devotions. Indeed it is a bold effort, and Soli Deo Gloria is designed as a verse by verse exposition so that the full scope of the epistle is included, and even the \\"difficult\\" verses, like the ones having to do with the Christian's relationship to government, are covered. The subject of death (Romans 4) is not glossed over or overly spiritualized either, partly because the author has been deeply affected by the absence of loved ones, including his own father's death. Several pages are devoted to grappling with the sorrow that the death of a loved one brings, and with that sorrow, the subtle emergence of hope and promise that come through resurrection hope.For both Ausburger and the other evangelist we know simply as Paul (the author of Romans), the grace and power of the gospel of Jesus Christ seem more tangible and visible the more one reaches out to the people of the world for whom Christ died. In addressing the international impulse and intention of the gospel, Augsburger states in one of the devotions, \\"Christianity is not a western religion.\\" So be prepared to travel if you use this book, and be prepared to be consistently challenged to make your life count forChrist and the church.While reading Soli Deo Gloria I found myself reflecting on the foundation of my faith. Questions emerged: \\"What was my baptism about? How have I changed? Is my life a testimony to the grace I have been given?\\" If only for moments of honest inner reflection the book has touched me, then it has served a worthy purpose.For the person who loves the honesty and challenge of Romans, who wants to live out the Christian faith from an Anabaptist perspective, and who welcomes theological reflection that is sensible and contemporary, this devotional guide is a treasure."},{"Title":"Cucina & Famiglia : Two Italian Families Share Their Stories, Recipes, And Traditions","review":"There have been far too many unpleasant surprises for me to recommend this cookbook. Steps often aren't in a logical order, and they don't present considerations in a timely manner--notes often appear too late. It's the type of cookbook in which a complex recipe will call for an ingredient on page 120, and then when you get midway through the recipe on page 120, an obscure note says, oh yeah, by the way, this seventh step takes three days. Or you'll follow a recipe to the letter and find that while you had to rush to make twice the dough called for, you have to throw out a pound of unused pasta.

The crust is absolutely fantastic and easy to make if you have a food processor.As for the Timpano itself, a friend and I made it and it was quite the event. It took about three days to make sure that we had all the things we needed (sauce and meat need to be made ahead of time, not to mention side dishes). One thing to consider before attempting it is the right basin. Enamel basins like the one in the movie are not made any more, so they are difficult to find. I actually was able to secure one from a company recommended by the book, but it took a few days to track down a retailer. I was also able to get one that looked exactly like the one in the movie, but it was used and I don't know what for, so for the sake of being sanitary I went with the one from the retailer. After it was all said and done, the Timpano was everything we expected and more. Follow the recipe exactly and don't skimp on any of the ingredients, it may seem like collosal ammounts of food, but I tell you that it is all accurate.Bottom line: fantastic cookbook with excellent recipies, comprehensive and easy instructions with preparations requirements that will appeal to everyone from the novice to the expert!

It tells the story of each generation as they adapt to the current political situations, moving through Europe and finally to America. With each generation, their religious values and practices are challenged and 'adapted', and where the trials and tribulations of choice in marriage partners, their childrens' rebellion, and their thoughts of what it means to be Jewish, are consequently questioned also.The book is enthralling all the way through (I couldn't put the book down!) - particularly the last chapter (by far the best chapter, but I won't give it away!)Splendidly written, with much prose, \\"The Island Within\\" was a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend it.

I really didn't enjoy it at all, The characters were not developed enough, Michael was weak, even pathetic and Hanna was not a likeable person. I would have liked it if I could get into the characters more, it was hard to enjoy when I had such feelings of indifference towards them."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Oddly engaging, yet wholly unbelievable. The first-person narrator is charmless and preachy, and the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the teenage boy and the older woman (not to mention the relationship itself) is completely ludicrous and poorly motivated. I like the idea of a novel dealing with later-generation Nazi guilt from the German citizen perspective, but the issue is so weighed down with theoretics, rather than true feelings or thoughts, that it comes across dry and essayist, instead of compelling fiction as truth. A different author with this material may have hit gold, but Schlink fails to ignite much of anything here, and the result is disappointing and a bit frustrating."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Love is supposed to be unconditional, then you find out that lover has been involved in tragic, dramatic crimes, which can hardly be explained. Then, is it wrong to love that person? Are the acts of a person the same thing as the person? If we can always be defined by our actions, and what we do is contradictory, then what are we? Can any one really judge anyone? And if we judge how do we really know that we are viewing the situation form a superior moral stand point? And if we can not judge, them how can we relate to life and others? How can we evolve as better persons without a before and after to compare? How do we know is better? Is someone who kill one thousand persons worst that a person who kill one? Why? Can really life be quantified?The questions which that came to our mind are certainly not limited to these few, but the intensity of the work and its basic humanness will certainly touch your heart. Is just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A 15 year old kid and a 36 year old girl. What could they possibly have in common? From the beginning, this novel captures the attention of the reader with passionate sex between these two characters, 15 year old Micheal Berg and 36 year old Hanna Schmitz. The novel matures from there and tells the story of two lovers torn apart. Hanna takes in Micheal as her son (with a few more benefits not normally given by a mother) and protects him and forces him to succeed in his studies. Micheal lives for the love he gets from Hanna, with a glimmer in his eye, dedication in his heart and a book in his hands. They live through fights and growth; love and hate; and finally, betrayal. Micheal is betrayed by his one true love. How you might ask? Well, you will just have to read the novel to find out. This woman of beauty and love takes from Micheal the ability to find and experience love again. The same love that he had experienced with her. Hanna stole his innocence, and it would never be returned. This is a riveting novel that takes the reader through the course of Auchwitz (yeah, where did that come from?) and a young boys first, and last, love. Through trials and tribulations. Easy reading, but deep meaning. Simple, yet complex. A must read for any personal library."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I hated this book. Yah, yah, the prose is good; but the promise on the cover of a &quot;morally devastating novel&quot; is not good. There are two parts to the book. In the first, 15-year-old Michael Berg begins an affair with Hanna, a woman in her mid-thirties. That part of the book is good. The writer seems to capture the logic and emotions of a 15-year-old boy quite realistically. In the second part, Michael is a grown man watching the trial of his former lover. This is the part that really fails. There is no sense that Michael has matured in any way. Also, the final message is not morally devastating nor even believable. I wonder about those who've written that the book made them change the way they look at the Holocaust. What, they never thought that ordinary, mostly decent people participated? They never thought that many of the perpetrators were caught in events from which they saw no escape? For a better discussion of these issues, read Hannah Arendt, not Bernhard Schlink. If the book weren't so hyped, I'd probably give it three stars, but I feel like there needs to be a leavening influence here."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was a great book! It has many themes compiled together in it: love, lust, hate, betrayal, compassion, and friendship. At times, the book seems to turn the unexpected direction, which makes it interesting to follow. Great mixture of imagery and literary techniques."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Its fast, its brisk, its well written and it could have been about cardboard cut-outs. The characters are not human beings but plot elements. Michael our deeply boring narrator is involved with a much older woman then he, Hanna. At first I thought she was a person of few words, but as the book progressed I came to realise that Hanna's lack of depth is deliberate, so that her judgement would be more of a philsophical, theoretical issue rather then about a character that we have come to care about. She is not a character, but a plot element to provide our narrator with a moral dilemma. By the time the second half the second half of the book rolls around we are reading about a trial of a person we hardly know and morally dillema of a passive, weak and humorless young man. Even when the author hints at character complexities as the Michael's relationship with his father, he immediatly withdraws back to his plot thread and the not very original philosophical ramblings about the holocuast. It would be more rewarding (and definitly more moving) to read a historical book about WW2. Inspite of the extremely negative tone of this review there is something to be said for the pace and simplicity of this novel. But by the time the end of this novel comes around you're be feeling lousy, unmoved and not very illuminated."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am an English teacher and read constantly. In the past I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Oprah's selections. I was excited to see that this novel addressed the Holocaust. Wrong! The first 30 pages of text dwell only on a licentious relationship between a woman and a boy half her age. There is little character development of either character, so I found myself caring about neither. The ending, while slightly shocking, is very contrived and contains no closure. I could not put this book down; not because I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, but to get it over with so I could move on to something more enjoyable. A grave disappointment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I must say I've been disappointed with many of Oprah's picks lately, but this was the worst ever. Perhaps the original German version was good and the emotion was lost in the translation, but I found it flat, dull and dry. For such a great plot, it was incredibly boring. I didn't care about any of the characters, and being Jewish I expected at least the courtroom scenes to dredge up some feeling. But there was no clue as to the character's inner lives - it was like a good outline, or a painting in black and white with no color or depth.I kept hoping to understand Hanna's attraction to Michael or to feel something during the love/sex scenes or care when things went wrong. But the writing was so dead I really had no empathy for anyone and I ended up skimming the last quarter of the book just to find out the ending. It seems some people feel a good plotline makes a good book, but some of the best books I've read have had very little action. For me good writing is as much - no more - about the dance of language, the rhythm of a sentence and the poetry of the words chosen as the plot itself. And this book was like reading a factual report, the writing itself was soul-less."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The beginnning of the book seduces you with a love affair between an older, sensuous, street car conductor and a young student. This affair takes up most of the book, but it remains relatively shallow. Most of the scenes are sexual, and the older woman - Hannah - while provacative is not likeable.The love affair is abruptly cut off, and the main character never recovers. His life is filled with empty romances and regret over his first love. His conflict over accepting and rejecting Hannah, is the most interesting part of the book. It is never resolved however, and as his life progresses and he runs into Hannah again, it becomes the central theme of the story.I liked how the story makes you contemplate difficult questions. How it offered a different perspective of the Holocaust. But I found it hard to accept the ambiguous way the Holocaust is presented. It never answered central questions it posed, and it even refused to address others. Was Hannah cruel, or merely a victim of her secret shame of being illiterate? Was she just following orders, or did she really hate the people she killed? Was she responsible for any of the killings? Did she understand that killing innocent people is wrong? Or did the thought never occur to her?There were too many important issues not addressed in this book, and not enough depth in the characters for me to like it. I mean the main character basically defines his life by Hannah but his most important memories of her are of them making love, laying next to her and smelling her, and the way her dress flapped in the wind when she rode a bycicle. Oh, yes, and the reading. And to make it worse, the story ends with an easy way out, a suicide. It was as if the writer came to the conclusion that he didn't really know what he was trying to stay, and that there wasn't enough meat in the love story for it to continue - so he killed of the object of the main character's affection.The reviewer before me wrote that this book is a must read for educators. While I agree that this book offers something different, I don't think it offers enough. It addresses one of the greatest otrocities in modern history - the Holocaust. It asks the question - why did they do it? And the closest thing to an answer it provides is, ignorance. The guards were ignorant. They didn't know what to do. They didn't understand the rules. Couldn't see the system they were taking part in. We are all responsible for our actions. That is the message I try to convey as an educator. We cannot control everything, but we can control the decisions we make. This book tries to take away even that."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After seeing the film and being completely caught up in it. I had to read the book and I am so glad that I did.The story centres on Michael \\"Kid\\" and Frau Smitz and is in three parts. The first part focuses on the love story, the second focuses on the trial of Frau Smitz and her role in the SS where Michael is a law student and the final part focuses on the time when Frau Smitz is in jail serving life and Michael sends her tapes of him reading and helping her learn to read and write.The story is so moving and I couldn't stop reading it. I was in tears watching the film but the tears didn't come. However I was so caught up in the book I was breathless at some points. The writing style was easy to follow, the fact that the chapters were very short made it very easy to read and the pages just flowed by.I was caught up with the characters and the visions the book details were easy to picture.For me the story was moving and as I mentioned above breath-taking. Some books are ones that leave you thinking them over and this is how The Reader has left me. I also find that as I watched the film first I was able to picture things and I will be talking about this book for a long time. I actually feel privileged to have been given the chance to read it, if that makes sense?I would give The Reader 5/5."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Written from the angle of coming to terms with the contradiction of personal experience of a woman versus her involvement in the Nazi concentration camps.

It had a lot of interesting discussion points."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Good Read. Held your attention from start to finish. The characters were not over described nor was the scenery. Would recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The modern German novelist Bernhard Schlink writes novels that make his readers feel and think to the very depths of their soul and mind. While storyline can be, at times, morally uncomfortable, the lessons he wants us to learn are nothing short of blessed and heroic. The time and setting is post-war Germany, when a nation is still dealing with the terrible guilt of the Holocaust. What we see on the surface is a sordid story of an older German woman named Hannah sexually exploiting a callow youth named Michael. If we can get past that initial shock of having to confront moral turpitude in its vilest form, we will be rewarded with an amazing accounting of why people do what they do to get by, even if it is wrong. At the heart of their illicit relationship comes a codependency that his desperate need to be loved and her need to overcome the stigma of being illiterate. While Hannah never shares her secret, Michael becomes her reader and gatekeeper to a world of emotions and ideas previously unknown t her. She eventually realizes that she cannot go on indulging in this relationship so suddenly disappears from his life. As Michael moves into manhood and law school, he suddenly meets up with Hannah again: this time as a spectator at her war crime trial as a Nazi prison guard at one of the camps. She will confess to everything the courts accuse her of only because she does not want to be cross-examined on a report that she cannot read. While she is able to gain the sympathy of the tribunal assigned to decide her fate in terms of not really knowing the full consequences of her actions, she still has to live with a guilty conscience of using a personal failing such as illiteracy to indulge wretched behaviour throughout her life. When she truly confronts her tragic past, only one choice remains for her."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I first tried the movie, and then the book. Both seemed beautiful. Even though Hanna's images changes as she gets old and that made Kid (I've already forgot his name. I remember Hanna.) shocked, Kid stays close to Hanna, and the movement of his heart shows how sensitive he is."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Our hero, Michael, first met Hanna, an older woman, when he became ill walking home, and she aided him. After a prolonged illness, he returned to express his gratitude. At that visit, he became enamored with her, and caught a glimpse of her changing clothes. He became obsessed with her and fantasized about returning to visit her.He doesn't explicitly quote Jesus' admonition that if you look with lust on a woman you have committed adultery, but he refers to it in a classic justification for premeditated sin. When struggling with whether to visit Hanna again, he asks, \\"Did my moral upbringing somehow turn against itself? If looking at someone with desire was as bad as satisfying the desire, if having an active fantasy was as bad as the act you were fantasizing--then why not the satisfaction and the act itself? As the days went on, I discovered that I couldn't stop thinking sinful thoughts. In which case I also wanted the sin itself.\\"Granted, lust and the act of adultery are both sins, but there is certainly a qualitative difference between imagining the act and actually doing it. Still, many Christians can relate to his quandary.In a later passage, as he observes Hanna's trial, he reflects on his generation's rejection of his parents' generation's moral authority. Every generation has a sense of rebellion against their parents, but in their case, they see the manifest moral failure of the Germans during World War 2 and the years leading up to it. Whether they were active participants, passive approvers, or silent observers, Michael considers the atrocities of that era to reflect a lack of morality for all of their generation, so who can blame young people for wanting to distance themselves from the culture and mores of the previous generation?The age gap between Michael and Hanna is unnerving, but is essential to the story. If such a thing can be looked past, once you do look past it, The Reader is a terrific read and brings up questions of moral culpability and ethical decision making in very interesting ways."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One of the best kindle books I have read in a long time. I highly recommend others to read this. May watch the movie now, but I know the book is always better."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who is seeking to learn more about the Third Reich. It is also a vital example of \\"man's inhumanity to man,\\" the seeds of which lie in all of humanity.The author has created a masterpiece and a classic in the genre."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It's rare that you come across a book that you can't put down. I actually read The Reader in a day, which while not impossible, is pretty impressive considering how inconsistent I am as a reader. Some books will take me months to get through while I fly through others.The Reader tells the story of Michael Berg, a young teenage boy who falls in love with a mysterious older woman. After a brief time they become lovers and he reads to her all kinds of stories of fiction, non-fiction and the like. One day she disappears with barely a trace and a few years later he finds her again, only this time she is on trial for war crimes as a Nazi SS guard at a satellite concentration camp to Auschwitz. This conflict of passion and guilt manifests itself into a life long journey for young Michael and his struggle to find meaning in post war Germany.The writing, and English translation I should say, is superb in it's bare bones style. Very minimal and to the point, which seems to my mind as a common trait among Germans, especially apparent in their arts. The story is engrossing and I was caught up in the immediacy of the longings of sexual awareness, as it was described very lucidly in the first half of the story. While I don't particularly prescribe to works of eroticism, this was very intriguing and effective in elucidating those desires in a suggestive yet powerful way.The one thing that I felt was hard to get over at times was the sense that Michael and Hanna both in their own ways seem quite selfish. But again, as I've gotten older I've come to appreciate stories in which the lead characters aren't perfect and have traits that I don't admire in human nature. Most protagonists tend to be ideal in nature in the sense that when we are reading, we are imagining ourselves as that character, but in this case, and the case with many books I have read as I get older, is that it lent itself to the mood of the story. There is a sense of finality and curt resolution to the tale, as evidenced by the short chapters, each rarely more than five pages at most. There are also so many areas that also question the tone of morality and what deserves forgiveness or what deserves damnation. But the tone of the book doesn't seem to want to give defined answers as black and white, and like life is full of gray areas. A worthwhile read, and a complex tale of love and passion, not only romantic, but of a love for literature and the joys and burdens of reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I didn't care much for the first part of the story, which concentrated on the affair between the boy and a woman much older than him. The part that made the deepest impression which I thought is also a challenge thrown to us, the readers is Michael's moral dilema on whether to save Hanna and deny her the dignity which she obviously cares so much about or to respect her wish and keep what she feels is so shameful, a secret. At the end of the book, Hanna is no longer ashamed of that inability anymore, but is in fact proud that she has overcome it. Does it make a difference to Michael, I wonder? The book did mention that he is proud of Hanna, but did the fact also made him more remorse and guilty?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"If someone were to ask you to write a story about a Nazi war criminal--one which allows the reader to sympathize with her--could you pull it off? I couldn't. But somehow, Schlink's &quot;The Reader&quot; manages to do just that. In just a few deft strokes, the author paints a compelling picture of an intelligent boy having an affair with a mysterious older woman, which is to become the springboard for a much larger story. Rather than take the safe, easy route of portraying Nazis as inhuman (&quot;monsters!&quot; we'd say, &quot;nothing like ME&quot;), he asks us, through Hanna, &quot;What would you have done?&quot; A compelling story, written with clarity and compassion--not to mention devastating candor--&quot;The Reader&quot; is the best book I've read this year. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"An easy read, yet thought provoking and very moving"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book touched me because it expressed the effects of an adolescent sexual relationship. I think that the ideas are devoid of any moral good, but that is not the point of the book. I felt myself revisiting my adolescent love, realizing how affected I am- even now. Our first love can enrapture us (even when unhealthy) to a point where they become a mental fixture- reminding us of everything new and innocent sexually. Hannah ruined this boys relationships with women for life. Being a man, I could remember the thoughts this boy felt, and I can't imagine what it would be like had my lover had the age and knowledge of men that Hannah had. What scars that would leave. This book reminds me of Lolita, but the sexes have changed. Both Nobakov and this author use characters that are haunted by there first love, depriving them of normal relationships in their adulthood. This book is important, but I felt the author was too reserved. The story is disturbing, so why not share the real hurt. I think the author could have been less detached."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink casts out a line to the readers, using an intriguing thought provoking theme as bait. Once you've begun reading, it becomes almost impossible to stop. The story will move you into a mode of thinking unfamiliar in most American novels. Intelligently written, it challenges your morals, yet invites a particularly wonderful sense of commonality with life, love, and forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink casts out a line to the readers, using an intriguing thought provoking theme as bate.

(probably because it was realtively short)I still don't understand why she had an affair with a 15 year old boy. Nor why he never got over it. The book didn't educate me at all about the Holocaust like I hoped it would. I don't know why he wouldn't visit her in prison or why she killed herself. Seems to have a lot of missing links. Maybe I didn't care enough about the characters to think about these situations. This was is a take it or leave it kind of book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When I first started reading this, I thought, &quot;Oh My&quot; But the more I read, the more gripped I was. This book is one that I could not put down until the end..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story is of a young boy in post war Germany, who has an affair with a woman twice his age. Later he learns of her guilt and subsequent life sentence in prison. He continues to read to her, (though recorded on cassette tapes), just as he did during his earlier affair. The biggest problem is dealing with his own guilt.This book will 'slap you up side of the head' to get your attention and will hold it until the last page. This ought to be used in our public school system and be required reading in both English and Ethics classes."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What's the difference between a &quot;romance&quot; novel and a well-written story of people in loving and unloving situations? I believe it's the language and the images constructed for the reader. You know from the reviews that the Pilot is not all he seemed to be, and the immediate other life is not hard to imagine. What is especially well-drawn about this particular picture is the sincere emotion and the ways of dealing--or not dealing--with difficult revelations and complications. I began this just before a weekend, and found myself carrying it with me wherever I went. I enjoyed it thoroughly. For anyone who thinks they're secure in what they know about their partner."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am amazed at how many readers thought this book was about sex and obsession. That was only the introduction to the theme of what can be a generation's response to a living monster. The author's main idea is not sex, but confronting our own attitudes toward the past and parents who aided and abetted and applauded Hanna in their lifetime. Did anyone think her illiteracy was a bit unusual for a 20th century German? Perhaps it was a metaphor for her &quot;not knowing&quot; what she was doing. Was it a whitewash? Are we being led to being sympathetic to Hanna? Why did she commit suicide? Maybe because she realized that she could never escape the hideousness of what she had done. She was truly worthless."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Mr. Schlink creates lasting portraits of two characters of amazing depth. Although I finished his story some time ago, it is etched in my mind and I return to it ever so often. Here, I am moved by the loss, the hope, the experiences of Michael and Hanna. This novel transcends the history which creates it. It captures the very essence of the human spirit. A beautiful read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really enjoyed the combination of the love affair, Nazi Trial, and the ironic twists in Schlink's novel. I couldn't put the book down. It's a good choice for an easy weekend read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A spell binding, fast reading and touching tale of young love, obsession and growing up in a tragic time. A sickly teenage boy first finds himself and then loses himself in love with an older mysterious woman. His examination and questioning of love, ethics, forgiveness and contentment is both thought provoking and intriguing. The end came too soon and had me sobbing out loud with emotion I haven't felt while reading a book in a long time. At the end I found myself turning back to reread parts I had originally skimmed through to find out would happen next. Just wonderfully written and translated.I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an incredible exploration in allegory of postwar Germany coming to terms with its past. A novel of ideas not to be taken literally, it asks so many difficult questions about guilt and expiation. Schlink seems to feel that the postwar generation has to accept its love/hate/guilt feelings about its parents and move on. This book is not for someone looking for an easy summer read. It takes thought and the willingness to look beyond the literal. After an intense discussion at our book club, I intend to reread. I know that I missed much on first reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Oprah, Oprah, Oprah. I usually loooove Oprah's picks but this one, not so much. I guess it kept my attention, but some parts were rambling by the author. I feel like something might have been lost in the translation. Anyhow, it's okay in a pinch, and you'll get through it in a day or two. Good to take on a weekend trip to the beach."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought that the book had that &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; that kept me wanting to read it right up to the last page. The whole story could have been condensed a little in my opinion, as the passive moments profused a little throughout the story. However, that might have been the goal that the author was eventually aiming at. I used this book as some kind of introspection. What would we do in such a situation? I believe it to be some kind of study of life. Whoever has been in love with an older person, might understand the anguish and dejection this teenager felt as his mistress was mad at him for no apparent reason? It makes you wonder about some matters related to the heart. In short, a fear of the winner to lose it all and not be a winner any longer? And the fear of this boy, thinking he will never, ever find any other person to fall in love with if she does not want him? Many of us do prefer to be loved, no matter what you have to go through.Eventually, one also realizes that it is better to lose in love than to never love at all. We are all enslaved in the stratagem our heroes are bound by.The most interesting part took place, in my opinion during the trial when she looks at the judge and asks him &quot;WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE?&quot;. The judge remained stoical, in spite of his lack of wit. What are we supposed to say or do in certain situations? What do we do or say in certain situations, where a person is stuck in a place where everything may incriminate her and yet, there are different ways to look at it. She is NOT a bad person.Let's not forget that the time when that story took place is to be differentiated from our time now! How many people were given a choice? You were on their side or they would get rid of you! If you have not read the book yet, try it, keeping this in mind.Finally, as to the slow motion of this plot, it made sense to me to some extent, as it is maybe meant to mirror what took place within those characters. How fast does life go by when you are down? The despondency of a moment makes everything stand still and that may well be what the author was aiming at. Maybe I am wrong, but it may help get the full picture of these remembrances of things past!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A teen's lusty coming of age with a woman 10 years younger than his mother leads Michael Berg into obsession hell. Temporarily numbed by rejection and regret, his time with Hanna achieves an unbeatable sensual rememberance making other relationships an empty experience. After she leaves, his life resembles normalcy to all except one professor of law, who actually calls him on it.In a special semester studying the trial of women persecutors of the holocaust, he finds Hanna a defendant. Horrified by her crimes, he attempts to understand the perpetration of crueltry and injustice upon other human beings. His abstraction becomes a destraction to me, the reader.Can he assuage his pain by reading to the imprisioned Hanna, whose secret he FINALLY discovers during the trial? Michael's character developes with dullness, while Hanna takes on a more interesting growth which the author fleshed out very little.In conclusion, Hanna's shame deals her the death card rather than endure with a world of haunting faces in a society burdened with the horrible past.A good read and turn pager for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"i cant figure out whats so great about this book. i read the triumph and the glory because it was mentioned favorably by a lot of people and it was great. but the reader left me bewildered at its lack of direction. what was the point of the theme? i'm going to read back through the reviews and see what more is said and maybe try reading it again. i just got to be missing something somewhere . . ."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book gave me information that I had never grasped about the whole society being caught up as willing victims of the Holocust. What would you do as a women living as this women did not being able to read or write. Who could you tell? Where could you go? The knowledge of it all is just so over-whelming. I also got a glimps of the wrongs that adults do when they have sex with youth. He was consumed with this women most of his life and called it love. I believe it was rape of the mind body and spirit. I read this book like it was a memior, it was believable....well written. A bit of education for me.

The character development is often weak but its message packs a strong punch."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"First off, I had to read this for a class. So that should tell you that after years of cruising over this book, I never really wanted to read it.Then after getting past a bit of the dryness (not dry humor, dry story) this book has a somewhat intriguing plot. I found Michael and Hannah's initial relationship interesting. It made me wonder where the story was going and what the psychological profile of Hannah was made up of. But then the interest dropped off there. The story jumps through Michael's life, briefly mentioning his marriage, child, then divorce. The next time we see Hannah, she is on trial. Yet again, we wonder about her, why she did what she did, why she is doing what she was doing in the trial.And then the story ends in what seemingly is supposed to be a tragic ending. But I couldn't care less.This gets three stars because it was such a quick read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was a beautiful and extraordinary love affair between two people, even though their age was quite a difference. I loved the romance of Schlink's quiet style. Having heard many horrible stories from that era, it was an interesting look into the lives of this mis-matched couple.Having not heard anything about this book before reading it, it was definitely hard to put down. A very compelling look into the lives of these characters which were more a metaphor for the situation than that of a relationship between the two."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I loved this book.

Not that my time is better than anyone else's but i just do not have a lot of it. My main complaint with this book is that it just seems so unrealistic. Dont get me wrong I know that it is horrible not to be able to read. I sure your self esteem would be rock bottom. However, I just can not imagine anyone going to prison for almost twenty years just because they would not admit they could not read. I also can not imagine letting someone I knew was innocent and someone I loved or at least loved beyond comparison at one time , go to prison. This book read like a soap opera. By the way just because Opera recommends does not make it worthy, Although I think very highly of Opera."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was not a good read at all.

I was very disappointed in this book and could hardly even bring myself to finish it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I usually find the Oprah books very interesting, but not this one. This was one of the most boring books I have read. I skimmed through it just so I could find out what happened to Hannah and Michael.

I don't give this a good rating at all."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I don't consider myself an insensitive boor, but I wanted to throw this book out the window! Michael is nothing but an arrogant wimp. Hannah is ashamed to be illiterate, so she'll take the rap for a horrendous crime rather than admit she can't write? Please!!

Maybe at this point I was in denial because I felt so bad for her in this occupation. I just wanted to think more of her.Hanna could of truly contributed so much more to the world if it was not for her illiteracy that caused a series of negative chain reactions including her death.I wonder how Hanna's life would of been if she was literate!!

It positions moral dilemma in such a way as to force the reader to let go of his or her preconceived notions of right and wrong. In the big picture, who would ever see a relationship between a 30-something woman and a 15-year old boy as something other than perverse? Or, who would ever find reason to sympathize with someone who personally was responsible for atrocities during World War II?

Hence the complaints of poor writing and strange plotting. This is a curious phenomenon, when a serious work becomes pushed into the populist spotlight in front of an unsuspecting audience.. I am reminded of &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; a few years ago. But &quot;The Reader&quot; reminds me of &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; by Kosinski. It has the same oddness about it. It will be interesting to see it disturbing genteel book discussions groups for awhile."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In reading about the Holocaust, I have never put a face or personality to any of the offenders.

Its a great example of power and control and how damaging it is for young boys to engage in relationships with older women or vise versa . It was clear that having been involved in this relationship did not allow the boy to move on with his life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader, by Bernard Schlink, was a moving book. When the aurthor describes the relationship of the two,Michael and Hanna, it makes you feel like you were there going through all that they did. The way he wrote this made me feel like I was in the shoes of one of the character's. I love how he runs through Michaels life at a great moving pace, and then when the problems occur he uses such great structure of how it was. Bernard Schlink uses so many emotions throughout this book you never get tired. When he starts the book with Michael getting sick and being helped by Hanna you never would think anything of anything. Then he goes and describes how they have a very intimate relationship as those of adults, with all the fights and emotions. When you think everything is good for the two he surprises you with the sudden disapperance of Hanna. I thought it was great how he could show how years later after alot of maturing Michael could still love a woman who walked out on him and was now being tried and convicted of murder years ago. At the end when Michael gives Hanna's money to the soul survivor of the murder at a concentration camp, he sends it in the name of Hanna who was sentenced to death for a crime that both she and Michael knew she would have prevented if able. I love how he uses a whirlwind of emotions and at the end gets you with the best kinds, heartbreak and ever lasting love."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What makes Schlink's deserving of my low rating is not any particular stylistic aspecture of the piece, but rather that which does not appear. Schlink takes in hand two subjects possessing of great deterministic and moral power...the issues of illiteracy and ethnocide (by no means am I endeavouring to say that the two stand upon equal footing). He does not, however, lead us to any marvelous realisations regarding these themes. Instead we are left high and dry; he supposes we shall be sated by his little homily that Michael (the protagonist of the piece) finds himself now unable to distinguish the boundaries of his innonence and Hanna's guilt (the implication obviously being that there perhaps are none). While this is a well and valid conclusion, I didn't need to read this piece to have that thought handed to me...Goldhagen's &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners&quot; and &quot;The German Army and Genocide&quot; already do a more valid job. It may be I simply found myself so disenchanted by this book because I fail to conceive of these issues as proper issues for treatment in the framework of a novel.Upon the converse, this book was...memorable. If nothing else, it was certainly memorable...powerful, disturbing, and effecting as well. I find it by no means to be great literature, nor to attempt to deal with a subject that really has any actual place being dealt with in a novel...but &quot;The Reader&quot; does leave the reader with dominant, powerful impressions; the most enduring of which is the idea that guilt must be doled out upon the basis of admissions at the trial...not upon reality."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Whenever I spot a book, movie, article on WWII it's a must read for me. This story shows how two people are drawn together for very simple reasons during a very hard time in postwar Germany. I truly loved it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book draws you in with Michael and Hanna's relationship at the beginning, and character development would naturally seem to follow - but it doesn't. Michael has more passion and evokes more interest from the reader at 15 than at any other point in the book. I wish more could have been written about the reasons for Michael's failed relationships and his generations' attitudes towards the horrors of the holocaust. The book just was not very good. I expected much more from an Oprah book club book. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"... This is a simplistic work, in terms of its so-called &quot;style&quot; (there is none), its themes (treated much more forcefully by hundreds of other writers, but particularly by Hannah Arendt and Elie Wiesel), its outlook (provincial, bordering on ignorant), its insights (along the lines of Jack Handy's &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; on Saturday Night Live) and its tone (deaf).I read this work through because I couldn't believe that George Steiner would have his name attached to a second-rate book. I was not rewarded for my efforts. Maybe Schlink is a personal friend of Steiner's for I can't for the life of me see how anyone of his literary reputation would suggest that The Reader should be &quot;Read...and then Read again.&quot; This is probably the most singularly colorless, dull exercise in language that I've come across. And please don't bring up how that's part of the author's intent, that it's supposed to be some kind of minimalist treatment a la Raymond Carver, or that Schlink chose stark prose to portray a stark subject. It's simply a lack of imagination on the author's part. He hasn't the imaginative power to construct one meaningful metaphor or image.At times, the novel sinks beneath the weight of its banalities to new lows in fiction, as when the author delivers the following &quot;deep thought:&quot; &quot;When an airplane's engines fail, it is not the end of the flight. Airplanes don't fall out of the sky like stones. They glide on, the enormous multi-engined passenger jet, for thirty, forty-five minutes, only to smash themselves up when they attempt a landing. The passengers don't notice a thing. Flying feels the same, whether the engines are working or not....Maybe the very quietness of the flight is appealing to the passsengers.&quot; Really? No one would notice if all the engines failed for forty-five happy, carefree minutes? How many martinis does this guy down on a given trip?The reaction to this book actually frightens me to some extent. So many readers here appear to blithely regard it as some kind of erotic turn-on, a love story infused with serious meditations on the after-effects of the Holocaust. All I noticed was that a 15-year old boy was seduced by a 30+ streetcar conductor (what happened to Frau Schmitz' husband, by the way?), they had a sordid and colorless affair, she dissappeared and then shows up years later in a war-trial. ... While the court proceedings are occuring, the narrator (Michael Berg, aka Schlink) tells us he has erotic dreams about Hanna dressed up in her SS uniform: &quot;The worst were the dreams in which a hard, imperious, cruel Hanna aroused me sexually; I woke from them full of longing and rage. And full of fear about who I really was.&quot; If you are the sort of reader who finds German women in SS costumes exciting, I suggest you rent a Video of &quot;Ursa, She-Wolf of the SS.&quot; I will give Schlink credit for enough self-awareness to admit in the next paragraph that &quot;I knew my fantasized images were poor cliches.&quot; Unfortunately, the same can be said for 99% of this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernard Schlink &amp; Carol Janeway give us a smooth, poingnant, German translated book of love, eroticism and shocking hideous crime.In &quot;The Reader&quot;, I found myself easily drawn into Michael and Hanna's passionate world.

Go into this raw, don't read too much about it.This book packs an emotional punch, but it is a punch that is strangely distant, and for me it faded rather quickly. Perhaps it is because I guessed the plots twists before they happened, but I don't think so. I think it is because there is a difference between American and German authors. This work was translated into English and it came across a little too distant for me. I understand the events in the book forced the author to step back, but it was too much for me. The lack of direct emotion was strangely oft-putting to me.The book is moving, but it is the Chinese food kind of moving. You will be hungry for something emotional rather quickly. It is well written and technically sound novel, but too sanitary."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As with a lot of the novels I've read by Eastern European writers this book does not spend much time on useless adjectives or flowery language. Instead the story is brisk and well formed. Could have used a bit more character development to enhance the psychological drama of the situation (which seemed to be the crux of the story). Overall a good (short) read that hung with me for a few days."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"At first the book was good, but it grew tiresome. I found myself skipping pages at a time. You really didn't get to know the characters. I didn't connect with the main character at all. His affair with the older woman was interesting at first, but it was no great love story. If you're looking for a quick read, but no feelings this is for you."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"though i devour most books i come across, i had to force myself to finish this one. it is not one of oprah's better picks. realizing we all appreciate different books at different times in our lives, depending on &quot;where&quot; we are and &quot;what is going on in our lives&quot; at the time, this book left much to be desired. the characters were flat. i had no empathy for any of them. although there were sentences that caught me up, most of the book left me down. a major disappointment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Why Oprah recommended this book is beyond me! This is not a book I liked reading. The main character is an over-sexed teen and later judgement is passed on the ex-Nazi woman he regularly bed down with. She reads in prison... so what!

The story left so much for the imagination. I just found it so romantic in a way, yet sad at the same time. This book changed my way of thinking."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I wanted to like this novel, but it was just ok. It was very superficial and dialogue driven. The perceptions were lots of words strung together to similate emotion, but it was false emotion. I didn't care for either character, Hanna or Michael, which is a mistake for this kind of novel. The main character is a statuatory rapist, for goodness sake. The later recollections are wordy and tortuous attempts at feeling that don't work, the twist, was not a twist at all (I figured it out earlier than the author wanted me to) and the ending was merciful."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was hoping this would be a great story (being that the movie is causing all sorts of hype and it won a number of awards). I had a lot of trouble finishing this book. The characters never fully develop. The writing is sparse and poor. The main character asks questions throughout that are meant to be thought-provoking but detract from the story and make you feel like you're sitting through a seminar with a boring professor. There are plenty of good books about the Holocaust--and this isn't one of them. Don't waste your money OR your time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was ok, but left me thinking it was kind of gross and weird. The ending was a nice little twist, and it was a quick easy read, but not the greatest thing I've picked up.

If you have nothing better read, go for it, otherwise pass on it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"ALL THE BOOKS OPRAH CHOOSES ARE FANTASTIC!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In their encomia on the cover, Neal Ascherson calls this 'the best novel I read in 1996', while Jorge Semprun hails it as 'one of the most overwhelming novels I have read for a long time'. All I can say is, they can't have read many.I approached 'The Reader' full of eager anticipation: here was the definitive, end-of-the-century novel, by a German, on the Holocaust, Schandgefuehl, reconciliation, coming to terms with the past etc. etc. What I got was a rather lightweight 'rites-of-passage-with-a-twist-in-the-tail'- type story. I agree with the reviewers who feel there is little character development: Michael is a rather shallow individual, and I found it hard to get worked up much one way or the other when Hanna's shady past was revealed. Here, surely, was the point to get the reader to ask him/herself &quot;What would YOU have done in Hanna's situation?&quot;, but, alas, the chance went a-begging. Pity.Overall, 'The Reader' gets pass marks as a little cameo piece about a boy and an older woman, but the failure to put the literary boot in when the time was right means that it never really rises above that. Having said that, it's not the worst book I've ever read and at no time did I ever feel like giving up on it, and I'll probably read it again. It just lacks a bit of depth, that's all.Go ahead and read it and, as with all books, make up your own mind, but take those gushing reviews with a large pinch of NaCl."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Not often does one come across a novel this perfect. A dizzying array of emotions swept over me as I read of the love affair between 15 year old Michael and 36 year old Hanna and its aftermath - lust, loss, horror, revulsion. In the end this affair is a metaphor for the relationship between the Germany of the Third Reich and the Post War Germany. Read, The Reader, savor it, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A story of growing up... growing older... and the ethical and moral decisions we must make along the way. Definitely worth reading and digesting thoroughly. To be savored."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Many reviewers, I believe, missed the point of the story as a whole. Many focused solely on the trial of war crimes and the holocost itself, but disregarded the human elements of love, obsession, shame, and dignity of the main characters. Schlink does a beautiful job of making the reader want to know more about his characters and, ultimately, care about them. Schlink's work is so beautifully done that there is no need for excessive dialoge or flowery language. These elements are often misused, and confused as necessary for literary greatness. The Reader engages it's audience and stimulates thought and emotion. A work that is worthy of it's praises."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really enjoyed this novel-- very compelling. Ironically, its style owes alot to Knut Hamsun's &quot;Victoria'; while Hamsun won the Nobel prize, he was later exposed as a nazi sympathizer. The book really gives some insight into what recent historians have described as the 'blandness' of the nazies and nazi sympathizers, and to a certain extent, germans in general during the war."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It really seems that German people can't get over their shame and guilt about what happened over 50 years ago; this is another book on the same old subject, but I must say one of the best. Schlink doesn't fall into apologizing, he tries to explain why it all happened. It's simple: nazis weren't inhuman, they were very human, and the reason we are so horrified about their deeds is because we can imagine ourselves in their places. This idea in itself makes the book worth reading, but it's also a story of love and human relationships, and a very true one, if somewhat cynical and pessimistic. A fascinating tale indeed, even if it's a bit difficult to read in all its heaviness."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This short novel bears reading and re-reading. Although translated from the German, there is never an awkward word or phrase. How complex life really is: love, sex, betrayal, the morality of one's decisions. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates good writing and is interested in what lies beneath the surface."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As I read the first chapters of the book, I wondered why I continued reading, almost embarrassed by its contents. By the second half of the book you realize that you are drawn in by curiosity of a young boys sexual dream come true. It is then that the characters, seen years later, take on a new personna, and you become witness to an emotional, disturbing, story of post war Germany, and its effects on those involved. The easy reading 'part one' becomes intensely thought provoking in 'part two.' Great book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Read this wonderfull book in one sitting. But I found it easier to place fault in Hannah. (Although it is skillfull writting to see how being in love makes it hard to condemn someone of a crime they committed.) She does not seem as innocent as some here have stated...and none have commented on how she &quot;ruins&quot; Michael for any future healthy relationships. If she had met him in the camps..she would have sent him away to die. Would I have done the same if I were her, in the same place...ie: allow the women to die in the camp? I hope not but who knows? But if I did...I am guilty and so is she."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I saw the movie first and read the book 2 days later. I was blown away by the story. The philosophical questions it raises are haunting. I am so glad I saw the movie first, because there were no spoilers...all a surprise. The book then fleshed out the story in ways that the film did not. This was a story that needed to be told. It humanizes and somewhat gives rationale to those who arguably unwittingly conspired to commit one of the worst atrocities in history. It was clear to me, however, that Hanna never forgave herself and was haunted by what she had done. It is also clear that Michael loved her and was never able to get over her. By seducing him as a minor, Hanna actually perpetrated another crime, although it didn't feel that way when reading the story...it felt more like a love story. He was tortured for life, however, which is why coming of age shouldn't happen this way. In the end, perhaps he was able to move on. Questions remain as to who Hanna really was and why she had no family or friends."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After reading any story, I always think: What was I supposed to take away from this? In the end I think this was a story about a woman who really had no sense of right and wrong. She showed no remorse for sending Jews to their death then she shows no remorse in seducing a 15 year old boy. She was a totally selfish woman-she learned from him, she took from him and ultimately he received nothing valuable in return. But of course, in real life, things like this can happen. I like books that make me think, and this one did."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Seldom have I read a book that seemed so simple on the surface, but remained in my mind so long as I peeled away layer after layer of complexity like peeling an onion. I'll leave the debate to others; for me, The Reader was one of those books you surrender to and allow the author to lead you down passageways both light and dark.I finished The Reader on a Sunday evening. It's now Wednesday and the characters of Michael and the doomed Hanna remain at the edges of my consciousness. My inner debate still rages over their actions. I have no doubt but that it will for a long time to come.Thank you, Bernhard Schlink, for such an extraordinary book ... a book that uses a simple story to shine the light on moral and ethical complexities."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an excellent novel about Germany's shame; in particular the strain it has placed on a generation of children unable to respect their parents because of their participation or inaction during the Holocaust. Much of the emotion in The Reader remains unexpressed, but always present, lurking beneath unspoken words. The prose is spare and at times emotionally detached, yet the author manages to evoke strong feelings and to force the reader to reflect on the complex issues raised by the novel.The Reader is a \`morally ambiguous' novel. The characters are flawed and can not be easily categorized as clearly good or bad. Hanna, the 30-something former SS Guard who seduces the 15 year old protagonist of the novel and who later stands trail for war crimes is guilty of many things but she has redeeming qualities as well. When she asks the judge at the trial \\"\\"What would you have done?\\" she poses a question that haunts the post-war generation and the answer is more complicated than it might first appear. The Reader does not absolve guilt or relieve shame, and efforts to seek atonement are acknowledged for what they are but are ultimately inadequate.I appreciated that this novel avoided sentimentality. For a novel that, on its surface, appears emotionally flat, I found it surprisingly moving and thought provoking. There are no easy answers in The Reader. Horrible atrocities were committed that can not be forgiven but most of those who followed orders or who were passively compliant, weren't evil people; they were just flawed human beings who lacked the courage or resolve necessary to make different choices. The narrator tells us that \\"Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it\\". His own experience is complicated by his love of Hanna. In a way it makes him party to the guilt of his parent's generation while at the same time leaving him with the shame of his own generation.The Reader is a short, engaging, and thought provoking novel that I found nearly impossible to put down. The characters and their story are presented, warts and all, for the reader to consider, free of contrivances, emotional manipulation, and overwrought sentimentality. This is an open and honest novel that I highly recommend. 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A short novel that's written in clear, precise prose, \\"The Reader\\" is a worthwhile piece of fiction by German author Bernhard Schlink.The plot centers around Hanna Schmitz, a middle-aged woman with a mysterious past who seduces a young boy and oddly makes him read to her. I thought she was well developed, complex, and lovely, and she only becomes deeper as the story goes on. The other main character, and the story's point of view, is Michael Berg, who falls for Hanna as a child. She never tells him of the crimes she has (or has not) committed, but at an older age he attends her trial, and it is from this perspective that we learn of what Hanna has been accused of.In the end you find out what Hanna's dark secret is that's \\"more shameful even than murder\\"... and some readers will buy into this conclusion; others will not. I had a hard time with it at first, but once I considered it a bit more, and took into account the sociology, setting, and government of the times, it did make sense.When we meet up with Hanna after she's been imprisoned, the transformation (as well as conclusion of her character) is one of the best in literature that I've read.There are some issues that need to be taken into consideration, such as the translation from the German. I always wonder if we're reading what, exactly, the author would have written if it were to be created originally in English. But this translation works well.I would recommend this book to you if you're past the level of literature that you, as a reader, can think, analyze, and decide for yourself. The plot is heavy and considers morals (personal, as well as social and political) regarding war, sexuality, and shame - shame that is impressed upon us by society's convictions, as well as shame that is created within our own selves. And it shows us what all this Shame will drive us to do, but Schlink does not tell us why. That will be your job."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In mid-century Berlin, a young boy falls ill on the street; he is assisted by a woman who helps him clean up and sets him on his feet again. When he returns a few weeks later, to thank her, the two begin forming a pattern for their time together: making love and reading.First he reads to her and then they make love. This relationship never leaves the spare rooms. The boy holds his secret safe inside; it warms him and comforts him, bolstering his self-confidence.And then she is gone. The rooms are vacant and there is nothing left behind - no clues to why she left or to her current whereabouts.The boy - Michael Berg - misses her, this woman, Hanna Schmidt. He compares each subsequent relationship to the one they had and all others fall short. Even though his relationship with the woman was very narrow and contained little in the way of sharing - just the reading and the sex.Years later, while a student, Michael is involved in legal coursework, which leads to his attendance at a trial. Several defendants are being held accountable for deaths in the concentration camp - people who died in a burning church. One of the defendants is Hanna.As the facts emerge throughout the trial, Michael begins to piece together several clues that reveal a deep secret held by Hanna - a secret that, if told, could actually improve her lot in the case. But she says nothing. And Michael, who struggles with whether or not to come forward, also remains silent. And she is sentenced to life in prison.Through the years, he confronts the issues again and again, wondering if he did the right thing. His struggle against the possibility of altering someone's fate - especially when that person has obviously chosen not to act on her own behalf - or remaining silent and allowing a miscarriage of justice. Eventually, he stifles the conflicts in order to get on with everyday life. But underneath, informing all of his choices is the emotional muffling that occurs when strong feelings are suppressed in such a way.A deep and moving exploration of moral ambiguities and conflicting choices,The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)is memorable and emotionally stirring.Laurel-Rain SnowAuthor of: Web of Tyranny, etc."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Like any fifteen-year-old boy would be, Michael Berg was essentially overwhelmed with the icy good looks of thirty-six-year-old Hanna. Their multi-month affair was intense, awakening, and to some degree exploitative; however, there was a certain reserve and sharpness about Hanna that Michael could never penetrate. Her sudden departure and her memory haunted him for years, but he was completely unprepared for the devastating impact of seeing Hanna as a defendant in a war crimes trial, which he was observing as an assignment for a law school seminar.The facts that Hanna was a Nazi concentration camp guard and that she was one of several guards charged with overseeing female prisoners who burned to death in a locked cathedral after an allied bombing raid are not in dispute. At this point the questions are many: had he years before not seen or simply ignored a propensity for cruelty, could a person in her position realistically defy orders, what is the complicity and culpability of the entire German society relating to Nazi atrocities, and do laws and legal process actually lead to justice? Beyond these reflections, Michael had to decide whether he should make contact with her and in what way.Michael finds no easy answers and is quite equivocal in the manner in which he should now relate to Hanna. It is the discovery of a secret, an unusual shortcoming, of Hanna's that permits him to at least partially understand her past actions and to embark on a course of action that was perhaps all that circumstance allowed.The book is structured as a book within a book with Michael finally capturing the history and his thoughts of his long association with Hanna. Perhaps the reader will want to question what Hanna or Michael could have done differently, but they, as in life, only get one chance. The book proceeds reasonably well considering the frequent reflection and the author's tendency for a somewhat difficult writing style. It is definitely an absorbing and cautionary tale"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Like a lot of great books I've read, I heard about this story because of the upcoming movie with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes. Since they are two of my favorite actors, I was sure that there must be something worth looking at so I got the novel to read first.I haven't seen the movie yet...but I'm not sure just HOW they can really do this story justice on film. The complexities and timeframe of the story might be too much to get across in a two-hour film.The novel not only looks back on a lost love between a 15 year-old German boy and a 40 year-old woman but also addresses the monstrous shadow of the Nazi past cast over all Germans ever since. It reads very fast without an ounce of fat on it. The economy of the author is impeccible. It doesn't dwell on the horrors of the Holocaust but succinctly considers the aftermath of the generations since: how do we live with this, how do we even begin to address it?The novel's believability often took me by surprise and I couldn't find a false note in it.Very powerful, excellently written. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I knew nothing about this book and thought the beginning was a beautifully told love story (illicit, but...still told in a very thought provoking, well written way). Then it turned into a 'coming of age' novel. Next it bacame a holocaust trial story and then became the protaganists moral fall from grace and descent into self hate. Finally there comes redemption through the years of impersonal contact with Hanna. Though a way to sooth his guilt over not speaking up at the trial, I found his attempt to mend the broken bridges of his and Hanna's life commendable. I think this novel speaks to those Germans who had fathers in the SS and concentration camps. It speaks from their point of view and their horrific guilt about the atrocities committed during their lifetime. They have to live with it and they know they can never do enough to pay for the 'silence' of their relatives and ancestors. I did gasp at the end because it surprised me so (can't reveal this for potential readers)but the writer could not end it any other way. A book that will leave you with many questions and new insights. A book that I will remember."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I expected this book wouldn't suit everyone's taste, but I am shocked that many people found the book a waste of time. I also can't believe that so many people have reviewed it in a way that gave so much away!I found this book to be a very good read. I had minor issues with the way the plot worked it's way out, but then again, reading would stink if everything always turned out the way I expected it would.The best part about The Reader for me is that it ties a substantial historical event to the relationship of two average people. Schlink's message on the betrayal in a relationship is right on the money. It was clear to me that both Hanna and Michael had roles in destroying their relationship, although Hanna played a heavier hand. As other reviewers have stated, there was also the issue of Michael being at the wrong time in his life for this relationship. Anyone that did like this book from the mixed age relationship \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" perspective should read A Widow For One Year by John Irving.As I stated, I really enjoyed the book and it was a fast read. I was ever so slightly disappointed in the end. I can't give it 5 stars, as I wouldn't place it in my favorites for all time, but it was one of the best I read this year. It is worth reading at least once, and pay careful attention to Michael's own betrayal. It is a valuable life lesson to anybody. I will read it again someday."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I saw this book on Oprah's show and decided to buy it because of Oprah's glowing remarks. I do not recommend this book for many reasons. The primary reason is that the character development is weak. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters, whether it be hatred or love. The plot was not very interesting either, and although I did finish it within several hours, it was not a page turner. Obviously, being a page-turner is not a primary reason to read a book. However, it offered very little literary value, and it was not a book that challenged your mind. The only reason that I continued to read it was because I had hoped that it would get better. It didn't. You will be very sorry that you wasted your time with this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It's a story that will touch various readers differently, depending on how history has touched them. For some, the story might be insignificant yet for others it might be even personal. For me, it was a new avenue of questions which has opened up ever since. It was not about the war or the atrocities about it. It was about something totally different, ie. the generation which was not involved directly and yet affected by it greatly. Something, not many of us have considered or given much thought of. The book is a good read about it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought this was an interesting story, but after reading the book just consider it an average read. It's not long and easy to read...two of its best features."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Yes of course Micheal is obessed with his first love; this woman has reparented a young boy who had been emotionally neglected by his own parents.

I didn't enjoy this book at all."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"...and I DO read quite a bit! I have just finished this masterpiece and am still reeling from the subtle beauty, the heartbreak- this book has just secured a spot on my all-time Top Three. The Reader is the kind of book you will want to read again and again- it already feels like an old friend."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The first few pages of the booked grabbed my attention, but the rest seemed too distant from the beginning part of the book. This is not a story about friendship at all. A friendship is when two people benefit from the relationship. The fact that the child is 15 and she is much older, has nothing to do with my rating. Though I morally have a problem with it, the fact that the &quot;love&quot; he felt for her seems to have driven the path of his life bothers me even more. The story isn't very believable. We all remember our first loves, but we do manage to move one. Hanna's character is more believable than Michael's, but it's almost like the book should have been about her past, with which she is obsessed, not about Michael's obsession. I was rather dissappointed in Oprah's pick. Robin, Worcester"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"So many issues come to light in this book, yet it is written in an understated, almost simple manner. The questions of how a generation of young Germans must deal with the Holocaust, and the specific contradictions in Michael Berg's situation because of his involvement with Hanna are presented in a way that invokes the reader's sensibilities. The book is not perfect, however, as there are some flaws, especially with the question of what was Michael actually doing during WWII, how it effected his life, etc. To not have dealt with this left me feeling a bit jiped, but the overall idea of the book and its resolution (or perhaps lack of one) made it a very compelling and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What an interesting and thought-provoking novel. I have never read a book quite like this one, one that deals with the Holocaust, Jews or concentration camps. I have to admit I am pretty ignorant about the topic, so I had a hard time understanding the trial. Aside from that, I was moved by the story and how it developed and ultimately how it ended. Very quick read, so even if it isn't your kind of book, stick with it because it takes so little time to finish. And, as in my case, you may even end up liking it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a story that everyone can identify with. The identification does not have to be literal. The questions are thought provoking for all of us."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was hoping this book would provide me with something much more. As a person born in post war Germany with parents who were teenagers during the war, with grandparents who experienced their realities I thought this book could have given more. I found the inner struggle that the protaganist expresses superficial and empty. I kept thinking maybe the book lost something in the translation. I gave the book to my parents to read and they felt the same way. Fortunately it was quick to read but at the end I felt nothing. I was hoping for more."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am not offended by this book, although I do feel that Hannah's relationship with &quot;The Kid&quot; was abusive. I think there is depth in this book that I did not feel, because the writing style did not click with me. I did enjoy the story. I did appreciate the way the book depicted the affect of the abuse on the boy's whole life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book combines several elements that, by themselves, would have made interesting stories. Put together in this one tale, I found it one of the most thought-provoking books I've read in a long time.The author's recognition of the fact that our first sexual encounters often shape our impressions and expectations of future relationships is well-done but not over-done. And, unlike many authors, Bernhard Schlink does not attempt to explain the behavior of the world or necessarily even the behavior of the most minor characters in the narrative. The story haunts me even now that I have finished the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book at first seemed to simplistic for such a deep subject.

Over all I enjoyed the book it was a very quick read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The hurt that Schlink inadvertenly puts on his readers. Or maybe he purposefully made you remember those people, lovers and friends, who you found reasons to avoid or just fail to call or write or in this case, visit. I found the premise plausible. Where else could she turn to love and what an education he received...in love and leaving.I will suggest it to our book club."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I started this book and could not put it down.

I was riveted ... glued to my seat the entire time. Couldn't wait for the next piece, but didn't want it to end either. The three parts are very different in tone and atmosphere, and I found myself marveling at how Bernhard Schlink wrote 3 distinctly separate stories that weave so seamlessly into one coherent picture. That the story was set in the area I grew up in, was another unexpected treat - I could see very clearly the landscapes he was describing.I listened to the audio version - and I loved the way Campbell Scott gave voices to the characters! I actually liked the fact that &quot;The Reader&quot; didn't offer any answers, only raised questions - that made this story very truthful for me.I'm a native German speaker, and am very picky about translated literature - but this was wonderfully translated!

The writing was very good and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is often difficult for the modern American Reader to immerse themselves into the European world of symbol, myth and power. Yet, if one is to fully understand the power of this work that is exactly what must be accomplished. This is not a Romance, it is not a history, it is a metaphor that presents the ongoing struggle of passion to transcend the dark side of humanity and in so doing, bring some sense of redemption to those haunting events of history that often overpower the humanity of us all.When I first began reading this work I was taken aback by its abruptness and terse presentation. However, as the story began to unfold it became apparent that the author was attempting to place his characters in a life setting that incorporated the youthful passions of a generation in the process of renewal and the shadow of youthful passions whose blind allegiance to forces beyond anyone's control ultimately led to its corruption and downfall. Hannah is the epitome of the youthful passion suffering under the weight of age and guilt. Images such as Hannah working on the Streetcar, a train that in reality goes nowhere, and her retreat to the warmth of a bath secluded from the business of the world are worth reflection. The desire of Hannah to be read to is indicative of a childlike curiosity stretched between the harsh reality of what was and what yet may be. How interesting the twist of fate that brings the end of the relationship, Hannah's arrest, trial and imprisonment. The irony is that she keeps her silence, in fact all keep silence except those who accuse her of brutality. Intriguing is the picture. The accusor, the accused, the facts in contrast with the findings of the court and then, the reality that the accused has taken upon herself a portion of the collective guilt. Read this book with a discerning eye and pay attention to the weavings of a tale that reflects a modern tragedy in the making. Fallen powers, twisted personalities, character flaws and the desire for redemption all make their presence known."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is the story of a love affair. And this it is the story of postwar Germany.I had been tempted to put the book down at the beginning. At first I was annoyed at what seemed like an awkward translation, too much description of buildings and scenery and the romantic details of the love story between the teen-age boy and an older woman. I'm glad I pushed on though as the complexity of the story deepened.Questions were raised. Deep moral questions. Questions of law. Questions of conscience. How does a generation of young Germans too young to have personally experienced the Third Reich deal with the past? How do they view their parents? What are the internal struggles of the individuals? At what point are choices made? And what exactly is love?There are no easy answers.This book examines some unexplored issues though characters so real that I feel that I know them. It never answers the questions it raised. Instead, however, it enriches perception and understanding."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader did what a good book is suppose to... make one forget their own world and live in the book for a few hours. I was drawn into this book like one is drawn to a scene of a horrible accident. I felt like I was reading someone's dirty secret, yet I couldn't stop reading. In the end it made me wonder what I would do in the same situation. The book is eloquently and tastefully translated. Take your time with this book to appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"How much do your past actions really affect you later in life? I think this is a question that this book addresses in a manner that I've never even thought of before. It also confronts the reader with the question as to how many past occurrences you are willing to overlook. The story revolves around a man, Michael, who has been infinitely impacted by a series of events that took place when he was fifteen years old. The author also presents the Holocaust in a manner that the reader can almost sympathize with. This is very different from many other novels on this particular subject. You come to know Hanna, another main character, as a sweet older woman and Michael's lover. Therefore, it is hard to condemn her for her past actions, even though most people wouldn't even think twice about sympathizing with what she did. Overall, I felt the book kept my attention and made me think about some of my morals and my feelings towards others. I would definitely recommend this book, if for no other reason than to give yourself a new perspective on the Holocaust and for the experience of an interesting piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who loves to read and for educators who teach Language Arts or the history of the Holocaust. Set in WWII Germany, it is full of history, romance and heartbreak. Most importantly, it shows the deep shame felt by those who are illiterate and go to the greatest of length to hide it. Heartwrenching and unforgettable, I have read it twice and will read it again."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Admittedly, this seems to be one of those books that you either love or you hate, but I really enjoyed it. Perhaps that is because I lived in Germany for three years as an adolescent in the early 1980s, where I experienced firsthand the average German's reluctance to discuss the Holocaust.The first half of the book follows the illicit love affair between 15-year old Michael, and his 30something lover, Hanna, in post-War West Berlin. The affair ends when Hanna disappears. Michael doesn't see her again until years later, when he is a law student, and Hanna is on trial for a terrible crime. As the jacket states, &quot;As he watches her refuse to defend herself, Michael gradually realizes that his former lover may be a guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder.&quot;Ultimately, &quot;The Reader&quot; explores the legacy of shame wrought on the post-War generation of Germans by the atrocities committed by their forebears in the Holocaust. Through the story of Michael and Hanna, Schlink exposes the dilemma facing Germans of his generation: reconciling the love they feel for their parents and grandparents with the realization that those very same people allowed the &quot;unspeakable&quot; to happen, either through direct participation or through silent acquiescence"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Hopefully, if you are reading this review, under this book (and not under the \\"movie edition tie-in\\" link), you have not seen the movie nor- hopefully- know what the movie is about. The surprise- the twist- the unexpected dimension that this book takes half way through the story is one of the most rewarding and thought-provoking turns a novel has taken in many years.It starts off as a typical Older Woman/Younger Man (15 years old), December/May, reads like a male fantasy, memoir. Lots of questions- Why was she like this? what did she do during the day? Why must I ask all these questions?- that have been written by young male characters before. It is nothing new, but it is well written and the conection between the two characters is alive and believable.Then, halfway through the book, information is revealed that casts the relationship in an entirely new light. In the hopes that you do not know what that information is, no spoiler alert here. It is not contrived or stretching the boundaries of coinicidence, just so you know, and gives the novel an entirely new tone and importance.Simple, straightforward, brilliantly executed- an amazing love story and an amazing morality tale."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Barely a week ago I saw the movie of The Reader. As the child of Holocaust survivors, I make it a point to read what is written on the subject and to see films and TV programs that address it. I was more than disappointed in the film -- I was troubled by the mixed messages it seemed to send about individual German's culpability in the horrow of the Holocaust. The film seemed to be saying that Hanna, the central character in the film, had a secret -- that she was illiterate -- that was somehow more shameful to her than her actions as a concentration camp guard and that somehow this was understandable. I think the mere fact that Hanna is played by Kate Winslet, who is such a powerful screen presence, causes this almost sympathetic reaction. I felt the audience was being invited to pity her, and this bothered me immensely. I had some interesting discussions with friends about the film, many of whom disagreed with my point of view.I decided I needed to know more and chose to read the novel. What a revelation. The novel is everything the film is not. I was immediately drawn into the spare, unadorned prose, entirely depicting Michael's first-person memories and questioning thoughts,and which moved along at a furious pace that kept me glued to the page (or screen, as I was reading on the Kindle). In the novel, Michael grapples with big questions of love and dependency, guilt and obligation,knowledge and denial, forgiveness and absolution.The novel makes clear that the love story between Michael and Hanna is really a metaphor for the effort of the post-war generation in Germany to grapple with the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich and the role that their parent's generation played in those horrors. Should the younger generation try to understand their elders? Should they stop loving those that are revealed to have been complicit? Are they obligated to make amends to the victims? Should they forgive? Should they continue to assume the guilt of their parents? Should they forget or remember? None of these are easy questions, and they are certainly not resolved in the novel. But through Michael's unflinching telling of his story, we are given glimpses into how a generation must have felt to have to deal with knowledge so painful and to wonder if what they would have done.Those who gave the book one star reviews and complained about lack of character development and too many unanswered questions posed by the narrator are missing the point of the novel. These are first-person memories designed to help the person sharing them come to terms with his past and who he is. It is about healing yourself. In that it is akin to a memoir, not a character study. If you're looking for historic explanation and poetic descriptions of people, places, and events, this is not the book for you. If you want an honest exploration of what it means to look evil in the face and come to some sort of understanding of your role in abetting it or exonerating it, you will be enriched by reading \\"The Reader.\\""},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book as part of a short class on the second generation of people after the Holocaust. It was thought provoking, but, in many ways, flat. The narrator is, as my professor said, &quot;a collection of ideas,&quot; and never evolves into a real person. Some of this is intentional on the author's part, however, it becomes inconsistant with what he is able to determine about Hanna (he doesn't have that much insight!). Hanna is the most well drawn character in the book, and, despite her past, has some integrity (she admits to her what she has done and denies what she has not). Her illiteracty explains how SHE became involved to the extent she did, but is by no means an explanation for all participants. It made me think about what I would have done in her postion, and the most real part of the book is when Hanna turns to the judge and says, &quot;...what would you have done?&quot;--and truly wants an answer."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book mesmerised me on several levels. Its spare and lucid language captured me in a dream. In that dream, a young man's emotional involvement with an older woman, colours the rest of his life. I think that this book is not only about secrets but the mystery of being and how events shape us and transfigure us in damaging ways. And this book is full of emotion, implied in a gesture, a word, a look- but what that emotion might be, no one seems to know. The author has captured the essence of emotion.The story raises the question of &quot;what should one feel&quot;? And, &quot;how should one judge?&quot; What would I have done given those circumstances, either Hannah's or Michael's?Hannah, in caring for Michael, simply continued doing what she had done in her unspeakable sojourn earlier on. She gave him what he needed, and seemed to ask for little in return. In effect, she nurtured the qualities in him that made him successful. There's a mutually redemptive quality to their relationship, that unfortunately, in the end, never reached its full potential. Not only the secret came between them, but far greater secrets- how we can become prisoners of our past.In the end, I wept for both of them.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to think!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"First of all, I never found any connection between the part of the book where Hanna and Michael are having a deeply sexual relationship and the part where she is on trial. I know that Michael ties it together with illiteracy, but to me that seems weak. I also didn't understand Michael's having an obsession with Hanna, which was not always sexual, for all those years. At the end something did seem to be showing a deeper message but I don't understand it still. The language kind of confused me, but it's really not that difficult. I don't know, see if you can understand this book or just enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It was not until page 188 (of 218) that this book clicked with me. Until that moment, \\"The Reader\\" was a quick read with little depth or reader engagement. Mediocre, at best. In a landslide, however, the story grabbed at my heart and tested my reasoning. The climax of this story makes it a worthwhile read.The final thirty pages depict a narrator torn by his past and present, and trying to reason his relationship with a Nazi SS Guard. Beyond the themes of anti-semitism, hate, and prejudice, the narrator grapples with the forces of human nature. His troubles are those that you and I will endure in our own lifetimes. This story and its particular outcome begin to place our own circumstances and stories in perspective.If for no other reason that seeing how you react to the climax of the story, I highly recommend \\"The Reader.\\" It begins as a shallow harlot's tale, but eventually wraps itself around your psyche."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an amazing book about Post-War Germany and the guilt of the &quot;second generation.&quot; It starts as a love story, but ends as a thought-provoking tradegy. Well written as well."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. It was one of the most intense, compelling, and moving books I have ever read or listened to. Powerful!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The beginning was beautifully written and sensitive. After Hanna leaves, the story goes down such a different path that is so disconnected from the beginning which I call the first story. While I appreciate the message that the second part of the book was sending, it was like reading a book written in two parts by two unequally talented authors."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is not about the Holocaust or Jews or the Nazis or the wars. It's about love.The life of young Michael Berg is changed forever when he fell into the arms of Hanna Schmitz, a woman more than a decade older than himself.When she left him, he withdrew into his own self, developed a hardness in himself, presumably to protect himself from further hurt and later compared all his other lovers to his first one, Hanna.Just how much of ourselves do we see in Michael? How many of us are withholding ourselves, immersing our senses into work to numb ourselves and to ease the hurt that's ever ready to pounce on us when we let our guard down for just a little?Bernhard Schlink painted a dark picture of love went wrong; a life whose happiness had been snatched away because one had closed himself up for too long and avoided what his heart told him for fear of pain.If there's one thing to learn from The Reader, it's to face up to the hurt and grow from it, which Michael had clearly failed.Not a totally easy book to read but the words therein contained a valuable lesson that we should seek to understand."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I absolutely could not wait to read this book. As it turns out, I could have waited all my life and not missed much. The Reader's premise is a very intriguing story line with so much potential. Unfortunately, the outcome is a disappointing and depressing book that leaves much to be desired. The story develops in a very uneasy way. I felt like this story wanted to almost stop itself from being told. With all of the wonderful books out there I am a little dissapointed that I spent my time on this one."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A plethora of thoughful insights hung on an improbable plot line written beautifully."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The first time I picked up The Reader I was astonished at it's boldness. I was not prepared for the oncoming adult content but nevertheless I enjoyed it. The Reader held my attention throughout the entire novel. I did not run into any slow points nor did I run into any really confusing areas. I enjoyed the level of difficulty in the writing but it was never too hard to follow. I think the sexual anecdotes also kept my attention. I would recommend The Reader for anyone interested in a quick novel with a lot of insight."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a well-written, simple and easy to follow read. Through the first person narrator, Michael, the reader travels through post-World War II Germany to give us insight into the decisions, thoughts, behaviors, and the way moral values can be challenged in life. We journey through three phases in Michael's life. In many ways each of us can find a little Michael in ourselves. He is at first vulnerable and dependent. Then he is growing and learning by trial and error to formulate his own identity. In the third and final phase Michael is grown man, with ideas, morals, feelings, and beliefs of his own. The Reader will force the audience to determine right from wrong and bring back a painful time in history. Michael gives us a glimpse into how a fifteen year old boy still longs for adult attention. His relationship with a thirty-six year old woman may be viewed as a warning to adults that they have a responsibility to protect the young and not trespass or allow anyone else to trespass on their weaknesses and innocence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Little or no ware like a newly bought copy so I could destroy it as I fell asleep with it to give it some character myself.

Makes you understand the other side of things and why animals do what humans consider wrong."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is a pure example of why that classic tenet of writing is crucial. Too much of this story is the author/narrator telling us what he's thinking, rather than showing us.For all his introspection, Michael was quite an oblivious guy. Hanna's big secret was obvious (and I don't typically catch on to these things unless I'm hit with a two by four...) well before Michael figured it out.Both Michael and Hanna had few, if any redeeming qualities, which is unrealistic and why some reviewers are saying the character development is virtually non-existent.The real secret, and more interesting angle than Michael's teenage angst that he never outgrew, is how did Hanna become the person she was? Michael didn't seem to want to know, therefore neither will we."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The reader in my opinion was a very strange book about a boy's obsession with an older woman. I can see the irony in the woman later turning out to be a former SS officer, but I don't see why the author had to put so much sexually explicit material in a book about crimes committed in the past. Other then that I found the authors side quest to understand the holocaust to be quite worthy of note."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I must admit, this book is not the best book ever, but it is a good book nonetheless. There are a few parts I found rather boring but for the most part, I was well into the book and enjoying the characters. What I like about \\"The Reader\\" is that it is a love story without a happy ending. It's a lot like real life and very believable. Since the book is translated from German, I found that the book wasn't beautifully written. I'm sure if I could read German there would be much more emotion to this book. The book is very short as well, so it's something that one can read on the weekend or so."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Not a very good book.

But if something hurts me, the hurts I suffered back then come back to me, and when I feel guilty, the feelings of guilt return; if I yearn for something today, or feel homesick, I feel the yearnings and homesickness from back then. The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed or pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive. I understand this. Nevertheless, I sometimes find it hard to bear.\\"This book was hard to read for me but I feel blessed to not have been a part, in any way, of Nazi history.

The second part however, lacked the sensitivity and emotion of the first part. The ending, I believe, is fitting to the novel. Surely a one-day read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story never went beyond the surface. It is a quick read but nothing more. There are no moral lessons to learn from this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is more about relationship and the perculiarities of the human mind than it is about the Holocaust or Jews. Schlink's observations about behavior and your emotions when passion is involved are often deadly accurate. The plot is rather unique, and his descriptions and observations of the events leave no doubt that at least portions of this story really occurred. The author's prose is clear and concise, no wasted words or excessive imagery, which on occasion wouldn't have been a bad thing. Hanna is a peculiar character, sometimes sad, at other times frustrating and impossible to figure out. Having been on the same end of a May-December romance, I can relate to much of Schlink's confusions and desires as he speaks of Hanna. He raises some questions and issues to which he gives no answer, but all things considered, a fine novel. One thing I very much liked is that the events and outcomes were generally logical and the turning of events believable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For anyone who likes their stories transparent and easily digestible, this novel will prove disappointing; for those who love Ford Madox Ford's 'Good Soldier', it will exceed our expectations. Its control of point-of-view is masterly.It is, as it tells us, a novel of 'unconscious pain' - of Michael, Hanna, his parents, and the unwitting victims of the Holocaust, those children of the survivors. To unlock the novel, we have first to understand its metaphoric nature. We are given a clue from the image of the house which invests Michael's dreams. Within the austere prose, we snatch glimpses of a far greater pain, like a house which gives us just a hint of the spaces within; or like having a quick look through a window into room upon room. Doors are seen leading to more doors, and in reading the novel, we must unlock them ourselves.'The Reader' tells us more from what it leaves unsaid than what it says and demands of us an involvement that lesser books do not. Often it depends on just a word or two. But don't be disappointed by its deceptively casual references and allow its magic to work. In return it will enthrall you."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"very fast reading..i guess in germany this book struck a nerve..to me it was old news..i bet this book had oprah's army of soccer mom's scratching their heads..on the one hand they must be wondering what they would do if they were hanna's position when she met the boy..on the other hand, they must be saying,&quot;gee, war is bad. i wonder what oprah would do?&quot; the reader also has a &quot;surprise&quot; secret that might or might not explain hanna's motivation.."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What a BIG disappointment.

He lived his life without conviction or passion and whined about it. The woman might have had more life, but through his eyes was flat and unsympathetic. All in all the book was depressing without containing any redeeming insights into human nature. Somebody should give Oprah some upbeat, multidimensional books to read for a change.

And why was it written in Dutch? And with a horrible Flemish accent?

As the title implies Michael is asked to read out loud various books to appease Hanna. They have a steamy affair and then Hanna disappears without a trace.As the story unfolds we learn that she was a concentration camp guard and was responsible for the murder of numerous women and children. During her trial when the prosecuting attorney shows her a written confession and asks her whether she wrote the document, Hanna agrees it to be hers. She was an illiterate and did not want the ignominy. One can argue was it shame or guilt which prompted her to own up to her sins. In the end Hanna redeems herself but at a cost.It is almost impossible to reconcile with the fact that after she was sent to jail for 18 years, the narrator, never bothers to contact her. He sends her book tapes but never writes her a personal note. It defies logic or human nature.Germans for generations would be burdened by the guilt of their parents, ancestors, participants of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is excellent! It truly made me think and evaluate my own personal philosophy of the world and people. You can't walk away from this book unchanged."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked this book up without knowing much about it, and read it on an airplane. It would be remarkable if it was a true story, but as a fictional novel one has to wonder about the motivation. That said, the story itself starts slowly and is perhaps overly done in regards to the sexual relationship between a young man and a much older woman. On a couple of occasions I just about put the book down in the first third as the story was choppy and seemed to be a sensationalized fantasy of a male teen-ager, but was glad I didn't drop the story there.The emotion evoked in the last several chapters is so vivid one can feel it long after the book is over. The sense of loss, the emptiness of change and the confusion between morality and personal attachment is explored quite deeply. I think that perhaps what makes the story compelling, and sometimes a bit frustrating, is the perspective of the main character. We are let in as if it is being told in the first person, but either the central character is a person who has difficulty accepting and processing reality, or the audience is only let in so far.In the end, this is a story about expectations, and the loss that comes with change. It is about the moments in time when reality in the present comes face to face with our memories and our held beliefs about situations and people. The result is always bittersweet and vividly powerful. A good read, and a moving story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader, by Bernhard Shlink is the story of a timid, fifteen year old boy corrupted byan older woman. Young Michael Berg falls into a lustful relationship with a thirty-year oldwoman named Hannah.

Although he loved her henever knew her so he seeks to find out more about the camps and the Nazi past.This book intrigued me from the very begninng. The steamy relationship sets thescene for the rest of a deep book filled with unanswered questions. Hannah is a characterof mystery and throughtout the novel, Michael searches to find out more about her. Thebook is filled with Michael's revelations about Hannah, the Holocaust and himself. Overallthe novel starts out much stronger than it ends, but the message Shlink sends about theHolocaust is powerful."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a very disturbing book. I am uncomfortable with a 36-year-old woman seducing a 15-year-old boy, and not being charged with some crime. I don't like the tone of their relationship, it wasn't loving, and it was more a case of Hanna controlling Michael. The way it tried to excuse, or at the very least minimize Hanna's guilt. You have a pedophile that was also a cold-blooded Nazi war criminal. That's not a love story. It's very disturbing just how many readers thought it was a 'wonderful' love story and seemed unmoved by her manipulation of a teenage boy. The Holocaust was one of the most horrific times in world history. Germany has to live with what they did. I think this is a case of trying to deal with the guilt that the German people still carry."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was captivated from the start. The reference to the Post War German guilt and the secret of Hanna which I expect most readers to figure out early in the novel, did not detract from the beautiful interaction between the characters. The love cementing them for the rest of their lives unbiased by age, or time. Perhaps an additional lesson may be learnt, Don't hold on to the past, the enjoyment of the present may pass you by."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a read that requires work, but the gems mined from its weaving of words makes it a worthwhile labour. Dealing with a post-WWII era, this is a unique expose on the lives of the German population in general, and the shame and dishonour they had blanket them in those times.It is also a rich, deep, journey into the shame of one woman, who would rather bear judgement for war crimes than have her lifelong shame revealed. Compelling and provoking."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; was a book that was very difficult to read and more difficult to put down. It was over-whelming to read again of the atrocities that were allowed to occur in Germany during the war, but also it opened up my mind to know those atrocities did happen over and over without people doing anything to stop them. It made me question myself and what I would have done had I lived in that era? I was surprised at the ending, but now feel, it couldn't have ended any other way. I was &quot;in that era&quot; for a very long time after reading the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The novel The Reader was a very thought and emotional provoking book. The author does a great job showing the growth in the characters as well as their relationship. The historical context of the novel, displays the serious nature of not only the crimes committed but also of the bond between the Woman and the Man and also the problems of each person. The story shows the influence one person can have over another's life. Over all the book is very simple yet very refreshing as it is a love story and a triumph over problems. I would recommend the book to any persons wanting a very simple yet thought and emotion provoking story. The novel offers a interest which makes it difficult to put the book down because of the uncertainty of what is coming. I think that the story is definately worthy of 4 stars maybe even 5."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is NOT about understanding the &quot;weaknesses&quot; of our parents; of the previous generation. Committing atrocities is not a &quot;weakness&quot; and any attempt to trivilize what happened in the camps is deplorable. What kind of person can truly love a person who stands by while innocent people burn to death?That said, the book is well-written. It describes somewhat the feeling of &quot;falling in love&quot;, with a face, a motion, a movement - but not really a whole person. Young Michael Berg never falls in love with her mind. Understanding and empathy is a necessary prerequisite for complete loving.What many people have against this book is the idea that seems to come across - if one is ignorant, one is capable of atrocities. This is not borne out by history, however, as the Germans of Nazi Germany where highly literate and sophisticated and committed unspeakable acts. When the former camp guard is capable of reading she becomes capable of introspection. What hogwash. There are many people with oral history instead of written history who are very capable of moral behavior and introspection.The real question here is, &quot;What is the author trying to prove?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As you read through the reviews of this book, you will find that they are less consistent than reviews of most books. So many people could not relate to the characters at all, yet so many were profoundly moved. While I read this book, I was, (like many others who have written reviews here,) amazed, shocked, and intrigued to find myself trying to &quot;forgive the unforgivable&quot; and sympathize with the incomprehendible. How amazing and shocking for most of us to be on the other side of a Holocaust survival story and try to resolve loving a perpetrator of autrocities. It is the fact that the author puts us in this, never-before-imagined position that gives this book power and identity, and makes it ultimately a literary achievement. After putting the book down though, I thought about the other comments you will find in the reviews, and I thought about the five years I spent living and working in Germany. TO quote from another review, &quot;Most German books never make it &lt;to the best seller list&gt; because they are almost all devoid of any emotional colour; austere.&quot; Just as Italians are noted for being gregarious the German national character is described as lacking empathy, compassion and void of deep emotion. As the author tries to go international with a novel that will move us to sympathize with the German plight, and paint a different picture of the German character, he falls victim to the same lack of depth that has forever plagued the international perception of Germany. ALTHOUGH his character struggles with trying to emapathize and trying to understand. He does so at a distance. Guarded, safe, without heart. He gives the least of himself as he can. Never giving to the point of risking himself... the very same crime that Hannah is guilty of. Compassion without cost.( ) The author seems to be struggling with whether or not he did enough, did he betray her - yes he did, as surely as she betrayed the Jewish women she befriended. They both befriended to the level of their own convenience, so we, loyal, sappy, emotional Americans, are left cold"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is clearly not for the average reader, as it evokes a time that unfortunately few understand. A beautifully written account, although troubling."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael Berg, a young student, falls sick on his way home from school and is assisted by Hanna Schmitz, a woman old enough to be his mother. Almost immediately, he is captivated by her beauty, grace, and seductiveness. Before long, they become lovers and spend each day together. Their days are spent in a comfortable ritual of Michael reading aloud to Hanna, showering with her, making love to her, and lying by her side afterwards. For a while, Michael's life is blissful, but eventually, he sees a fury in Hanna he never has before. Then, Hanna disappears. Michael believes this to be due to his betrayal. Years later, Michael sees Hanna again and realizes she is on trial for a gruesome crime. As he watches the trial take place, Michael realizes Hanna is hiding a bigger secret than anybody could have guessed.Though this novel challenges the known ideas of the Holocaust, it forces us to see the other side of the spectrum. The novel is shaped to prove that there are shades of grey to every situation and a person can't be judged, sentenced, and written off as easily as we believe. Throughout the novel, there are undercurrents of collective guilt and shame that the protagonist, Michael, is battling with. He feels an incessant need to condemn his parents for their turning a blind eye to the perpetrators in their midst. However, later on, it is obvious that Michael does not fully belong to the second generation since he is unable to condemn Hanna. He is still searching for answers through his numbness at what he has realized about her.At the heart of this novel is the love that Michael feels for Hanna. Even though their relationship changes in many ways by the end of the novel, it is this alteration that shapes Michael. He is completely changed by the guilt that both Hanna and the first generation have left him with. Schlink manages to create a book that is gripping and leaves us with an unnerving look into the depths of Germany's history."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Naturally I wouldn't critizice the quallity of the novel itself, as the film, it's a masterpiece, though I was hoping to have a fine printed version of the book and not this very ordinary booklet with the cheapest paper and print quallity you could ever find. A total disapointment on that sense. Not recomended for collectors."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I think something was lost in translation. There's an excellent story buried between two covers, it's simply one-dimensional, lacking humanity, feeling, hollow? I really don't know what was wrong with it. I do know I felt like a doctor was describing the symptoms of the characters. A bit sterile for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I felt no real connection to the characters. I kept thinking that something got lost in translation when they made the book into English language.

This book was so good, it was difficult to put down. I finished it in two days, even woke up earlier than my daughters in order to continue my reading. I love the way the author presents his story, never attempting to explain Hannah's actions or lack there of. Instead he invites the audience to experience the rollercoaster of feelings and emotions Hannah put Micheal through. A love story as painful as love can be."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernard Schlink makes intricate, personal observations that will take your breath away. Although this book could be consumed in six hours, I stretched it over two days because I wanted to savor the experience. It was thrilling to absorb such profound meaning from so few written words. I love this author and am eager to read all of his other books."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Well-written (or well-translated) story of a young boy whose passionate teenaged affair with an older woman turns into an experience that shapes and defines his life. Ultimately the novel becomes an examination of human behavior and motivations. As the truth of his lover's past unfurls, a non-judgemental narrator grasps for understanding & later finds a way to reconnect. Poignant, sad, thought-provoking & passionate. Definitely a novel worth reading (a fast read too)."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was able to get into the first couple chapters but after that I thought the book was very boring.

I have no idea how this book made the Oprah list, because every book I have read from the book club has been great."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Reviews summarizing The Reader made it sound like a good book, but I had to stop less than half way through because it was so uninteresting. Nothing in the development of the characters made me want to find out anything more about them. The &quot;story&quot; has great potential but needs a writer who can make it happen. Another &quot;best seller&quot; that isn't any good."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book started out with such potential with the backdrop of the holocaust behind an adolescent's first love/sexual experience. However, the character's were unsympathetic, bland and vanilla. This was especially discouraging since the book was about sexual passion and the most emotionally laden period of our history, the holocaust. Neither Hannah nor Michael were characters I wanted to know better which made for a very disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"At first I thought it's going to be a good story but I really got tired of it after a while. I wonder why this book is on the top of the best-seller chart. I really thought it was a waste of my time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"GAWD WHAT A SLEEPER!! I found myself scanning through in the middle of the book just to get to the end! And why the heck didn't he say anything about her being illiterate!!?? Uh...i don't get it..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After hearing raves about this book, I read it in an afternoon. I just didn't get it. The relationship between Michael and Hannah didn't ring true; therefore, his lifelong obsession with her made no sense to me. Michael should have used Hannah's money to put himself in psychological counseling."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I began reading this book in a kindof &quot;captive audience&quot; situation in which I had nothing else to do for a stretch of time. After an hour, I had already finished a 1/3 of the book. Now, I can't seem to force myself to pick it up again. The writing (perhaps due to the translation) is overly simple. And I don't mean &quot;simple&quot; in a poetic way. I mean &quot;simple&quot; in a childish way.The premise itself sounds very promising, but I can't get past the writing style. Thinking it might be me, I gave the book to a friend, who also passed it back to me -- not caring if he finished it -- after getting only 1/3 of the way through."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was a horrible book. It was just this side of pornographic, and kept going on and on about their sexual encounters. Hanna was an interesting character though I thought she was quite undeveloped in character. I'm surprised at Oprah's selection this time. A lot of her other recommendations have been very good. I hope she does better next time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Okay, maybe picking this up after reading The Testament and The Client was a bad idea, but this book isn't something I'd recommend to my best friend, or a stranger, for that matter.First of all, it started out very very slow. There wasn't any human dialogue until the second or third chapter.The book is divided into two or three parts. I didn't get past the second part, so I'm not sure. The first part is an intriguing read, I must admit. Maybe the idea of a 15 year having an affair with an older woman drew me into it. But in the second part, when the trial begins, it is boring. The only setting is the courtroom and it gets really slow. I couldn't stick with it, so I put it down, permanently, and picked up The Street Lawyer, which is pure poetry compared to this book.Give it a chance, but only if there's nothing else to read!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Boring! I am an avid reader who has read--and enjoyed--nearly every Oprah pick. However, I can't understand how this book was chosen. The first half of the book trudged along, while the second half was completely unbelievable. When I finally realized that Hannah's true &quot;secret&quot; was that she couldn't read, I thought, &quot;So What?&quot; I think the main problem was that the characters were so two-dimensional that it was difficult to care about their dilemmas. I actually had 20 pages to go, and I never did finish reading this. The moral of the story: Don't assume an Oprah book is a great book--she makes mistakes too!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked up this book from the buzz I had been hearing in regards to the film adaptation. The book follows the story of Michael Berg's life at the start of a summer affair with a woman, Hanna, who helped Berg when he fell ill one day. One day Hanna disappears and Michael is left dumbfounded until, years later, as a law student, he sees that she is on trial, accused of Nazi war crimes. While trying to wrap his fingers around his conflicted emotions and memories of Hanna, a secret regarding Hanna is revealed which may have served behind Hanna's actions and behavior. The book also ties in the generation of Germans, post WW2, and the idea of guilt being transferred down from a generation that was taught to look the other way to another that didn't really know how to feel in regards to it all. Does one constantly acknowledge the atrocities and atone for them, or does one try to move on relying on the mantra that the dead are dead?I found the writing to be sparse and cold, but it only added into the characterization and I found it was easier to get wrapped up in the story that way. I felt that Schlink's writing is good in that he wants one to not feel sympathy for Hanna, but I felt that as Hanna's secret was being pulled apart, layer by layer, one can't help but wonder if Hanna did what she did because she truly felt she never had a better choice. (This also ties into the idea of ordinary Germans who were willing to participate in Nazi atrocities under the excuse of creating a better nation/providing for a family/etc. etc.)The book was an easy and quick read, and while I a bit put off by the fact that Hanna technically committed statutory rape with Michael, it was compelling enough for me to brush it aside. In conclusion, I do recommend The Reader for anyone looking for a good read that deals with the nature of guilt, love, and the debate over whether what's in the past truly does remain there."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I agree with all the praise lavished on this novel. I, too, cannot stop thinking about it. It haunts, it probes, it wounds its readers. There is no recovery, no easy redemption from the questions this novel asks. It is Kafka's ax to the frozen sea within us. Still and all, it feels disturbingly incomplete. As other readers have already asked, why doesn't he visit her in prison? Why can't he break through his own cold impersonality? He doesn't even seem to make the effort, as if it isn't worthwhile. My other, and most important question, is why did Hannah did what she did in the camp and in the burning church? What are her motives? What's in her soul?A foot-note: I am glad I read the book before I read the reviews because so many of them are spoilers. Why do reviewers feel compelled to summarize the plot? There is no need, really.S. Spilka"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one of the shortest, easiest reads I have ever encountered, yet it manages in those few short pages to wretch from your soul some of the heaviest emotions imaginable. \`The Reader' is one of those novels that moves you, and one that never leaves.The story follows young Michael Berg as he starts an illicit affair with an older woman at the ripe old age of fifteen. Hanna is different from anyone he has ever known. She is beautiful and illusive and guarded, but all of these facets of her make her all the more intriguing to Michael. Hanna is drawn to Michael and it becomes apparent that she needs him almost as much as he believes he needs her. They know very little about one another but the love between them continues to grow stronger as they bond over passion, both for each other and for the printed page.Then one day Hanna is gone, and Michael fears he will never see her again.A few years later though, Michael does see Hanna again, but the circumstances surrounding their reunion are less than desirable. Soon Michael is faced with a new perception of his one-time lover and as the years pass his feelings for her and his feelings towards his own actions begin to twist and turn and infect his very being.The one thing that touches me so deeply about \`The Reader' is the way the novel slowly unravels and creeps up on you until you're crying uncontrollably and you aren't really aware why until moments later. Yes, there is a subtle calm surrounding the words recorded in Bernhard Schlick's tragic tale of love and loss and that calm makes for one of the most devastating yet honest reads I have experienced in a long time.The novel raises questions of guilt and consequence, of forgiveness and understanding, of loneliness and desperation. \`The Reader' brilliantly weaves a breathtaking web of circumstance that permeates each and every page, each and ever word, and takes the reader to a whole new level of emotional understanding. As the final moments are revealed to the reader and he is faced with the same feelings that Michael is battling we are forced to try and comprehend what he must be feeling, and we thus find ourselves ravaged of our emotions as we lay bare and broken on the floor. \`The Reader' brought me to tears as I connected Michael and Hanna's story to one of my own and I saw how my actions may have inadvertently caused harm to someone I genuinely care about.That is the last thing that ran through my mind as I closed the novel, and it is the first thing I ponder whenever this novel comes up among friends. \`The Reader' causes us to take a step back and weight out our actions and our interactions with others because everything we do has an effect, positive or negative, on the ones we love."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Although highly recommended it took me a while to finally read this book. The story seemed too hard to me, but anyway I read it.It is a very compelling book . The style is clean and direct without, apparently, any concesion to warmth. But at the end just as Hanna accepts her culpability the reader understands the feelings hidden in the remembrances of Michael.Hanna as a character is not specially sympathetic but the diference is that we can see her as a a human being while for her the prisioners were nothing. Maybe the book is so attractive because we can develope that humanity to someone who did inhuman things."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After reading the Los Angeles Times' cover note that The Reader is a \\"disturbing and finally morally devastating novel,\\" I postponed reading it till I thought I could handle 'moral devastation.' I have to say that was quite an overstatement, in my opinion: part of the self-righteousness that appears in the trial in the latter half of the book.Bernard Schlink created a delightful afternoon read that included erotic interludes reminiscent ofThe Graduate (1967 Film), intellectual and moral arguments and a decision on the best way to honor someone you love in difficult circumstances.A bit of an insider's view (Nazi's) of the holocaust toys with conventional horror at what was perpetrated. Were guards in fear for their lives if they did not cooperate fully?Far from theoretical analysis, Schlink forces us to new analyses by asking, \\"What is law? Is it what is on the books, or what is actually enacted and obeyed in a society? Or is law what must be enacted and obeyed, whether or not it is on the books, if things are to go right?\\"Showing a keen understanding of humanity, Schlink writes, \\"Even when the facts took our breath away, we held them up triumphantly. Look at this!\\" (That could account for part of the passion surroundingSchindler's List (Widescreen Edition).)Are we all doomed to punish ourselves if society doesn't punish us enough? Or to punish ourselves for the crimes society does not even hold against us?If you want a fun book, this will do it. If you want a book that will haunt you for months or even years, this will do it. If you want a book with characters and actions about which you can argue and philosophize way into the night, this one will do that, too!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Reading out loud is a very important experience for the title character in Bernhard Schlink's novel \\"The Reader\\", a man named Michael Berg. The first time he does so is when he reads \\"The Odyssey\\" for Hanna, a 36 year-old woman to whom he became a lover when he was 15. But those were hard times, and he took young to assume this affair, and the couple falls apart when she vanishes for no apparent reason.Michael will find Hanna again years later, but them both are different people. He is a law student following a process of war crimes, and she is accused of being responsible for the death of many prisoners when she was a guard in a concentration camp. He is astonished to learn that the woman he once loved was capable of such atrocity. She, on the other hand, doesn't seem care to be taken as a scapegoat so that the other guards can be found innocent.\\"The Readers\\" is a novel written with urgency and passion - two features that don't seem to come along very easily. But Schlink can combine them both easily when he creates very believable characters. The passion between Hanna and Michael is at the same time touching and endearing. He is just a teenager having his personal sexual awakening, while she is a mature woman seeking for comfort.Michael is a son of the generation who was too young to know which side their parents took during the War. This gap between child and father arises at some point in \\"The Reader\\". This is only one of the points that Schlink brings up in his book.The writer's style is reminiscent of 19th century post-romantic with a fairy tale spin - except for the happily ever after. His novel seeks a dialogue between past and present without being revisionist. It is above all honest when dealing with Germany's most painful scar.In his life, Michael will become a reader one more time. And this is a very beautiful event to the narrative that ties two loose ends and closes the circle of his story with Hanna."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"(This review is based on the German original, \\"Der Vorleser\\").One thing is amazing when it comes to this book. The German paperback edition lists some 350 customer reviews, an American one, on the other hand, has more than twice as many (20% of what the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" collected). Many of them are short and somehow superficial, being concerned mainly with the perhaps tingling relationship between an older woman (a former guard in a concentration camp to boot) and a young man and appear never to have fathomed the deeper, hidden layers of the story.Schlink does not make life easy for his readers, perhaps because in his everyday life he is a lawyer qualified to plead before the German Constitutional Court and is thus accustomed to getting his point across in a complicated way; his narrative is far from straightforward and the questions he asks are often obscure. He is very much concerned with the evolution of his characters over their lifetimes, but at a more fundamental level of this book he wants to plumb what they know, believe they know or can possibly know about the world around them.To make his argument more extreme, he centers his story on an illiterate woman who, early on, realizes that she has only a restricted, personal view of the world, but still has to act out her life in accordance with the situations she finds herself in and which are far from being entirely of her own choosing. Her decisions are not always morally acceptable to outsiders or to judgments ex-post, but in this predicament she is very much like everyone of us.What we know about the world at any moment is fragmentary, tainted, partisan and often, in hindsight, turns out to have been deliberately distorted. Depending on our personal intelligence, on the trust we place in certain people, and on our individual upbringing we choose the direction in which to stumble along, knowing that we advance in a fog and will never really know where we are nor where we are heading.We try to find guideposts along the way and attempt to distinguish Good from Evil, but as Sartre tells us in his play \\"The Devil and the Good Lord\\", even those landmarks are unreliable in the long run. Schlink's tale aptly illustrates this."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"An extraordinary story I couldn't put down. Schlink offers a view that is searing, original and unique. Granting the reader a vantage point that is unexpected and spellbinding."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is a book to savor. Expertly written, this book pulls you in with moments of bliss and wonder as our protagonist's quiet life suddenly explodes with passion and yearning. The novel then shifts from the physical to the philosophical, as Michael encounters the uncertainties behind the ecstasy. We hear all this from the perspective of a grown man, carefully considering a lifetime of choices.As he unravels and examines his life, Michael confronts questions that are universal in scope. In relationships, in life, we are all faced with choices and our choices have consequences. Wrestling with one's own choices is necessarily a lifetime endeavor, but in \\"The Reader\\" it is evident how choices we made long ago can stay with us.We also find ourselves in situations that require us to judge the choices of others. This moral dilemna, constructing a reliable platform within our own ambiguous morality from which we can evaluate others, is wonderfully explored in this book.I found Michael's voice and character to be quite likeable and sympathetic; in his unassuming way, he is sweet and charming. Fate pairs him up with Hanna, a mysterious older woman, and he tumbles into love.Years later, still uneasy about questions of his own guilt in betraying Hanna, Michael unexpectedly finds himself in a courtroom where Hanna's larger actions as an SS guard are being judged.As her former lover, Michael is in an unusal position. Michael struggles to match the Hanna who called him \\"Kid\\" with the camp guard guilty of such unpardonable crimes. The time he spent reading to Hanna provides the prism through which he views her now. Remembering how this time they shared was a warm and intimate part of their trysts, and hearing that Hanna selected certain prisoners to read to her within the walls of the camp, Michael chooses to believe that his former lover's actions were not unkind.In a stark and dramatic scene, Michael encounters an older man who suggests that it was possible to kill the Jews because the Germans involved were indifferent. Michael is appalled by this idea, and despite her guilty verdict Michael can't be indifferent to Hanna. His care and concern for her continue throughout his life; he resumes the role of her reader.We never know exactly what Hanna is thinking, but her final actions are arresting. Inspired by Michael's recorded books, enough to become a reader herself, she nonetheless loses faith in herself when Michael fails to address her in his own words. Michael realizes only too late that Hanna felt the sting of his inability to forgive her.All in all, a very thoughtful and complicated novel wrapped in a concise and rewarding package. Setting \\"The Reader\\" against the Holocaust may be upsetting to some people, but it does indeed serve as a larger mirror against which our protagonist can measure his own worth."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As I was reading, The Reader, it kept me interested in Michael Berg's World. I did not want to put the book down until I knew the outcome of the relationship and that is what a book should do. It should make you forget about the world that you are in and make you feel like you are in the world of the character and that is exactly what Bernhard Schlink did. He used powerful language and imagery that made the book very interesting to read. As he described all the steps of the relationship it brings you into the book. Michael meets a woman who is twice his age when she is helping him when he is vomiting on the side of the road due to Hepatitis B. As he went back to her later to say &quot;thank you&quot; he never expected to be caught in such a mysterious relationship. As they talk little and have no real conversation you can feel the dryness of their relationship. As she leaves you can see the dramatic irony that is displayed. As he later meets her in a courtroom, after being a lawyer, you can feel the intensity between them. Bernhard Schlink has clearly written a book that can be shown as an example of what books should be."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book twice which is very unusual for me. Excellent writing...I really enjoyed it. I am glad the writer got the chance to have a movie made...His story deserves a wider audience."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"At first, I thought this would only be a book about an affair between an older woman and a boy, and its sure complications. I was wrong. The author brought us into his own life as a young German during post WWII, but I'm not so sure I wanted to go there. The issues of illicit love had sufficient complexities to explore, in my opinion. But, when the main character's thoughts shifted to explore implications of morality concerning the actions of WWII parents, and the questions, doubt, and guilty rejection of their children, I found myself wishing it hadn't happened. That particular issue of thought deserved more than to be side-swiped during the movement of the love story from beginning to end.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the story in its crafty portrayal of a budding young male child, clumsily struggling to manage passion and maturation while amorally exploring a most immoral and illegal relationship. I also enjoyed hanging off the edge throughout the book with Hanna's dark and tormented mind.One more thing... the educator that I am was captivated by the twist. That illiteracy could have such a phenomenal impact in life decisions was of far more value to me, in this read, than the attention-deserving but ill-placed exploration of the relationships of parents and children of post WWII."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story of The Reader is fascinating. A 15 year old boy has an affair (or, is he taken advantage of?) with an older woman. Years later, the same woman is on trial as a Nazi prison guard.The best part of The Reader is the passion the narrator retains for the woman. Later, his passion turns to empathy. I know it sounds weird to say, but this book helped me understand how people could have perpetrated such horrible war crimes in Nazi Germany. The Reader explains the role that ignorance can play in cruelty.The prose of Schlink is beautiful and sensual, even in translation. Like all good books, The Reader will stick in your psyche long after you have finished reading it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There are few occasions where the movie is just as good as the book. This is one of those cases. I read the book looking for a deeper understanding of the characters, especially Hanna. The book left me knowing there was so much more to her, just like when I watched movie. The author is descriptive but doesn't go into great detail about anything, which I think is good. Too much detail leaves me bored. The book flowed smoothly and was an easy read. I finished it in 2 days. But you can either watch the two and half hour movie or read the 218 page book, either which one you choose, you've done the other one as well."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"...I would just have loved to know more about Hannah's background, her family, how she grew up. But, maybe that was intentional on the author's part, for Hannah to remain a mystery. Recommended read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In 1958, Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German boy had a passionate affair with Hanna Schmitz, a thirty-six year old German woman. The affair that lasted for certain duration had a certain routine. During their meetings, Michael read books to Hanna, showering with her, making love to her, and lying next to her for a while afterwards. A physical relationship between a young boy and a woman twice his age does occur sometimes. Nowadays, it is tolerable if the relationship had been mutually consented.One day, Michael came to visit but he found out that Hanna had moved out; she disappeared. Later on Hanna was arrested and brought to trial for her activities as a guard in Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps, where gassing and burning Jews and some others were everyday occurrences. Michael was present at the court room every single day of the trial and the day when Hanna was sentenced to life. After several appeals for leniency, her life sentence was reduced to eighteen years. Before her scheduled release, Hanna had hanged herself at daybreak.Michael had been disturbed that Hanna had not revealed to him her involvement in atrocities committed during the Holocaust. The author Bernhard Schlink does not reveal which episodes are factual and which are not. By his own admission, he had forgotten many episodes at the time of writing this novel. Ergo, THE READER could not have been classified as a memoir. In either case, I am wondering how sincere Michael was in stating:\\"I was guilty for having loved her, a criminal... I was in a rage at her and what she had done to me (p. 216).\\" Was he really disturbed by the fact that Hanna, like many thousands of Nazi criminals, managed to avoid for so long a court of justice? Hanna was comparatively a minor criminal. Thirty thousand Nazi war criminals got away with murder. Josef Mengele, Adolf Eichmann, Franz Stangl, Martin Bormann, and so many other murderers succeeded to have many years of a pleasant life after the war. They settled in a hospitable Argentina, Peru and other South American countries. Egypt, Syria, Italy, Spain and even the Vatican were accommodating fugitive Nazi war criminals and their collaborators. To me, the following quote from page 169 is most compelling:\\"How could those who had committed Nazi crimes or watched them happen or looked away while they were happening or tolerated the criminals among them after 1945 or even accepted them - how could they have anything to say to their children?\\" I have been asking repeatedly the same question since my liberation from Nazi concentration camp.I am puzzled, how could Hanna function being illiterate! She grew up in a German community in Romania, and then came to Berlin at the age of sixteen. She took a job at the Siemens factory. How could she fill out an Employment Application Form? Then she ended up in the army at twenty one. Being illiterate, how could she become familiar with the military ordinances and manuals? Also, it is baffling to me that Hanna would rather let herself be unjustly sentenced rather than simply admit that she could neither read nor write. Schlink didn't dive into much detail as he should have. Still, THE READER makes the reader think and reflect. It provokes questions about WWII and its aftermath; about guilt, morality, illiteracy, love and forgiveness. It is very well written and the characters are very well portrayed.I was disheartened to notice that during the trial Hanna expressed no remorse for being a Nazi collaborator in concentration camps. Hanna learned to read and write in prison. It was refreshing to read that that Michael found in Hanna's prison cell books about the Holocaust from Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Tadeusz Borowski, Jean Amery, Hannah Arendt and others'. Perhaps Hanna did reflect and repented."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"'The Reader' is about a teenager who falls in love, and has a sexual relationship with an older woman.

No happy endings here.Although the story is rather simple, it is written as a memoir by the young man, I think the author makes it work by the genuine emotion projected by the two main characters. The two characters aren't very likable but I was very empathetic to their plight. Yet at times I felt the author didn't dive into details as well as he should have; it was if I was reading the Reader's Digest version of a fuller novel.Bottom line: a depressingly realistic story of doomed lives. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel packs a great deal of power into its scant 218 pages. The basis for the film that earned Kate Winslet her well-deserved Oscar, The Reader examines profound questions of love, morality, guilt, forgiveness, social justice, and the power of the past in beautifully written prose that I imagine is only more powerful and beautiful in the original German. The theme of literacy (and lack of it) is also quite prominent in the novel. Schlink manages to achieve an almost impossible task in The Reader, as he creates a sympathetic character out of a former Nazi--and that's only one of the many complications this novel depicts with such skill and artistry. He bravely tackles this problem, as well as the sexual relationship between the then 15 year-old narrator and the adult Hanna. I plan to pick up another one of his novels, Homecoming, in the hope that it's as good as The Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink is amazingly efficient in his writing of this novel. It's a quick and relatively simple read, but he has not cheated the reader from a complex and courageous story that really, really makes the reader think and reflect. What exactly the reader might reflect on depends largely on the reader's personal life experiences. Schlink develops the relationship between the two protagonists, Michael and Hanna, in the first section as an intensely physical relationship between an adolescent boy and a woman twice his age - undoubtedly a fantasy come true for the young man. But as life would have it, circumstances bring that episode to an end, but not the relationship, which lasts a lifetime - albeit a lifetime of questioning and some frustrations for Michael, given his inability to separate from his young Love or the endless memories forged by his young experiences into his mind. While the story is uniquely German in that it draws on circumstances some \\"regular\\" Germans were put in during and after World War II, the underlying themes of the story are universal - just about anyone can ponder them in their own lives. Schlink, through Michael, poses many, many rhetorical questions to the reader. And though there are many, they never become a hurdle to the fluidity of the story, but serve to continually draw the reader in by engaging the reader's emotion and, at least for me, reminders of experiences of a personal past. The reader who simply chooses to read this story for the story itself will not be disappointed; the reader who chooses to open themselves to the content between the lines will be changed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"So, I had heard from a friend that she hated this movie and complained about how she could feel no compassion for the characters while watching the movie. I am pleased to say that the book is an entirely different experience. It is well written and the inner struggle to deal with the issues is palpable, but I can see why that would not translate to the screen. A quick, excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader provides complicated issues for today's generation to think about. After World War II, many people stopped caring about what happened in the past because many people of today maintain affluent, happy lives, and the issue of Nazis is nothing more than the past history. This book talks about the gap between generations and what we must do with the knowlege of history. Also, I had to feel bad for Hanna who could never lead a happy life as a woman. She became a victum of her generation, and I can understand why her will chooses death. The Reader is absolutely wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a novel which hooks the reader from the start. The plot ranges from love scenes between two very unlikely lovers, to their relationship that grows out of the initial lust. However the reader is quickly able to see just how much of an impact they had on each other when they are separated and meet again in the most unlikely place imaginable. The Reader combines great voice, diction, and imagery to create a story that is not only interesting but also greatly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Mr. Schlink has done well with this creation. He has made a piece of interesting fiction that can be read and understood by most readers. Although &quot;The Reader&quot; is not a simple story of a reader and his illiterate listener. As any reader begins this novel they are immediately swept up into the action. Schlink grabs ahold of the reader firmly and guarantees their continued interest with a story of a passionate relationship. Ironically, the author tries to gain our interest by our emotional involvement in a relationship, which itself, is lacking much emotion. As we approach the climax, Schlink suddenly changes the entire mood and pattern of events. What started out as a simple story of eroticism, soon develops into a thought provoking novel of one man's struggles. He struggles with society, political issues, and moral decisions as his life withers away. More irony appears as we see all his troubles center around the one thing that once made him happy. His first joy, his only love, and his biggest worry consume his entire life. He doesn't want to be with it, but can't live without it. Schlink leaves the reader thinking through and after the last page. What would this man's life be if his love, his obsession, were to die?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a well-written, simple and easy to follow read. Through the first person narrator, Michael, the reader travels through post-World War II Germany to give us insight into the decisions, thoughts, behaviors, and the way moral values can be challenged in life. We journey through three phases in Michael's life. In many ways each of us can find a little Michael in ourselves. He is at first vulnerable and dependent. Then he is growing and learning by trial and error to formulate his own identity. In the third and final phase Michael is grown man, with ideas, morals, feelings, and beliefs of his own. The Reader will force the audience to determine right from wrong and bring back a painful time in history. Michael gives us a glimpse into how a fifteen year old boy still longs for adult attention. His relationship with a thirty-six year old woman may be viewed as a warning to adults that they have a responsibility to protect the young and not trespass or allow anyone else to trespass on their weaknesses and innocence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When I began reading this book I wondered why I was reading it and why was it so highly recommended. The early parts details quite explicitly the love relationship between a young man (Michael) and an older woman (Hanna). I thought this part was tedious but the rest of the book was based on this short love affair and it was necessary to understand this woman and how her life changed the course of the young man's life. This affair affected everything and every part of his life. It also affected me as I'm still thinking about the story line several weeks after its conclusion. The philosophical bent was interesting -- pondering one's and others' weaknesses and where this might lead you in life because of such weakness. I also thought the translation was wonderfully well written."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was interested in this book from cover to cover and I thought the way that the characters evolved was extrememly interesting and well written. I would definitely recommend this book to others. THe ending is GREAT!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Janeway did a superb job in the translation of this book. While reading it, I often wondered if her phrasing might be even more eloquent than the German version, though I will never know first hand. I disagree with the review that it is difficult to connect with Schlink's characters. I felt sympathetic toward Michael and curious about the distant Hanna which is, I would guess, what the author intends. The blend of the timeless and secretive affair and the historical events of the Holocaust was one I had never read about, but presented an interesting vantage point of a subject with which most of us are familiar."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Books takes me weeks, regardless of their length. This one captured a single weekend. I kept coming back to it as family life swirled about me. I suppose there was a sexual undertone, but nothing of their intimacies did much to invite or excite. The real message was larger than love found and lost. I think it was about the ultimate act of love - forgiveness. This story is a trumpet sounding to anyone who continues to suffer the abominations of the Third Reich. The abuse will continue as long as the abused carry their baggage and proclaim &quot;We will never forget!&quot; This author told a story about love sneaked, love lost, then love found ugly due to circumstances of war. That's a love story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I've tried to find gracious ways in which to describe this book but the truth of the matter, for me, is that this was simply an o.k. read. Although the subject matter is of interest the writing failed to connect me to the experiences of the characters in any memorable way. I'm certain that this would have been a much better literary experience if I could read German and experience the book in its native language. Throughout the entire novel, I kept feeling that there was significant meaning lost in the translation to English. While in San Francisco, I met a couple who simply loved the book. In my brief conversation with them, they confirmed that most people with whom they've spoken with about the book either loved it or hated it. I'm somewhere in between. The Reader is an easy enough read but not very engaging. I highly recommend the book to high school children who are starting to learn about the Holocaust (and no, I don't think the relationship between Hanna and Michael was child abuse). For adults who are looking for a more intellectually stimulating read on the subject matter I strongly recommend Ursula Hegi's Stones From The River."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I liked the clean/spare writing style, the briefness of the book particularly juxtaposed with the moral dilemmas Schlink is trying to address- they could clearly fill tomes.Ultimately it is too spare. Who is Hannah? An abused child? A sadist? A woman of limited intelligence? A borderline personality? I never understood her choices.Any real insight into them was lost for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael is 15 when he becomes transfixed by an older woman, a much older woman, Hanna. (Please keep in mind that I found the point of this book more interesting than the book itself.) After they meet, Michael enjoys in sex and bathing, while Hanna finds comfort in his way of reading to her. (I cannot get passed an older woman having sex with a 15 year old, but I guess something may have been lost in the German to English translation.) Months of the sex, baths, and reading go by and Hanna disappears. Michael is devistated in different ways. Then he sees Hanna, years later, while attending a trial where Hanna is among many defendants. The trial is to conclude who is guilty of taking part in the illegal acts that took place in Nazi Germany. One thing leads to another and Michael finds out one important characteristic in Hanna that could keep her from imprisonment... I normally enjoy any and every book in some optimistic way, but until I got through this particular one I almost lost faith. Overall, this is not one I would recommend to just anyone. Try something else, you may thank me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink has attempted to lead himself, his fellow German generation and all his readers towards some kind of understanding of his nations past, the Holocaust and essentially incomprehensible questions. How can one generation love and judge its parents, whether as the offspring of Nazis or non-German racists? I think the large number of negative responses to the work expressed by the reviews above actually reveal the success of the author rather than failure. Schlink has disturbed his &quot;readers&quot; into thinking and responding.Like all provocative writing this work contains layers of perception and interpretation that depend upon the imaginative perseverance and open mindedness of the reader.Schlink asks paradoxical seemingly senseless yet nontheless real questions. Can we love what or who we hate ?,can we forgive what or who we hate?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Der Roman &quot;der Vorleser &quot; von Bernhard Schlink ist einfach Super! I absolutely loved Schlink's novel &quot;The Reader&quot;... I had picked up the German Edition of this novel in Germany this summer, and finally got around to reading it. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours. I haven't read the English translation, so I cannot judge the version that others have written reviews about on this site, but the German novel is the best thing I have read since Patrick Suskind's &quot;The Perfume&quot; a few years ago. It is extremely thought provoking and makes one seriously think about love, relationships, guilt, responsibility,shame etc."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I do not regularly get Oprah book club books - not to sound snotty, but what appeals to the masses in the literary sense does not usually speak to me. However, encouraged by my enuthusiasm for Wally Lamb and Jane Hamilton, I read on. Ugh. First the Pilot's Wife (atrocious) and then this? Oprah, come on. Character driven books with no plot I can deal with. Plot driven books with no character are harder to deal with but still carry SOME redeeming value. Books which meander and look deep within them for some sort of introspection which does not exist and then ultimately do not lead you anywhere (and don't even throw you the bone of having brilliant, delicate or delicious passages to revel in) is out of the question. Certainly not as contrived as the Pilot's Wife - and since it only takes about 2 hours to read, not as big a waste of time - but certainly not worthy of effusive praise, either."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The novel &quot;The Reader&quot; by Bernhard Schlink always seemed to have a mysterious, unanswered side to every page, drawing you deeper into the plot. The novel is a pure example that love is unpredictable, enduring and unforgettable, yet you may be faced with questions regarding where you should draw the line. It shows that at 15-years old, you may look at a situation in a much different way than you would in your later years of life. You might not always regret your actions, yet if you're lucky, you will have learned a life-long lesson from it and be forever changed because you will carry your experiences with you. After you the reader read the pages of this novel, you will also be changed in some way, for its morality, originality and unpredictable words are unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is truly a book for everyone. Fans of stories like The Triumph and the Glory or The Testament will like this book. People who liked The Poisonwood Bible or Memoirs of a Geisha will like this book. People who liked Stones From the River or The Pilot's Wife will like this book. Readers who enjoy the Oprah books will LOVE this book. It has everything one could ask for.

But I found that I was totally wrong as I was kept reading. This piece of work gave me a whole new perspective to understand the Holocaust during the WW2. I've read and seen so many books and movies about the horrible massacre that I doubted there could be possibly anything new to me. BUT THERE ARE !

The middle didn't keep me very interested"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)(Note: I am re-posting my review of February 2, 2009)\\"The Reader\\" by the German writer Bernhard Schlink is a slim work. In a narrative of a mere 224 pages, thinly cloaked as a love story, the writer takes all Germans--both pre- and post WWII generations--to task for the crimes of the Holocaust.The story begins when a young boy becomes ill on his way home from school. A woman helps him. He's a good boy, from a nice family, living in a nice home. Once recovered, and at his mother's urging, he takes flowers to the woman who helped him when he became ill. Thus begins the May-December romance between 15-year-old Michael Berg and 35-year-old Hanna Schmitz.Let's look back on the day of the rescue, the day Michael vomits at Hanna's doorstep. He is ill, wretched, miserable, and embarrassed. She assesses the situation and takes charge. The assistance she offers is decisive and efficient, accomplished as effortlessly as the \\"Anschluss\\" of Austria. Or, in the author's words, \\"When rescue came it was almost an assault.\\"The young Michael, whom Hanna calls \\"the kid,\\" has never known a woman like her. Hanna is clearly from a different social class than his own family and friends. She is uneducated, works at menial jobs, and lives in a shabby, but clean apartment. Hanna makes no effort to seduce, yet beneath her stern exterior, she is oh so seductive. And like his parents, Hanna is emotionally unavailable. The pleasures she offers come on her own terms. As the relationship unfolds, he is at a loss to explain the times when her cool demeanor gives way to irrational outbursts. Warning signs of a troubled psyche to be sure, but there is no arguing with Hanna's anger; there is only acquiescence. \\"The kid\\"--eyes on the prize--submits.Which young man or--if we accept the metaphor of Michael Berg as a stand-in for the German people--which country in the throes of infatuation heeds such warning signs? Smitten with a Fuehrer who would lead them away from wretchedness, who would turn shame to triumph, the German people submitted as eagerly as young Michael did. Thus, \\"the kid\\" traded away the innocent pleasures of his youth for the guilty secrets of adulthood, as willingly as Hitler's Germans surrendered their innocence for a taste of sin.Then one day it's over. Hanna is gone, and Michael will never again find another woman who is able to take him to such heights of passion or depths of despair. The end of their affair is a shock to him, just as the end of the Nazi regime must have been a shock to the German populace. Abandoned by their Fuhrer, who escaped into death, they're left alone to explain their mad dream of the Third Reich and to face the accusing eyes of the rest of the world.Michael and Hanna meet again when he's a law students sent to observe the trial of Auschwitz prison guards. She is one of them. During the trial, Michael discovers the secret she's kept all her life, a secret she's too ashamed to reveal. This secret will not absolve her from guilt, but decrease her lifetime sentence to a mere few years. Yet she keeps silent, as does he. Whose secret is he protecting? Hanna's or his? Just as his father kept silent about his role during the Nazi regime, Michael, who, by his actions as a boy linked his life to hers, now keeps silent as well.As an adult, Michael Berg comes to exist in a state of emotional suspension. He says, \\"The worst were the dreams in which a hard, imperious, cruel Hanna aroused me sexually; I woke from them full of longing and shame and rage. And full of fear about who I really was.\\" What an awakening it must have been for the German people when the dream was over, the truth revealed.In the end, neither Hanna's imprisonment nor her death, like the death of Adolf Hitler, can atone for the silence of two generations of Germans. I applaud Bernhard Schlink for breaking that silence with his excellent novel, \\"The Reader.\\""},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book absolutely amazing. Written in simple short sentences, but used in so clever way that every sentence is important. Schlink managed to create great atmosphere of Germany after the war. I found Hanna very exciting and erotic. I hoped she would get free despite the fact that I despised all about Nazies. However probably everyone would do the same as she did in the wheels of second world war.Pity that book was short. Anytime I open the book again I must start to read again."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I bought this book on Sunday afternoon and even with two tests this week, I managed to finish it by Thursday night. The style of writing is so seductive and beautiful, it is woven like a spider's web. I thought that his discussion of Hanna and Michael's love in the afternoon was so tragically beautiful, it was something that you know that cannot last but at the same time, you will find yourself savoring the passages when they are together. I think that the way that Michael's father explains this situation is beautiful, but even underneath that, beyond who is responsible for what, there is the beauty of a story of a woman who has allowed her own life to be diminished because of the simple fact that she doesn't want anyone to know that she cannot read. I mean even though she is illiterate she still manages to have a great affection and love for literature. I personally love to be read to, I have lots of books on CD and I usually listen to them at night when I sleep, there is something deeply beautiful about someone reading to you. When my husband reads to me, its is something that is beyond the book, its another form of intimacy. In this book, the intimacy isn't the kind that is found between bodies but there is however something deeply initmate about his reading to Hanna. I loved this book and I am going to see the movie this weekend, which I don't expect it to translate but I am hoping. This book was emotionally and poetically stunning to me, I know why Hanna did what she did, but I don't think it had anything to do with what she was on trial for. I don't mean to belittle the suffering of the Holocaust because that would be so wrong of me, only to say that you have to understand that this is all a sort of backdrop to the story. I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael Berg, 15, falls sick one day on his way home from school. He is helped home by the beautiful Hanna Schmitz, more than twice his age. The two become entangled in a love affair, one that ends abruptly when Hanna moves away. Michael doesn't run into her until years later--when she is on trial for crimes committed during World War II. Hanna puts up almost no defense: she openly admits to what she did. But why? Why does she not try and save herself? Michael is forced to realize that he never really knew the woman he loved...and that, sometimes, loving someone can be an almost criminal act.As a work of fiction, Bernard Schlink's \\"The Reader\\" is hit and miss. It is truly an entertaining, thoughtful narrative, and Schlink's writing (at least as it's translated) is crisp and engaging. However, he often reverts to rhetorical questions the narrator asks of himself (and the reader); Michael also admits, almost every other page, to not remembering certain things. It serves a nice literary purpose, at first; after a while, it simply becomes annoying, and we must wonder why he is bothering to tell the tale at all, if there is so much he doesn't remember.Taken as a more philosophical piece, \\"The Reader\\" shines. It is an in-depth, engaging view of guilt in post-war Germany, of how a generation tried to deny the horrors committed by their parents; and how pride goeth before the fall (as someone once said). \\"The Reader\\" would make fine reading in classes discussing the German conscience after the Nazi regime; it is also a fine work of historical fiction, aiming to analyze and demystify a complicated period of history. \\"The Reader\\" is a thoughtful little novel; flawed, yes, but well worth reading nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A wonderfully told story of the pain of individuals using each other for their own purposes. I enjoyed this book very much and as the author diligently builds upon two people using each other to satisfy their loneliness and then the numbness of the suffering that is created from such a codependent relationship. The unfortunate pain of almost redemption but never resolution at the end of the book left me feeling the way I should feel: a bit saddened for both of the characters.Bernhard Schlink captures you quickly as he progresses through his short novel. I will avoid to much description of the story so as not to take anything away from the power of the book. The main character is Michael Berg and this is his story of obsession with an older woman during World War II; though this provides only a time frame for the book as there is little description of the war itself. The author sums up this book so well when the main character, Michael, says, \\"Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily. Happiness is only real if it lasts forever? Because things always end painfully if they contained pain, conscious or unconscious. all along?\\" The insightful thoughts such as these hold you so tightly to the story as it develops wetting your anticipation with each turn of the page.Yes this book is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I had this book in my shelf for years. Only when I realized it had been made into a movie, did I pull it off to read it. I wanted to have the full details before seeing the film. At any rate, it was a good book. It's short, well-written, and I think, brings up a lot of food for thought. One of my favorite quotes is: The Truth of What One Says, Lies in What One Does.It was actually a sad tale that brought up questions about whether we really know a person. And if we fall in love and discover that the person is not whom we thought, do we continue to love them, or can the horror (if that's the case) of what they've done, erase what one feels?I think the book is good and worth a read. It won't take up too much of your time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I find love relationships like the one described in this book absolutely strange, self-destructive and unromantic. The beginning of the book kinda reminded me of Lolita...with one of the partners twice the age of the other. The one is totally head over heels and the other cold. However, beyond that I found the reason to why she didn't want to fight for justice in the courtroom ridiculous--because she's illiterate? Are you serious? But maybe it was the fact that she was the only one of the defendants who saw her guilt and truly thought that she deserved such a hard sentence. She worked with the SS and I guess any connections with them was seen as unacceptable.What I truly liked, though, was how the author dealt with the fact of how Germans feel about the Holocaust and their involvement. It's been years and some of the next generations think that somehow the guilt passes down to them...even though their parents might not have been supporters of the Nazis. But just by saying or doing nothing, were they also guilty? This is a question I've been thinking about for many years, since I'm from Germany myself. The older generation doesn't like to talk about it...but some of the younger generations now think that they are not responsible for the actions their parents have committed.What is one to think?I like that the author addressed this very sensitive issue and brought it to light on behalf of all Germans."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"At first this was a very hard read, for me, because of the moral issue, and I only mention this because at the very first it might detract some readers. Do not be detracted.To be certain this is a book well worth the effort. The insidiousness of the novel takes hold as a boa constrictor wrapping around the body of the reader. Mr. Schlink has injected a lethal moral venom into the bloodstream that one cannot escape. The moral questions come at you with no time to brace 1) illicit relationship that is certain to be ruinous 2) Love, Shame and ultimate Loss (loss for which neither Hanna nor Michael can fully comprehend in the middle of the story) 3) A horrendous crime forcing the reader to take sides (then a skill set of moral questions thrown at the reader from all sides makes one squirm, 3a) The Holocaust and the moral questions of what to do with the people who took part in the horrendous crimes 3b) a segue into Holocaust territory via a trip to the concentration camp and Michael's own moral struggle to try and see things from Hanna's PV which I believe, he is unable to do, 4) Michael's inner struggle of knowing Hanna's secret and also for having been a victim of hers, and still he has enduring love for Hanna in the form of compassion and yet his ultimate cruelty in never once visiting her, 5) I have realized I am revealing much more than I should, and shall begin a retreat. Read this book! Everyone. Buy it for your relatives. A must read for any ethics class and or Legal Ethics class. Truly, what the author does is entrench the reader in the very basic and moral questions of what it means to be a survivor and that of the relationship with the oppressor, he goes on to ask what it is to love someone, to be angry with them for the love that you have for them, to withhold that love and ultimately to betray them, and how we must go on with ourselves after the ultimate betrayal. The author insists on putting the betrayed front and center on the screen so that we may see how they have suffered and died within their yearning and desperate trying. This book like it or not is about the very cruel game of one upmanship that humans play on each other oftentimes without realizing it and how one is forced to endure punishment that far exceeds the confines of a prison cell. A truly masterful piece of art. So many intricate details compound upon each other. This is an air tight piece of writing. Also, the relationship between father and son is done so well. Michael's detachment and Hanna's bitter crime are so real one can almost feel them creeping onto the skin. One of the things I truly love about this book is that it connects philosophy and logic with feeling and emotion. The writer makes them all join hands even though on the outskirts of life they are unwilling; through his forced actions of the story, he makes them connect. Outstanding! I did not think the end would get me the way that it did. When it gets you, you better have some Kleenex handy."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When 15-year-old Michael begins a love affair with an older woman, his obsession with her becomes the center of his life. Then one day, Hannah completely disappears from his life without explanation. In later years as a law student, he encounters Hannah in a courtroom as a defendant in a Nazi crimes trial. Hannah is ashamed of a secret so embarrassing for her that she would rather be accused as a criminal than have that secret come to light.Schlink unravels his narrative so seductively and in Michael's first person narrative we get a disturbing image of how the memory of Hannah has preoccupied him throughout his life. While Hannah is portrayed in a sympathetic light in the final chapters of the book, there is that underlying immorality that taints her character. Why would a woman in her thirties seduce a teenager? Why would she turn down lucrative job positions only to end up as a Nazi guard? Why would she play such a damaging roll in Michael's life? The answers are sad and pitiable, but delivered with a poetic inflection that makes this novella a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael Berg, a young German boy suddenly stricken violently ill one October day by the onset of hepatitis one, is assisted by a kindly middle-aged woman, Hanna Schmitz. Several months later, after Michael has recovered, he returns at his mother's insistence to Frau Schmitz's residence to thank her. Thus begins a \\"reverse Lolita\\" relationship that will mark Berg for the rest of his life and force him (as a representative of his entire post-war generation in Germany) to confront his generation's reaction to the Nazi Holocaust and its perpetrators, his parents' generation.THE READER is loosely structured into three segments. The first half of the book traces the unlikely yet shocking relationship between the adolescent Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz. In addition to their carnal activities, Michael indulges an apparent whim of Hanna's to read aloud to her. Hannah's abrupt disappearance from Berg's life marks the end of this first segment. The second section of the book picks up ten years later with Michael now a law school student. His university professor asks the class to monitor the testimony in a trial where Berg discovers that Hannah is one of the main defendants, accused of horrific crimes related to a World War II concentration camp. Hannah all but refuses to speak in her own defense and is summarily convicted. Thus begins a renewed, Platonic relationship between her and Michael that manifests in part through Michael's tape recording of more books for Hannah to listen to in prison. In the last section, the book's shortest, Michael takes some modest steps to help Hannah make restitution for some of her wartime actions.Reading, and literacy generally, figure large in Bernhard Schlink's story. In the Michael/Hannah relationship, it is a favor lovingly bestowed by the young boy but a form of usage by the older Hannah that parallels her use of him in the physical sense. In the prison camp, Hannah forces various young women inmates to read aloud to her as well even as she wields life and death control over them. This revelation during the trial brings Michael to the surprising realization that Hannah was and still is illiterate. Reading aloud while physically apart (by tape recording what he reads) reconstitutes Michael's young adult relationship with the older, imprisoned Hannah. In turn, Hannah finally takes life-changing steps in prison to compensate for earlier deficiencies and to reconnect with Michael in a new way.Hannah's illiteracy coupled with her complicity in the concentration camp horrors might suggest a sort of criticism on Schlink's part: that the Holocaust was a product of lack of education, of common folk being tricked into acting badly because they didn't know better. More apt might be the interpretation that under the Nazi regime, even the most civilizing human activities, such as reading, were corrupted to serve inhuman ends.One is also tempted to think that every modern German novel must be a treatment of the Holocaust and its resultant guilt, either directly or by allusion. Schlink's approach is direct, with numerous references to the manner in which Michael's post-war generation should view their respective parents' behavior. Schlink goes so far as to suggest that not rejecting one's parents, regardless what they did during the Nazi era, is morally equivalent to condoning what the Nazis did. By that measure, Schlink's resolution is rather ambiguous. Hannah's ultimate fate seems poetically just. However, Michael's final actions, while modestly inspired, hardly seem adequate to exonerate a generation's sins. Then again, perhaps it is the accumulation of small actions by the common person of Michael's generation that can serve to compensate (to the extent such compensation is even possible) for the horrors created by the accumulation of so many small but horrific actions by the common German citizen under the Nazi regime.THE READER is an affecting story in which the complex and troubled relationship between two human beings from different generations mirror the complex troubles of an earlier time. The \\"survivor's guilt\\" that plagues Germanys' post-war generation parallels in some interesting ways the issues of race and slavery in the United States."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was not disturbed by the detached narrative in The Reader by Bernhard Schlink, but believe he used it successfully to tell some truths. The exposure of Hanna's illiteracy was not the point of the book, nor the excuse for her behavior. But I found it a warning of the far-field damage that can occur when people are blinded by near-field issues. At the same time Hanna was spending so much energy trying to hide a flaw, she was also an active participant in atrocities. It would be easier to police the world if pain was only caused by people with bad intentions, and asking ourselves what we would have done in that same situation would have a straightforward answer. But if even good or neutral people/intents can create so much harm, then we all have the potential for promoting harm. And that is disturbing."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" takes place in postwar Germany. When Michael Berg is 15 years old, he begins an affair with Hanna, a woman in her late 30's. Although the relationship is incredibly passionate, it also borders on obsessive. Hanna is very secretive and is prone to irrational mood swings. Michael never learns very much about her, but he cannot bear to live without her. Suddenly, without any warning, Hanna disappears one day, and Michael assumes that he'll never see her again. Years later, when Michael sits in on a trial as part of his legal studies seminar, he is stunned to find Hanna as a defendant in the case, and it instantly becomes obvious that she is guilty of the horrendous things she has been accused of. Michael must come to terms with the fact that the woman he once loved was capable of such horrific actions, and he finds himself struggling with his own personal sense of values and responsibility.This is a fascinating book that forces readers to examine their own morality. The parallels between the main characters and major historical events are absolutely brilliant. I don't want to give away any additional details and spoil the plot for anyone, so just trust me when I tell you that \\"The Reader\\" is a truly compelling book that you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Complex and intimate fictional memoir in which a middle-aged German recalls a love affair he had at age 15 with a 36-year-old streetcar conductor. The affair is more of a metaphor for the guilty relationship between Germany and the Nazis, rather than an Oedipal/Lolita study. This becomes more apparent in the second half of the book, when the mentor/paramour Hanna is tried for war crimes and becomes the morally ambiguous human face of German Nazis.The generation gap experienced by baby boomers in the United States was intense, even though American veterans of WWII were heroes in a noble cause. Imagine how different the experience was in Germany, where the older generation was stained with the commission, or at least the tolerance, of Nazi atrocities. Schlink treads a delicate line as he attempts some measure of forgiveness on behalf of the generation he refers to not as &quot;boomers&quot; but as &quot;second generation.&quot;Kudos to Janeway for the translation, as the poetic quality of the writing and the keen human insight survive amazingly well in the English version. The book did not win its awards by being insipid, or deserving the worst possible Amazon ranking. The intensely negative reviews elicited are likely a result of the author's willingness to deal frankly with such emotionally charged subjects. It is an important and thought-provoking work, beautifully written."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really want to give this 3 1/2 stars. While reading the book I kept waiting for it to get better.. but when I was finished it kept me thinking. The characters seemed shallow- after reading the book I thought that I couldn't relate to any of them, but I realized the author purposefully kept them at a distance. The novel gave a unique perspective into how one might forgive or even love another after they commit unspeakable crimes. I would recommend it, but don't expect much while reading it.. the impact is how the book makes you think after you're finished."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink's novel starts slowly, but gradually pulls you in. It is an incredibly subtle work. The reviews on the back of the book make you all too aware that this is a Holocaust novel. The narrator strikes out any stereotypical images though, and conveys the various ways in which history treats its survivors. Displayed in 'The Reader' is the contrary, agonising human nature of the perpetrators and their survivors. Above all, this is a novel about an extraordinary love affair, which is powerfully erotic. The characters are portrayed extremely well: their tragedies become your tragedies. You cannot help but feel for them, and walk around in their shoes. Although this story mostly concerns death, it is highly vibrant, with an exceptional ability to move. It is also quite timely, for war wages in Europe yet. As we now see all too familiar atrocities, and wonder how people could do such things, and how we could let them, 'The Reader' brings a timely message from the past of what the future might bring. It's the best novel I've read this year."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I liked the book. I would not say it is a page turner, where you can't wait to see what happens on the next page. Throughout the book I felt that the weather was grey and dismal--which can be pretty depressing after a while. I also found the story to be somewhat predictable after a while. This is not a book that you can't put down and then go back to. The book doesn't seem to have its own momentum. Interesting but not riviting."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It could be the type of book one would expect out of a middle-aged, German judge, full of the law and still haunted by the guilt of his parents' generation in Nazi times. But author Bernhard Schlink adds a sensual layer infused with another breed of guillt. While there is a subtle eroticism in the early chapters, this gives way to the sights, smells, memories and fixations of trying to deal with relationships and responsibilities. As the narrator moves from his adolescence to middles age, Hannah glides through his life, first as lover, then as mystery, later as obsession, and finally as heart breaker. Hannah is at times everything good and everything evil as her secret is revealed. Her deeds and insensitivies as a prison guard, her quirky tenderness, her efforts to cover and uncover her past -- these are the tidal waves beneath the surface of this engaging small volume. In the end, her secret both revealed and overcome, there is no relief from the mystery that surrounds her driving motivation. The title of the book, The Reader, takes on various meanings, but everyone in the book who is a reader is doomed in his or her own way. And by the end of the journey, one can only ask, &quot;Why?&quot; That question, especially to a German of the present generation, is the troubling reaction to atrocities large and small of the mid-20th century."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"While the book has some very eloquent language and few memorable scenes, I felt everything in between was particularly mediocre. The story is a little demented with a 15 year old boy in a sexual relationship with a 30-something woman, but soon you forget the age difference and are caught up with the passion and unlikelyhood of their sordid romance. I have yet to meet a 15 year old who behaves like our hero, Michael. Parts of the story were too absorbed in legal issues and Hanna's trial and I felt myself drifting in and out. It never really captured my full interest. The book is jumps around without any explanation of how we arrived at the next stop and I felt I never got an actual feel for any of the characters. I was disturbed by the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion and felt the emphasis (and better writing) was wasted on the affair between Hanna and Michael. If you're searching for something to read, give this a try, but only after you've exhausted other sources."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is an oddity. Its international success is a complete surprise to me. The fact that it has provoked over 760 reviews here with a broad and even spectrum of responses demonstrates that it hits a nerve. Many different ones actually.I like Schlink as a writer of detective novels. He invented a great PI, an aging reformed Nazi called Selb, a name which enabled great titles like Selbs Justiz or Selbs Mord. A writer and a hero with their hearts on the right spot, with interesting cases in post war Germany.But the Reader is something else. The story is 'simple' enough: a teenage boy has a love affair with an older woman, a tram ticket collector; part of the charm of the affair is that the boy reads to the woman after sex. Then they lose contact when she moves away. Later, he is a student at university, he finds out that she is an accused in a Nazi trial, she was a KZ guard, and it becomes apparent that she is illiterate, and too proud to admit it. She can not even read the dossier of the prosecution.Which reminds me of Monty Python's Meaning of Life: the fish in the aquarium in the restaurant watch the guests eating fish and ask themselves in excitement: what does it mean? Exactly. What is Schlink's point? Till now I have no clue.Are the Nazi criminals just illiterates too proud to admit their lack of education? That can't be it, obviously, so what is 'it'?Schlink pokes into a deep well of ambiguity, but there ends his contribution. He goes no further in clarifying anything. What do we conclude from his story? I wish I knew."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is not a book I would ever have chosen to read. The only reason I took it up was because two of my Spanish teacher colleagues had asked me, a German teacher, to give my opinion about the ending, since they had each come away with a different interpretation. (MAJOR SPOILERS COMING!) So I read the book as a favor to them, having absolutely no idea in advance what the story was about.For the first third of the book the review I was planning was negative. It seemed to me basically a sex book dressed up in literary pretentiousness. The novel takes place in West Germany (the Heidelberg area), starting in 1959 and spans a period of over 30 years. The story is told from the viewpoint of the main character, Michael Berg, and opens with his seduction as a fifteen-year-old high school student by streetcar conductor Hanna, a woman whose name he doesn't even know and who is in her thirties. On the one hand the relationship borders on morally repugnant. Had the roles been reversed--had a thirty-year-old-man seduced a fifteen-year-old girl and the first third of the book been devoted to a frank description of their sexual relationship--the novel may never have gotten published in America. But realistically, the author is male and what he has written is a fantasy that most young men have had; and our culture seems to find that acceptable. On the other hand, the relationship between Michael and Hanna is a destructive one. Both are using the other strictly for their own pleasure. Or at least for their own interests. But not out of a regard for the other, and certainly not out of love, even though young Michael mistakes his lustful infatuation for love and mistakes Hanna's attentions for love.The interesting twist in Michael and Hanna's otherwise twisted relationship is their post-coital activity. Michael, on a college preparatory track, begins reading Hanna the books he's required to read for school. They are classics of German and European literature: Emilia Galotti, Kabala und Liebe, Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts, War and Peace, The Odyssey. It's true that the reason Michael reads aloud to Hanna at all forms an integral part of the story's plot, and it's not even clear to Michael until he is much older what it meant that he read aloud to her. However, I felt the choice of novels mentioned was intended to lend this part of the story a literary veneer, and I can't help but believing that the reader would be better off skipping this book and reading the works alluded to themselves.It isn't until the novel's second act that the plot really takes off. Michael, now an aimless law student, attends the trial of several women who had been guards at a concentration camp during the war. The women are accused of being responsible for the deaths of a group of Jewish women on a death march while fleeing the advance of Allied forces at the end of the war. Michael is shocked to recognize Hanna among the defendants. She had disappeared mysteriously after their relationship was about a year old, and Michael had had no contact with her since. Adding to Michael's confusion at seeing his former lover on trial for Nazi war crimes is Hanna's bizarre, belligerent, seemingly inexplicable behavior in the courtroom.It wasn't until the late 1960s that Germany began seriously coming to terms with the twelve year period of National Socialist rule--not just coming to terms with the crimes committed by the Nazi regime but also with the actions of the adult populace at large during that period of time. This introspection was lead by the children of those adults and corresponded with the student protest movement of the late 60s, which was very much a reaction against the existing authority structures in society. Therefore the introspection took the form of a condemnatory stance against most of the previous generation, which was held--by its actions or by its silence--to be complicit with the evils perpetrated by the Nazis. They tended to blame everyone in their parents' generation out of horror at the sheer magnitude and inhumanity of the crimes. It was this same reaction among the British and Americans that led to the retributive leveling of Dresden during the waning weeks of the war. Michael's struggle to reconcile the woman who had treated him at times so tenderly with the woman accused of leading the others in the brutal death of helpless prisoners mirrors the struggle of his generation.The nature of the writing improved as the novel progressed. The young Michael posed a myriad of questions which he didn't bother to try and answer, and at first I understood this as a pretentious attempt at art. I don't find the endless stringing together of questions about the direction and meaning of one's life to be particularly literary, especially if no attempt is made to provide possible answers. It is the product of a culture that no longer feels there are answers because it has lost faith in the Truth. Yet as he ages, Michael not only continues to pose questions but also attempts answers, subtly implying that there must be Truth out there, or else we would not continue to seek it. I came to appreciate the author's attempt to show the narrator's development over time from a sheltered, provincial adolescent to an experienced man of the world and veteran of multiple failed relationships and one failed marriage. But since the whole story is told as a retrospective from one point in time, it would seem that the aged Michael Berg would be as adept at handling the questions he asked as a teenager, as he is at handling the questions he asks as an adult.The best written chapter of the novel is the fourth chapter of the second act. In it Michael describes a \\"numbness\\" which has taken over everyone in the courtroom as the case drags on. \\"It had taken hold not only of the perpetrators and victims, but of all of us, judges and lay members of the court, prosecutors and recorders, who had to deal with these events now; when I likened perpetrators, victims, the dead, the living, survivors, and their descendants to each other, I didn't feel good about it and I still don't.\\" The author is at his best when trying to find the balance between acknowledging the humanity of the perpetrators and condemning the crimes that were committed. It is something that Germans have a hard time with. A few years ago when the movie Downfall appeared, detailing the final weeks in Hitler's bunker, it met with a great deal of criticism for putting too much of a human face on Adolf Hitler. For many he must be a monster without any humanity at all; that way he can be an anomaly. If he were human--and enjoyed pleasure and suffered pain and had doubts and loved--then he was like the rest of us, and that doesn't say as much about Hitler as it does about the rest of us and what we may be capable of.\\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it. But it was too terrible for that. When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned. When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding. But even as I wanted to understand Hanna, failing to understand her meant betraying her all over again. I could not resolve this. I wanted to pose myself both tasks--understanding and condemnation. But it was impossible to do both.\\" This is one of the best explanations of the conflict that the post-war generation was faced with. Condemning and understanding seeming to be mutually exclusive. It might not necessarily be good art, but it's good writing.In the end Hanna is sentenced to a greater prison term than she (legally) deserves, because she is loath to disclose the fact that she is illiterate. It seems strange to the reader that the plot of the novel and the trajectory of Hanna's entire life hinges upon her illiteracy and a sense of pride that won't let it be revealed. The author recognizes this and goes to great length to have Michael explain to the reader why Hanna would rather let herself be unjustly sentenced rather than simply admit she couldn't read. It didn't really work with me; I just had to go with it and accept it, even though I couldn't really buy into it.Then comes the end of the novel. For all of the years of Hanna's imprisonment Michael has been recording himself reading works of literature and mailing them to Hanna. As she is about to be paroled he agrees to be a care-taker for her upon her release. He has obtained an apartment and a job for her, has met with her, and she appears ready to begin life again. Yet the morning of her release she hangs herself. Why? A key might be provided by the warden of the prison. When asked by Michael how she had lived, the warden replies she had served out most of her time like a nun in a convent. But in the last few years she had let herself go to seed, even though she didn't seem unhappy. \\"'In fact, it was as though the retreat to the convent was no longer enough, as though life in the convent was still too sociable and talkative, and she had to retreat even further, into a lonely cell safe from all eyes, where looks, clothing, and smell meant nothing. No, it would be wrong to say that she had given up. She redefined her place in a way that was right for her, but no longer impressed the other women.'\\" It could be that Hanna realized she would not be able to continue such a life on the outside. And if it's plausible that her pride would allow her to serve 18 years in prison rather than admit she was illiterate, then it's plausible it would cause her to end her life rather than leave prison. As Michael explains to the one surviving victim of Hanna's crime, Hanna did not want her years in prison to be merely the required atonement, she wanted to give her own meaning to her experiences. Again, I'm not sure that I can buy into the explanation; I just have to accept it for what it is. And one must accept the novel for what it is: deeply problematic, but at times an articulate, well-worded explanation of an important chapter in German post-war history. Ultimately though, I'm stretching to be as positive as I have been."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have enjoyed reading a selection of books from Oprah's Book Club including Jewel, Where The Heart Is and Black and Blue. However, this book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. I must admit Part Three was the best section of the book. I could never find any &quot;attachment&quot; to the characters; could not sympathize with Hannah or feel any emotion toward her or the narrator. All in all, this book was extremely different from all the others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"An unusually poignant rendering of a country coming to terms with its past through the machinations of an intense sexual relationship. I felt that this novel sensitively approached the idea of 'masking' the responsibilities and inherent guilt, which are nowadays associated with those who played a part in The Holocaust. Post 'Schindlers List', it has become perhaps acceptable to view this terrible passage in history with a quiet ,reflective dignity. And yet, this novel manages the remarkable feat of personalising a sense of incomprehension and genuine grief through, of all things, a bizarre adolescent 'rite of passage' and, in so doing, conveys a powerful sense of helplessness and misery. This book is a valuable and necessary addition to the canon of modern Holocaust-related 'fiction', and, as such, demands to be read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What potential this book could have had! Here is a young man walks into a courtroom and finds his lover of years past accused of crimes during WWII. One would think this book would be gripping. But it is not. The characters were shallow and simplistic. The writing was dry. Ultimately, in spite of the promising story, The Reader is disappointing."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When Oprah anounced this book as a book club choice, I bought it the very next day. A few hours later I was holding the closed book in my hand trying to decide what I had just read. I was blown away. The book did not touch me as much as it revolted me. I wanted to know why? I felt that nothing was ever resolved. It was an absolute pointless read. I have gained more insight reading a trashy Daniell Steele novel. You can bet I will be more causious next time I choose a book off of the book club list."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was the most unusual book. Such a different viewpoint for the era in time. It was disturbing but also riveting. It gave great insight into how the main character felt about her secret. A fast read also. It moved and didn't drag on with needless descriptive passages."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One of the best books I've read in a long time! The story keeps moving and keeps you anticipating the characters actions and reactions. The story from past to present keeps you wanting more and more. If the book was twice as long, I would have stayed interested and wanted more. A novel that takes on the aura of a true and riveting life story. A believable real life drama! You won't be sorry with this one!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I heard a lot of hype about this book but found it to be very insubstantial. It was hard to follow and even though you get lots of details you never really get to know the main characters."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This sparse, tersely written book seems to be a veiled autobiography. The writer, like the narrator became a lawyer and consequently a judge. American readers might have problems with the sex between the teenage boy and the &quot;odler&quot; woman, however, in Europe this is accepted, even condoned. It is written very believable. Most young boys go on to happy, uneventful lives. The protagonist gets stuck on this one very satisfying sexual encounter and all women later are measured against it - and naturally fail. To his horror he meets Hanna in the courtroom, where she is being tried, along with other women for unspeakable crimes committed against Jewish concentration camp inmates. Her behaviour puzzles him and he - rightly - concldues that she is illiterate, which might not excuse, simply explain some of her behaviour. He decides against revealing this to the presiding judge, which could mitigate her sentence - on the advice of his cold, remote(again, very typically European) father, Hanna is given a long sentence. He makes one concession to their shared past: sends her tapes of books that he reads to her aloud. As Hanna laboriously learns to read, a new world opens up to her. Her innocence is ended, she finally faces her crime and is her own most severe judge. Is this a metaphor for Germany? Or simply a story that gives one lots of thought? Innocence, ignorance is no defense. There were not many illiterates in pre-war Germany one of the most highly civilized European nations. This is a haunting, readable book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader makes a good start by arousing the reader's interest to read on. However, it doesn't satisfy my appetite for a good work which must include a strong recognition and climax. The protagonist's recognition of Hanna's secret as being an illiterate does not product a great impact on the reader as well as on the book itself. Besides, the work seems to leave many questions unsolved. Maybe the worst part is that we as the readers fall into the protagonist's subjective world without ever coming up to see what's really goimg on. If there's an access to Hanna's world, that will be better. The world of literature is never the same as the real life. To some extent, reading the book makes me feel like seeing someone's true life story instead of a well-written, solid novel. Overall the Reader is not good enough to the reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book shows you that you really never know someone the way you think you do."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one of the best novels I've ever read. It is primarily a memory book and examines as much how we remember events as the actual events themselves. It has too many layers to be taken in one read. The author never thrusts his opinions on the audience but presents the story and its possible morals for us to decide on individually. Plus it's a quick read you can read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Actually, I'm not sure if I think this book deserves even two stars; it's not terrible, but it's pretty weak. Why are there so many questions the book leaves unanswered? I keep on coming back to the possibility that the author, while starting with an interesting idea, couldn't execute it very well. The translation was totally banal, and it may be that the original was banal, too. I had no sympathy for either of the main characters, both of whom lacked any depth. I got tired of the author's philosophically superficial musings; the whole thing started to come across like a term paper. If you want to read a great, well-written story that deals with the German character and complexities of WWII, pick up &quot;Stones from the River&quot; by Ursula Hegge. That's a five-star book!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader asks the questions that post war Germans ask themselves about their nation's dark history and the personal involvement of those close to them in the Holocaust. After the horrors of the Holocaust became known throughout the world - it seems impossible that such a horrific crime could ever happen again. However, the individuals that committed these crimes are grandparents, parents, neighbors, professional associates of present day Germans - it is difficult for them to believe that people with whom they have personal relationships have either committed the crimes or associated themselves with the perpetrators. This book will leave you thinking."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"From the moment I picked it up it captivated me. The writing was smooth and flowing. The story was interesting and dealt with some important issues. Check it out!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am surprised by Oprah's choice of books. I found this book to drag on forever. It was very vague with some interesting areas and went into way too much detail about nothing. Hanna's side of the story was never discussed much and left you feeling depraved of half of the story line. The one chapter at the end is the only one that lets you get to know her. I might have had more compassion for her if I had &quot;known&quot; her better. Definately not one of the better books I have read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is hard to explain because of the many different emotions that it leaves you with.

I was surprised by that, as I had previously read Black and Blue, and Jewel, and just got done with Where The heart is, and I couldn't put those down. I guess I didn't much care for the sex in almost every page, for such a short book, and I am not really too interested in WW2.

I even sent it to a friend to read, so we could discuss it! It was interesting reading, but left you with lots of questions that are not easily answered or easily dismissed. I found that I had little sympathy for Hannah, and I consider this more of a child-abuse story than a love story. He was haunted all his life by a woman who took advantage of him when he was only 15! I am haunted also by the other young &quot;readers&quot; that Hannah &quot;used&quot; while working at the concentration camp. Hannah's very nature poses lots of disturbing questions; nevertheless, the book holds your interest and I would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A book that just doesn't have you happily float along until it's over; this book pulls you deep below the surface to not only see, but feel the passion,love, pain, anger, despair and most important morality.

A book to read and read again!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Written from the point of view of a man too young to have any responsibility, yet he must agonize over the crimes of a woman who has had a proufound effect on his life.

It absolutely gave me chills as I read this passage, precisley describing as it does that the sum total of our lives includes everything that has happened in our pasts.I found the setting and plot of the book to be the perfect format for illustrating this undeniable truth. The Holocaust must be a cauldron of secrets, half-truths and baldfaced lies for many people. Some reviewers complain that we never really get to know Hanna or Michael. I disagree but even so, isn't it true in real life? How many people in our lives do we REALLY know? As I've gotten older, I've become convinced that it is the human condition to keep secrets about ourselves - especially FROM ourselves.A fine novel. I simply could not put it down and read it in a sitting, frequently going back and re-reading passages. A deeply affecting novel on so many levels, I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the complexity of the human heart and soul."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For those who have grown weary of the typical post-war, anti-Nazi novels, movies, and histories of World War II Germany (I'm thinking of Ursula Hegi's tedious Stones from the River,among others), but wonder how the legacy of Nazism has affected successive generations, this book is a must-read. Written by a German man who grew up in post-war Germany, this book sheds light on how people of his generation have grappled with the Third Reich and its aftermath. At the same time, the book touchingly tells a young man's coming-of-age story in a most compelling manner. The love affair with Hanna, the friendships with his school and university classmates, and the strained relationship with his family are utterly credible--so much so that one cannot help wondering how much of it was based on the author's personal experiences. This also lent credibility to the other part of the story--Hanna herself and her experiences during the war and afterwards. While illiteracy is no excuse for atrocities, this book does convey the profound effect that illiteracy can have, not only on the illiterate but on those around her. If Schlink's story is an accurate portrayal of what Germany's baby boomers are experiencing, he has done us all a great service by describing it. I found it ironic that I was listening to this book on tape, which are so much easier to make today that in the 1950s. I am giving the tape to my sister, a high school English teacher, because I think she would enjoy it and might recommend it to some of her more sophisticated students. And I am planning to read it myself, the old-fashioned way. Listening to books on tape is a delightful convenience in our busy lives, but there is no substitute for curling up with a good book in one's hands--a pleasure that Hanna sadly came to enjoy much too late in life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this remarkable book twice and made new discoveries the second time around. As a decade-long national leader in adult literacy in the U.S. I understand well the stigma and shame attached to the condition of adult illiteracy, but I don't find it believable as the primary motivating factor for the actions of Hannah. But there is much else to say about the work. The lucidity of the language creates a horrifying picture that is both stark and beautiful. Hannah's awful past acts against humanity are horrifying and inexplicable. Still, one wants to cry not just for her victims, but for Hannah herself. The author masterfully interweaves the horror of her criminal action (really, a lack of action) with other periods in her life, but most importantly with the underlying broader theme of betrayal that results from silence/inaction. The book delivers a powerful message that asks for a great deal from the reader, including an honest examination of one's own behavior. I admire the book immensely. Oddly, despite all that is terrible about Hannah, and about the lawyer who loves her as a young man, the truth is much more complicated than that. At the end, on a purely human level, I cared about Hannah and even felt in some measure responsible for her."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"THE READER BY BERNARD SCHLINKIn THE READER, German author, Bernard Schlink, offers us an intriguing situation. Told in the first person, it is about a fifteen-year-old German boy, sick with hepatitus, who, to his great shame, vomits on the street one day and is helped home by a stranger, a woman. He would have forgotten about her except that his mother insists he thank the stranger and buy her flowers with his allowance. I smile to think that a young boy today would, in all probability, protest and tell his mother: No way, Jose! But, being German, he obeys her and this seemingly insignificant incident changes his life.After he has delivered his flowers, he has no intention of seeing her again. And yet, a week later he finds himself standing in front of her door. Schlink writes: \\"Often in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.\\" He explains that his behavior is often the opposite of what he had intended as though his behavior is quite independent of his thoughts. I too am German-born and although Germans are sometimes known for being excessively rational (and efficient), I too, have found myself doing the very opposite of what I originally intended do.The love story begins with a sensitive rendering of the young boy's sexuality being awakened. Our young narrator is fifteen when he meets Frau Schmitz (whom he will soon call Hanna), a woman more than twice his age with whom he begins an almost obsessive relationship. Hanna is a streetcar conductor, a taciturn woman who possesses a mysterious beauty that captivates her young admirer. She is often surly and coldly monosyllabic, given to sudden bursts of temper but her young friend continues to spend his afternoons with her. In spite of their difference in ages, a bond springs up between them that I find entirely believable. I can feel how much she loves her young visitor even as she pushes him away with her coldness. He arrives at her apartment straight from school and tells her what he is reading in his English class. She asks him to read to her and this becomes a ritual she loves and they engage in every afternoon.This unique story, beautifully translated from the German, illustrates the universal need for love and how, in our fear of rejection, we tend to sabotage our chances of finding it. Schlink is saying: we want to be loved for ourselves but are afraid to be ourselves. Hanna harbors a secret out of a deep shame and embarrassment over what she feels are her inadequacies. As our young man's feelings for Hanna eventually diminish, he also is less than honest with her and will also pay a price for this in the years to come. This story feels absolutely true to me and, especially because of its first person narrative, may well be a personal story taken from the author's own life.Many years later, our young protagonist, now an adult, is preparing to become an attorney. In a courtroom where he is studying the outcome of a trial dealing with perpetrators of the concentration camps in World War II, to his great surprise, he sees Hanna again. The story now becomes an ever-deepening drama that poses a compelling moral and psychological dilemma. More than this I can not say without giving too much away. Suffice it to say that I became deeply involved in the fate of the two main characters, Hanna and her once-boyish lover.I work in the field of mental health and it is my belief that the human conflicts that drive this story pertain to all of us whether healthy (if there is such a thing) or mentally ill: We all live with varying degrees of shame and low self-esteem, with feelings of inadequacy which prevent us from speaking honestly to those we love, and thus find outselves in relationships that break apart. Like the characters in this story, we all have a deep-seated need for love, a need to find a place for ourselves in the lives of those we love, to feel that we belong; and yet our inability to reveal our true natures all too often destroys the very connections we most cherish, leading to heartbreaking loneliness.Our narrator, turned lawyer, writes that his memories of Hanna never leave him. He did marry, he tells us, but the marriage led to divorce. Furthermore, he confesses that all his relationships with women are hampered by his constantly recurring and poignant memories of Hanna.THE READER is a book I read again and again and and each time am drawn into the heartrending destinies of this ill-fated couple. I enthusiastically recommend it to all who are intrigued, as I am, with the ever complex and emotional affairs of the heart. #"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The editorial reviews about this book do a great disservice to the novel. (Sometimes I wonder if the reviewers actually read the book.I don't consider this in any way a YA novel -- the themes are way too adult and the introspection and examination of conscience of the adult writer aren't reflective of the typical younger adult point of view.)That said, this is a fantastic novel. I was glued to the pages, examining my own reactions to what was happening and trying to summon the outrage one should feel when a 15 year old boy is having a sexual affair with a 30 something woman. He should be viewed as a victim. I couldn't summon that assessment.This is a beautiful and haunting story of a 15 year old boy named Michael, whom she called \\"Kid\\", who has an intense love affair with a 30 something woman named Hanna -- a streetcar conductor. He knows nothing of her past, and their relationship is mostly physical. She disappears suddenly once day and Michael next sees her when he's a law student in 1965 Germany as the war trials of the Nazi criminals are getting underway.He is both stunned and repulsed when seeing his former paramour as an SS guard criminal. He can't reconcile his love of her to what she had done during the war. Michael is in a state of suspended ambiguity. Should he feel guilty for having loved her -- a reviled and heinous war criminal with the worst of reputations? A quote at the end of Chapter one in Part 2 sums up how Michael faces the truth of his lover and how he responds to it: \\"I adopted a posture of arrogant superiority...this juxtaposition of callousness and extreme sensitivity seemed suspicious even to me.\\"The book is divided into 3 parts and deals mostly with Micheal's feelings about his relationship with Hanna, his reaction to her trial, and the final chapter as he comes to terms with all that has happened.This is a novel that is not to be missed. One that can be discussed at length in book groups everywhere or just between friends. I can't get it out of my mind.The reason for the title becomes clear midway through the novel.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Americans have grown so accustomed to turgid, overwritten prose that Schlink's unadorned style at first seems cold and a little unsettling. The result, however, is that the reader is called upon to use his or her own imagination and memories to &quot;fill in the blanks&quot;, and I found Hanna's home; the streets that Michael walks; the bike journey; the courtroom; the camps, etc.; formed extremely vivid pictures in my mind as I read this book and for days thereafter.While I loved the style and enjoyed the interaction between Hanna and Michael--who among us has not lived through illogical, confusing relationships?--I found the story so odd that it was somewhat frustrating. The &quot;secret&quot; upon which the whole plot revolved--Hanna's illiteracy--was so obvious to the reader that it was incredible to think neither Michael nor anyone else in Hanna's life had caught on. Nor did illiteracy seem sufficient explanation for the intense alienation of Hanna's character. (An aside here--see Ruth Rendell's &quot;Judgement in Stone&quot; for a similar motif). In his imagery and descriptions, Schlink hints strongly at a darker, more compelling secret--that Hanna is actually blind. This would explain why she did not acknowledge Michael in the streetcar; why she was unaware that he left her a note in the hotel room; why everything about her is associated with tactile senses. Of course, a blind woman simply could not have carried out the things Hanna did, and illiteracy seems to be Schlink's own metaphor for Hanna's &quot;blindness&quot;. All of the characters are &quot;blind&quot; in their own fashion: to the sufferings of the WWII prisoners; to the needs of their friends and lovers; to their own inadequacies. The implications of Hanna's &quot;secret&quot; are intriguing, but ultimately awkward--the reader should not have to reach this far to make sense of the story.Despite the flaws, I found &quot;The Reader&quot; compelling, and certainly worth reading, although I understand why the reviews have been so mixed: this is not the kind of book one encounters often!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I chose to read THE READER simply because of its title. I found it interesting that i was to become the title by reading it. My curiosity drove me to find out who this reader really was.The book takes place in postwar Germany. It is the story about Mickael Berg and his lover Hanna. It describes their love as an obssesion, started by the day Mickael, a 15 year old boy, was saved by a 36 year old woman (HANNA) as he collapsed on the sidewalk with hepatities.Mickael reads to Hanna on a daily basis before making love. However, Hanna disappears on day without even leaving a note. When Mickael sees her again he is already a student of law, who in a trial stumbles upon her, for she is to be prosecuted for working for a concentration camp during the war.During her trial, Mickael realizes a secret that in fact takes her to jail. Hanna was ashamed of revealing her secret, and in turn receives a harsh sentence. While in prison, Mickael proofs his undying love for her by sending her tapes of his readings.Sadly when Hanna overcomes her secret, she becomes aware of what her crime really was, and of her relationship to the boy. Then the novel takes a tragic twist that ends it.I loved the book! It even brought tears to my eyes. It shows how ignorance can take someone to their downfall. It shows an undying love, and the power of shame. Schlink is a great author who kept me glued to the novel, he was capable of turning what sounds like a disturbing relationship, between a boy and a woman twice his age, into a passionate love."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Der Roman &quot;der Vorleser &quot; von Bernhard Schlink ist einfach Super! I absolutely loved Schlink's novel &quot;The Reader&quot;... I had picked up the German Edition of this novel in Germany this summer, and finally got around to reading it. I couldn't put it down and read it in four hours. I haven't read the English translation, so I cannot judge the version that others have written reviews about on this site, but the German novel is the best thing I have read since Patrick Suskind's &quot;The Perfume&quot; a few years ago. It is extremely thought provoking and makes one seriously think about love, relationships, guilt, responsibility,shame etc."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an excellent and thought-provoking book that made me consider new perspectives on the holocaust.Although there is more than one theme here, I think the most striking is the one in which Bernhard Schlink uses the relationship between a 15-year old boy and a 30-something year old woman to address the strange ambivalence of attraction and revulsion that the German generation born after the holocaust felt toward its parents and older generations for their involvement in the holocaust.Through the eyes of the 15-year old boy who grows up during the course of the novel, we come to see how difficult it was for the generation born after the holocaust to simply mark its elders as \\"evil\\" or corrupt. While the children of that generation wanted to hold those who were involved in (or who allowed to take place) the holocaust as criminals, it would have been impossible for those children to escape the fact that those criminals were their mothers and fathers, or their kind neighbors.By the end of The Reader, no matter how much the narrator thinks he has broken away from the influence of his former lover, he finds that the memory of her haunts him in every area of his life - just as the German psyche would have been completely inescapable to any young Germans wanting to break away from their identification with Germany and the horrors that the country and its people committed during WWII."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I left the film with many questions about the motivation of the main characters. I then decided to buy the book and was rewarded witha more morally and philosophically complex development of these characters. A quick read and far more satisfying than the movie evenif the actors turned in very gifted performances."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in an evening and loved it. Chapters are just a few pages and at the end of each chapter, I wanted to read on. Made me want to see the movie even more."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an outstanding book and a very easy read. The depth of the topic is challenging and engaging."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It was okay. Not great, not awful, just okay. Good story overall and it did offer a lot to think about, but it moved slowly and even dragged at times. Predictable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Though I enjoyed the book, I do sense that the writing got flattened out during the translation process. It felt dull, hollow, as if some intermediary was paraphrasing what the author had originally written. Just my feeling. Though I did like it in spite of this."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a good book about a boy who falls in love with an older women only to find out she has a very troubled past that is coming back to haunt her. He never forgets her and can't understand what is going on until he grows up and finds out exactly what is going on. Tried to avoid spoiling anything in my review. Try it out I think many will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I loved this book. I urge you to read it. It lingers in the mind for weeks after reading it. There is something so sweet and hopeful and tragic about Michael. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am about half way through The Reader (enjoying it so far) and was curious what other's had to say. Well the reader who titled his/her review &quot;A bitter portrayal of a young man's bliss and its aftermath&quot; just gave away the rest of the book for me! A review is not a blow-by-blow synopsis of the book, especially not on an e-commerce site intent on selling readers the book. I am so disappointed that I read this review, and I'm nowhere near as excited about going home and finishing the book now."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The austere style of this writer is perfect for this novel. No fluff, just the facts presented in a simple way that leaves one feeling the raw emotions of the conflict Michael Berg was living. I found this book to be intense and sincere."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I bought this book because it was on Oprah's book list. I found it quite an interesting story, and I really felt connected with the characters. It was a bit difficult to get past the wordiness of this novel, and found myself skimming some parts. Deep be the best way to describe this story, and a word of advice...while it is a good book, it's not a good choice when looking for a light-hearted book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader by Bernhard Schlink starts off with a young boy, Michael, falling in love with an older woman, Hanna, who is a worker on the streetcar. Their love is obviously controlled by Hanna and she often gets upset with him when she thinks that he will leave her. Hanna starts to do things that don't add up in Michael's mind. One day when he leaves her a note, she gets upset and claims that she never saw the note. I could tell that she was hiding a secret, but did not know exactly what it was. Hanna's character was not developed very well and even when I discovered her secret I did not feel that it explained her actions earlier in the book. This was a weakness in the book because I wanted to know what it was about Hanna that affected Michael's life so much. Michael's emotions were clear throughout the book, but I found myself wondering what it was about Hanna that made her so special to him. I felt a strong point in this book was reading Michael's changes in emotions and how Hanna completly changed his life forever. Another strong point of this book was that it showed a different view on the Holocaust. Hanna was a woman in charge of running the concentration camps and it lets the reader know that these people doing the disgusting crimes were actually people. My favorite part of this book was near the ending because I thought it was interesting to read about how Hanna and Michael had changed each other's lives. My least favorite part was the middle during the trial. I felt that some parts really dragged on. Overall I really enjoyed this book and it was an interesting look on the people involved in the Holocaust and a young love that kept on throughout the years."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I did not care for this book in the least. First off, I felt that it read at a High School level and was in no way interesting to the adult reader. Schlink begins The Reader in mid-story. We have no background or character development. One day Michael Berg, the main character, is sick in bed and the next he is having sex with a woman twice his age. Then we turn the page and she is a Nazi war criminal. As Schlink takes us down this some what interesring story line he still forgets to develop the characters. Why should we care what happens to Hanna? Schlink did not reach me on a moral or philosophical level, he could not even reach me on an erotic level. All in all, this Reader was a let down and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought I would pick the book up to read because so many people are recommending it and the subject matter seemed interesting. Unfortunately, I found the book to be emotionally detached and hard to relate. The main character is hard for me to sympathize with. While the woman is a tragic figure, I wish I could read more about what is driving her silence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found parts of this book iteresting to read but much of it boring as well. It was hard to go on at times... If you read this book, or want to read one that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book disturbing as it abdicates personal responsibility for the evil things that people do. The author has written this book to dupe the unsuspecting reader. His distant style and debauched view of the world, leave a bitter taste in the mouth. We are not all that prison guard as he would have us believe."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I don't think this book is nearly as morally provocative as thereviewers have said, or as the author would like us to think it is. Ithas become abundantly clear to me that many modern Germans think that paying lip service to questions about morality is sufficient to gain their society a dose of forgiveness, and even entitles them to forgive themselves. In my mind this book utterly validates my main criticism of post-war German society. In fact, it strikes me as the perfect apologist manifesto for post-war Germany's view of the Holocaust. &quot;What would you have done&quot; is Hanna's question to the judge---and the author then softens his treatment of her, as if her mere asking of the question is tantamount to an excuse. And poor Michael's agony of indecision over whether he should tell the judge of Hanna's secret? Oh, gee, I guess that means he's really a compassionate guy underneath his vapid exterior. And I suppose the fact that he doesn't tell the judge after all, so Hanna ultimately serves her time in jail, is meant to suggest that modern Germany is now willing to do the right thing? Sorry, but it's too late. Schlink conveniently ignores the fact that the Holocaust was planned genocide--and every German must share the responsibility for that, forever. Admitting the truth just isn't enough, in the end. If you're a modern Jew who wants to get really p***ed off, read this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought this was an excellent, quick read on a topic I, as an American, certainly haven't pondered in great depth. One thing that struck me most about the book was how removed Micheal is from virtually everything in his life. He reports on everything in a most dispassionate way - his near fatal illness, his affair with Hannah, the trial (he doesn't even become outraged at the ineffective assistance of her counsel), law school, his relationship with his father, his marriage, etc. For example, look how he went to the judge and could never bring himself to talk to the judge about Hanna and the episode instead focuses on how the judge is just a civil servant after all. I would have thought that any or all of these events would have produced more passion. Oprah continues to do a great job of picking good books on thought provoking topics and getting Americans to READ!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The ReaderSadness. Sadness permeates this beautiful little novel like a winter fog. It imperceptibly closes round the story enveloping the reader with the characters, drawing them together for what little warmth they can find. The characters themselves are not unlovable, in fact Hanna the anti-heroine and subject of the story is quite ordinary - she is a conductress with a tram company - but her secrets isolate her even from her youthful lover.The narrator, the Reader of the title, is a nameless, blameless individual who accidentally stumbles into Hanna's world one afternoon in his mid teens. The love affair which ensues follows a fairly ordinary trajectory until one day Hanna is gone, no explanation, no recrimination, only his youthful tears at his loss, but, well, he'll soon get over that. And he does.As a child of the WWII generation he enters law school and amongst his studies are the judgements of Nuremberg and the ongoing pursuit and trial of the participants from his parents generation. Hanna, of course, is part of it and his next view of her is as a defendant in a concentration camp trial. If this was an ordinary novel then it could slide at this point into the familiar rehash of confused motives and idealism with which we are all too aware. But it's not. Schlink is more thoughtful and more literary than that. He takes this as a starting point and allows Hanna's tragic story to unfold. Her former lover, her former friend, as an embryonic lawyer with a conscience, sees it as natural justice that she should be punished with a long jail sentence. He can dismiss her and march on into his new world. Except his own world is almost as messy as hers and time slowly pushes them together again. Not together enough for him to ever forgive her. Her crimes are too heinous and she has tainted him by association, but enough for him to start sending her books, novels which he has dictated onto cassettes, but cassettes only, no greetings, no enquiries, no news, only the audio books - The Reader of the title. And that is how he appeases his guilt, audio books to make her feel better, his voice because she loved him to read to her, but real communication would be going too far.It would be wrong to release the ending of the story, wrong to reveal how the gulf between the two of them is finally crossed but, as with the fog on a cold January afternoon, the dampness persists even when you come indoors.Schlink has tried, successfully, to show what it means to have your parents mistakes on your conscience but equally, how do you avoid them yourself ? The tawdry Jewess who features near the end of the novel refuses to show any signs of forgiving or of understanding, even when the Reader explains to her that Hanna could never have committed the crimes for which she was imprisoned. Hanna's crimes are passed from country to country, residing at present in Palestine, and, ominously, from generation to generation.A novel, presumably perfect in the original (I read the translation by J C B, a work of art itself), which will haunt your memory long after the book is closed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I liked this book. I liked the sparse style, the portrayal of emotional and spiritual numbness, the way it begins and the way it ends. The recommendation came from my librarian when I asked her if she had read anything interesting lately. Earlier I had passed &quot;The Reader&quot; by having heard lukewarm comments from others. But from the moment I picked it up, I didn't want to put it down. Disturbing, yes, the relationship between a young adolescent boy and an older woman. Shocking, too, to realize that Hanna was capable of such horrendous crimes. Her shame at her illiteracy is poignant when it is so great that she accepts responsiblity for writing an incriminating document when, in reality, she did not have the capability.Was Michael Berg wrong in failing to alert the judge or at least discuss a valid defense with Hanna? Neither character warrants much of our sympathy. Yet of the two disturbing main characters in the novel, Hanna has the greater capacity to grow and accept responsibility. Michael fails to connect to anyone -- even the daughter he loves.The Reader is a highly discussable book. It would make an excellent choice for a book club."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After reading the description and reviews I thought I would really like this book, but I didn't like it at all! It was very slow and boring and I honestly didn't care what happened by Part 3 of the book!This book is about a young boy (age 15) who gets seduced by a much older women (in her thirtys). This takes place post WWII. Then later he finds the woman (Hannah) awaiting a trial. She was a guard for one of the concentration camps and held responsible for a lot of women's lives.I felt nothing for Hannah or the kid (I can't even remember his name), but she calls him kid throuhout the whole book! I was sick at the fact that this older women seduced this boy and in turn ruined his life! He was never the same and could never have a decent relationship with another women because she screwed him up so bad! When she went to trial I still felt nothing...just like the kid kept saying...I felt the same way. The last few chapters were touching in a way, but in a way they were just sad! This kid devoted his whole life to this women and I found it to be very pathetic! By the end of this book I just wanted it to be over with and thought about just not finishing it at all. I usually love books that relate to the Holocaust, but this book just happened to be set in that time period and really didn't have much to do with it at all.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It was only 200 or so pages and it felt like it was 1000 to me. This book could have been written in 50 pages or less without all the boring details and relayed the same thing I felt when I was done reading it. I felt like I wasted a few hours of my life on some stupid story that I could never get back!!!!Oh and also this remineded me of the reason I steer clear away from Oprah's Book Club Books...they are never worth a flip!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"You can read this book very quickly.

Shame, love, grief, consume narrator and reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel uses a unique love story to remind the reader not only of the horrows but the legal issues of the Holocost. Suberbly crafted and excellent read"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In less than 200 pages, Bernhard Schlink manages to get the reader(no pun intended) thinking about very critical life issues. While the book begins as a rites of passage novel it takes very interesting turns into the behaviors of seemingly ordinary people and what motivates them. I find myself thinking about Hannah and her actions daily. This is a powerful, philosophical gem of a book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is not an easy book to read and some may even think it's depressing. One might glibly describe it as another 'rite of passage book' or toss off Hanna as a 'German Mrs. Robinson'. But to dismiss either as such is to be facetious. What this book does is to make one think of one's own prejudices; to reconsider youth's idealism and how this sometimes turns into unintended cruelties. It questions the notions of love and forgiveness, of loyalty and betrayal. The prose is poetic without being mawkish; there is pathos but no bathos! This is a quiet little book that echoes and reverberates in ones mind long after one has closed its covers."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought this book was wonderful.. A little heavy on the philosophizing at times, and someimes I wondered about the faithfulness of the translation, but I would recommend it to anyone. The twists and turns in the plot truly took me by surprise, and it was a good thing that I hadn't read either the dust jacket or the reviews that give away the first half of the book"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Even though this book is written in a very simplistic style, it took me two weeks to get through the book because I did not enjoy it. Character development was poor, you can finish the book and not know much about any of the characters, their motivations or goals. The plot was shallow and unbelievable. This book did not effectively convey any message, or story. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"'The Reader' is a short book, written in a simple style, which, paradoxically, deals with enormously complicated and nuanced issues. It's tempting to say that its strengths are also its weaknesses: brevity and clarity allow key concerns to be put vividly, however they limit a discussion around these concerns to the merely suggestive; the intelligence of the reader is never insulted, but, then again, too much might also be presumed.*The spare style of the prose has numerous effects, not all unequivocally positive. Certainly it makes for a clear exposition of the plot. It also gives the narrator a voice that is free of apparent irony, and so makes it initially hard to credit that he is keeping anything from us, or from himself. Yet this very clarity, with its superficial honesty, starts to feel like it's failing to communicate the complexity and messiness of the thoughts and emotions raised by the subject matter. Its cool distance can feel like pretence. Once pretence is suspected, then it's possible to ask whether the narrator is deliberately leaving out much that is pertinent, and whether his clarity actually curtails, rather than encourages, further thought about the difficult issues contained in the book.*To look at this another way, it is as if we are allowed access to only one of the voices inhabiting the mind of the narrator. The events depicted suggest a tremendous internal conflict within th narrator, a conflict that might be expected to generate a number of opposing voices, much like in one of Dostoevsky's protagonists. Instead, a fairly uniform, and oddly dispassionate, voice is presented to the world. This voice is very clear, and spare, and readable, but I'm not sure it's the most interesting, or insightful, or truthful way to illuminate the issues at the book's heart.*The clarity of the style extends from the word surface to the structure. This can be beguiling, in that where gaps in information exist, these gaps are readily visible, and we can engage in the imaginative task of filling them in. Who were Hanna Schmitz's parents? What were the details of Michael Berg's marriage and his subsequent affairs? What kind of relationship did he maintain with his child? These and many other questions might reflect upon the text, but Schlink provides answers which are, at best, suggestive, at worst, non-existent. Again, this is double-edged. The reader is shown respect, is not manipulated or told what to think, but perhaps insufficient guidance is provided for further thought to be successfully promoted. To be more personal - I felt I was being asked to, \\"Think about Germany's relationship with its Nazi past\\", but I was given the means to this only in the most broad and 'suggestive' of strokes.*If the key concern of the book is the relationship of one person, or one nation, has with a flawed and shameful past, then overall, 'The Reader' puts the questions squarely and clearly. It is also well aware that no one 'answer' exists to these questions. However, its strategy of leaving silence to speak of the complexity is flawed. The many answers, most incompatible and partial, that might have been offered to the reader are left unsaid. The undeniable courage of the narrative seems to stop short when more is needed, but that is not to belittle its considerable achievement in arriving at such a vantage."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When I first read this book I liked it a lot. Then the more I thought about it, the more I found things wrong with it until I reached the point where I thought it was important to warn people about the dangers in it.The first part deals with an abusive, horrible sexual relationship that somehow people are calling erotic and romantic. She used a kid that didn't know better and pummeled him into a submissive emotional dependence to the point where she scarred him for life (see his later marriage). I can expand on this but I don't think I need to and besides, the biggest problem is yet to come.The moral dilemma about revealing her illiteracy was very interesting but it's extremely misplaced. Just because she was honest at the trial, that doesn't mean she even showed one sign that she wouldn't do any different if it happened again. So who cares about her shame?! First put the murderer away! And what about the other defendants who didn't even show guilt? By taking into consideration her shame, they got away with reduced sentences. Mass murderers no less. But read on...Then there is the sympathy and all the work he went through to make her life slightly more pleasant. Perhaps she finally showed regret and a change at the end when she was reading about the holocaust, but the book does not mention or show this so we have no way of knowing what she was thinking. And besides, he didn't know what she was up to until after he did everything for her and after she died. And even if she did feel guilty, aren't there much better people worth helping? What about the surviving daughter? Talk about misplaced sympathy!But all this isn't as bad as the overall big picture I got from the book. The main character was weak minded, apathetic and full of misplaced morals (another example of this is how he dealt with his marriage). All this led me to believe that it was because of people like him that the Nazis could get away with what they did. Guilt is meaningless and even detrimental when it comes with passive behaviour. And sometimes guilt is even used as an excuse to feel human while committing inhuman actions. If Germany is populated with the likes of him nowadays and Nazis would rise to power, the holocaust would happen again. I have no doubt about that.And don't tell me that this book is objective and cannot be criticised from a moral point of view because it isn't. It's unconsciously manipulative and VERY subtly monstrous. And the proof is that most of the reviews I read for this book describe this as a 'touching love story', a sympathetic view at human characters and real dilemmas, or praising it as putting a human face to Nazis.So altogether I felt this book was pro-Nazi, despite its strong initial impression otherwise. The problem is not that it pictures Nazis as human with sympathetic emotions, but that it didn't condemn them despite their emotions. People would love to think of Nazis as cold hearted monsters but the truth is a Nazi lives potentially in every heart and if you are not careful, you can be a Nazi sympathizer too."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Hepatitis made him weak. He was fifteen years old. Michael Berg, the narrator, knew every building, every garden, every fence on his way to school. Being ill is an enchanting interlude. The fever sharpens the imagination. He encounters Hanna and vists her frequently.His last years of school and first years of university were happy. Parents had played a variety of roles in the Third Reich. Everyone condemned parents to a sentence of shame. Michael enrolls in a seminar on the camps. The group attends a trial. Hanna Schmitz, one of the defendants, had been Michael's friend. She had served at Auschwitz until early in 1944.Hanna makes a bad impression on the court. Michael comes to realize that she cannot read or write. She refused promotions in her industrial job. She sought out the job with the SS as a guard. She describes the confusion on the march westward from the camps and receives a life sentence.The narrator tries to speak to his father. In those years there was little direct observation that made life in those camps real. The few images available were derived from Allied photographs.The student movement was a generational conflict. Coming to terms with the Nazi past was one of the issues of contention inalterably. For the narrator's generation, collective guilt was a lived reality. Legal history was to be his metier. History involves building bridges between the past and the present. He worked on legal codes and drafts of the enlightenment. The codes were based upon the belief that order was intrinsic to the world.The narrator sends Hanna tapes of his reading, the Odyssey, Chekhov, Kafka. In the fourth year he receives a note from Hanna. The note is child-like. It provides verification of his theory that she could not read or write in the past. I will not disclose further details of the plot or the ending of this fine work."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I needed to read this book for my summer reading when I was in high school. When I start reading, I felt it's a easy book to read, the English was not hard at all. But the first few chapters are definitely weired because an 15 year old boy have sex with an old woman. In some way I think it's really sick! But once you get over that chapters, the novels starts getting your attenton. The old woman just left boy without saying anything, and when the boy next time see her is in the court. At that point, you will start wondering what happened to this old woman. Of course there are a lot stuff need to do with this woman's background. She was a Nazi and killed people. She feels guilty! This novel has something to do with human's guilt and also people cares how other pepople in the society look at them. Once you start understaind all these points, you will think it's a pretty sad novel. In some way I think the way author represent this book is quite unique, you won't feel you are reading a text or history event books. It's worth reading it!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a quick and easy read...(I finished it in a weekend and I consider myself a slow reader). It is written almost completely in the first person with very little dialogue between the characters. The book chronicles a teenager (Michael) and his journey through life, from a passionate love affair with a woman who is 21 years his senior (Hanna) and his life following that affair. Michael wrestles with the feelings that he has for Hanna and what he can/should do about them. Hanna disappears one day and the next time he sees her, she is on trial for crimes committed against the Jews. She refuses to defend herself because she is guarding another secret that she is ashamed to admit to. Michael discovers this secret (I'm not going to give it away!) and realizes that she can get a lighter sentence if she tells it to the court. Michael again wrestles with feelings of helplessness; he doesn't know what is morally correct...should he tell the court what Hanna is hiding or should he allow her to condemn herself? This book deals with questions that would be difficult for anyone to answer. The ending is bittersweet and sad; it will definitely leave an impression on the reader..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked this book up because it was a &quot;best-seller.&quot; I felt compelled to finish it knowing that I had paid for it... but I just couldn't get past the first few chapters. How could I waste my time on top of wasting my money?I'm surprised that so many people who gave this book 1 or 2 stars actually got through it... Where was the substance? The relationship between Michael &amp; Hanna was appalling and twisted. And what about Michael's parents, didn't they notice he was gone for hours?What about the Holocaust? German Society at the time?Unless you have absolutely nothing better to do, I wouldn't bother picking this one up."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It was a nice idea, of Schlink's, to put this fictionalized memoir together for us. But in the end, it left me thinking, &quot;yeah...and then what happened?&quot; -- sort of the line you tag at the end of a bad joke.The sexual relationship they had, twisted and remote, was worthless and gratuitous. It didn't need to be there. While Michael was sewing his oats, Hanna was aroused by intimacy of the reading. There was no symbiosis or exchange in that relationship. But that's what happens when you put together a 36-year-old former Nazi prison guard with a 15-year-old well-educated boy who's learning the ropes of life. In the final analysis, it was an emotionally abusive relationship -- and if any of us thinks it's a great &quot;romantic&quot; piece, we should have our collective heads examined. If that happened in America and the parents found out about it, it wouldn't be so romantic.Why everyone thought this was such a great work is beyond me -- maybe I'm deft to the symbolic undercurrents, but I don't think so. On the very primal level, it was sad and manipulative. I found myself finishing it out of obligation. I don't like to quit anything."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"i read this book because of oprah, i had to force myself to finish it, it was beyond boring!!you knew the big secret from the beginning!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The entire story could have been told far better in 10 pages.Maybe less. But to get their 20 bucks, the author, editor and publisher pack in another 180 pages are pure fluff. As for the &quot;secret&quot;, I'm sure everyone thought it had to be a little more a good deal more significant and surprising than it turned out. As the reviewer says above, the woman would rather do hard time than admit she can't read? I can see the sequel even now: woman kills self and rest of world because she's not online."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I saw the book at half-price, bought it, read it, all the while wishing I hadn't and when I finished it, I donated it to the local library as I did not want it in my book collection. I did not like the characters, the setting, the subject matter or the underlying theme of literacy. Why Oprah chose this book, I'll never know."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Although the premise seemed engaging initially, I soon found the characters--particularly Hanna--terribly unsympathetic and offensive. Neither character was very dynamic...neither changed or grew throughout the novel. Is the reader REALLY expected to feel anything but disdain for these two selfish, self-absorbed characters...especially one who feels that her inability to read and write is more shameful than her grotesque crimes against humankind? I couldn't quite figure out what all the fuss was about. The big &quot;secret&quot; was ridiculously simple to figure out..no suspense there. True, Schlink raises some interesting questions about morality, forgiveness, and the nature of who we love, but those questions get lost amid the loose ends pertaining to Hanna's years long guilt and shame over the wrong things and Michael's years long guilt over his possible &quot;betrayal&quot; of someone who was emotionally, physically and sexually abusive (afterall, Michael was only 15 years old). Schlink's messages get lost in a weak, bori ng story line. Overall, I was disappointed in what promised to be an interesting read. Additionally, the German point of view of the Holocaust as told by Schlink neatly omitted the fact that the crimes were a result of a plan for genocide. Instead, it almost seemed as if we, the readers, were supposed to feel pity for the plight of the poor guards and other SS personnel who were only &quot;following orders.&quot; The old &quot;What would you have done?&quot; question that Hanna repeatedly asks the judge was a thin disguise for justification of Nazi war crimes. Oprah, what were you thinking?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book on a 16 hour flight to Thailand. I finished quickly, and what a waste it was. This book was boring as could be. There was only a few parts that were captivating. Save your money!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This story, one which very well could have come form the imagination Milan Kundera, has the basic makings of a masterpiece. Unfortunately the author fails to make his point, can not offer the lyrical prose of a master and ends up instead with a trite, boring read. The characters are one dimensional and dull and the climax of the story leaves you wondering \`is that all?' Trust me stick with the proven master. Read Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being and leave The Reader where it belongs: on the bookshelf"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I can't decide if I am disappointed that it went by so fast because he could have put in a lot more interesting historical information. Or, I'm glad it was fast because it is so stupid! I expected Hanna's big secret to be something worse than being an SS officer, but it's not. The book is hastily written and there isn't much there."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. For a short novel, it ran too long with unnecessary details. I felt nothing with any of the characters. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is the first book I have read from B. Schlink but I was impressed by the story and the writing style. In several pasages, the book read with the flow of good poetry. Whether to credit the author or translator, I'm not sure. Although the ending was rather sad, the book was a fast, satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have to admit that I have not seen the movie, and I'm only mildly tempted by it. I did buy the book because of the buzz though, and it was a most absorbing reading. Although I actually do not find the ending convincing given the development of the characters, the novel does convey both the beauty and the strangeness of the relationship between the protagonists. The author has a subtle but ultimately convincing way of opening up the reader's mind to the possibility that horrible crimes are committed by perfectly normal, even somewhat innocent, people. The Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have read just the most helpful favorable and critical reviews. There are just too many to read, 800+ at this time.I got furious with this book. I am Jewish, I am surely not a holocaust denier, but the narrator Michael Berg bent me out of shape with HIS guilt. Of course Hanna bore real guilt, but neither of these two reviewers suggested that Berg/Hamlet is as guilty of a capital crime as she is. He thinks about talking but ends up doing nothing, costing Hanna years in prison and perhaps her life. I am not sympathetic toward Hanna, I just would have liked to see some condemnation of the narrator.Who is The Reader? It is not Hanna, it is Michael; and it is me and you and how we react to the book's reader's crime of silence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found it very good. I am glad I read this book. It is an amazing story. Worth READING!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have to admit that I picked up this book because of the movie and the Academy Award nominations. I haven't seen the movie, but after finishing to book, I will make sure that I do.Bernhard Schlink wrote a beautiful novel that is told by one of the main characters, Michael Berg. When he is 15 he falls ill with tuberculosis and has to be away from school for a long period of time. One day he meets Hannah and everything in his life changes. He not only begins a very illicit affair with her, he begins to read to her. It is then that readers see that Hannah has secrets. Hannah disappears Michael's world changes forever.As the story goes on, readers see Michael grow up, go to college, marry and have a child of his own. But he is still conflicted about his relationship with Hannah. Eventually he starts to learn her secrets when she is being tried for a terrible crime against Jewish prisoners that occurred at the end of World War II.The story is beautifully told, and yet very sad and tragic. For anyone that is interested in historical fiction, WWII, the Holocaust, or looking for a good book--this one is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was assigned this book for class but it turned out to be a thought-provoking and interesting read. It brings up deep questions about morality, relationships, and guilt. The translation was excellent and it felt as if the original were written in English."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book will have a permanent space in my library - have already recommended it to my friends as a 'must read' book. It is profoundly moving. What an excellent teaching tool this would be for students, for history buffs, for anyone trying to define 'MORALITY'. I cannot remember the last book that had such an impact and felt so true to it's form. This is a book whose message goes past World War II, it is universal and expresses important thoughts without preaching."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was a required read in a class at a community college. I probably would never have read this type of book. I intend to read it again and again because of the time and place with which it was written. Even though it was fiction, I would think that this was a story which might have happened!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read \\"The Reader\\" after having read \\"Night\\", and although The Reader is fictionalized, it helps one understand how ignorance can lead to horrific, despicable, ugly, inhumane and un-human atrocities. In this case (The Reader), it was a Guard not knowing how to read, and thus not being able to foresee the consequences. Hanna, the main character in The Reader, was interested only in doing a good job at work. She was petrified that someone might discover she could neither read nor write. Thus, she did what many beings do; she ran from the truth and wove a horrific web. Rather than be promoted at a previous job (the streetcar company),she quit, because she knew the promotion would have required her to display reading and writing skills. She took a job as a Guard, and later sent her wards to their death at Auschwitz. (Would she have done this if she could have read the note?) She even took the rap for having written a report, a report which was sure to convict her, just to avoid confrontation with a court expert. She was willing to accept exposure as a criminal for fear of being exposed as illiterate.It makes you stop and think. Hanna was not anti-Semitic. She was just trying to be something she wasn't. If all the world -all nations -- all peoples -- simply confessed ignorances and got help to overcome those ignorances, we might see world peace. It doesn't matter whether the ignorance is outright illiteracy , or of another's religion, culture, history, background, race, creed or national origin, as long as we have the basics to learn about each other, seems that would be a step in the right direction."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was recommended this little gem of a novel, by my friend, and I must say that it is short, bitter/sweet and thought provoking. Here we are introduced to Michael Berg a young impressionable boy, who like most young male men, yearns for the sex of a woman. Michael then meets up with Hanna an older mysterious character that is both loving and distant, yet who seems to be hiding a secret so disturbing that it consumes her life.The author, spends little time on embellishments and metaphorically strips his characters to the bare bones. Again short and bitter/sweet story telling up until the controversial ending; which I though appropriate. Give it a try."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"How arrogant that her shame in being unable to read and write would be the premise of such a pitifull life. It is really almost sick and I too and surprised at Oprah - I have enjoyed almost all of her previous picks."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After all the hype about this book I expected much, much more. Usually I avoid all &quot;Oprah's Book Club&quot; books but I was so interested in a book that would cover the &quot;digesting&quot; of the Nazi past in Germany that I picked it up nevertheless. But it lived up to all my negative expectations of an &quot;Oprah&quot; book....First I thought it was the translation ... However it is the content that is not developed well or written well. Michael's realtionship with the woman is not believlable which is the center of the story. The reaction to the Nazi years and the Holocaus is superficial, simplistic, &quot;unimaginative&quot; and predictable, i.e. he is not writing it any differently than 100s before him. The word &quot;transition&quot; has not made it into his vocabulary. Character develelopment is limited. Very quick, boring read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book has large type and is very short, and yet I almost did not take the time to finish it. It is as satisfying as Bridges of Madison County, another Oprah book, which is to say, not very satisfying. The main character falls in and out of relationships with extremely scanty character or plot development. This becomes quite evident from the beginning when the 15 year old boy and &quot;woman twice his age&quot; fall into bed together, without exchanging hardly a word. You would feel just as connected to a stranger who tells you his or her life story in 3 minutes or less. I never learned enough to care about any of the characters, and only finished the book because it is short."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The voice of this book, even in translation, is so compelling that it can almost blind you to the fact that the book, despite the kudos, is psychologically bogus to a repellent degree. Quite simply, despite all the window dressing about the joys of literature and reading, it posits that a guard at Auschwitz didn't know about the Holocaust and that she was more ashamed of being illiterate than of being a murderer. Having studied the Holocaust for over thirty years, taught Holocaust film and literature, written about the effects of the Holocaust on the \\"Second Generation,\\" most recently in a memoirMy Germany: A Jewish Writer Returns to the World His Parents Escaped, and even co-authored books about shame itself, I found this central conceit of the book unbelievable. Unfortunately, it seduced even Oprah, but then she has a history of being taken in by fakes."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in under 3 hours, simply because I just wanted to get it finished. I don't give up on a book, even one as awful as this.Truly, I sensed no emotion and very little depth. The story is not remotely interesting and the characters are nothing but names. It is completely dull and did not make me wonder once what was going to happen next. I could not have cared less.The people who find this book amazing and thought provoking and worthy of deep discussion are reading into things just aren't there, or even hinted at. There's just nothing to this story.Schlink, on pg 118, has the narrator referencing another book. Of it, he says, \\"It does not invite one to identify with it and makes no one sympathetic...\\" I smiled as soon as I read those words because he had just described his own book perfectly.Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was written by Bernhard Schlink. The story is about a 15 year old boywho falls in love with a much older woman. In a confusing way they stay in love for awhile until Hanna, the older woman, suddenly disappears one day. Michael, the youngboy, must return to his life as an adolescent and forget his days of showering and makinglove with Hanna. The next time Michael sees Hanna is during a trial. Michael finds outHanna's past, which he never knew of, and finds out more about Hanna than he everknew.The reader targets teenagers and adults. Both genders can indulge in this book.The Reader is an uncomfortable story of how a young man falls in love. The confusingpart is how he is in love. Hanna is described as big and old, not a character one can easilyfall for. Many young males lust for older woman, but they are attracted to good lookingwoman. As a child you don't want to be in love with someone that isn't described asbeautiful, which Hanna isn't. The Reader gives the message that love is boring. Hannaand Michael fall easily into love. But it does not seem as if Hanna is in love withMichael. Hanna still treats Michael like a fifteen year old. Every day the two continue todo the same activities. Michael and Hanna will read together, take a shower, and makelove. After pages of these activities love and sex become very boring.I did not like this book. It makes a reader feel uncomfortable about sex, anduncomfortable about love. The Reader is a boring novel which shows love to besomething that it isn't. Hanna's odd and quiet character is boring. She has all thisbackround but none of it seems to matter after Michael and Hanna part.The Reader is supposed to excited people and express feelings that others hideaway. Michael did not hide his feelings towards Hanna. In our society an uffair like this isnot accepted. Michael and Hanna showed us why this affair should not be accepted.Bernhard Schlink tried to show love had its backround. Lust was more than just a feeling.He did his job as an author getting across that love is hard work. The Reader neither madeyou feel happy in the end, nor sad. It left you with a very queasy feeling like youshouldn't have read it. The Reader was a confusing portray of a young boy trying to findlove in the wrong place."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I did not enjoy reading this novel. I would not have even picked up this book except for the fact that I am involved in a book club and this is what we were reading that week. Only a couple of us from the book club, enjoyed The Reader. The rest of us despised the character Hanna and felt that Michael was a very confused and simplistic character. The novel didn't seem to have purpose. I will admit though, that I am only a teenager and I think I will enjoy The Reader much more if I read it again in about fifteen to twenty years. I didn't enjoy reading this book, but I definitely understood it a lot better after I had finished reading it and I was looking back on the novel. If you are reading this book, you should finish it and then think back on what happened in it and what this novel was truly about. The Reader is more appealing in the past than in the present."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am puzzled by this book. The characters are cold and unyielding. The prose is spare and lucid, though many parts read like the narrator's soul-less observation or statement of facts without revealing or even hinting at his pain and troubles. What is about the war and Hannah in his childhood that made him the unfeeling and unloved adult? The Holocaust forms the background for much of the novel and Schlink does suggest the hidden psychological impact of the atrocities but if his intention is to tickle without eliciting any giggles then he has succeeded."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"did you expect a book oprah told you to read to be good? probably not... here is another case of a book picked by her that is very _bad_. would have given it a zero rating, but there is no option to do so."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Had to read for book club but could not finish it, it centered around an older woman involved with a teenager."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have the sad sneaking suspision that too many people nowadays expect to be entertained by the books they read, rather than feeling unsettled - thoughts come to the surface that were so far unconsidered.This is exactly what this book did for me. While, for entertainment, I usually enjoy fluffy novels, this one entertained enough to keep my mind sharp, yet provoked me enough with difficult questions to make me recommend it. I agree it is a bit vague in sections, I disagreed with the characters' choices so often I was frustrated - but in Hanna's questions to the judge, I felt the questions we all should be asking ourselves. What would we have done in her situation? It's easy to take the moral highground after the fact, but what of the moment, the pressure?Spellbinding and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The holocaust, as a subject of media attention, has evolved through time and catered to various agendas. The idea that it is 'incomparable', 'incomprehensible', and perhaps, 'unforgivable' places it in a league of its own with respect to being included in a novel. The social responsibility it entails, the expected sensitivity of the audience, the overall risk, the risk of offending the population --all these are considerable. However, The Reader incorporates both the holocaust as a back drop for his novel and impressions of the younger generation faced by its ramifications. The result is a most poignant novel. This is true perhaps because it strikes at the experience from a basic level. He highlights sensations of shame, of guilt, of betrayal, of needing to return home. Schlink, by juxtaposing the affair between Michael and Hanna with a Nazi trial, addressed the idea of seduction, of culpability, of passion. This was achieved in such a way that the taboo surrounding the affair of an older woman and a younger man mixed with the tinge of Nazi appeal, and Nazi horror, striking a chord within the human psyche most readers would rather deny. The form of the novel itself facilitates this goal. The conclusion of each section is marked by Hannah exiting Michael's life, while her influence remains. The less familiar Hannah is the Michael, the more familiar the holocaust becomes to him. But the same way Hannah is unreachable, the holocaust is never fully intelligible. On the one hand, Hannah sought to destroy, or at least bury, her past. On the other, Michael is struggling to come to terms with his past. But again, he struggles with where his past begins and where the holocaust ends, if in fact it has. The idea of dealing with the past runs through the entire novel which is told by a mature man, beginning with his adolescent years. As one becomes more involved in the novel, one is drawn further and further toward the present. What the present signifies is a relationship to the past and action, i.e. the latter's inability to escape the former. All in all, the novel is artfully written, weaving different perspectives into an almost coherent whole."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is very seldom that I read a book in one sitting, but I could not put this book down. Schlink has captured the essence of collective responsibility perfectly. Coming from South Africa, where these issues are still extremely raw, I was profoundly moved and astonished by his grasp of what it means to live in a country damaged and damned by its history."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; feels like a Kubrick film - clinical and detached yet intimate and profoundly affecting. The sparse prose and rapid development allow for a quick read. Like many good novels, you spend much less time reading it than you do thinking about it afterward."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, It was contemplative and very discerning. For those reviewers who think the book was flat and boring and yearn for something more upbeat, try Dr. Suess. The book was not meant to make you smile it was meant to make you think"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I felt I was zapped by a subtle web woven by this seemingly simple story of first love which grows into obsession and guilt, and then a powerful moral question. As a Jew living in Germany for 7 years and struggling to understand what happened and how it happened, this book so well captured people that I knew (in Heidelberg) and their attempts to struggle through the horrors of German history and responsibility after the War which, not surprisingly, also caused much conflict between generations. The power of this book is that it takes Hannah, an unsympathetic almost evil character, and makes us feel her humanity. And it takes The Kid, and allows us to feel his detachment, as he too is damaged by the forces of history. Germany is a very complicated place. This story cleverly took a small slice of the War's legacy and led us into some difficult philosophical questions. During the last pages I cried for a German woman whose crimes were monsterous, but somehow I understood. Wonderful writing."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This isn't just a book to read. It's a book to feel. To respond to and then explore those responses. To me it wasn't just about the Holocaust or Hanna and Michael. It's about the deepest levels of human emotions and psychology. How we behave in difficult circumstances -- circumstances as horrible as the Holocaust and as basic as whether to intrude in another person's life. Its spare writing (and I assume strict editing by both the author and editor) focuses on events and feelings and a deep exploration and understanding of both. I will read it again. And I wish it had been there to read when I was in college -- although I probably would not have understood it as well. I can't criticize those who didn't like it. But we'll never have anything is common!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am appalled by some of the reviews Amazon's readers have submitted. This book is obviously not for the romance novel set. Those raised on fast-moving pulp fiction that revolves around sex and violence might not appreciate this simple, yet profound piece of literature that explores the relationship between those Germans born after WWII and their parents. The author answers no questions, he raises them and offers them to the reader to digest. These are important questions: how guilty is each German who lived through WWII? What are the responsibilities of their children? Can those children ever live normal lives under the cloud of what their parents did or didn't do? The protangonist of this story could not. He is forever scarred. What about his parents, the Germans represented by Hanna, his father, the truck driver? It's a great deal to think about. It is beautifully written, though I think the author made some excuses for his parents' generation despite his good intentions."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Some things in life are just inexplicable. In a rational world, we spew forth words to express meaning, as though we really &quot;know&quot; something. In The Reader, we are faced with a story where the familiar is just a facade; like a building in war torn Germany. Underneath that facade there is a 15-year old boy trying to be a man. There is a 36-year old woman trying survive in literate world with an inability to read. There is a mother and daughter deserving justice, who never find it, even when their perpetrator sentenced in a court of law and dies in prison. There are silent victims who speak loudly from the grave, but are only faintly heard. Most inexplicable, is human compassion, where one can love even heineous war criminal, yet not &quot;know&quot; them for who they truly are."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am astonished by the number or reviewers who missed the point of this novel enough to give it one star. I have to wonder if they bothered to finish it.Although I was sometimes annoyed by the fact that the point-of-view is so legal, I kept in mind that Schlink is not a novelist by profession but a scholar of law. In that sense, his very direct method of moral analysis seems perfectly appropriate. Schlink simply approaches the novel and its penetrating moral questions from his area of expertise, and there's certainly nothing wrong with that.As a scholar of the German language and culture, however, I am disturbed that so many of my fellow Americans missed the point so completely. Perhaps many of us are incapable of comprehending and analyzing difficult moral issues and their effects of the human psyche. The United States has, after all, never had to deal with the guilt that invariably follows an event as inexplicable and horrifying as the Holocaust. Understanding of such difficult moral questions is the only way to avoid complicity in our own Holocausts, and, as such, it is essential that we dismiss neither the far-reaching effects of such a tragedy nor our own moral failures._The Reader_ eloquently examines the questions and guilt that modern-day Germans continue to face -- even 55 years after the Third Reich. This novel forces the reader to ask herself what she would have done in Nazi Germany and to ponder how one can finally free oneself from guilt. If you like thought-provoking novels -- and especially if you're a Germanophile, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Despite its acclaim and recent hype, &quot;The Reader&quot; fails to probe as deeply into one's moral and ethical consciousness as might be hoped or expected. The plot indeed drives home a moral question (broadly, 'what is the extent of forgiveness?'), yet its development and maturation prevent it from truly striking a resonant chord. There is simply too much that is shadowed over, too much that is not discussed, and too much that seems improbable and even impossible in the relationships that are described. Yet the tone and character of the writing earn &quot;The Reader&quot; high marks: its masterful use of allusion, its ability to speak volumes by what is left unsaid -- are beautiful things to see in a modern novel. This is a book worth reading, yet perhaps with slightly lower expectations in hand that what the media hype have deemed fashionable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read the Reader before all the hype started and yet still feel it is one of the most thought-provoking books I've read. The shock in part two was un-anticipated. The sympathy you feel for someone everyone else abhors is cleverly created. The cold style makes you shiver and feel the desolation even more. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink succeeded in representing an average man's struggle to find love, and the unaverage man's resulting eternal misfortune. Mike Berg fell in love with Hanna Schmitz for obvious reasons at an extreme early age in his life: she pampered him like a helpless child and introduced him to physical love. However, when trying to capture love's essences apart from the physical, Mike soon learned that he was doomed to fail. Hanna, an overly insecure woman who focused only on her well being, became as ruthless as ever through verbal and physical abuse. As Hanna had undoubtedly been overly neglected in something as a child, her resulting actions only hurt her. Hanna had been ultimately charged with a crime committed as a guard in Nazi Germany that sent her to prison. One reading this novel may easily be persuaded, as Mike eventually seemed to be, that her evil actions became justified because of her insecurities. What one must keep in mind is that a lover would do anything to protect himself in a relationship, and believing her actions to be justified is a typical thing men do to reduce their own cognitive dissonance. If we believe Hanna's actions to be justified, we are looking at it subjectively, as Mike, or the author. Understanding Hanna as a self-centered sadist, I believe is the correct way to look at her because there are certainly some essential rights and wrongs in this world that there are no exceptions for. Hanna violated them, and coerced a man to obsess over her through excessive physical attention, mental neglect, abuse and abandonment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Many reviewers announce proudly that they figured out the secret of Hanna's illiteracy before everyone else did. Of course, you were supposed to. It is an obvious secret, just as the Holocaust was an obvious atrocity. But Hanna fooled everyone around her, just as the Nazis did.The point was that the society was wilfully blind, particularly towards the flaws of an attractive young woman. She was not all that bright, but she manages to ask the question that should haunt us all: &quot;What would you have done?&quot; Maybe you are (a saintly) fool enough to have acted without considering the consequences. Maybe you would have taken the minimalist, unemotional actions of the father. Or would you have been the bored SS officer, feet dangling into the execution pit, as he waits for the day's killing to end?I liked the novel very much, simply because of its ambiguity. Probably the best example is when the protagonist agonizes over visiting the judge to tell him of Hanna's illiteracy. He assumes that this will clear her name, since she could not then have written the report that damned her and her co-accused. Does he tell the judge? If he doesn't why does he feel relieved? If he does, why does this have no bearing on the sentencing? Was he worried about moral issues that had no bearing on truth, or just not on the society's reaction to truth?Germany in the first half of the century was as advanced scientifically and socially as any country. Just consider the number of Nobel Prizes won by Germans in the sciences and literature. It was certainly less racist towards its largest minority, the Jews, than America (and Canada) was towards blacks. But something went terribly, inexplicably wrong. This novel, like the German experience, is a challenge to the myth of progress, to the assumption that we can understand something by observing it, and to the smug assumption that we would do the right thing."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was astonished to find Bernhard Schlink in the New York Times Bestsellerlist and would like to add the view of the German post-war generation. The moving and unsettling theme in this book is the question, if we can forgive ourselves the love and the bond we feel for our grandparents and parents allthough we know (or not know) about their share of the happenings before and during the third Reich. It is easy to blame &quot;the Nazis&quot; in general or the hanger-ons who gave them their power and to dissociate from all of it. But it is harder to face all of it on a personal level."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was alternatively gripped, shocked, bored and then deeply troubled by the ethical tensions throughout.I felt the ending was most unsettling.Can a war criminal be made sympathetic without for one moment lessening the crime. Yes?Can the fact that we confront evil in others make our own actions less subject to judgement. No?Does this make a powerful novel. Yes?Will timid readers be offended by the story line? Yes.Is it worth reading the READER. It is what reading is all about."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is an excellent and illuminating analysis of morality, loyalty, betrayal, guilt, love and hate, fear and fearlessness, stretched to cover a difficult subject. It appears that the character of Hanna represents Nazi Germany and the character of Michael Berg represents at some level the metaphor for post-War Germany. The book is brilliant in examining the different and difficult levels of morality against the backdrop of the relationship between Hanna and Michael, her &quot;secret,&quot; and how that secret has tragic implications. Professor Schlink also manages to inject legal theory and philosophy into the book without condescension. The spare writing style is similar to Kundera, either deliberately or because of the translation. Among books that utilize the Holocaust as a backdrop, this one is much different because it is not told from the survivior's perspective -- although the real &quot;survivor&quot; in the book is post-war Germany, the Germany of today. This book truly should be read by people interested in grappling with and trying to understand difficult moral choices, moral ambivalence, and the make-up of morality itself. A challenging book in its entirety and one that should be read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book opened up some very interesting questions for me concerning German war guilt, which, as in immediate post-war period of &quot;The Reader,&quot; is also very much a part of modern Germany. How does one come to terms with the mistakes of one's forefathers? And how does one begin to speak about the unspeakable? Though it doesn't specifically answer these questions, the book provides an insight into the attitudes of a generation which didn't experience WWII directly, but was nonetheless greatly affected by its legacy. Not surprisingly, this is also Schlink's own generation. Though I read the book in its original German (Der Vorleser), and am consequently unsure as to the effectiveness of the translation, the book was written in a direct style which seemed appropriate to the issues it addressed. I found &quot;The Reader&quot; entertaining, clear, and most of all incredibly interesting in the issues it addresses. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For those of us who still grapple with the unfathomable question of the extent of man's inhumanity to man - whether that be past and/or present wars, hate crimes, racism, bigotry - this small novel is a stunning experience. Schlink has created at least two unforgetable characters in his tale of the coming of age of Michael Berg with an experienced woman of more years. How he evolves a beautifully honed description of sexual awakening into the nightmare of realization and then leads us to an understanding of all aspects of life civilized and uncivilized is a miracle of writing. A short tale, but one that lives on in the conscience long after the book's covers are closed. This is a genuinely brilliant novel. Share it with those meaningful to you."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel is set in post World War II Germany and traverses a number of different and difficult issues. In the first part of the novel, Michael Berg is taken ill in the street; Hanna Schmitz helps him and this seemingly random act of kindness changes both their lives. After this chance encounter, Michael, aged 15, embarks on a sexual affair with Hanna, aged 36. Amidst the raw physicality of this relationship, Michael reads to Hanna. And then, suddenly, Hanna leaves without warning. Michael's consequent self-doubt scars him for life.\`Often enough in my life I have done things that I have not decided to do.'Some years later, Michael encounters Hanna as she stands trial for war crimes. Can he reconcile the Hanna he knew with the woman on trial? Hanna's past and Michael's present serve to exemplify the tension between the generation who were adults during World War II and those born immediately afterwards. This novel may have been written primarily for a German audience, but the issues are universal. All actions have consequences, regardless of personal circumstance.In the third part of the novel, while Michael comes to terms with what has happened, there are still broader questions left hanging for the reader to consider: how do individuals come to terms with their pasts; and how do nations deal with their involvement in events such as the Holocaust?I did not enjoy this novel: the issues raised are uncomfortable and I found it difficult to empathise with either Hanna or Michael. And yet, I find myself still thinking about those issues, the decisions that we make as individuals, the bases on which we make them, and the consequences.\`What would you have done?'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is the story of a young man's association with an older woman. It is the story of how relationships can affect and eventually structure our lives. Michael Berg (15 y/o) meats Hanna (36 y/o) and has a short but life-changing affair with her. Years later, he is a witness to her trial for crimes commited during the Holocaust.Not for the squeamish, this book hits hard and will stay with you later. To oversimplify it, it comes down to one step affecting the next and the subsequent deterioration of moral structure.I like the way it ruminates on the mixed feelings of guilt, enlightenment, culpability and self-righteousness of Germany's second generation following the generation that perpetrated the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The question has been asked over and over about Nazi Germany. The evil of the Nazi leaders is plain enough. But what of the average, everday person? What if you were one of them? What would you have done? It is very difficult to know, such insight being particularly difficult and particularly rare.THE READER explores this question but from a different and interesting angle. Instead of focusing on Nazi Germany during the time of its existence, it removes the question by a generation. It must have been very strange to be young in Germany during the '50s and '60s. Many people not that much older than you, what exactly were they doing just a few years ago?Michael Berg, the main character here, has the type of affair at the age of 15 that every 15 year old boy dreams of. Hanna is older but still has her looks, sexy, mysterious, and is willing to teach him a few things. Then . . . she disappears. Just like that.Hanna resurfaces several years later at a trial for war crimes. Michael, a law student, attends the trial, not knowing on his first day that Hanna is one of, indeed the main, defendant. Hanna's effect on Michael left its mark after the years, with Michael reserved and distant towards others, his mind always on the girl that vanished.Hanna's trial does not go well and Michael realizes that Hanna, embarassed by a well kept secret, is not doing all that she can to defend herself. More deeply, the trial explores numerous issues, both historical and emotional. How is one to judge Hanna for the crimes she committed? That is not to say she does not bear some guilt. Clearly she does. But what is the standard? Should our inability to project ourselves with complete accuracy into a similar situation act as a mitigating factor?One characteristic of THE READER is both its strength and its weakness. Neither Michael nor Hanna is sketched out that well. As a weakness, it prevents readers from connecting with the characters as well as they might. As a strength, it allows one to view both Michael and Hanna as representatives for their respective generations. These are not merely individuals here. They are symbols of Germany's Nazi past as well as its post-war struggle to come to terms with its own actions. Well written yet a quick read, if one is thinking of reading this because one liked the movie, then by all means, read it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was a very interesting book. I saw the movie first and I had hoped that there would be more to the characters in the book. I admit that I was almost a little disappointed at how good of an adaptation the movie was from the book. There were no surprises in the book, and it was a very fast read. The book was very interesting, but something was lacking from both the film and the book - a better sense of the characters, details... just that certain something..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In Bernard Schlink's book, The Reader, the author raises serious questions about individual responsibility in relation to the Holocaust. It centers on two people, a sickly young man named Michael Berg, who, in the course of the book, grows into a middle aged man, and Hanna, a former Nazi prison guard, whom we learn later is responsible for the murder of defenseless Jewish girls and women. Berg falls hopelessly in love with Hanna when she showers him with sexual favors. As a result, Berg becomes a \\"man,\\" and, for the rest of his life, cannot shake his attachment to this woman, even after he discovers the horror of her life. When Hanna is later convicted and sent to prison for her crimes, Berg, now a law student, finds himself drawn to her trial, despite the fact that he has lost contact with her for several years.Hanna is convicted and sent to prison, but Berg cannot forget her and eventually begins to send her taped readings of literary masterpieces. Hanna welcomes the tapes, which remind her of a critical part of their early relationship. She's illiterate, but fascinated by books, though her only entre into them is through someone reading to her, hence the title of the book, The Reader. Another ripple on the title is that she required the young Jewish girls to read to her before she sent them to the gas chambers. When Berg finds out that he too was a \\"reader,\\" he feels disgust and anger that Hanna might have been using him in some twisted, perverted way.Nearly two decades later, the prison authorities decide to release Hanna and implore her former lover to help her adapt to the changed world. He consents reluctantly, apparently motivated by a sense of feelings of guilt mixed with retrospective love. On the day of her release, she commits suicide, but leaves him a note asking him to give one of the survivors of the Holocaust the money that she has saved.In a foolish, self-serving and misguided response, he brings the money to the survivor, who rejects it because she sees clearly that it is meant to purchase forgiveness both for Hanna and for Berg, who feels complicit in loving her.The book ends with a sense that Berg will have to live not only with the grief for his lost love, but with his sense that in some inexplicable way that by loving her he is in some way guilty of her crimes."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is an insightful story, written in a terse and sparing style. This tale excuses no one but brings forth the troubling issue the post war generation, in Germany, was forced to face; how to heal the nation and face the sins of their fathers. The story has at its heart the souls of two individuals, their entanglements, shame, and an aging love. No one seems to make the right decisions in this tale, which begs the question ; how do we judge rightly in these times when the circumstances of an earlier era were so different? The film, I felt was stronger than the book. The author, in my opinion, writes as if he's impatient with the deeper examinations that other writers of this era have issued themselves, but perhaps something is lost in translation.The Reader (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage International)"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink has created the most emotional inducing, emotionless book that I've ever read. In writing this novel, he purposely makes numbness a re-occurring theme. I would have never guessed that such an anesthetized-like story could be so thought provoking.The book is divided into three parts, and because I don't want to spoil the story for anybody who has not yet read it, I'll only recap pieces of part I and part II.In Part I, Michael Berg (15 years old), is seduced by Hanna Schmitz (36 years old). Their relationship consists of little emotions and a lot of sex. Their daily ritual becomes a loop of sex and Michael reading aloud to Hanna. Michael becomes torn and confused between his unusual, shameful affair and strong attraction to Hanna and his schoolwork, and school friends. He never crosses the two worlds: the Hanna World, and his, fifteen-year-old school life. When Hanna suddenly leaves with no explanation, Michael feels guilty for all the time he didn't spend with Hanna, and for all the time he did spend with his school friends.In Part II, Michael is older and attending law school. As part of a class, he is observing the trial of a group of women who served as SS guards in a camp where 300 Jewish women were killed in a fire. Michael is shocked to see Hanna there as one of the defendants.This is one of those books, where the author is exceptionally capable of telling a compelling story in so little (but expertly chosen) words. I totally recommend this 200 plus page book that can easily be read in a day or two."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was motivated to read \\"The Reader\\" after seeing the movie starring Kate Winslet and wasn't disappointed. The author did a masterful job moving from various time periods in primary character's lives. The plot focused on a young boy's first love with a woman twice his age and how their relationship developed as they grew older. Both had to deal with a horrific incident that happened during with World War 2 and it was how it was handled that made the book very sad and poignant for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is a storyteller's masterpiece, featuring Homeric similes, profound psychological insights, memorable and fully developed and motivated characters who struggle with difficult ethical dilemmas, and unforgettable vignettes of the Holocaust, all told in simple, direct, unadorned prose. It is much more complex and nuanced than the movie that it inspired, and the fact that its author is a German professor of law dealing with Teutonic generational guilt renders its success all the more stunning."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Fifteen year old Michael Berg gets sick on his way home from school one day and he is helped by Hanna Schmitz. After he's better, he goes by to thank Hanna and they embark on an affair. He sees her as often as possible and when Hanna asks Michael what he's studying in school, he begins reading to her. Their affair continues until Hanna mysteriously leaves town one day.Michael doesn't see Hanna again until he's a law student attending the trial of Nazi war criminals for a seminar he's taking. He's shocked to see Hanna is one of the female guards being tried. He attends the trial every day and slowly comes to the realization that Hanna is illiterate. While he's attending the trial, Michael thinks,\\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it. But it was too terrible for that. When I tried to understand it, I had the feeling I was failing to condemn it as it must be condemned. When I condemned it as it must be condemned, there was no room for understanding.\\"Hanna accepts more blame, and a harsher sentence because of it, rather than admit to the shame of being illiterate. After Hanna is in prison for several years, Michael starts recording books on cassette tapes and mailing them to her, because he can't get her out of his mind. After several years in prison, Hanna writes Michael and note and he says,\\"I read the note and was filled with joy and jubilation. \\"She can write, she can write!\\" In these years I had read everything I could lay my hands on to do with illiteracy. I knew about the helplessness in everyday activities, finding one's way or finding an address or choosing a meal in a restaurant, about how illiterates anxiously stick to prescribed patterns and familiar routines, about how much energy it takes to conceal one's inability to read and write, energy lost to actual living. Illiteracy is dependence.\\"Wow, The Reader by Bernhard Schlink is a book full of controversial subjects! If this book doesn't make you think, nothing will. It would make a great book club pick because there is just so much to talk about in it. First is the love affair between a minor and a grown woman. During the war trial, Michael never absolves the guards of guilt, but questions how much of the blame the society that allowed the atrocities to go on should shoulder. I was struck by how many of the choices in Hanna's life were made because of her shame in being illiterate. It made me even more thankful that I can read. This book does contain sexual situations, but I recommend it and the movie that was made from it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"If you watch the movie without reading the book you may come out with a misconception that this is not much more than a reverse Lolita. However, I read it before watching the movie. It felt like reading DH Lawrence'sSons and Lovers (Modern Library Classics)and Tolstoy'sResurrection (Penguin Classics)together. One of my many favorite passages is on page 70, without giving away the story:\\"I read her War and Peace with all of Tolstoy's disquisitions on history, great men, Russia,love and marriage;... she withheld her own opinions; she did not make Natasha, Andrei, Pierre part of her world ... but entered their world the way one sets out on a long and dazzling journey, or enters a castle which one is allowed to visit, .....We too are better off withholding our own 21st century opinions of Hanna and Michael as we take the journey together reading their story spanning 51 years, from 1944 to 1995.I am still recovering from reading The Reader. Wish Bernhard Schlink made Michael and Hanna read DH Lawrence's Man who died\\"The Man Who Died (Dodo Press)also in addition to Chekhov, Kafka, Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Keller, Goethe, Lenz, Odyssey and War and Peace. If you liked reading Balzac and the Little Chinese SeamstressBalzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress: A Novelby Dai Sijie, you may also relate better to this kind of story. This indeed is a book lover's book, pun intended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For me, The Reader was just another average love story that I read for class. Man falls in love, loses love, finds ex-lover again and falls in love again. The story, in my opinion, followed too much of a pre-set standard that has been seen in literature for years. There were a few good plot twists, and a good use of scenery, but overall I was disappointed. Another part of the novel that disappointed me was the lack of flow. The plot jumped around a lot, skipping what I felt were crucial years in the development of the protagonist. I was often baffled by the thoughts of the protagonist, and I felt that I got less out of the book because I could not see where he was coming from. The book also had a moral of sorts, and I hate morals."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink does a good job of keeping the reader, in &quot;The Reader&quot; interested from the get go. From the beginning of the novel he talks about sex. Then he craftifully transforms to the more serious topics of love, war, death, the holocost, and court room actions to name a few. The novel has everything you need in todays Hollywood movie. I am actually surprised that it has not been made yet. I also like the shorter chapters to make it seem like the book is going along fast in time. This is another way Schlimk keeps the reader involved. When I read his novel I think of Anne Frank and all her turbulations she went through. I actully think that Schlink makes reference to her in his novel during the court room chapters. I love this novel and reccomend it for not only the novice reader like myself, but for more educated readers as well."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When reading The Reader, the person reading the book is drawn into the story through the excessive use of sex, intrigue and sickness. How the author uses the vast age difference between the main charater and his &quot;lover&quot; in addition to the mode in which the two meet, leaves the audience mystified. after the intial shock, the pages begin to calm down, and things, like the main charater, micheal, grow distant yet closer still to his surroundings. As Micheal grows older and more mature, the audience, too, grows. In all, this is a very fast and easy read, any person mature and/or willing to see from a new perspective will greatly enjoy this book. The history used as a backdrop in the main plot will offer other books to be explored. Or, it will trigger the audience to discover more about the underlying subject. So, in a nut shell, I believe that I would recommend this book to all of my friends and associates to read for enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader grabbed my interest from the begining. It dealt with controversial topics but presented them in a way that made it hard to determine if they were right or wrong. The Reader covered all its bases by having sex, scandals, coming of age, love, and courtroom drama. It is easy to see how it could grab ones interest. I did, from time to time, have a hard time understanding what Micheal was feeling. He is the narrator of the story, but he tends to be quite withdrawn. Right when I started to feel like I knew him the story would skip to a later time in his life and change his character. The story seems to shift focus a couple of times, but it does come back to the torn relationship between a younger man and an older women. It shows how shame can be so strong that it could cause someone to end there own life, rather than admit to it. It is shocking at times, but can also get dull. Over all it is a good book and an easy read. It's not one of my favorites, but I would suggest to others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed The Reader because of Schlink's use of point-of-view. This novel, written in the first person, allows the reader to slip into the shoes of the characters.In places, the imagery and detail are somewhat lacking, and the reader finds him/herself a bit confused and yet unable to do anything about it. At the same time the reader sees Michael's inability to affect what's going on around him, and so the title has more significance as we relate that feeling to our own lives.It's not a difficult read, you could probably do the whole thing in one sitting. It's got sex, mystery, dirty little secrets, desire, and everything that we want to see now days."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found Schlink's book fun and easy to read. The beginning was a good attention grabber with the sex scenes and the it ended with some thoughtful insights on life. Michael, the main character, becomes fixed on a much older woman when he is young and can not seem to shake her for the rest of his life until she dies. The middle of the book was kind of boring, but necessary for the end, which I thought was well done."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel was enjoyable to read. The reason why it was so enjoyable was because it was easy to read. I liked the method in which the author employs historical context to the story. The Holocaust was a dark time in our world's history. However, Bernard Schlink makes the pain of this grim time in history, more bearable because he does not entirely base his novel on the war. This novel opens with eroticism which automatically grabs the reader's attention. But, it is not the erotic confrontations between the boy and the woman in the book that makes this novel interesting. Schlink is also able to make moral claims on the reader leaving them questioning the actions of Hanna, the 36 year old woman who has an affair with Michael Berg. In my opinion, this book was worth the time to read. One of the things that I really liked about this novel was the way in which Schlink makes the story progress through time. It is the reflection of a man who reminisces about his past from the age of fifteen to the present time. His views change as he gets older and more mature. The focus of this novel in my opinion is the story of a man growing up and ultimately realizing that one should act on his intuition and should not hold back on his feelings. If one does this, it may lead to regrets when that person passes away."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel was enjoyable to read.

What can future generations do about problems concerning the past? Should mankind forget its troubled past? All these questions come into play in The Reader. Simple and to the point, The Reader appeals to the senses by encompassing love, war and sex that finally tie into the big picture of the Holacaust itself. Shortened chapters glide the audience through the events that unfold in the story as the withdrawn hepatitis stricken boy meets the two-sided seemingly flawless older women Mrs. Schmitz who is later charged with being a member of the German war machine in the concentration camps. Schlink gets the point across when dealing with the questions that surround the concentration camps in a manner that does not need to be of your typical grotesque scenes of death and annilation. He looks at the characters and does not resort to sheer violence to describe the horror."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Although I found this book to be entertaining, the plot development was rather inconsistently done. At times I felt like the author was rushing through the story and trying to paint the pictures with as few words as possible, and at other times I felt as if the narrative got so detailed that it bogged down the storyline. Overall I felt that it was a good read, but most certainly not the outstanding piece of literature others had claimed that it was."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book to be like an English assignment. It didn't flow from section to section and the characters felt undeveloped. I was disappointed when part one simply ended with Hannah going away. The trial section was equally as blunt.

Is it worth your freedom? Does pride matter more than anything else?The Reader is above all else a love story. Michael Berg is a young man who has never been close to anyone in his life except for an older woman he meets at the age of fifteen, Hannah Schmitz. Hannah, seductive, evasive, and complicated, is full of secrets. They have a love affair, however brief, that spans and haunts Michael throughout his life. Hannah ultimately disappears from Michael's life for 8 years. When Michael finally sees her again he is a young law student and Hannah is on trial for a heinous crime.Full of eroticism and moral concepts, this story is all-encompassing, breathtaking, a book that you can't put down. The passion Michael feels for Hannah is so vividly described- the way she smelled, the way her body moved, the confidence she exuded. You feel as though you are reading a 30 year old diary of a man and the love he lost as a child. You feel for Michael, drawn into his obsessive yearning, his homesickness for a time when he felt most loved and when he most loved.Their story, Michael and Hannah's, takes you on a heartbreaking journey with lessons of pride, forgiveness, and guilt. It leaves you wanting to read it again and again. There are many moral questions and thoughts that come up from this book, some remain unanswered. The Reader is disturbing and tortuous, yet simultaneously, it stirs your heart and leaves you hopeful for the magnitude of love and compassion shown in this book. The Reader is indeed a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I loved The Reader!!! It is probably the most well written book I have ever read. The story is about love above all things, and how your first true love will effect your life. I couldn't put it down after I finished the book I went to see the movie. It followed the book so well. I would recommend both and I have to everyone I know. I can't stress how much I loved this book. I hope you choose to read this book. You be missing out if you didn't. It's a wonderful love story for the ages!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was a very moving and sad book in many parts his love for Hannah was so deep yet he couldnt really come to her defense and struggled with his own decisions. His marriage failed and he struggled with all of the decisions in his life including the marriage. In the end he seemed very shallow and reconciled to her ending her own life. His chracter was detached from the realities of life in post war Germany.At such a young age he couldnt be held responsible for what went on but could have been less detached from the cruelties and agony of the concentration camp detainees . Moved me greatly and was very sad."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The affair profoundly effected his life. We never realize how deeply we may effect someone else's life. This book was well written but overall I think it was a very sad story without a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was so beautifully written that even though the subject matter was a bit difficult, it made one hunger to read on. There was a kind of distancing in the language that made the story both plausible and bearable for the reader. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"i found the female character unredeming in the book . in the movie they softened her up a great deal"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a spare and incredibly haunting book that offers a unique reading experience. Its modulated, precise, and tightly-controlled prose sets the perfect tone in telling a story that is by turns erotic, regretful, and flat-out sombre. It is ostensibly the story of a young man who had a sordid affair with an older woman, falls in love, and the psychological shift and moral ambiguity he feels when, years later, he is privy to information that could desperately help her while on trial for crimes commited during World War II. Michael is a well-written character, and Schlink's style offers us a deep look into his mind and heart when faced with his tough decisions. The character of Hanna is almost maddeningly mysterious, and while I am sure that that is done on purpose, her inevitable fate did not ring home to me as much as I felt it should. However, this novel is a striking moral parable, and what does stick with you is the overall theme of regret and responsibility, an attempt at absolution by a society that simply did not know how to atone. This slim book is wise and fascinating."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"Why does what was beautiful suddenly shatter in hindsight because it concealed dark truths?\\" This is the essential question of Bernhard Schlink's provocative, morally complex novel, \\"The Reader.\\" The book was published in Germany in 1995 and translated into English by Carol Brown Janeway in 1997, but it has gained a new following due to the 2008 award-winning film directed by Stephen Daldry and starring Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet. While the film focuses on the difficulties subsequent generations have had coming to terms with the holocaust, the novel is also about the past in general, the way it haunts and shapes the present.I am not a fan of the new film, mostly because I read the novel first and I feel the film fails to capture the honesty, guilt and uncertainty with which the protagonist, Michael Berg, narrates. The story begins in West Germany in the 50's when Michael is fifteen and suffering from hepatitis. One day he finds himself weak, exhausted and retching outside an apartment building, and suddenly an attractive woman is escorting him up to her apartment: \\"When rescue came, it was almost an assault. The woman seized my arm and pulled me through the dark entryway into the courtyard.\\"The woman is Hanna Schmitz, a thirty-six year old tram conductress with whom he begins sleeping with after she catches him watching her get dressed. Over the next few months, they develop a routine of bathing, having sex and reading, Michael reading aloud to Hanna the classics of German literature.As the older Michael struggles to make sense of his memories, especially in terms of what he finds out about Hanna later on, he becomes reflective and questioning, seeking an understanding that continues to elude him: \\"But we were happy! Sometimes the memory of happiness cannot stay true because it ended unhappily. Because happiness is only real if it lasts forever? Because things always end painfully if they contained pain, conscious or unconscious, all along? But what is unconscious, unrecognized pain?\\"In other words, can past joy remain in tact, given present, darker truths? What if the one you loved committed a great crime you found out many years later? Does that destroy your initial love? How is memory shaped by present knowledge and circumstances?This is truly an unforgettable story of love, terror and forgiveness, one that is directly and lyrically told and anything but easy to forget."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"We read this book for my bookclub and had one of the best discussions we've ever had. It is a quick read, it pulls you in. Interesting on more that one level - as novel and as history."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was artfully and eloquently written. The author's use of simple language to express complex human emotions in Post WWII Germany is rather refreshing. There is a simple twist to the book that one might not expect, but the book does not go much in the way of suspense or even drama for that matter. It's a nice quick read for those blue rainy days at home when one reclines next to a window with fruit, tea, and chocolate...or not. However your preferred ambiance it's a nice read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked this up in the airport not knowing that it was the basis for an Oscar-nominated best picture movie. I'm usually not that oblivious. Right after I purchased it, my husband said \\"ew, that's a creepy book.\\" I wondered what I was getting into.Bottom line, I finished the book during my two flights. It was an easy, fast read. There was time between the flights, during dinner, and at the end of the night to discuss the book with my family. Early on my son asked me who is the antagonist, and is it man vs man, or man vs society, or something else. My answers to his questions evolved as I read the book, but that's all that evolved.The book is three parts -- the affair, the trial, later in life. There was little if anything that changed about \\"the kid\\" from the first page of part 2 to the end of the book. Perhaps that lack of change is a reflection of the damage done to his psyche due to the affair. That's a lot of pages to read to show his lack of development. Hanna is just as undeveloped and essentially unchanging over time. Yes, she eventually learns to read and write, but no interesting communications or insights are forth-coming from this skill. Overall, a very unfulfilling read. I was happy to be done with the book, so I could share the end with my family, and let them know the characters never really changed nor came to any great revelations.The only redeeming aspects of the read that led to a bit of interesting family discussion were the two questions broached. 1.) What standards do you apply to war criminals, the current law, law at the time, law as it was enforced at the time, etc. 2.) What is your moral duty to help someone when they'd rather succumb to harm than accept help.Bottom line -- not worth my time. Yet again I've stumbled across something that I found out later was an Oprah Pick, and yet again I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When Michael was fifteen, he began an affair with a middle-aged woman named Hanna. They shared little beyond the physical relationship; she was not a talker or a thinker as he was, but she did seem to enjoy it when he read to her. One day she disappeared without a word, only to surface years later when she was on trial for crimes against humanity.The writing style of this book is similar to Albert Camus'The Stranger, where the main character narrates the events of his life without passion or judgement, in a dulled, distant, vacant voice. The first half of the book is fairly interesting with his steamy but unemotional affair with this mysterious and oddly callous woman. I had to force myself to finish the second half, though, which explains her disappearance, trial, and the next eighteen years, because the monotone narration got really old and boring.It felt like the author was trying to be shocking and profound with his detached storytelling, but I was not impressed. This would have made a very interesting short story, but I found it a tedious book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is not a fun book, and there is no happy or easy resolution. It is also carefully structured to establish the dilemma of postwar Germany coming to terms with the Nazis. The main character is symbolic of Germany. He falls ill and is saved by a mysterious woman, Hanna. He returns to thank her and is both attracted and terrified of her. They become lovers and he struggles to manage Hanna's swings from sensual caring to vicious cruelty. She then vanishes and he moves on with his life, only for her to reappear as a former Nazi on trial for war crimes. He struggles to come to terms with this, but in fact never really does. The trial exposes the corruption and hypocrisy of the accusers, whose self-righteousness conceals their own complicity. Finally, many years later he must deal with her continued existence and his inability to come to terms with their shared past.This is a difficult and thought provoking book. Literally very simple, but metaphorically very complex. It gives no easy answer to the questions it raises, and that of course is its intention. Two things it is not are Nazi rivisionism or a Holocaust story. It deals with Germany's attempts to come to terms with its past and the scars that linger. Devastating, a must read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found 'The Reader' to be very addictive and quick. Before I knew it, I was well into the book. While the story is on some levels possibly disturbing, I found the overall effect to be more thought provoking. The writing is very economical and to the point. It conjures up images and feelings of love and lost and insecurity and wonder that everyone can relate to and grasp. In all it is a sombering tale of human nature that sticks in your head well after you've put the book down. I enjoyed it very very much."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book's concept is good, BUT the story does not develop. The characters are not developed and the more importantly the story does not develop well. You don't care about Hanna because you really don't know who she is. I couldn't understand why the narrator so tirelessly obsesses over this girl when we the reader has not had an opportunity to sympathesize for either of them."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book mainly because for my english class, we had to pick a book about an author who was not from the United States. But once i started it, i was not sure how i has exactly supposed to write a report on it. For those of you who have read the book, you know what I mean. I had no idea that the book would turn into what it is. The person reading the book is provided with minimal information at the start of the book, and that makes you want to turn the pages. then, once it actually goes to the storyline, the book is a very thought provoking read. What a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Boy, the first part was bad. All about this teenage boy'ssexual awakening in the most clich&eacute;d terms. But in the 2nd part of thebook, when Hannah is being tried for Nazi war crimes, she explains that they were all under Hitler's orders and they themselves would have been killed if the orders weren't carried out. Then she turns to the judge and asks the crucial question of the book, &quot;What would you have done?&quot; And he has no answer for her. I think the people who said this book was about how terrible the Holocaust was, or how hard it is to love someone who has done something terrible, or how a boy's first love is never forgotten, all missed the point."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story of Michael Berg and Hanna Schmit comes across as erotic and at the same time as being a violation of a young man's body. The fifteen year old boy, Michael Berg, meets Hanna as he gets sick. She helps him get back to health and after another meeting, Hanna seduces him like a female adult teacher seduces her young male students. With the rise of these kinds of relationships, this book should not be encouraged to be read in high school at all. There are other books out there on other subjects that can be replaced and I am an English teacher so I wouldn't suggest putting this book on the high or middle school reading list.Hanna's actions are legally and morally wrong and that's the end. The author tries to rationalize Hanna's motives but there are other problems. Hanna's life is never clearly explained especially how she ended up as Nazi SS Guard during World War II at such a young age of 21 years old. Hanna's secret is so obvious that it's not shocking. But the story is simply about two people despite their age who truly alone in society. Michael's illness prevented him from really associating with his peers. Hanna comes across as work focused as a streetcar conductress who has the job of checking out tickets. She likes the uniform and the simple power of it all. The foreshadowing into her past comes later as Michael sees her in the courtroom facing her war crimes. This is why I can't give this book more than three stars. I find that Hanna is never fleshed out or explained in her life. Was Hanna abused herself, neglected, abandoned, rejected, etc.? I have read hundreds of true crime books searching for the answers as to what criminals like Hanna come from and evolve. The book is an easy read.While I will get comments regarding my suggestion and insistence that this novel not be on a reading list for middle or high school students is because of the relationship between a 36 year old woman and 15 year old boy. The schools don't need to encourage this kind of relationship among teachers and students."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts. The first part of the book deals with that encounter.While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. They even go away on a trip together. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials. The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war, had tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity, as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna. He stoically remains throughout the trial, realizing as he hears the evidence that she is refusing to divulge the one piece of evidence that could possibly absolve her or, at least, mitigate her complicity in the crimes with which she is charged. It is as if she considers her secret, more shameful than that of which she is accused. Yet, Michael, too, remains mute on the one salient fact that would throw her legal, if not her moral, guilt into question. Consequently, Hanna finds herself bearing the legal guilt of all those involved in the crime of which she is accused and is condemned accordingly.The third part of the book is really the way Michael deals with having found Hanna, again. He removes himself from further demonstration and discussion on the issue of Germany's Nazi past. It affects his decisions as to his career in the law, eventually choosing a legal career that is isolating. He marries and has a child but finds that he cannot be free of Hanna. He cannot be free of the pain of having loved Hanna. It is as if Hanna has marked him for life. He divorces and never remarries. It is as if he cannot love another, as he loved Hanna. Michael then reaches out to Hanna in prison, indirectly, through the secret they share of what she seems to be most ashamed. Yet, he carefully never personalizes the contact. The end, when it comes, is almost anti-climatic.The relationship between Michael and Hanna really seems to be analogous to the relationship between the generations of Germans in post-war Germany. The affair between Michael and Hanna is representational of the affair that Germany had with the Nazi movement. The eroticism of the book is a necessary component for the collective guilt and shame that the Germans bear for the Holocaust, as well as for the moral divide that seemingly exists between the generations. Yet, the book also shows that such is not always a black and white issue, that there are sometimes gray areas when one discusses one's actions in the context of the forces of good and evil. There is also the issue of legal and moral responsibility. One would think that the two are synonymous, but they are not always so. It also philosophizes on the ability to love another/a nation who/that was complicit in war crimes. This is an insightful, allegorical book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I finished reading the book within four hours,fast and no pause.when it covered the last word,my brain went to a totally blank state.I found my eyes cannot focused on,my fingers stirred.I found another thing from the man which was much horrible than nazi,and it was not only existed in the main character.It destoryed everything."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader written by Bernhard Schlink is a historical fiction book about a young boy that falls in love with a woman who is double his age. When the story starts it explains how the main character, Michael Berg, meets a middle aged women when she helped him when he was sick one day. Once Michael is better he goes back to thank the women, Hanna, and from that moment on his life is never the same. Michael falls in love with Hanna and her womanly confidence but one day she oddly vanishes. Despite his efforts to move on, Hanna is always on the back of Michael's mind until one day when she randomly reappears.I would reccomend this book to someone that likes a story with twists. The story is short and very well written, it is an easy read. I liked that the book was based on historical events. The Reader is a love story with a wicked twist that you never even see coming."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Since the first selection I read from the Oprah Book Club was so awesome, (A Virtuous Woman), I decided to add all of them to my TBR list. The Oprah stamp of approval is pretty much the only reason I picked up this book, however that stamp of approval is starting to mean much less because I really did not like this book. The only thing keeping me from giving it one star is the fact that talent gleams randomly throughout the pages. The author is really fabulous at capturing and describing moments and emotions that most people experience. (My favorite passage is a paragraph that starts on pg. 38. In it he discusses how awkward he felt growing up and how he had such hope that one day he would be confident and successful. He had all of these unfulfilled big dreams which he sees reflected in the faces of the youth around him. That hope saddens him because he knows that very rarely does life fulfill and exceed your expectations.)I enjoyed Mr. Schlink's writing very much, but this novel left me feeling empty. There was no hope to be found. Everyone's life had fallen to pieces. I hate feeling empty, like all the light and hope have been sucked dry. Therefore this novel will receive a 2/5 stars.I really love the cover of this novel. It's simple yet incredibly inviting. I think it connects to the tale in a few ways. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is complex, especially for a fifteen-year-old. He fulfills multiple needs in Hanna's life, but it seems to me that his needs cannot even begin to be fulfilled by her. She's emotionally vacant. The book and the flowers show the roles Michael plays in Hanna's life. It's saddens me that she is so flat and so checked out of life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"3.5 starsWell, I don't know where to start. This book is short but heavy. Not heavy in terms of weight but heavy in terms of emotions that it carries. With a postwar Germany as its background, what did you expect?The book starts on a lighter note with a 15 year old boy who happens to meet a woman. And then there's no looking back.The book takes you on a journey so unique in itself that you find yourself pondering on it. I got confused a couple of times during the reading and had to re-read what it was about. The book is mysterious, I think I can call it that.The secrets spill out one by one and everything changes. I don't want to spill the premise or what happens afterward, so I'm at a loss of what to write.In all, this book made me think a lot. I don't think there's one answer to anything in this book. It will make you agree and disagree with your own thoughts. It will make you want to change things. It will make you emotional and you will speculate to no end.This will make a wonderful book for a book club. I wish I had someone to discuss it out loud with, this is one of that kind.I think I loved this one but then again, I'm not sure. LOL! I will have to re-read it sometime soon. I think I will watch the movie too."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Interesting read, well written although lost momentum 3/4 way in, then picked up.

For me, this was a new way to view the Holocaust, and so the story was very interesting. However, it's not the type of book I generally enjoy, so this is the only reason I gave it a lower rating. I think it's a very well written and thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In post-WWII Germany, 15-year-old Michael Berg gets mysteriously and violently ill in the street on his way home from school. An older woman, Hanna, helps him get cleaned up and offers to walk him home. She has to change before they go. There's this weird scene where she's unselfconsciously pulling up her stockings, which makes Michael feel all weird and he takes off running like a weirdo.After this encounter, Hanna is all he can think about. So he goes back to her house with flowers to thank her for her kindness (i.e. see if he can get in her pants). Low and behold Hanna has no morals and bags the 15-year-old. They begin a semi-pornographic love affair (I mean, have you seen the movie??).So, why is it called The Reader? Well, Hanna asks Michael to read to her every time they see each other. It's their *thing*One day Hanna disappears and Michael is all emo and treats people like crap because his heart is shattered and blames her for his inability to feel anything about anything. He gets married, has a kid, gets divorced, etc. It's exhausting.When he's in law school, he runs into her during the war criminal trials in Germany. Hanna is on trial for her part in a mass murder of Jewish women during one of the death marches. Michael feels so many mixed emotions about her trial. He's angry at her for leaving him, and he's sad for her because he doesn't think that she ever did anything maliciously-for her, it was just a job.Then comes this philosophical monologue about how the German youth feel extremely out of place and guilty and accusatory of their parents' generation. It's a very interesting look at German sentiments post WWII. I once had an exchange student from Germany and when ever someone said something like \\"that teacher is being such a Nazi about that stupid homework assignment,\\" she would take personal offense. I never really understood why, so thanks Mr. Schlink for clearing that up.Anyway, Hanna goes to jail for life in order to protect a secret and Michael figures out the secret during the trial, but he doesn't help her. While she's in jail he reads into a tape recorder and sends her these tapes. I don't want to ruin it, so I'll leave off here, but the ending is so tragic and leaves you feeling confused like YOU INSANE PERSON! WHY WOULD YOU GO TO JAIL FOR LIFE TO PROTECT THAT SECRET? and like I THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT YOU LOVED HER. WHY ARE YOU BEING RUDE, FOOL!I really liked this book though. Read it in like a day."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader by Bernard Schlink is set after World War II and begins with fifteen-year-old Michael Berg becoming ill with hepatitis. He is found by a woman, cleaned up, then sent home. That woman is Hanna Schmitz. He returns to her home, and they soon begin a passionate love affair that will affect him the rest of his life. Their affair lasts the duration of a summer, and then, inexplicably, she disappears from his life. Approximately eight to ten years later, she reappears when he is observing a trial; Hanna is under investigation.I found this book to be very simply written and a pretty quick read. There was no over-embellishment and nothing flowery about Mr. Schlink's writing, which I appreciated. Because of the simplicity of his writing, I felt that the emotions in the book were not way-layed by excessive description. Everything pertained to the story.However, because of the way the story is written, I feel that it undertones the crimes that Hanna is accused of, thereby dulling the severity of her actions involving the Holocaust. I felt that the trial section of The Reader was shallow and unconvincing.I feel that Hanna's illiteracy is a metaphor for the Third Reich's lack of morals. She is almost a representative of the German people for being unable to \\"read\\" the signs of the mass murders being committed essentially in their name. Her Nazism, like many other Germans of the time, was not intentional.The Reader also comes off as an anti-illiteracy campaign; imagine how much different Hanna's life would be if she were able to read.... all of the choices she made pertaining to her future were because of her inability to read.I enjoyed the story and the writing, but the issues involved in the story seemed so glibly written that I cannot give Mr. Schlink's The Reader any more than 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Any published work that causes the reader to connect the context of the book to their own situation and/or experiences, deserves notice.The Reader will be relevant to the next generation of students as it was to the protagonist, Michael. Perhaps even more relevant to new readers who discover this book by way of the movie as I did.The book is worth passing along to those whom you respect, admire and care for."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernard Schlink's novel The Reader is a brilliantly insightful journey through multi-layered thoughts and feelings, some of which are heart-felt and real, some of which are socially prescribed pretense, and some of which are confused and confusing and can't be confidently categorized. There is love, sex, shame, guilt, uncertainty, pride, pain, duty, willful indifference, and uncontrolled longing, more than enough of each to cover a multitude of lifetimes. All this is experienced by two seemingly unexceptional people from different social strata, Michael Berg and Hannah Schmitz.Their lives became interwoven wholly by accident on a street in Post-World War II Germany when Michael, ill with undiagnosed hepatitis, vomited, and Hanna, for no compelling reason helped him clean up before going home. From this inauspicious beginning, fifteen year old Michal and Hanna, twenty-one years his senior, developed a passionate sexual relationship that filled Michael's consciousness with unqualified devotion and provided the substance of his dreams.Since the story is narrated by Michael, we can only make tentative inferences, as he does, about the effect of the love affair on Hanna. She demonstrably enjoyed the sex, taking charge at first but sometimes yielding control to Michael. On a few occasions when Hanna mistook Michael's misreading of situations as bespeaking neglect, rejection, or insufficient interest she was outraged. Perhaps her anger and hysterical weeping were prompted by nothing more than overweening pride. But the duration of their relationship, the frequency and intensity of their encounters, and the comfortably stimulating glow that illuminated their few public appearances together suggest that Hanna, in her own way, loved Michael as unreservedly as she could afford to love anyone.The author's rendering of Michael's adoration of every aspect of Hanna's physical being, and his understanding of a longing so deep that it was all-consuming, are so skillfully rendered as to be achingly palpable. Treating Michael's feelings as manifestations of commonplace animal lust or pop psych accounts of adolescent hormones would be ugly and profane. Instead, we find thoroughgoing hunger, the kind that made even touching Hanna's hand or smelling her hair painfully arousing and at the same time transiently fulfilling, though Michael could never be sated.For reasons that he didn't understand until much later, when Michael was in his last year of secondary school the affair ended. He blamed himself for an unintended slight that he suspected was rightly seen as a split-second denial of fidelity. Seeking protection from being hurt again, he found a way to maintain emotional neutrality regarding all people and events. He still functioned intellectually, completing secondary school and his university studies, and becoming a capable researcher, employed to study legal history. As an historian of the law he hoped to find direction and closure for lives properly lived, but he was asking too much.In time, however, Michael was, indeed, overtaken by the past. Not his past, not the past of the Enlightenment that he found so hopeful in his research, but Germany's Nazi past, and efforts made by people and institutions to come to terms with its horrors. Whether or not these attempts at absolution were made in good faith seemed irrelevant. They were carried along by taken-for-granted tides of history, making perfunctory amends for Germany's unprecedented sins.Without warning and in a way that was impossible to foresee, Michael's legal research became wrought up in the ongoing effort to attain national absolution and brought him once again face to face with Hanna. With his detached internal demeanor he recognized feelings that he thought he should have but didn't. Perhaps Michael's visceral indifference paralleled that of prison camp guards who had dutifully and with detachment done their jobs in the Nazi concentration camps, without malice, without feeling of any sort. At the same time, Hanna was aware of Michael's presence but disengaged and unresponsive.As the story develops, the meaning of the title, The Reader, becomes clear. The co-mingling of pride, vulnerability, loss, confusion, and love is both illuminating and painful to behold. The author masterfully illustrates accidents, strengths, frailties, and happenstance borne of a unique set of circumstances that inexorably determined the courses of two lives.The movie version of The Reader does not begin to do justice to the novel. It would be difficult, indeed, to capture on film the shifting emotional makeup and interior lives of Michael and Hanna. The Reader is a brilliant novel, a modern tragedy whose author has a remarkable talent for presenting the lives of complex and troubled people in a difficult world."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed the book and I will always carry some of Schlink's questions with me. I have to admit that I never considered the second generation of Germans after the Holocaust and how difficult their position is (was). A quick read.

This aspect was barely touched."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is an excellent example of modern literature.

Also, I had read another Oprah book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I decided that perhaps Oprah and I had the same taste for books, what I like to call life books. While I adored &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; by Wally Lamb and am enjoying what I've read so far of &quot;Jewel&quot; by Bret Lott, this books seems to have left me asking too many questions. I feel as if I don't have closure. While there were some beautifully written passages and clever word usage, I really think this book could have ended after Hanna left him for the army. It wouldn't have had much point then, but at least it wouldn't have rambled on for the next hundred passages. I felt as if the author had much to say, but wasn't really able to say it eloquently or articularly. While it did leave me with some deep thoughts about the Holocaust and made me once again think about this awful tragedy, I feel something was lacking in the writing. I felt almost as if the author wasn't able to really identify with the tragedy, or if he was he couldn't really put into words or portray what he was really feeling. All in all, it was an okay book, but definitely not as good or as well-written as Miss Winfrey's other choices. =) =)"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I would like to have comment on a point that was debated in a book discussion recently. One of our members, a teacher, said that Hanna had a learning disorder and, therefore, could not read nor write. Another in the group disagreed and said that Hanna had never been taught to read. I would like to hear back from others with their opinions."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Like many others I read the brief plot on the back of this book and could not wait to find out Hanna's great secret, but once inside the novel I was dissapointed with how much he developed this horrible secret. Then a day after reading it, I realized the horrible secret isn't the one he tells you but its the one the author doesn't tell you. You really can't see it unless you step into the character's and realize that Hanna's true secret was who her character really was and how she felt. I was very disappointed at the abrupt ending of the character Hanna. I think the author could have developed it more."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"read this book, it is haunting, it is beautiful and it is very very harsh....the author and the translator have tackled one of history's most delicate themes very very deftly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When I first picked up this book, I thought it would be an engaging story about a woman with a dark secret and a boy struggling to find his sexual identity. Was I wrong! This book is deceptive, in that it promises an engaging story but does not deliver. I was glad that I borrowed the audio tapes, becasue Campbell Scott's great voice kept me listening. I am not sure that I would have finished the novel otherwise. Oprah, please pick some more uplifing novels next year! I understand your choices of books that are supposed to make you think, but not put you to sleep."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Easily understandable but lacked emotional depth almost as if the author only allowed himself to feel a certain amount of anguish and angst in his recant."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Beautifully written book. Compelling characters. Simple stark language. It's an Escher drawing - Hannah as prison guard denying her prisoners freedom and life; the narrator as prison guard denying Hannah her freedom and life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A very strange story of a very unlikely couple. I liked Hanna for about 30 seconds when she helped the very young Michael up onto his feet after he had fallen ill. But I felt that here was a very DARK woman even before I knew her past. She was tragic as were her deeds. I just could not understand Michael's passion for this woman. The book was well written, well developed characters, but a very sad story for both of these two people."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found &quot;The Reader&quot; to be a wonderful surprise story. I didn't like Hanna but I learned a lot about what it meant to be German during WWII. I agree with the reviewer who said that her inability to read was of course obvious, indeed that was not the &quot;big secret&quot; of the story. I enhjoyed this book much, much more than Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I loved the book. Reading this book makes one take a serious look into their heart.A rape is committed, yet this book is not about sex, love or rejection. It deals with highly charged emotional and practical issues which is often difficult to understand or analize."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked the book up one morning and refused to move until finished. Many of you believed this was a tale of obsession and sex between a young boy and his neighbor. On the contrary it has much to do with our need to make our lovers fill a void in us and at the same time, how we all have a desire to &quot;fix&quot; our lovers. The author did a beautiful job relating this love affair between Michael and Hanna. Face it, in every relationship one of us is the enigma, and the other one is the detective. As far as the issues brought forth with the disscussion of the Holocaust and Nazis. The author gives you Hanna, makes you wonder about her, long for her, fantasize about her, and then sets forth the shocking truth of her past. Now, try and hate her, and condem her. Hard isn't it, yet we would never admit that , am I correct. I read this book months ago and I am still unable to release it from my memory. Definately a Thinker, and a book made for the reader. All of us will come away with something different, yet all of it provacitive."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book within the span of a few days even while I was working. I normally do not like historical fiction, but this book came very highly recommended. The book is enjoyable and deep...no, it is not about sex and longing. Not at all. It is much more than that and really leads you to think. The ending is somewhat surprising and yet somewhat predictable. Just depends on how much you read. The author really develops the &quot;kid&quot; and you see how he struggles to grow and come to terms with &quot;Hanna&quot;. A question of obligation? Perhaps. If you are not sure about the &quot;Oprah&quot; books...just try this one. It is enchanting!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Thought this was a great book. The writer took on a difficult topic and managed to come out with a realistic story that didn't have the typical happy ending. (Sorry guys, it doesn't always happen). Maybe if you thought it so boring, you should go back to your romance novels, where there is no thinking involved."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is definatly worth reading. It starts out very intersting with the hot love affair, which keeps you turning the pages. The middle did get somewhat boring, but things picked up again towards the end. The ending was vey unexpected!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found the story well written. Every word, every sentence never made me feel it didn't belong. The book flowed very smoothly and had a rythym. It was also the type of book that left you thinking thats it? That was all there was? Unfortunately it wasn't a story I could put myself into, I didn't sympathize with the characters, infact I disliked them. The boy was obviously infatuated with Hanna, I got the impression that there was nothing else to the relationship then that. Hanna no more felt for the &quot;kid&quot; then you would for a house plant you were obligated to water every day. She got her pleasure from him and he read to her which she could not do for herself. Other than that the relationship was entirely in his mind. They both got something out of it, but what they got were two completely different things. She had her fun with him, and he red her books she could never have read. He felt he was in a mature relationship and convinced himself it was love. Once again beautifully written but I felt no sympathy for the relationship, or the characters."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In ordinary society there is no such thing as the realtionship that occured between the characters. This book completely lost it from the get go. With a lack of interest I forced myself to finish this composition. The whole plot of the book was way to overwhelming with too much action for the short period it took to read. A mistake on the authors part lead to a boring read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book has the basic outline of a great novel/story. Unfortunately, it reads to me as a manuscript. Unfinished, and unexpanded. The story could have been developed more. The author didn't delve deeply enough into the characters or history. I was very disappointed by what should have been a great novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What if you fell in love with someone and later discovered that your lover had been a Nazi years ago. Would you still love her? Perhaps this is the idea behind Bernard Schlink's 1995 international bestseller The Reader.In The Reader, Schlink presents a story that is only shocking in its attempt at nazi sympathy. A sexual relationship between a willing 15-year old boy and an older woman is not news today or yesterday. What disturbs me is the basic premise of the story. Are we to feel sympathy for this woman simply because she's illiterate? Does her ignorance somehow lessen her crime? Does being illiterate explain her inhumanity, her ignorance of evil? Not guilty by reason of illiteracy?It's easy to believe that Hitler's ranks were filled with illiterates and miscreants. The idea that an illiterate woman kept the delicate, sickly girls from being gassed at Auschwitz to read to her (until she was through with them) isn't far-fetched. Disgusting, yes. Surprising, no. Hanna's illiteracy and her attempts to conceal it make her brutality no less inhumane; if anything, it makes her worse because she's as proud as she is cruel. She has no remorse about her actions. But she's prideful enough to hide what she finds shameful-not that she's a cold-blooded killer, but that she can't read. Outrageous.Schlink's language typifies the German stereotype-stark, austere, harsh. What's interesting is the philosophical questions he poses and his thought processes as he tries to think his way through a problem to the best conclusion. But what is \\"best\\" based on, other than man's own system of values? Isn't that what Hannah obeyed? In her case, it's generally agreed that those values were of a madman. When the protagonist wrestles with philosophical issues, he goes to his father, a philosopher by profession. He comes away with no insights and no answers. In the end, the story neatly concludes itself, and doesn't answer any moral questions.The Reader is thinly veiled nazi sympathy, and that is ultimately the most shocking thing about Schlink's novel. Schlink knew his case was indefensible; hence, the brevity of the novel. If there were some deeper point he was attempting to make, it must have gotten lost in translation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The reader was a very good book w/ a lot of socking parts. I would recomend it to anyone who likes romance with a twist."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have not read the book yet but have seen the movie. I anticipate a great story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am a senior in high school and an avid reader. The first half of this book was enjoyable, but then it just got plain boring. Maybe it is my age or lack of interest, but I just ended up skimming the end because I wasn't about to give the time to finish it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When I first picked this book up, I thought this would be a real thought-provoking novel about the Holocaust. I was very disappointed and could not wait until I finished it so I move on to something more enjoyable. I thought the book lacked character development. What was worse, was the ending which left me feeling very unsettled. Even if I enjoyed this novel and wanted to recommend it, I would be too embarrased because of the sleazy relationship between the woman and the boy half her age."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This has to be the worst recommendation for a book I have ever had"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found myself skimming through much of &quot;The Reader&quot; just to finish the book.It was wrong of Hanna to take advantage of a young Michael. That whole scene disgusted me.The trial was dragged out and boring.I didn't feel for any of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"for starters, I didn't finish this book, if you could call it a book. it read like an upscale version of something from penthouse letters. it was thinly disguised pornography, and trying to pretend to be literary. also, it struck me that the seduction of the boy by the woman (that boy did not seduce her, that much I know!, he was just a child), was not presented in a way that I felt would have made it genuinely good fiction, or non-fiction for that matter. what really irked me was that it was presented in a titillating fashion, all about her grabbing his @#$%, etc., which I felt was entirely unnecessary, and in fact, led the reader quite astray.I felt the author had some need of his own to present child sexual abuse in a light that made it look not disturbing, and while many adolescent boys have or have had fantasies of sexual interactions with full-grown women, by no means would or could or does ANYTHING positive come about in the long run from their fantasies being fulfilled by becoming reality. it just messes children and adolescents up...so as far as I'm concerned, any book that makes sexual abuse of a child (let's call it by its true name) titillating or racy or exciting for an audience gets only one star in my book. I wish I could give it &quot;no stars&quot;..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"If we really live in a world of true equality, then all the people who love this book should love the book of a male ex-SS soldier with no regrets for the atrocities he committed who commits statutory rape on a 15 year old girl before deserting her, leaving her miserable. Imagine the western world's response to that book, and then you have some idea of the gender fascism which rules the show there. I have respect for people who would like both books equally. But all others should seriously think about what has lead them to believe that men's crimes are worse than women's, that is, what has made them into sexual bigots."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"While our book club was divided in the evaluation of The Reader, it generated important discussions focussed on the nature of guilt and redemption, the ammorality of Hanna, the interesting structure of the novel and the connection between literacy and the opportunity to reflect on personal and social actions. The various responses seemed to be determined by whether or not we were able to make personal or intellectual connections with the text, or whether we were satisfied that a text could open doors to new experiences. The most rewarding discussions arose from the author's portrayal of Hanna's illiteracy, there seemed to be a nexus between literacy and the capacity to reflect on human experience. Essentially The Reader is a reflection on the nature of post war German experience in the light of the Holocaust. The main character Michael comments at the end of the book, &quot;At first I wanted to write our story to be free of it.&quot; But in the end he concludes, &quot;I've made peace with it.&quot; This is the power of reading and the power of book clubs to explore the ideas we can overlook in our reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is a powerful portrayal of good and evil and the moral dilemmas facing post World War II Germany. It also forced us to examine our own personal moral values and concepts of evil. However,in my opinion, it would have been more meaningful if Michael had focused his concern and assistance on a survivor of the Holocaust rather on one of the perpetrators. Hannah voluntarily chose to join the SS and commit heinous crimes.The fact that she was more ashamed of her illiteracy than of her criminal activity only emphasized her pathology.Millions of innocent people died at the hands of individuals like Hannah. I sincerely hope that the author did not intend to white-wash that fact."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found &quot;The Reader&quot; to be a powerful,fascinating and disturbing book. The moral issues were very well presented. However, it seemed to me that there was a hint of an apology, an overly sympa- thetic attempt to explain away criminal behavior. the proposed notion that Hanna chose not to fight for her so-called &quot;innocence&quot; did not sit well with me. WHAT INNOCENCE! Hanna chose to join the SS. Hanna chose to allow the church full of women prisoners to burn to death. Illiteracy does not create criminal pathology. In our efforts to understand the criminal mind, we must not forget the eleven million people who perished nor in any way trivialize the enormity of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As I come to the end of this novel, which was easily devoured over a few short days, I am overwhelmed by the saddness I feel over the loss of innocence, the loss of love, the loss of faith, and the distance and numbness one can feel when looking back at a history that they did not create, but will have to bear the burden of for all their days. I cried for Michael, I cried for Hannah, I cried for Germany."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a novel that should be required reading for anybody who wants to learn about the German side of the Holocoust. Although the narrative didn't quite flow at times, Mr. Schlink's moral considerations are worth everything in the novel. The end of the novel is perhaps the saddest I've read in quite a long time, but it teaches a valuable lesson and brings some hope. It would be interesting to see a movie based on this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Great descriptions. Resonated deeply with my own life. Great story.This wasn't so much a book about war, or jews, or germans, but about the human condition. Why do we do things we know are wrong? How do we live with the concequences afterward?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I actually just got done with the German version of the book--I'm studying for Ph.D. in German right now--but I like it enough to get my wife an English language version, and some basic comparisons show that the translator stayed close to the original. I'm Jewish, so I get the question a lot asking me how I feel about learning the language of a people that worked pretty damned hard to get rid of my people. I usually say that it's a generational thing, that today's German's just aren't the same as their father's germans, any more than we Americans were the ones who held slaves. It's a different mindset, a different Weltanschauung. Someday our descendants may wonder how we living today ever enslaved sensitive, feeling beings... our pets! Who knows. Michael and Hanna stand on opposite cusps of the Teutonic generations; she did what she did not because of her special issues, but because she is, unapologetically, who she is and was during the Nazi times. I saw her as emblematic of the old; Michael is painfully young, then painfully desensitized as he grows, but he still couldn't do what she did. Thank god. World Wars aren't fun."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a deceptive story which leaves echoes, questions, perhaps doubt in one's mind long after the last page is turned.The style of translation slides along so well that it is hard to remember that it is from the German original. I wanted to have more, yet had there been more, it would have ruined that which we were priviledged to share."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink is a lawyer and a practicing judge but he also is a man who knows the intricacy of human nature and behavior.The book can be divided in two parts and te firt could be a short story by itself. It is a boy's dream which is over when the object of his love suddenly dissapear. In the second part we find that Hanna had two secrets and we realized how a person can be good and bad at the same time and how an uneducated person can love good literaturae and appreciatte Tolstoy.There are some literary references such as Emilia Galotti that I would like to investigate. An excellent book , well written and full of psychological insight."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink's prose is sparse yet evocative. There are just enough (and not too many) details to allow us to imagine the scenes. The major moral question, which re-occurs in each section, is &quot;What would you have done?&quot; That ever-present, hovering, issue is smaller and larger than it first appears. It is smaller because it could be said to apply only to those characters under the novel's novel circumstances. It is also a small issue when we think of the horrendous immoral behavior done to the Jewish vistims. It is larger, because the issue really applies to each and every one, all, of the German people, in effect showing what each did or did not do as effector or seeming bystander."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Another typical Oprah type book, regular snore which I couldn't even finish...I didn't see the point, as there was nothing captivating about this book at all. The characters and prose were dead as a door nail! So I went to the libray and returned it unfinished for a new book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found the concept superficial. Small book but didn't hold my interest even for that short amount of time. No depth to the story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was completely disappointed with the story, and all aspects with it. The characters were mediocre at best, and the storyline was soooo boring! I did not see any point in finishing the book, but did just so I could give it the benefit of the doubt. I should have dropped it when I had the chance, then I would not have felt so depressed at the end. If you want a good Oprah book read Where the Heart it, by Billie Letts, and you will not at all be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book because of the attention that it received from Oprah. I cannot believe how much they went on about this book. I found it very boring and lost my interest right from the beginning. Because of what I heard on Oprah I kept reading hoping it would get better but it did not."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I bought this book, hoping for a good read, but I definitely did not get that. It did not keep my attention; I didn't feel connected with the characters; I feel like I wasted my money on this one. The author assumes that the reader knows all about the Holocaust, making it difficult to understand to the person, like me, who was never taught the Holocaust in school. I very rarely come across a book that I feel so negatively about, but this is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I felt very disgusted that I used my hard earned money for this. Who picked this book? Who wants to read about a woman having a fling with a young boy. I feel that a better book could have been chosen."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It was boring. It was easy to guess the secret. It wasn't gripping. I only finished it because it was our bookclub choice. 6 out of 6 of us thought it was awful. I read Sesame Street stories to my 3 year old son that have a better plot."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read the book mostly because so many people were saying things about how offensive the affair between the 15 yr. old and the 36 yr. old were. I thought there had to be something of more merit than just a meaningless sexual encounter. But, in the end, I felt that this was graphic and meaningless. The characters were lifeless and seemed to have no value systems. They had no connection to each other or the world around them. It was rather sad and pathetic. I finished it, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am a thoughtful, avid and intelligent reader who does not watch daytime talk shows. I found this book boring, offensive and pointless. Don't be bullied into thinking that you are not intelligent if you do not like this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was easy to read, but it was sort of boring. I only finished it because I bought it.I've been reading Oprah's pick since &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot;, and they have been good for the exception of &quot;Jewel&quot; and &quot;The Reader&quot;."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is thought-provoking. It's an easy read; can be done in 2 nights. You won't be able to put it down. I really enjoyed it. The author raises many social issues while interjecting the reality of human emotion. This is the 1st Oprah Book Club pick that I have read, &amp; I'm looking forward to reading others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink brings the reader to the moral fibers of the human soul, the soul of Hanna. Obviously, Hanna was a prisoner of her own burden, illiteracy, which guided her moral compass in the path she took. That path brought her to make &quot;prisons&quot; for others, especially the seduction of the young man, Michael. Even more complex are her burdens of her SS past which makes her tragic in the horrific actions she placed upon others. Complex, but simple. Mr. Schlink has created one of the best novels of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There must be a Hanna in each of our lives in some way, whether she is the lover, the love lost, or the misunderstood. This book brings together so many different ideas--first love, social issues, moral issues, history. The story told here is too real to not be true, too possible to not be real. Though it is a quick and simple read, the messages it contains are profound and will last much longer than it takes to read the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"a must rea"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink touches on a subject most Americans are sheltered from in our own post Vietnam crisis. He has provided an awareness and an avenue of questioning. When Michael reflects on sadness, or happiness and the shattering of it, and recounts conversations with his father he reavels a writing style and opportunity for reflection for the reader, not commonly found in fiction. Cybertoe obviously has quite an interest in Oprah's picks, or he wouldn't be wasting our time with such drivel. For the educated reader, this book provides thought provking entertainment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Wish that I hadn't wasted my time reading this book...too many good books out there."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Normally while reading a book you are drawn into the characters and sympathize with at least one of them. These character were badly written, you felt that even at the end of the book you knew nothing about them. And the trial, which I suppose was supposed to be the pivotal point in the novel, came from so far out in left field and with no explanation or logic. I felt let down after reading this, especially after all the praise Oprah had given it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have read many books about the Holocaust and certainly rate this among the best. I found it simultaneously gripping, thought-provoking and moving."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked up The Reader from a local bookstore yesterday and finished it late last night. I was moved by the story and found the themes of love, morality, and honesty universal. There were so many layers in this novel that I was amazed that he could relate so much in such a short read. He is very blunt and to the point, which made it an easy read, but the subject matter gave it a depth that astounded me. His style reminded me of Albert Camu because his discriptions were real and beautiful without being over-discriptive, but it exuded a dark optimism that is difficult to express."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The spare prose in The Reader is off-putting at first, but then takes on its own rhythm and that rhythm, ultimately, works. The book raises a lot of interesting questions about the nature of love, and of what it is that one human being may owe to another, and I think these questions &quot;work&quot; precisely because of that spare style. Also, because of that style, certain simple sentences have the weight of a ton of bricks. There are many sentences that I clearly remember even weeks after finishing this book.It was ultimately flawed for me, however, because it seems to be trying to make an apology for Hanna's participation in the Holocaust, as if to say, &quot;Gee, if not for this, then that would have never happened.&quot; I couldn't buy into that and it bothers me that many people possibly are. I am not a watcher of Oprah, but it made me wonder what her position is on that aspect of the book. Might she also wish us to believe that the perpetrators of slavery were really okay guys, just misunderstood? I doubt it.Nevertheless, it was a worthwhile book and a provocative read. I was hesitant to read it at first because of the love affair between the boy and the woman (a turnoff as a topic, but possibly autobiographical?), but I was ultimately glad I read it. I am pretty sure it would be a good bookclub book for there is much here to discuss."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As an amateur WWII historian, I couldn't wait to get home and begin this book. Like many other reviewers on this site, I read it in one session. I was disappointed in the book overall. Although the initial parts are interesting, the book loses steam toward the end and just piddles out to a close. The character of Hanna felt more like a paper doll than a flesh and blood character. After the trial begins the main character also loses some depth. Having said that, I did NOT dislike the book. It was entertaining to read if a little shallow at times. I'm a little disappointed in Oprah, because usually her book choices offer a little human insight. Maybe some meaning was simply lost in the translation; as often happens from such a rich language as German."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The cutting images and provocative use of the words &quot;and&quot; and &quot;the&quot; and even &quot;on&quot; were so original that the only literature they brought to mind was the excellent series of early novellas &quot;For the Love of Lee&quot; written by former &quot;Paterno Prize&quot; Winner Phyllis Barrack. To me, there is no higher praise. You must read this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I couldn't put this book down! It's very easy to read, and yet it's an extremely powerful and evocative story. I couldn't help but wonder if it's semi-autobiographical Mr Schlink?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Upon receiving this book as a Christmas gift, I was unsure of what to expect. It didn't sound like a book I'd normally read, but over the holidays boredom set in, so I picked up the book. Was it ever a pleasant surprise! The events that took place were surprising, yet interesting and attention-getting. The book presented a good picture of post-war Germany. I couldn't put it down I was so glued to the pages! A good read!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I sat down in the cafe at Borders last night and read this book from start to finish. It hit me on so many levels and the translation is really good. I highly recommend this one--much more hard-hitting than many other of Oprah's selections (and written from a male point of view for a change!)"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was shocked to learn that Oprah had recommended this novel. I read this book last year and I think of it often. Disregard the &quot;bad&quot; reviews and check this book out!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Once I started reading, I could not put it down. The author describes the complex relationship between Michael and Hanna in such a way you can almost tell what they are thinking and why. A different book that makes you think for a long time after you have finished it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in one night. I thought that there was going to be a climax of sorts; that something amazing or unexpected would happen; nothing did. I didn't like the way the author portrayed the characters. I thought that the beginning of The Reader was good, but I didn't enjoy the ending."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have noticed some of the reviews below complaining about not being able to fully empathize with the main character; that he seemed distant and shallow. I think that that is exactly the point of this book; He himself (the person we are &quot;hearing&quot; from) cannot express a fullness of emotion. He experienced such a crushing sense of numbness over the whole ordeal, with all of its past and present implications, that in writing about it, he exhibits a detached, almost exhausted, sensiblity.The part that impacted me the most was during the trial, when Hanna says to the judge, &quot;Well, what would you have done?&quot; . It made me ask myself that question. We, who have never stood in the icy snow in a flustered panic as a church burns to the ground, should not be so quick to blame."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"sorry but im not going to write a 1000 words but it was a good enough book to write that much. i found his a affair with hanna thrilling. the age along was just wow ! well i dont want to give anything away from this book you must read it though!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I can't help but wonder if this book lost something in translation from German to English, and I can't believe Oprah Winfrey endorsed it. A friend lent me this book, and I am glad she did, otherwise, I would have been very upset if I paid money for it. First of all, the storyline is flat, and that was a big disappointment, because the premise of the book was great, I think Schlink could have done alot more with the idea. I also found the characters to be shallow and one-dimensional, especially Hanna. Michael, on the other hand, irritated me after only a few pages, he is completely narcissistic, self-centered and self-absorbed. As for the \\"secret\\" hinted at on the back cover?? The \\"big secret\\" was pathetic, I figured it out WAY before the author disclosed it. But the ending was the biggest let down, just when you think the novel might have a redeeming quality, that Hanna and Michael might be able to resolve some of their issues, you are slapped in the face.I would not recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this accidentally. If I had known it was an Oprah book, I would have stayed away from it, but as it were, the copy that my sister had was without the telltale sticker. I finished it in one day, so the only positive thing I can see is that it's a quick read.The plot is silly, the writing (perhaps the translation?) is poor, and the characters are entirely unsympathetic. The narrator is despicably self-aware, and every action and word in the book is over-analyzed to the point where the one conclusion I was able to draw myself is that I made a bad decision at the bookshelf. There are so many wonderful and beautiful books out there -- please don't waste your time on this."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Speedy Shipping, Fast and Great Service. Will look to use again for my book buying needs."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is a surprisingly easy read, while still thought provoking. Schlink is very effective in his choice of detail and scene, and employs descriptions of nature almost as a unifier.Unstated until the very last chapter, and then surprisingly by the Holocaust survivor, is whether Michael's affair at age 15 stunted his emotional life, whether in fact he was a victim of child abuse, what in the US would be a crime (statutory rape). The book does not provide enough of a picture of Michael's character before the affair to be sure, but we do know that his father was emotionally stunted, and that his family life was not a warm one.Incidentally, I think I may actually have enjoyed the book more for having seen the movie some time ago, and my wife agrees."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss about this book is. It's a little better than mediocre. It does read very fast though and would make for a good read on an airplane or over a summer weekend. It's not a book that will stick with me for any amount of time however..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Something odd about this novel - I felt an uneasy distance between the narrating character and the events he narrates despite the fact that he is, theoretically, intimately involved in these events.The title confused me. A title generally points to the main character or the most significant theme. However, the ambiguity of this title and its referent is complicated by the fact that I'm not sure who is the main character: the narrator or the woman he writes about.The events span the time from adolescence to middle age of the narrator yet his voice and perspective remain the same. Maybe he is just not very bright and lacks the ability to look back on his younger self. Or maybe it is to do with the translation.And I had problems with the treatment of time. I had to flick back to work out when events happened in relation to each other."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book, I thought was well written.

It's really, really, good! So good that I bought it as a gift for someone."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The beginning of this book was quite interesting. A relationship developed between the adolescent boy & the 30something Hanna. But as time goes on, he moves on with his life, which is nothing to speak of, really.

I wouldn't reccomend any of Oprah's books. It's very poorly written. The worst $15 I ever spent."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Nobody would read it. I found the plot quite slow and boring. I wonder how much Bernie and Carol paid Oprah to recommend this book. I will no longer read her selections because it's obvious that she's getting paid to pick this slop. The main characters are shallow, and I didn't believe them. I would have been better off watching Springer!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was written by Bernhard Schlink. The story is about a 15 year old boywho falls in love with a much older woman. In a confusing way they stay in love for awhile until Hanna, the older woman, suddenly disappears one day. Michael, the youngboy, must return to his life as an adolescent and forget his days of showering and makinglove with Hanna. The next time Michael sees Hanna is during a trial. Michael finds outHanna's past, which he never knew of, and finds out more about Hanna than he everknew.The reader targets teenagers and adults. Both genders can indulge in this book.The Reader is an uncomfortable story of how a young man falls in love. The confusingpart is how he is in love. Hanna is described as big and old, not a character one can easilyfall for. Many young males lust for older woman, but they are attracted to good lookingwoman. As a child you don't want to be in love with someone that isn't described asbeautiful, which Hanna isn't. The Reader gives the message that love is boring. Hannaand Michael fall easily into love. But it does not seem as if Hanna is in love withMichael. Hanna still treats Michael like a fifteen year old. Every day the two continue todo the same activities. Michael and Hanna will read together, take a shower, and makelove. After pages of these activities love and sex become very boring.I did not like this book. It makes a reader feel uncomfortable about sex, anduncomfortable about love. The Reader is a boring novel which shows love to besomething that it isn't. Hanna's odd and quiet character is boring. She has all thisbackround but none of it seems to matter after Michael and Hanna part.The Reader is supposed to excited people and express feelings that others hideaway. Michael did not hide his feelings towards Hanna. In our society an uffair like this isnot accepted. Michael and Hanna showed us why this affair should not be accepted.Bernhard Schlink tried to show love had its backround. Lust was more than just a feeling.He did his job as an author getting across that love is hard work. The Reader neither madeyou feel happy in the end, nor sad. It left you with a very queasy feeling like youshouldn't have read it. The Reader was a confusing portray of a young boy trying to findlove in the wrong place."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought the &quot;surprise&quot; toward the end was quite obvious from the very beginning and really not that intriguing. I also have a hard time empathizing with either character."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have to say that I am extremely disappointed...in the criticalreviews that I read for this book. It is not well written, thecharacters are flat and lack any real development, and the story lineis completely predictable. Over and over I found myself wondering whythe author kept asking rhetorical questions of the reader throught themain character. As an author it is his job to supply this sort ofinformation to the reader, to develop the thought processes of hischaracters beyond mere questioning to conclusive ideas. That was justmy first problem with the novel. Perhaps as a result of all therhetorical questions, his characters lacked any sort of development.Often I found myself wondering why I should sympathize with any ofthem. I realized that the reason I felt no sympathy was simplybecause I did not know them. The author failed to paint a vividpicture of either of them. He failed to let me into their world or tohelp me experience what they were experiencing. Finally, the storywas completely predictable. It was obvious that she was illiteratefrom the beginning when she asked him to read to her. This was herhorrible secret that she would die for? And this is what we were keptin suspence during the whole novel for? I was very disappointed. Itseemed so contrived. Beyond that, the romance was tawdry and smackedof Harlequin Romance. It seemed extremely cheap, the fantasy of anolder man looking back on his youth, not the tender love that twoadults might feel for one another. Once again, I am shocked to hearreviews call this book &quot;deep,&quot; &quot;evocative,&quot; and soforth. Read this again people, look at his style, or lack thereof andreevaluate. Perhaps something was lost in the translation, but thisbook was horrible."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found The Reader to be unusually trite and effortlessly transparent. Apparently, the reasons for us to even care about this story get lost in the translation about 40 pages into the plot. The novel is but a pathetic attempt to shock the audience of readers into a page turning frenzy. However, it doesn't work. The plot is so apparent that within the first 75 pages you will find yourself belaboringly turning each page, just waiting for the author to admit truths that you've known for at least 40 pages. Unless you just have a dull afternoon to waste, don't bother! Instead, may I suggest that root canal that you've been putting off? I'm sure it will prove to be far more entertaining than this novel. I wish someone had warned me before I wasted my time. It's the last time I'll ever listen to Oprah!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Once I started it I finished it merely on principle. I thought the story was flat and lacked development and interaction between characters. It could have been so much more. There was absolutely no spark to this story. I think that too many of Oprah's book choices are zoomed up the best seller list strictly because of her name and not for the enjoyment factor of the story. I think this choice really misses the mark."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"the book was more hype than anything else. a trite representation of a young man's affair and an illiterate woman who took advantage of everyone she could. another example of the minimalization of the importance of the holocaust."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. The writing is of such poor caliber, it could have been authored by a grade school child. It is totally devoid of emotion and character development. The writer lacks the ability to portray the emotions of a child experiencing his first sexual encounter with a woman more than twice his age, from lust to excitement through satisfaction and guilt. There is no sense of outrage felt by the reader as to the actions of Hanna and how she must have psychologically affected him. He also manages to completely trivialize the horror of the Holocaust and glosses over the effect of this terror on an entire country and the shame that still burdens it. The reader almost feels empathy for Hanna, as if the lack of education could ever possibly be an excuse for her undescribable crime against humanity. The sole surviving Holocaust victim is almost portrayed as hardened, unforgiving and uncharitable, and that was described in about two paragraphs in total. The book was so shallow I had a difficult time reading it, but I forced myself as this was the first book I have ever read that was recommended by Oprah Winfrey. I agree with the customer who likened this book to &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;. If you liked that book, you'll like this one. If you loved Pat Conroy's &quot;Prince of Tides&quot; or Alice Water's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, you will be sorely disappointed in this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was an extremely disappointing book. Not only were the characters flat and undeveloped, the plot was trite and contrived. Had the author spent less time asking one rhetorical question after another, and more time giving life to his characters, perhaps it would have been a better read. Instead he forces the readers to cover huge gaps in characterization because he is too busy trying to be philosphical. Not only that, but the story line is predictable from the beginning. It is obvious what Hannah is struggling with fromt the word go. And then to find out that that is her horrible secret, the thing that is going to send her to her grave in silence? Give me a break! I might have been able to sympathize with her, might, but because she lacks any depth as a character I cannot. Who is Hannah and what are her motives? A question that the author was too busy asking to answer. However, the worst part is the &quot;romance&quot; between the young boy and a woman over twice his age. It sounds like the fantasy of an adult man, looking back on his youth, not the beautiful reality of a loving adult relationship. It was extremely inappropriate. Had the roles been reversed, readers everywhere would have been screaming about the inappropriate nature of an older man with a minor, and yet review after review called this relationship &quot;beautiful.&quot; I think disturbing is the word we are all looking for. I find it insulting to my intelligence that Oprah Winfrey recommends a novel, tells everyone how wonderful, powerful, moving and all that garbage, it is, and yet it turns out to be a flat attempt at trying to evoke emotion through a poorly written, base story. Just because a celebrity says a book (or anything else, for that matter) is good, doesn't make it good. Don't bother picking this one up. What a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"yay! another amazing (yeah right?!?!) book that operah &quot;recommends&quot; to be good. stay away from this bad writing! should get 0 stars, but there is no option for it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I teach a high school modern novel course, and it's become kind of a tradition for the students in my class and I to make a pilgrimage to Borders and to select, as our last novel together, a book I've never read. When I think back to that amazing pile of books we abandoned for THE READER, I feel heartsick. There was a faction in our class who wanted to read a vampire novel called I AM LEGEND, and I, wanting something perhaps a little more literary, backed the group pulling for THE READER. How I wish we had opted for the undead. This is surely one of the most manipultive and poorly written novels I've ever read. Even my high school students knew it was a dramatic step down from the novels we had read so far in class (CUCKOO'S NEST, POISONWOOD BIBLE, SULA, TIME'S ARROW, ect). There are whole chapters that read like bad essays or banal journal entries. The &quot;climax,&quot; a court trial, is referred to rather than shown. The voice of the narrator is generic, as is his depiction of the woman he meets at 15 and then again 20 years later. We found ourselves poking fun at the sentences rather than discussing the characters. Our public consciousness regarding the Holocaust is so specific and layered (thanks to other better novels and to SCHINDLER'S LIST) that anything less seems like a horrible affront to the reader and to the victims of the tragedy. This is the second &quot;Oprah novel&quot; I've read that suggests, Toni Morrison and Jane Hamilton aside, that her literary tastes are flagging."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was an awesome book. I couldn't lay it down. And I will never do another one of these reviews!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is Interesting holocaust story that moves very quickly. Gives you lots to ponder. Not as depressing as I expected."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The tragedy surrounding the characters was touching. Although I am sensitive to the holocaust issue, I felt extreme sympathy towards the female character, and through her, all like her--males or females. The Eros was there, and there was an wholesome honesty and humanity in that whole aspect of eros used in the story.In a way, this book has something to say about a trend in German intellectual mind, at least about a segment of it.I have yet to see the movie, and am pondering if I should or not.If you have already seen the movie, you may have a different expectations.As for being convoluted, I suspect it has to do with the translation--not necessarily a fault of translator, but something gets lost in translation, always. Some lines or paragraphs I had to reread to get the drift or the sense. The story telling was good despite that. One can easily visualize the scenes as a black-white film.I recommend it. Three and half stars would be best, but I saw the writer's interview with Charlie Rose and Amazon does not allow three and half. So four star it is. It does not deserve less than 3.5 stars, possibly more in your judgment. Give it a go."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was not what I expected. The setting could really be anywhere under any circumstances, because what is comes down to is a coming of age story and the persistent self doubt that we all experience throughout our lives. Did we make the right decisions? How could our lives have been different? Are we the best version of ourselves that we can be? That being said, I really didn't enjoy this book. It's short, written in memoir style, and I feel like it examined everything in a very superficial way. The focus of the book is apparently supposed to be how the next generation deals with the reality of the Holocaust, how the various perpetrators and bystanders should be treated, and what we do with the history we've been dealt. The Amazon.com review says, \\"What does it mean to love those people--parents, grandparents, even lovers--who committed the worst atrocities the world has ever known?\\" But the book never addresses this problem. Michael Berg, the main character, skims over his own family's possible involvement and when faced head on with the fact that his lover was complicit in the murder of several women on a march from Auschwitz, he never displays any emotion one way or the other as to how he feels about it. Instead, he takes pity on her because she's illiterate and devotes a good deal of time making sure she's comfortable for the duration of her life. I do think this is quality work - the writing and translation is almost poetic. I just don't think the actual intention and message is conveyed well."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found the book offerd a unique glimpse of some areas of the Holocaust, but the characters within the story come across as detached and with no emotional depth. Both Hanna and Michael seem like cardboard cutouts, and just totally disconnected. I think because of this, I was never invested in either of them and the anticipated 'love story' of the first chapter falls totally flat. Also the callous unemotional way Hanna behaves towards her young lover lets you know she is clearly broken, and a tregedy is yet to come. Her sudden departure was almost a given, as to me they never bonded in any real way. I also realised Hanna was probably illiterate from the start, so the big revealing 'secret' was a non-event."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a great idea -- a young man is seduced by an older woman who turns out to have a terrible wartime secret -- but it falls hopelessly flat on the page. Schlink\`s language is lifeless (he writes like a professor of law) and it therefore fails to rise from the paper and enthuse the reader. In part this may be the translation, but in part it\`s because he keeps telling us he feels numb and can\`t understand the significance of what is going on. After the third or fourth time the narrator tells us the events have left him frozen I\`m thinking \\"If you can\`t be bothered to tell me how you feel, why should I care?\\" There is no drama here, even at the height of the tale, and the narrator -- who is not interesting enough to hold our attention -- keeps leading us down philosophical side roads which turn out to involve lots of words and not much deeper meaning. Schlink can\`t make the book work as a thriller and also fails to bring alive the other obvious side of the tale, which is how Germans dealt with (or failed to deal with) the aftermath of the war. Was it an abomination they should be ashamed of, or was it an unfortunate event perpetrated by their parents and other adults, who were still largely running Germany decades after the war? Schlink does touch upon this theme but it strikes me that because he was writing for a German audience, he perhaps felt he didn\`t need to spell out the dilemma which would be so familiar for domestic readers. I don\`t think it\`s any coincidence he went on to write a (turgid) book about Germany and its war guilt."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is giving me a lot to think about. There are so many levels: Michael and Hanna's relationship (as the mother of a teenage son, I do NOT approve), WWII and the Nazis, and philosophical thoughts on human nature.

Short book, read it in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Depressing but captivating story!but quite honestly by the end of the book,there were times when I just wanted to shake the man and say dude just get over it!!!In the movie has a beautiful woman depicts the character in the book, that is not being true to the real story of the book!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was an interesting book, although there were parts of it, dealing with the trial, that went on and on to the point where I thought I wouldn't be able to finish the book - but I am glad I perservered.

Although I have to admit, since I have a child that age, I had a hard time with the age difference at first, but it got to the point where I was so wrapped up with the characters the eventually I forgot all about the age difference. This is a book about your first love, and how those memories linger through your life time. The book was very touching and as you read about the couple, how their relationship suddenly and mysteriously ended, and how eventually they rediscover again. It is about the realization that sometimes you fall in love with someone that you know absolutely nothing about...and that people aren't always who they appear to be.

This is not, I don't think, the main theme.

I first read it in a Spanish translation, then found out it was a book club selection and ordered it in English. I suspect the writing was better in German, but wholeheartedly recommend it nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was unlike any other I've read. It was an easy read and kept my attention. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Reading this work, I had the feeling that Schlink had come up with several reasonably good ideas for short stories, but then unwisely decided to knit them together into a novel. The trouble is, they don't assemble well. The result is a contrived, stiff and disconnected effort, with the whole adding up to less than the sum of its parts. A failure, though briefly, here and there, an interesting failure."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink wonderfully introduces the reader to real characters. While reading this book (parts during my street-car commute) I felt as if the characters could be my streetcar driver. My neighbor. Schlink uses a seemingly unsual story to make us realize what we as humans ar capable of doing and how we as human often make mistakes when appraising others. Despite these horrid capabilities and sad mistakes we befriend each other, love each other, and need each other. The dilemma comes when we are forced (or feel forced) to justify one end of this spectrum with the other.I was surprised by some of the negative reviews of this book.For those who called it flat: I read &quot;The Reader&quot; in the original language (German: Der Vorleser) and must say that it was quite well written.When reviewing this book, several people noted their distaste for the relationship between a teen boy and an older woman. My retort to this is simple: it happens. The appropriateness of the relationship is not addressed directly by the author; Schlink does, however, acknowledge that this relationship at a formative point in the boy's live clearly affects his future relationships."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael Berg is confronted with unspeakable Nazi war crimes his former lover, more than twice his age when he became involved with her as a teenager, is accused of committing. Now an adult completing law school, he attends her trial as a student observing courtroom law. Powerfully effective is the question that Hanna, a former SS guard, puts to the judge inn response to his pinning her down regarding her responsibility in selecting prisoners to be sent back to their certain death at Auschwitz. She demands, \\"I...I mean...so what would you have done?\\" Can the reader render inconsequential the war time obligation to obey orders of authorities and superiors, a refusal of which could result in being put to death? Presented from Hanna's perspective that her actions were job related (guarding the many women prisoners locked in a village church) the question when posed the next time, \\"What would you have done?\\", is haunting. Hanna's testimony suggests that she and the other female SS guards didn't unlock the burning church for fear of personal consequences should the prisoners escape. By not acting, the guards caused the death of all but two of the women locked inside. But what of those bystanders, the villagers at the scene who didn't dare to challenge the five women guards? How did their inaction answer the question, \\"What would you have done?\\" The answer, cowardly or calculated, forever clinging to their consciences is, \\"Nothing\\". And is my answer a resounding, emphatic insistance that I would have acted to save the prisoners regardless of inevitable execution for defying the state, for failing to allow the SS to\\"do their job\\"? Am I too cowardly ,calculated or coldly careless to openly oppose murderous antisemitism? If so, my answer to Hanna's question, \\"What would you have done?\\" is the same shameful answer given by so many ordinary folks in the Nazi party, German army, concentration camps, German government bureaucracy, persons living beside Germany's railroad tracks, persons nearby the Jewish ghettos......all those \\"just plain folks\\" choosing not to become involved. My answer, unless I'm willing to risk my life, is the same answer that allowed wartime Germany's horrific atrocities to continue unchecked. If I am truthful, my answer is also, \\"Nothing\\"."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have never read a book which made me cry as much as this book. I have also never read such close depiction of what one feels in love. I recommand that everyone reads this book. It's powerful."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One of the merits of good writing is to be thought provoking. This is the case with this clean, simply-prose novel that touches on a very sensitive topic, one of moral and ethical content. Following the steps of Primo Levi, the author deals with the issue of collective guilt from the point of view of the perpetrator, the German nation and the horrors of WWII. How is one generation to deal with the atrocities of the previous generation?Michael Berg, a young adolescent has his first romantic affair with Hanna Schmitz, a mysterious woman several years older. Seven years later Michael will reencounter Hanna in a court room where she is been accused of war crimes. Faced with the most unexpected, Michael has to cope not only with his disappointment but also with the dilemma of understanding or condemnation: if he is to understand Hanna's past he has to pardon the perpetrators and condemnation is out of the question. Hanna herself inflicts self-punishment by refusing evidence that would substantially reduce her sentence.This ia a novel of psychological complexity and a parallel to human guilt and atonement. Needless to say, the German example can be easily extended to similar events in history, to cite the ex-Yugoslavia war trials presently taking place in The Hague. Bernhard Schlink brilliantly transports the reader into the core of a contemporary issue over which much has been said but little has been written about. Congratulations!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in one day.

I was intrigued and destined to find out what was to become of the relationship Mr. Schlink evokes between the young boy, Michael and Hannah. This book is without a doubt, unforgettable and keeps you wanting more. Bernhard Schlink has a simple way with words. Instead of reminding us how tragic and devastating war can be. He leads us to this visual rendering of love, passion, betrayl, history, regret, and life lasting memories."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Light reading; attempts to sympathize with unwilling Holocaust perpetrators. The movie industry and news media have not been sympathetic to unwilling German participants, and there must have been many. Heck, I didn't think there were any!The book does capture the narrator's struggle with his own self-imposed standards. He is obsessed with Anna.

The writing was flat and 2-dimensional; it failed to involve me. The characters the same. They had no depth, no qualities to make me care about them or what happened to them. The \\"love\\" relationship was worse than superficial; it was manipulative and cold. It was all described in a distant sort of way; nothing was \\"shown.\\" I never felt I was pulled into a scene, into a character's feelings, or into any of the described emotions. I couldn't wait to reach the last page and get on to a great book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Amongst many excerpts of reviews that precede the novel is one by heavyweight intellectual supremo George Steiner, who says \`the reviewer's sole and privileged function is to say as loudly as he is able \\"read this\\" and read it again\\"'My sole and privileged function is to say \\"Don't bother reading it once.\\"Here's the story. The narrator remembers back to when he was 15 and had an affair with an older woman, Hanna, a tram conductress. Lucky boy. But then she disappears. Later he finds out she's on trial for war crimes. She had been a concentration camp guard. She and some other guards had locked 500 prisoners in a church, and didn't let them out when the church caught fire because they couldn't find the key. She gets sent down. Some years later she tops herself in the slammer, although she was due to be released. Was she guilty? I don't care.During their affair, the narrator used to read books to Hanna, and later he finds out that she's illiterate. While she's in the clink, he records books onto audio tape for her, although she's learned to read and write. So what.Maybe the story had potential, but in Schlink's hands it's dull, uninvolving and clumsily written. Perhaps part of the fault for the poor writing style lies with the translator, but she can't be blamed for the lack of characterisation, narrative drive or tension, the dead dialogue, the totally ungripping trial scenes, the tedious sentences and redundant clauses, and the narrator's irritating habit of asking daft rhetorical questions at every opportunity.If the book has any interesting ideas about love, the Holocaust or Germany's guilt, I didn't spot them.On the positive side, it's only 207 pages long and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"First of all, this is not a \\"touching love story.\\" This is the story of a 15-year-old boy and his raging hormones who becomes sexually invovled with a 36-year-old woman. The woman manipulates him physically and emotionally. The boy becomes obsessed with her; this obsession lasts until her death, and beyond. Very sick, very sad.As you most likely know from reading other reviews, it turns out that the woman, Hanna, is a Nazi war criminal. One who left a bunch of Jewish women locked in a burning building to die. Because if they all stampeded out in panic, how could she possibly control them? And anyway, they were on their way to be killed, so what's the difference? During her trial, she asks the judge, in all honesty, \\"what would you have done?\\" She clearly has no concept of what she has done. And you have the feeling she would do the exact same thing if she had it to do over again.In spite of all of this, the boy, now a man who has divorced his wife because she's not enough like Hanna (read: Not Hanna) soothes his former lover during her well-deserved time in prison by sending her cassettes of him, reading books to her. Because, you see, she's illiterate. Yes, this is the huge, shameful secret she's been hiding. Not that she stood up to be counted with the Nazis. Not that she helped to kill who-knows-how-many Jewish women. She can't read or write. Big deal.Aside from a slightly interesting bit about how the post-Third Reich generation of Germans might feel guilty (as well they might) this book reads like one long excuse for those who were \\"only following orders.\\" Completely disgusting."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"THE READER has been billed as everything from a holocaust story to a love story. It has been touted as a \\"must read\\" and has appeared on the LA Times Book of the Year list, as well as being an Oprah selection. (Being selected by Oprah should have been a dead give-away.....I have yet to like anything she selects).At any rate, one would think that this story of the relationship (both emotional and sexual) between a fifteen year old boy and a 40 year old woman played out against the aftermath of the Holocaust would present a compelling read, but if these were your expectations then you, like I, would be sadly disappointed.The lovers don't really share anything remotely related to love, Hannah is secretive and remote and as a couple the two protagonists are distant and unsympathetic (almost appearing as observers in their own lives rather that participants). The courtroom scenes are bland, and the final revelation of \\"Hannah's secret\\" is an almost laughable \\"sin\\" when compared to the horrors of the concentration camps.This is one of those \\"what is it\\" stories. Is it supposed to be the story of a country's collective guilt, a coming of age tale, a crusade for literacy, or just the mundane tale of a basically self-absorbed, insensitive woman and an impressionable young boy? Whatever the author intended, all that comes across is a bland recitation of dates, times, facts and suppositions which fail to engage the reader.How Hollywood ever chose this monochromatic book as appropriate fodder for a movie is beyond me. If it were possible to give this book less than one star, I would."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I received the book very timely and was very pleased with it. I have seen the advertisements for the movie which say it is very sexual. Although the book had full descriptions of the sexual scenes, my interest was about the holocaust experience. It was amazing to see how she manipulated him into reading to her without his ever knowing she could not read. It was a great book with a surprising ending."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story, presented more or less convincingly, is a means of grappling with the larger questions of crime and punishment as they relate to people who personally experienced Germany's Hitler regime and to the postwar generation that tries to understand it retrospectively. The reader quickly finds that old assumptions regarding victims and perpetrators have to be questioned, at least suspended, to come to terms with that ever pressing question: &quot;How could this happen?&quot; Unwillingness to follow the author along this route will only leave the reader irritated, realizing perhaps that this unwillingness may be grounded in unacknowledged prejudice. Those who will follow the author may learn that some human conflicts are too traumatic to ever be resolved, but that love may overcome hate in trying to understand. Given the mostly singular perspective offered by today's media in the representation of World War II events, this is a refreshing book that should not be missed by anyone trying to fathom the more extreme diminsions of the human soul."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A searing novel of guilt and responsibility, The Reader has the relentless pace and stunning power of The Triumph and the Glory, unforgettable characters rivalling any in any of Oprah's recommended novels, and the vivid imagery of Cold Mountain. Thought-provoking, stark, yet fulfilling, this is a must-read novel for anyone with a conscience."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Having been fascinated with modern Germany throughout my life, this book literally left me in tears. Most reviews see the book on a surface level. That of a story of a young German in the late 1950's falling in love with a beautiful, older blonde, 36 year old Hanna, whom in Part 2 of the book we find out shockingly was a 21 year old SS Guard during the last two years of WWII.Not knowing what you now know above, but being very sensitive myself to modern Germany, and the feeling of modern Germany and its contrast with the older Nazi period and the feelings that entailed, I became aware that \\"Hanna\\" was more than the \\"girlfriend\\" of young Michael Berg in the book, she was an allegory for the feelings many many Germans felt for the period itself. The deep love affair that Germany had with Nazism and the ultimate realisation of the newer generation of what happened in the past is mirrored in the book.The book stands as it is. Although non fiction it states the case \\"as is\\". To me it is clearly anti-Nazi, although that does not mean that it does not appreciate the affair that Germans have and had with their national psyche and their past.The first clue that the author gives us that Hanna does represent the \\"old\\" Germany is the description of the apartment block she lives in. Then the way she seduces him...(just the way many Germans perceive that the \\"movement\\" grabbed Germany itself) and the ending and her sudden disappearance (just like the Nazi regime came to a sudden end).This book is about the deep murmurings of the German soul. And its search for forgiveness, for answers, and the suicide of Hanna and the small donation she left behind signifying the sorry state that represents the resolution of the problem for Germany in the years since the war.Namely that the war does and will continue to knaw at the German soul. That it is impossible to really reconcile what happened. That, as Schlink so clearly states that films like Schindlers List drive open the reality of what happened in a way that even many people involved could not appreciate at the time, and it makes salient points about the feelings, repressed and otherwise that Germany and Germans carry with them to this day.Had Germany won the war, an ex SS man noted on a documentary I was watching the other day, no one would have been writing all this up as so terrible - just the price of war on the eastern front. After all, it is the victor who usually gets to write the history of the event.And in all this lies the brilliance of the book. On the one hand it extends out the hand of understanding and sympathy (not forgiveness) to a people, regime and phenomenon of a time corrupted by a force of evil that and who's consequences were so terrible that they continue to invade and pervade the nation of Germany to this very day.In a sense the reality of the limited atonement and bewilderment of a nation defeated and shamed but once proud and in a sense still proud feels. The juxtaposition might lead one to see the book as having Nazi sympathies, but I think not. It is rather a presentation of the factsAn affair of an entire nation with a movement that existed and a time that came and went with a generation that has for the most part now died but whom in the 1950's were still very much part of German life.At the end of the book Mark arranges a holiday to go off with Hanna again, but she commits suicide just before her release from prison. This is after she has read, understood and atoned.This to me signifies closure and the death of the movement. Its about moving on. And yet the reality of the book conveys that there can be no simple closure and that some things are always there...."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Fifteen year-old Michael Berg contracts hepatitis and is helped home after vomiting in the street by Hanna Schmitz. She is beautiful and she seems to possess a strength of purpose that Michael lacks. Though Hanna is more than twice his age, Michael falls in love with her. The exquisite economy of author Berhard Schlink's style draws you in to the love affair between Michael and Hanna, framing all with the sight, sound, smell, taste and feel of life. Secrets both innocent and horrible abound in this book. Michael and Hanna meet years after their affair in a courtroom where Hanna is being tried for a terrible crime. You may think for a time to yourself, ah!, this is what I would, or wouldn't, have done. But as is true in life, and underscored in this marvelous book, good and evil have fuzzy edges. The Reader is a book of mirrors: horror and joy, compassion and cruelty, often intermingling. You won't avoid seeing yourself here. Words like atonement, epiphany, and forgiveness come to life in this book- and hope. The book is a classic to be read and studied for years to come. Carol Brown Janeway's translation is masterful."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am a slow, methodical reader. For me to sit down and consume an entire novel in \\"one go\\" is something that is quite rare, but that is exactly what happened yesterday with The Reader.It is a testament to the writer's ability to keep me entranced and involved with the story that once I started, I could not stop.The Reader is a first person narration of the life, from fifteen years onward, of one Michael Berg, in post-war Germany. As a fifteen year old he meets the vivacious 36-year old Frau Schmitz (Hanna), and he will never be the same.Everything about her affects him for a lifetime, in ways that he could never have imagined.In short pithy chapters and an economic style that never bogs down, Schlink separates the major phases of Michael's involvement with Hanna into three Parts.Part 1 is where we learn of Michael's sexual initiation and subsequent emotional attachment to Hanna. Serious page-flipping stuff!In Part 2 we are drawn into a courtroom situation (Michael is a law student) in which he is as shocked as the reader (us) to learn of the horrific nature of Hanna's secrets.Part 3 outlines the way in which Michael attempts to bury the past, as best he can. But it is not possible. It is not possible. Michael's past is exhumed. There were moments in this section that I found gut-wrenchingly sad, yet, presented in a beautiful way. (How does one say it?) It is brutal. Brutal sad and shockingly so.I will not go into WHY the book is called The Reader. That would be saying too much, I think.I enjoyed this book. You will sink into it quickly. But not as though into quicksand. You will walk away from it, perhaps with a heavy heart (that is one thing I should say. There is nothing humorous about this book)... your heart may be heavy afterwards, but only because it will carry the weight of knowing that there are beautiful things to be felt towards those who have done even the most atrocious things imaginable.Love is love."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The author's spare style is reminscent of Camus. He doesn't need to overwrite to create a lot of ambience and intense emotion. At first, I was worried that he would dwell on the love affair between the 15 year old Michael and Hanna. But, it turns out that those descriptions are among the best in the novel and their affair somehow never touches the sordid depths of Lolita's life. The narrator spends his whole life trying to equal or surpass this first and most pure of his relationships. I enjoyed how the narrator described his new manner with girls his age thanks to his experiences with Hanna. I agree with other readers below that the so called &quot;secret&quot; was way too obvious. I figured it out right after Michael left her the note, but then thought to myself, but how could that account for all her strangeness? I must say that the twists the novel takes make it a very interesting novel -- we pass through WWII and the Holocaust, but in a much different manner than we normally do in this type of genre.It's quite a short book (took maybe 2 hours to read), but because of the compelling narrator and the lean prose, I really enjoyed it. It's a cerebral book -- we feel the narrator's pain as he tries to get over his early affair and regroup -- whether he ever gets it together or not I will leave as a surprise."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is a haunting work of fiction and a political allegory, as well. To appreciate the story, you need to understand the author's intent: to delve into the wounded post-war German soul and extricate the pain and guilt that is harbored there. The protagonists are not merely characters in an ill-fated romance; they are the embodiment of the German archetypes of obsession with absolute power, and slavish acquiescence to those who pursue and exercise that power. At every turn, the story reveals ethical and moral dilemmas that the characters have difficulty navigating; the search for truth leads them to difficult - and different - conclusions about what is required of them. This is a fascinating book that will intrique anyone with an interest in the history of WWII, philosophy, German culture, or the Holocaust. I recommend it for readers who are looking for a challenging experience with a work of literature. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Emotionally charged, disturbing and erotic, The Reader is a whirlwind rollercoaster ride. I did not want to like this book. It is morally ambiguous and philosophically horrific. Still, the book pulled me in. I couldn't put it down. With each page, each word, I was compelled to read on.The Reader is the story of a fifteen year old boy and a thirty year old woman. It is a story of secret friendship and illicit sex. It is a story of a relationship based on mutual need, even though neither the boy nor the woman understands the needs of the other.Later, as the boy grows older, he begins to unravel some of the secrets. He starts to see things more clearly. But he is still under her spell. He still wants to understand this woman with the mysterious past.In the end The Reader is a story of self confrontation as the boy, now a man, examines his part in what has gone before.George Steiner wrote in his own review of this book, Read this and Read it again. I couldn't agree more."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I bought this book while on travel in Australia. I figured it would be a quick read on the plane back...little did I know how it would consume my time over the next few hours. I read it...and then I re-read it, and re-read it again. By the time the plane ride came, I had read it three times.Most of us can see a lot of ourselves in the protagonist, Michael or his lover, Hannah. The backdrop of WW II and the Holocaust is a unique means of showing character flaws and how they can drive us to destruction. Hannah's inability to swallow her pride and overcome her &quot;secret&quot; led to her destruction; consequently her atonement in prison and love for Michael led to her rehabilitation as a human being.What is sad about the book is how Michael cannot acknowledge his love for Hannah to the rest of the world, undoubtedly due to her shame of being a convicted Nazi. Even at the conclusion of the novel, he is unable to voice his love to anyone, except to the one person who couldn't care less about Hannah.This book is a wonderful read, and provokes a lot of thoughts. I heartily recommend it to anyone looking to find a little more about themselves."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a fine novel, once one moves beyond some of the more unusual aspects of the plot. It flows quite quickly and smoothly, a tribute to the translator as well as the original author. Its theme is thought provoking.I would imagine that this book has touched nerves, particularly with the original German audience. It is well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is interesting in that the reviews are either 5 stars or 1-2 stars. People either love it or hate it - no middle of the road. I have read it once and will have to read it again before giving it an intelligent review. However, I think it is a book that everyone should read, just to gain their own opinion - it isn't something you should take someone else's opinion for. Kind of like &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; - you may not like the message or even enjoy the book - but you should read it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought this book was going to incorporate more history in the story. I had a hard time with the moral issues prevalent in the book, but at the same time was illuminated by how impressionable young people are. At the tender age of 15 major events can and most likely will have a lasting impression on that persons life. Was a quick read, but was disappointed. It was not all I expected."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One of the things that I admire most about Oprah and her Book Club selections is that she is exposing followers to such a wide range of literary styles. This is not a book for everyone. The characters are hard to sympathize with and the writing has a staccato, abrupt feel. Frankly, I didn't enjoy it. However, I did find it extremely well-written, exploring some intriguing themes about relationships; about the mesmerizing effects a first sexual partner can imprint on you for a lifetime; about pride, pragmatism and their sometimes horrifying consequences; and about post-WWII Germans growing up in the aftermath of their country's shame. It's a quick read--you may not fall in love with it, but it's worth a try, because you might enjoy the insights the author provides."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Oprah once again made her good choice onto Bernard's &quot;The Reader&quot; a tale of lofe, a tale of hope and the defending illiteracy. The Reader opens with a delightful touch into 15 years old Michael Bergz falling in love with Hanna subsequently spun into a masterful written erotism literature, the second parts see into Hanna's pride, the ego in her that devastaded her life, then only Michael was able to understand that she was illeterate...I couldn't stopped with much exciting the plot goes to the greatest extense of life, I felt compel to tell others that the book has brought meaning of love of patience and of trust, The Reader symbolized the trueself as one. I've been touched most with the solemn ending, though it was really enjoyable, I felt an urge to claim Bernard as one of the writers that stepped ahead introducing erotism to literature."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is beautifully rendered, poetic and philosophical. It provides a unusual perspective on Nazi Germany -- about the roles and impacts on ordinary people that makes you stop and think about the nature of evil. This is a book that helps go beyond cliched thinking. Good and evil are not black and white here. I read a lot of novels and this is one of the few this year I am recommending to everyone. I continue to be haunted by this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There are some books in which the characters are extremely loveable. They are intriguing, interesting, and I enjoy reading about them. This did not prove to be the case, and the book did not live up to my original expectations. I read the reviews, saw the little &quot;Oprah&quot; symbol, and excitedly bought the book. But I was extremely disappointed. This book was missing something. I'm not exactly sure if I know what. Even still, the overall plot was excellent, and I think the story COULD have been absolutely fabulous. I guess it was worthwhile to read this, though I know I have read much, much better books in my lifetime."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"You'll read it in a day &amp; wish it was longer. It has so many different layers (love, tragedy, WWII, the fight of the generation that followed, soul searching, how one's choices shapes one's life-for better or worse, how life is something that happens while you're making other plans) the end result is rich and impacting. Hard to believe it's a novel &amp; not an autobiography. Schlink says things we all feel better than most can express them: &quot;This is what must happen to old married couples, I thought: the young man is preserved in the old one for her, the beauty and grace of the young woman stay fresh in the old one for him. Why had I not seen this...?&quot; For me, it just doesn't get much better than this!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a mesmerizing allegorical tale of post World War II Germany's attempts to reconcile the horrors of the Holocaust with the remainder of German life and people as they knew it both before and after the War. When Hanna, a former SS Guard, takes the innocence of 15-year-old Michael Berg, she takes his soul as well, and he is left only with numbness that permits his daily existence. There is no absolution; what is lost can never be regained either for Michael or the second post-war generation. An intensely psychological book that asks many more questions than it answers."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Beautifully written and disturbing at the same time. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a powerful metaphor of the seduction of German youth by the Nazis. In this book, Hanna symbolizes the temptation of the Nazis, offering &quot;the answer&quot; to society's problems, in this case Michael's teenage angst. When Michael matures and realizes what Hanna (Naziism) is all about, he is fascinated and tortured by what he had succumbed to in his naive youth."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is more than the sum of the words on its pages. Schlink leaves us lots of room to think, forsaking rambling dialogue and too-detailed descriptions for a beautiful sparseness. He allows us to discover for ourselves how the shame of WWII seeped into the characters' being. &quot;The Reader&quot; is history and war and love and shame and growing-up and more that I haven't yet discovered: it leaves me with plenty to ponder (and I love that!)"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Sensational read with numerous, engaging issues to consider. If you enjoy this one, I also highly recommend another very engrossing and debate-provoking novel, The Last Day, by Glenn Kleier. I found it one of the most intriguing, uplifting reads I've ever encountered."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader brings to life a love affair truly based on friendship.

I found it so interesting I was not able to put it down. In the Oprah meeting, abuse was mentioned, perhaps, but to me it did not come accross as such. It was a love story in a very different way from the usual. There was much more of course to this story, it had lots of things for one to think about.

The author does an excellent job of describing scenes, feelings, and events. The devotion, love and commitment that the main character has is unbelievable. This story of true love is told from the male perspective, which makes this book even more unique.

I write to encourage thoughtful readers--readers who do not watch talkshows on TV--not to be misled by the reviews that Oprah followers are submitting. This book is subtle, engaging, full of food for thought. It is an excellent choice for a bookclub, because of its ability to provoke discussion and reflection. It is a Bildungsroman with layers of meaning, an easy, flowing read, and an inquiry into the human condition in all its frailty. I recommend reading it without consulting reviews that may disclose the plot--just jump in and see what you find."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There are so many subjects worthy of discussion to be found in \\"The Reader\\". The first part of this story tells of a sexual awakening for 15-year-old Michael when he becomes involved with an older woman. The relationship deepens as Michael begins reading to her after each encounter and she encourages him to focus on his studies. Then suddenly and mysteriously, she disappears. In the second half, Michael is now a law student, and he happens to sit in on a trial, involving none other than his ex-lover. It seems she's had a secret - she worked in a Nazi concentration camp. Oh yes, and she's illiterate too. The rest of the book deals with Michael grappling with this new-found knowledge. He struggles with his ever-changing feelings regarding his country and how the war changed the people he knows in his life. Beautifully-written."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This relatively easy to read work of emotionally \\"ensnaring\\" fiction by Bernhard Schlink, a gifted writer, who also happens to be a professor of law at the University of Berlin and an active judge, is one of those books everyone should keep forever and also buy to pass forward as a gift. The plot and its characters - 30 year-old Hanna and Michael, her 15 year-old serendipitous sexual disciple - have already been reviewed here by others in detail. What I want to add is that this work of rare literary art lingered in my mind long after I read it. It became the central topic of stimulating talks about existentialism and life's seeming cruelty. And it became deeply inspirational to me and many of my friends before Oprah praised its special nature and helped it into a larger stream of readership. The question of who is the \\"victim\\" and who is the \\"exploiter\\", if the question is even applicable to a love story born within a sexual \\"molestation\\" setting and psychological drama between a 30 year-old woman and a 15 year-old boy, can become blurry at best. This is not yet one more story about Germany during or after WW II. This is a universal story about the deep, subtle folds of rare intimacy and abandonment between two souls in any country or period of humanity. This poetic tragedy will move you; especially the last four chapters. Buy it, read it, think about it and talk about its deep moral undertow with your friends because it shatters ordinary and comfortable moral superficiality."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a masterful work of art, and possibly one of my favorite books. Set amid the tumultuous times of post-war Germany, 15-year-old Michael Berg meets an older woman, Hanna. They begin a relationship that consumes the young boy, and profoundly influences his life. This relationship is interrupted when Hanna disappears. Michael only finds her again while he is a law student, and she is on trial for complicity in several of the Nazi crimes as a secret Nazi SS agent.This book shows an astounding amount of poise and insight, depicting the tremendous guilt and shame associated with the holocaust. The relationships between the perpetrators and the victims are discussed, along with Michael's personal guilt for loving a woman who was capable of committing such terrible crimes. This book is a quick read, and filled with incredible wisdom, and individual sentences that can stand alone as profound declarations that ring absolutely true. This is a great book, which acknowledges that the holocaust can never be truly rationalized, or comprehended, but only discussed as \\"truth\\". A fantastic piece of literature!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed The Reader for many reasons that others may not have. It was, as the narrator points out, a metaphor for involuntary and voluntary love. We involuntarily love only our parents, Michael Berg says. Berg falls in love with, of all people, a concentration camp guard, woman he describes in one place as a horse. Despite the &quot;juxtaposition of oversentivity and callousness&quot; he feels when he thinks of her, and her almost overwhelming strength, she washes him and takes care of him and encourages him. The story unfolds of one generation falling in love, involuntarily, with another --- with one that is flawed. And yet, almost in a way Nabokovian (Lolita) and Dostoevkian (Crime and Punishment), there is redemption. Hanna, the concentration camp guard, learns to read in prison and discovers her crimes and her complicity. She does what mankind has done when confronted with its crimes --- she feels guilt. This book is about guilt and the ability of Germans (and all others) to accept the weaknesses of their parents without giving up that love. Ironically, it is the reverse of many books that explore the guilt of parents for the weaknesses of their children. I liked it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am a bit surprised to read so many negative reviews of this book. I question if the fact that a fifteen year-old boy had a sexual affair with a woman more than twice his age is the reason for the negativity. If Michael had been twenty and Hanna forty +, would that have changed the perspective of many readers? The importance of this book is that it deals with the complex issues of guilt, revulsion, denial, rationalization, etc. of German people in dealing with the horrors and truths of the mass murders of WWII. Similar to Stones From The River, this book takes you inside the German psyche and poses, but doesn't answer, many complex moral questions. One example of this complexity occurs during the court trial. Hanna's demeanor and thoughtful responses and questions posed to the judge cause one to reflect: What would I have done? A second example was very well written in the dialogue between Michael and the third driver who picked him up as he was hitch-hiking to the camp of Struthof. Do his comments and rationale really suspend belief? I believe that Hanna's final decision in killing herself expresses her torment over the choices she made. It certainly makes one think of what one's own actions would have been given the situation she was placed in."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For those of us who still grapple with the unfathomable question of the extent of man's inhumanity to man - whether that be past and/or present wars, hate crimes, racism, bigotry - this small novel is a stunning experience. Schlink has created at least two unforgetable characters in his tale of the coming of age of Michael Berg with an experienced woman of more years. How he evolves a beautifully honed description of sexual awakening into the nightmare of realization and then leads us to an understanding of all aspects of life civilized and uncivilized is a miracle of writing. A short tale, but one that lives on in the conscience long after the book's covers are closed. This is a genuinely brilliant novel. Share it with those meaningful to you. Grady Harp"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is a quick read, not because it was short, but because it pulls you in and you cannot let go - it was hauntingly beautiful - I can already imagine that someone has already figured out that this would make a wonderful movie - perhaps the producers of the THe English Patient..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink is able to take the reader through a process of examining social justice and morality. While the book may be seen as an expression of a relationship between an adolescent male and an adult woman, it is far more complex. As world watches the horror in the Balkans, Schlink forces the reader to understand how little human progress has been made. Power and pride are the downfall of mankind. The book is an excellent examination of the human response to psychology and philosophy as it relates to motivation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book while snowed in from work. Once I got to the second section, I could not put it down I was moved and disturbed by the vivid depiction of the relationship between Michael and Hannah- the bath, the bike ride in the woods. Obviously, this is an abusive relationship. I wonder why the author felt the need to make Michael and Hanna lovers. I understand the reason for the difference in age- they needed to be of their respective generations in order for the thesis of the book to unfold. But why did they have to be lovers? The issues raised in the second half of the book are the most disturbing. What would I have done in Hanna's place? Or Michael's? I honestly cannot say. I don't think anyone can. This is the brilliance of this book- for this is what the author has attempted to do. And this is the power of great literature or great art. And that's what this book is- great literature. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The characters and scenary will draw you in and the story and deep subject matters will keep you reading.

The protagonist has a moral dilemma because he once loved a woman who became an SS guard during Nazi Germany. This woman was on trial for the atrocities she committed. Since she was illiterate, the argument went, she could not properly defend herself. That sums up the protagonist's moral quandry. I'm reading the book wondering why someone would want to use ANY defense for the monsters of the Third Reich! There isn't a punishment on this earth harsh enough for them. The protagonist once loved this woman, now is trying to say that what she did wasn't as bad as it sounded in court. In my opinion, he is monstrous as well for loving such a cruel person in the first place. He further demonstrates what a selfish coward he is later in the book by how he conducted his marriage. I was generally disgusted by the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The first half was so so, the second have was a sleeping pill !"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was very excited to start The Reader because I had heard such wonderful things about it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I found the relationship between Hanna, a grown woman, and a teenage boy really sick. Then when I saw how their relationship paralleled the relationship that Hanna had with the children in the concentration camps, I was even more disturbed. In addition, I did not find the book thought provoking, or educational as many other readers have. As I was reading I also felt that some of the lack of fluidity must be from the translation from German, which was more interesting to me than the story itself. As a side note, I read this book for a book club, and no one else enjoyed the book either."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I find the three basic premises of this book so repugnant that I am blinded to any redeeming discussions of post-war German guilt. These premises are: (1.)the dysfunctional, abusive relationship that the young boy has with the older woman damages his ability to form relationships for rest of his life, (2.) the shame of being illiterate somehow excuses her from the horrors she perpetrated as a Nazi concentration camp guard, and (3.) treating the weak prisoners well before she selects them to be executed somehow mitigates her horrific crimes.I did not see Oprah, however, no amount of pontificating about \\"complex\\" and \\"profound literature\\" can get me past these basic tenets which are wrong, no matter how elegantly or passionately you spin the tale."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I love history and this book has more to offer than history. A real story of people, events, history, compassion and finality of reality."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I started reading this book knowing very little about it other than its reviews calling it \\"beautiful\\" \\"disturbing\\" \\"morally devastating\\" and \\"speaks straight to the heart.\\" Although perhaps not as disturbing or morally devastating as some reviews claim, I did find the story to be beautiful and one that spoke to my heart. I found myself truly caring about the characters, however bizarre they were (and the strange relationships they were part of).Anyone interested in post-war Germany and the aftermath of the Holocaust would enjoy this book. I found myself wondering several times whether this was a piece of non-fiction, considering how it certainly reads that way (it IS fiction, however).The print is fairly large and the pages narrow. I read this book in one day easily. I was drawn into the story easily. The questions of morality, ethics, and philosophy that this book brings up left me thinking long after putting this book down."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink's The Reader is the story of the relationship between Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz. The author does a very nice job of showing how the relationship, and its continually changing nature, shapes the life of the main character. The style of writing (or at least of the English translation) is an almost clinical, stoic first-person recollection. There isn't any maudlin writing here, and nothing ever feels forced or unreal. It's fiction, yet Schlink makes you feel as if it is almost autobiographical.One thing that I particularly enjoyed in this novel was how the author leaves unanswered questions--not unresolved plot points, but dangling, almost philosophical questions. For instance, the scars left on the main character by his relationship seem to echo earlier scars left by Frau Schmitz on others. Or are they? Could they even be called scars? Is Frau Schmitz a criminal, or a victim of ignorance? I also thought that a central theme in the book, that of how pride leads to a downfall, was subtly yet very effectively reinforced through the writing, the plot, and the actions of characters.All in all, this was a short yet engaging novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The above reviews have summarized the plot effectively, so I only want to add a few points about the narrative strategy. The text is masterly, that is to say honed to hit all the lines between incidental decision-making and actual issues of morality. His story is plausible in a Talmudic sense only, otherwise all the details have been carefully chosen so as to lead the reader into conclusions that ultimately alleviate German responsibility. Its true that sometimes we make big decisions, really big decisions based on irrelevant data points, but the author is not being fair in presenting all of the material only from that perspective."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a very strange story about a strange love affair. Michael Berg was only fifteen when a woman twice his age, Hanna Schmitz, initiates him into an early adulthood. In a small town of postwar Germany, she takes him into her house and he becomes her lover. Suddenly, she disappears and the poor boy is frustrated as she searches far and wide for her, asking neighbors if they know where she has gone. He is heartbroken.But life goes on and he become a law student and eventually finds her again in an unexpected place in court on trial for war crimes. As he observes the trial as a learning experience, with a type of pleasure and feeling of retribution, he watched as she was unjustly treated, slandered and attacked verbally. He is bitter to be reminded how she had used him and thought about the birthmark on her shoulder.We all have secrets and events we'd like to keep hidden, forgotten in the past. After a while, one's past has a tendency to surface to our shame; it is not always a happy remembrance, one we cannot face again. All families have skeletons in the closet which are best left unexposed and kept hidden. Hidden from those we love who may judge us harshly. If we've endured trauma or emotional pain, it is twice as bad when the memory resurfaces.He learns in court that she had been a young guard in a concentration camp. I can identify with Hanna as she was falsely accused time after time. She faced down the trial judge as I did the Mayor.They were able to cast reasonable doubt about her conduct at the camps and how she had used the young, delicate girls as \\"readers\\" because they were too weak to do the hard labor on the building site. A church had caught on fire by the bombing and many POWs died as a result. Hanna was supposed to have a key, but so did the other guards, but none fit the front door.This is a dramatic and sad war story and a bittersweet story of forbidden love. Mr. Schlink has also written FLIGHTS OF LOVE and SELF'S PUNISHMENT. Not a book I shall soon forget."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In my opinion this is one of the greatest books in recent history.I am not going to talk about all the different great aspects of it, the language (at least in German), the way the story develops and the realistic way Schlink portrayed post-war Germany.Instead I want to say something about most of the negative reviews on this site. I do grant everyone his/her own opinion, but it seems to me that most people who wrote a negative review actually do this because they cannot handle dealing with a narrator who can still see positive and likable sides in a character who does things that are not socially accepted.Here we have Hannah, a mature woman who obviously seduces a fifteen year old boy and really makes him obedient to her. And if that was not enough, we later find out that she has been working in a concentration camp. So why does this woman not come across as an egomaniac monster hungry for power over other people? I think everybody has to find this out on his/her own and then judge Hannah and also Michael by himself/herself.One of the great freedoms this book gives to us is to decide for ourselves how we feel about the characters, especially Hannah. I realize that many people are not used to this and would rather prefer a book where it is simple to love or hate a character, which teaches us a lesson that is, oh, so simple to gather from the story, because it is written out on every page.If you are looking for this then do not read this book. Read it if you like to make up your mind on your own and if you accept it that all people have positive and negative character traits.And by the way, please do not read the review below if you have not already read the book because it might spoil the climax for you. The solution is not that hard to figure out, but still nobody should scream it all over this place to rob people of their enjoyment of this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When Michael Berg is 15 years old he is getting over an illness and this is where he meets the woman who will be in his thoughts for his entire life. This woman will change how he see's some things in life and the world.Hanna is the older woman who comes into Michaels life and shows him a world at a young age. There affair begains when Michael is 15 and it continues for a while. Hanna has a passion for Michael that doesn't understand. Michael cares for Hanna in ways that she doesn't understand, mainly because he is so young and devlops such intense feeling for her so fast.Years later when Michael is in school he is in law class and is going to court to learn about a court case. There he runs into Hanna again, except for this time she on trial for acts relating to Nazi concentration camp activites. As Michael watchs the trials he begins to realize things about Hanna and starts to wonder what she is really like. As years go on he is still thinking about Hanna.This is a age old love story, that is beautifully written. The story moves at a fast pace. I loved how Michael dealt with Hanna and all the problems she had and how he grows to care for her more even after everything that has happen."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Starting in 1958 in Germany, \\"The Reader\\" follows the first-person narrative of 15-year-old Michael Berg, an ill adolescent who has a love affair with a 36-year-old illiterate named Hanna Schmitz. He's perplexed by her moodiness, and, when she suddenly disappears, Michael becomes obsessed with her and his various memories of her.Seven years later, as a law student, Michael is reunited with Hanna; however, not on the best terms. She is on trial with a handful of other SS female guards, all of whom are being tried as war criminals in conjunction with the Nazi concentration camp atrocities during WWII. Although Michael is numb after seeing her again, he is troubled by his present dilemma to try and free her from a life sentence, or allow her to seal her own fate.Once I began \\"The Reader\\", I couldn't put it down and finished it in one day. It was very captivating and well written. The translation from German to English was great, and I'm very pleased this book made it over to the States. If you enjoy brief May-December romantic literature, then I highly recommend \\"The Reader\\". It's a wonderful work of fiction. Also recommended: \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a quick book to read and worth reading. The issues in the book are not often addressed in novels, such as how the Germans dealt with the aftermath of World War II."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read very few books but I could not unglue myself from Bernard Schlink's The Reader. This story is about Michael, a young boy...only 15 and with newfound hormones I'm sure...and his older lover Hanna. I found it to be not only shocking and disturbing at first, but I was close to throwing it across the room at the thought of this &quot;couple&quot; being together. It was not until I got past the initial shock factor that I saw how beautiful and touching Michael's pure feelings for Hanna were. To recognize the &quot;love&quot; you must think as a juvenile...innocently and sensitive. You will find yourself caught up in a time where you believed that your childhood sweetheart was the only one in the world that could fulfill your heart's desires.Later on in the story Michael has grown and at this time Hanna is no longer a part of his life. It is not until he sees her in a courtroom for her crimes during the Holocaust that he meets up with that area of his life once more. Does that love still exist in the depths of Michael's heart? As the reader you find yourself really examining that love and applying it to your own life. Has Hanna crafted an important part of his life that stays with him today? You'll also evaluate the things that crafted your life...the things that gave it depth and meaning. Schlink's adding of a story to the history of the Holocaust made that part of history all the more alive for his readers. It brings you in...heart and soul."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story is original, short but intense. It's a great book, great writer. I really recomend it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is 3am on Monday morning and I can't sleep. \\"The Reader\\" has been haunting me over the past few days, or I should say, over the past few months. I watched the movie and read the book at the beginning of this year and I just re-read the book and watched the movie again.At the end of the book, Michael dreamed about Hanna on his way from Boston to New York. Hanna had been dead then, but in the dream, Michael's longing for Hanna was so intense that it hurt. I knew this type of longing - it often hurt even sharper than a physical pain. Last night I dreamt about my recently lost love. I couldn't remember what happened in the dream, but what stayed with me was the pain of longing and not belonging. I have dreamt about my first love many times and woke up in tears more than once over the past 20 years. Michael had spent only a summer with Hanna, but he could never get over her. I know I would have similar difficulties to let go.Hanna's longing for literacy was as strong as Michael's longing for her. Hanna's shame of being illiterate was as strong as Michael's shame of having loved her.I have been thinking a lot about Michael's conversation with his father regarding dignity, freedom and happiness. Yes, even a child can take no comfort of knowing his mother is always right. Every adult should have the last word on his own matters. Nobody has the right to force his opinion on other, to take action behind other's back, even if it were for the good, the happiness of the other person. It isn't about happiness - it is about an individual's dignity and freedom. Yes, dignity and freedom, those are the things I have cherished most. I once fought my parents for my freedom when I was fresh out of college. I strongly desired to take control of my own life. I made my own decisions and ate my own mistakes. I don't blame others, and I want nobody's control in the name of \\"protection\\". Dignity and freedom are more important than \\"happiness\\". At the end of the day, happiness is a personal feeling: nobody can tell you how you should feel. Only you feel how you feel, and you know how you feel.So many conflicts among family members and between couples are caused by lack of respect to other's dignity and freedom, lack of respect to other's right to make his own decision, or lack of courage to make his own decision.Yes, I agree that Michael has no right to tell the judge about Hanna's illiteracy; even it could help Hanna's case. Yes, I agree that Michael should have talked to Hanna and persuaded her to admit her illiteracy. However, I understood why he couldn't bring himself to face her.Courage to face the reality, courage to dig out the potentially very ugly truth, no every one possesses that kind of courage.Another detail touched me was the picture of Michael's graduation that Hanna clipped from a local news paper and attached on the wall of her prison cell. Michael finally realized that, under the disguise of a cold surface, Hanna was as deeply attached to him as he was to her. I would have done and I had done similar things before. Love is an obsession and an addition that you couldn't/wouldn't/shouldn't get rid of. You can squeeze it to a \\"niche\\" for a certain period of time; but eventually it would flood you unexpectedly.I am not trying to write a review of the book/movie. I am merely pouring out my feelings at this moment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story line is as follows: A young man named Michael of 15 who lives in Germany post WWII and is sick with hepatitis and vomits outside of a 38 year old women's apartment building, Hanna. She takes pity on him and cleans him up before walking him home.His mother then tells him to take the women flowers to thank her. The young boy does. He talks with her a moment before saying farewell; she asks him to wait for her and they will walk together. She goes into the bedrm and leaves the door ajar. He sees her put on stockings and she catches him peeping. He runs.He thinks about her for many nights before mustering the courage to return and apologies. When he arrives the women asks him to fetch her some coal from the basement, he does, and in the process gets covered in coal dust. Hanna doesn't want to send him home to his mother looking like that so she instructs him to take a bath in her apartment while she shakes his clothes out. When she returns with a towel he has an erection, instead of sending him on his way she has sex with him.This starts an affair where the boy is hopelessly obsessed with the older women. She has alot of control over him, and seems to be aware of it. There are times were she is abusive. During this affair the women asks him to read to her, which he does every time before they make love.The affair last several months until one day she just up and disappears. The young man does not take it well, but having no choice but to move on he does.Years later he is in college and schooling to be a lawyer. One of his classes requires him to cover the trail of some female guards from WWII who were SS at the time of the war. They were involved with a terrible fire that killed over a hundred female Jews.It just so happens that one of these old guards is the women from his youth, Hanna. She is now in her late forties. He of course takes great interest in the trial and never misses a day of which the two of them never speak, but only exchange a few glances.As the trail progresses it becomes clear that Hanna is getting pinned with a great deal of the blame. Michael mulls over this and tries to understand why it is that she seems almost clueless to the gravity of the situation. After hearing a witness declare that Hanna had young Jewish women read to her in the camp, two and two are put together and he realizes that Hanna is illiterate.At the end of the trail a document is produced that is damning to Hanna and the other x-guards. The report details the day in question that the Jewish women were killed. The other x-guards testify that Hanna was in charge and wrote the report. He knows this can't be possible considering, but Hanna will not admidt to her illiteracy.The trial ends and the x-guars are given little punishment, but Hanna is sent away to prison for 18 years. Michael again attempts to move on, but Hanna's hold on him is too strong and the effect she had on his life is at times overwelming. He begins to read into cassette tapes that he sends to her off and on for the rest of her sentence until she is released. You can never fully understand if he does this for himself or for her, because as the years pass she does learn to read, and send small letters. He never answers them, but sends the tapes insteads. A day before she is to be let go he goes to see her. She is a old women now and resembles nothing of what he once knew. He tells her he will return the next day and help her get an apartment and a job in the outside world.The next day she hangs herself. She leaves a will, and tells him to take the money she made in prison and give it to one of the only survivors from her prison camp. He does, the survivor is confused as to the purpose and does not want to offer forgiveness. She ask him to do what he sees fit with the money. He donates it to a Jewish illiterate charity and takes the letter of acceptance to Hanna's grave.That's it in a nut shell. I wanted to put it out there, because I think it's easy if you have not watched the movie to get some preconceived notions about this book and for me this book was nothing of what I thought it may be. I had not watched the film and really didn't know the story line.This book is well written, its first person, and felt as though the author was setting in the same room with me telling a true story from memory. It flowed well, and read fast. I found some of the writing poetic almost. The last few chapters made me cry.I wanted to hate Hanna; I wanted to be disgusted by her relationship with Michael-- with how she effected him -- with what she was a part of in the prison camp. Yet, the writer was very good at pulling you back in, making you think about his feelings and what a mystery Hanna was. It was a rollercoaster of emotion and a window into another life. It raises a lot of questions, the easy ones being about his relationship with Hanna, about Hanna as a person, about what Hanna did when she SS. But, its the harder questions that leave you thinking about the book afterwards. Questions that are uncomfortable and complicated."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was wanting to read this for so long, and for some reason I never did until now. I am very glad I did, and that I did before seeing the highly acclaimed movie. I enjoy reading about the holocaust and War War II, but this book had a different edge to it that I just loved. It was compelling and very well written. I only wished it could have been longer. I enjoyed many parts and without spoiling anything especially the third part. I am sorry I waited so long, and now I can enjoy the movie!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Due to the popular movie starring Kate Winslet, most readers are familiar with The Reader's plot. The movie differs slightly from the book, but the small adaptations remain true to the story.The Reader is powerful book that is written simply in first person narrative. I never thought that I would consider the humanity of a holocaust perpetrator. Schlink makes the reader empathize with the former camp guard while regarding at her actions honestly. Excellent read - I would recommend this for college course reading as the subject matter is mature."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The editorial reviews about this book do a great disservice to the novel. (Sometimes I wonder if the reviewers actually read the book.I don't consider this in any way a YA novel -- the themes are way too adult and the introspection and examination of conscience of the adult writer aren't reflective of the typical younger adult point of view.)That said, this is a fantastic novel. I was glued to the pages, examining my own reactions to what was happening and trying to summon the outrage one should feel when a 15 year old boy is having a sexual affair with a 30 something woman. He should be viewed as a victim. I couldn't summon that assessment.This is a beautiful and haunting story of a 15 year old boy named Michael, whom she called \\"Kid\\", who has an intense love affair with a 30 something woman named Hanna -- a streetcar conductor. He knows nothing of her past, and their relationship is mostly physical. She disappears suddenly once day and Michael next sees her when he's a law student in 1965 Germany as the war trials of the Nazi criminals are getting underway.He is both stunned and repulsed when seeing his former paramour as an SS guard criminal. He can't reconcile his love of her to what she had done during the war. Michael is in a state of suspended ambiguity. Should he feel guilty for having loved her -- a reviled and heinous war criminal with the worst of reputations? A quote at the end of Chapter one in Part 2 sums up how Michael faces the truth of his lover and how he responds to it: \\"I adopted a posture of arrogant superiority...this juxtaposition of callousness and extreme sensitivity seemed suspicious even to me.\\"The book is divided into 3 parts and deals mostly with Micheal's feelings about his relationship with Hanna, his reaction to her trial, and the final chapter as he comes to terms with all that has happened.This is a novel that is not to be missed. One that can be discussed at length in book groups everywhere or just between friends. I can't get it out of my mind.The reason for the title becomes clear midway through the novel.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I recently saw the movie that was based on the story with the same title. I really enjoyed the film version so I decided to order the book to see how close the film was to the book. I liked the book very much, it was easy to read and follow. It was amazing to see how close the producer could stay to the setting and pick the perfect caracters described in the book. However, books are usually much better at describing emotions and feelings, which could be experienced in this book as well. The story is a real mind breaker and you're not done thinking about it after finishing the book. You don't even know whose side you want to take, although it seems obvious from about half way through the book.If you want to dig up a little bit of the past, you should really consider reading the book, then see the film."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book by a German about passionate love, complex guilt, and the Germans atrocities during WWII, themes that were cleverly interwoven by Schlink. The translation by Carol Brown Janeway is excellent. The book is in two parts. If you enjoy the first part you might also like to read \\"The Lover\\" by Marguerite Duras, excellently translated by Barbara Bray. The style of both original authors is quite different though. The brush with which Duras paints her story is very fine, and needs getting used to."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel felt like three different novellas, tied together. This first, where a 15 year old has an affair with an older woman in Germany in the 30's, is quite good. Part 2, the Nazi war crime trial, is the least engaging. Part 3, the post-trial era, pulls together the first two parts, and I enjoyed that quite a bit. It is certainly the most emotional segment of the story. I heard the audio-book for this novel, and the reader was quite good and appropriate for this first person narrative. While I never quite felt as connected to the narrator as I would have liked, I enjoyed this original novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This was such as great book. It's written in the voice of the teen boy (later on he's grown up). The narrative is really compelling as you see the dynamics between Michael and Hanna. Their relationship is very dysfunctional, but there definitely is chemistry there.You want to keep reading to find out about Hanna's past as she is very secretive about it. You also keep reading to find out more about Michael as he is greatly affected by Hanna--which you realize just how deep those effects run at the end of the book. You try to imagine how his life would have been had he not met her."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book grabbed me from the beginning and carried me all the way to the end. The storyline is very believable, if you take into account the time and place of the events surrounding the story. Michael Berg, a 15-year-old, is a well-developed character. His actions and thought processes are explained throughout the book. Whatever he does, we can understand where Michael Berg arrives from. We also begin to learn who Hanna Scmitz, a 30-year-old at the start of the book, is, was, and will be. The story will deliver you to the time of post-war Germany and explain to youwhat it is like to be a German citizen."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Last month a book club I belong to read this book along with Anne Michaels &quot;Fugitive Pieces,&quot; both on the theme of the Holocaust. The discussion was lively and provocative; however, most members felt that &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot; was the superior book. The problem with &quot;The Reader&quot; was its cold intellectuality which reduced engagement by the audience. Most members had difficulty in caring about Michael Berg or Hanna. To a German sensibility the book might seem poignant and highly emotional, but to an American audience it seemed too minimalist, too sparing, as if it were missing an essential ingredient. When I say I don't get it, I mean that it failed to move me. &quot;Fugitive Pieces&quot; on the otherhand, although flawed in structure and sometimes in language (although most of it was highly poetic and beautiful), was touching and engaging from the very beginning.Our group had a good discussion about guilt--a couple of our members grew up in Austria during the war and &quot;The Reader&quot; really demonstrated to them the conflict between patriotism and guilt that the story represents on its symbolic level. We all appreciated the book's moral ambiguity which shows the difficulty of determining guilt or innocence and how love can be complicated by guilt. I guess these complex understandings on the part of the author come from his experience as a judge."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The story of Michael Berg and Hanna has great potential but Schlink failed to explore the emotive value of each character.I empathized with Hanna's naivete and illiteracy. Yet, it seems that her character was mystified to the point of a non-entity.When Hanna asks the judge \\"what would you have done?\\", Schlink fails to embrace this theme and give it substance. Throughout the book there is a sense of incongruency and lack of flow."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is not meant to distract us with stylish prose, but to listen to a man, not an artist, describe an event that happened to him in childhood and how that event affected his life. Therefore, do not expect flashy &quot;literary&quot; devices other than plain-spoken narrative. This is not an easy style to emmulate. The telling of the story is the stronger for it.This is a take on the Holocaust, and it is a take on sexual awakening in a young boy who has an affair with an older woman. Later, the young boy learns to take disappointment, pain, and a growing awareness of what it means to love and to extend kindness even to someone whom you feel has hurt you irreparably. To look at this book as some kind of non-literary event and therefore worthy of scorn is to completely miss the point. This book really must be read without a lot of pre-judgement of what a book should sound like, and of what a book should be telling the reader. The book has its own point of view, and exposes that point of view to us slowly and evenly, without uneccesary drama. To me, this makes it all the more compelling. It sounds utterly real. The writer has taken the chance that some readers won't get it, and, indeed, some have not. More's the pity.EKW"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in German, because I saw it had made the British bestseller lists, and I know that German books almsot never get that far. Why? Because the are almost all devoid of any emotional colour; stripped bare, pared down, austere. This is so typical of almost every book by a German author I can really say it's a characteristic. Funny thing is, this characteristic in this case became a virtue - see one of the official reviews above. Could it be that the writer just wasn't CAPABLE of fleshing out the story? All we have is a skeleton - I expect more from a novel. What I do know is that this author made a point of getting an English translation, even paying for it himself BEFORE the German came out, and so managed to get a bit of early attention outside Germany. Within Germany it's so typical of many other books it would never stand out. The book only become popular here AFTER its success in English. OK, so there's a ghost of a plot, which could have been made into a gripping novel, but the characters are cardboard thin and I don't care about a single one of them. Another case of hype."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was required to read this text for my German history class in college. It is not the type of book I would usually read but I am glad that I did. The book perfectly captures the guilt that the German people suffer through as a result of their questionable actions before and during World War 2, as well as how the following generations deal with what their parents and grandparents were involved with.Anyone interested in WW2 and the holocaust would do well to read this book.There is a love story as well, but I would not recommend this book to someone that is looking for a romance novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I watched the movie before I read the book. That is never a smart move but it was especially dimwitted in this case. In my defense I didn't know the movie was based on a book. How did I not know that?The big secret wasn't so secret. I already knew the big reveal. It didn't ruin the book for me but I did read it from a different perspective since I knew what was coming.I don't know if I've ever felt more conflicted about a book. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is wrong in every way and yet there is something beautiful about it. Hanna's past actions cannot be excused and yet I felt pity for her.This slim volume is packed with big messages. There isn't much more that I can say without laying out a bunch of spoilers. I don't want to do that. If you haven't read this you should. Take a bit of advice? Don't see the movie first.Jennifer @ The Relentless Reader"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book was recommended to me by a friend who insisted that I read it. Three quarters of the way through the book I was wondering why! Well the ending makes the reading of the first three quarters all worthwhile. I understood why my friend wanted me to read the book and I was thankful that I did. Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This engrossing story is about an intelligent boy of 15 and his 36 year old seductress whom he later discovers has been an SS security guard at a Nazi gas chamber. I have personal acquaintance with only two men who had similar experiences (minus the SS) and both lives have turned out badly, but in different ways. Is the well always poisoned? Did it really have anything to do with their later lives? Frankly I forget how Dustin Hoffman's future is suggested at the ending of \\"The Graduate;\\" I might want to watch him and Mrs. Robinson again sometime. Bernard Schlink explores what happens in the soul of his young man and suggests what goes on within the woman. Somewhere he mentions the layers of human memory like tectonic plates pressed together so tightly that they are inescapably a part of us. As someone has said, guilt is the gift that keeps on giving. There is so much in this book of the \\"woulda, coulda, shoulda\\" sort of thing I can easily recommend it to my book club. The discussion might never end. I compliment Ms. Janeway on an excellent translation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a book where you are compelled to read on to the end. It is an intriguing account of historical events from a new perspective. The narrator, who is both narrator and protagonist within the novel, is authentic. We follow him from his teenage years to adulthood and become involved in his obsession of an enigma. The enigma is his first love who we learn leads a deep and troubled double life."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When he is fifteen years old, Michael, a German boy, has an affair with an older woman. He is not of the generation that had to deal with World War II--that was the generation of his parents and of this love affair of his, Hanna. Their love affair is short-lived, though. Hanna is sometimes mysterious and sometimes moody, and one day she is simply gone from town and gone from Michael's life. He is deeply affected by her disappearance but continues on with his life and eventually ends up in law school.While in law school, Michael comes across Hanna again. He goes to watch a trial of five women, accused of being guards at a concentration camp near Auschwitz and of causing the deaths of hundreds of concentration camp victims. Hanna is one of the accused, and she is actually the one accused of being the mastermind and therefore the most guilty woman among the bunch. She seems not to know how to defend herself, and Michael gradually comes to realize why. His dilemma is then whether to do something about it or to keep Hanna's secret to himself.The idea that someone could almost accidentally become a Nazi is both fascinating and horrifying. I was interested in reading about someone who has a personal secret she finds so absolutely shameful and unmentionable that she would be willing to do truly appalling things in order to keep it hidden.The characters in this book, though, are unsympathetic, and I thought the ending was lousy."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"First of all, the book has very short chapters and is easy to read, which is important for my attentional needs. More importantly, The Reader speaks to the very humanness of all of us, even those judged to have committed the most heinous of crimes. Schlink demonstrates that any gesture of kindness toward another human being has great value, not only for the person we are directing our deeds toward, but for our own soul as well."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Thoughtful, moving, daring, dangerous. Which made me think of my own choices in life. And how we are all victims of ourselves. The Reader was snared by his own trap, and her name was Hanna. I read this book in one sitting. It was thoroughly engrossing. Highly recommend for its content and excellent translation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was amazed at the depth of this small short story. I enjoyed the read and the subject matter which stays with you long after the book is done."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I admit it. This book sat on my shelf a while, and was almost doomed to obscurity when I found out it had been chosen as one for the club by Oprah. But once I picked it up, I whizzed through it.At first, I wondered if the style of writing- distant, reserved- was a function of the translation from the original German. But in retrospect, I don't think so. The reserve that Michael and Hannah have through much of their relationship- the withholding of information from each other- and the somewhat clinical catharsis that Michael claims for writing the book, are well served by the coolness in language. This is not a novel of passion, though it does have passion in it, but a novel of exploration and examination. It is to the author's credit and to his translator Carol Brown Janeway, that the book reads so easily and so well.The story explores extremely difficult subjects, including the Holocaust. But it is also about coming to terms with guilt. And there are so many types of guilt and so many reactions explored in the pages.I imagine this was a book popular with bookclubs all over the place."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Sure, the translation might weaken the language some. I've read so many people say that it's an easy read, however so many elements enter this work from so many angles. I was left with both regret and rejoicing that I have never had a relationship that affected me to the bone--something I could never shake.The theme of illiteracy should not be taken lightly, I think. We are such an educated people now. Can you imagine how devastating the inability to read must have been only a few decades ago? To think that a Nazi criminal would accept prison than admit that she is illiterate makes me appreciate my education and that of this nation so very much. Nearly all of us can read, can we not?I highly recommend this book, but take it slowly and ingest it, even though the vocabulary and language is simple."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a wonderful attest to the fact that love is not perfect and workable at all times. It tells of a story that is not too removed from experiences in many lives--Michael Berg develops an infatuation, a perplexing curiosity to someone that is socially deemed unavailable to him. Through his relationship, not only does he grow emotionally and sexually, but intuitively and mentally as well. Besides sharing a sexual relationship with Hanna, he is nurtured and encouraged to excel--a hope that Hanna did not get to fulfill in her own life.The book speaks to the human emotion, for although the story tells of an clandestime, socially unacceptable relationship, it proves that there are bonds and strong feelings that can link us to those outside of our own age group."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In the late 1950s, Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German schoolboy, meets and falls in love with an enigmatic working-class woman more than twice his age, thirty-six year old Hanna Schmitz. Thus begins Bernhard Schlink's short, sparely written novel, \\"The Reader\\". From there, the plot of this best-selling novel is well known. Berg spends many days with Hanna, reading to her and making love, the mysterious woman becoming the obsession and fulfillment of erotic desire. Then, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Berg's life as quickly and mysteriously as she had entered it. Several years later, in the mid-1960s, Berg once again encounters Hanna, this time standing trial for war crimes as a former guard at Auschwitz. His obsession rekindled, Berg's narrative follows Hanna's trial, disclosing her wartime crimes and her \\"secret\\", and relating the austere relationship which continued between them during Hanna's years of imprisonment.\\"The Reader\\" is a little novel that has big aspirations, its austere prose and simple plot suggesting to the reader that there is something more, something unsaid, about the engimatic Hanna. Unfortunately, Hanna's ultimate \\"secret\\"-her illiteracy-does not bear the weight of Schlink's story, does not adequately explain Hanna's actions. It may become a wonderful television movie, but \\"The Reader\\" is not the classic work that, for example, George Steiner's profuse praise suggests. While the first part of the novel, a little erotic fairy tale of the affair between Berg and Hanna, is a concentrated work of spare, lucid prose which \\"hooks\\" the reader, the remainder of the book is not nearly so good and never carries the weight of the big questions Schlink wants to raise-questions of guilt and love and the relationship between generations in post-War Germany.It is certainly worth spending a few short hours with \\"The Reader\\", an interesting, if not profound, novel with some very good writing. Just don't expect a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One of the merits of good writing is to be thought provoking. This is the case with this clean, simply-prose novel that touches on a very sensitive topic, one of moral and ethical content. Following the steps of Primo Levi, the author deals with the issue of collective guilt from the point of view of the perpetrator, the German nation and the horrors of WWII. How is one generation to deal with the atrocities of the previous generation?Michael Berg, a young adolescent has his first romantic affair with Hanna Schmitz, a mysterious woman several years older. Seven years later Michael will reencounter Hanna in a court room where she is been accused of war crimes. Faced with the most unexpected, Michael has to cope not only with his disappointment but also with the dilemma of understanding or condemnation: if he is to understand Hanna's past he has to pardon the perpetrators and condemnation is out of the question. Hanna herself inflicts self-punishment by refusing evidence that would substantially reduce her sentence.This ia a novel of psychological complexity and a parallel to human guilt and atonement. Needless to say, the German example can be easily extended to similar events in history, to cite the ex-Yugoslavia war trials presently taking place in The Hague. Bernhard Schlink brilliantly transports the reader into the core of a contemporary issue over which much has been said but little has been written about. Congratulations!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought The Reader from Bernard Schlink has a great narrative quality although and as one of the other reviewers mentioned it is not just a story it is a man growing to accept life, love and himself. I thought it was a bit too short and not as in depth as I usually like but all over a great read espeacially if your introducing yourself to Holocast and German Novels."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"themes of this book intertwine into a compelling story that parallel the relationship between the post war German youth and those that participated in the Nazi movement. How does a new generation evolve from its terrible/unthinkable past and how does a new generation move on and take ownership of their county? Every section of the book parallels this moral divide: the affair, the trail and the conclusion. This book examines all of the gray areas of the issue and never leaves the reader with just one clear emotion. You are never lead to hate Hanna even through the affair. One would believe an affair of this nature would be repulsive, but the reader never feels that way. Both characters are flawed and heroic in their own right. Both characters struggle with inner conflict and outward embarrassment which makes them both very human. That ends up describing this story best, it is very human.This is a great book for a reading circle as it easily spikes thought and conversation. You are unable to read this book without examining how you would feel. The only complaint I have about this book is the ending which seems a bit anti-climactic and simple for such a complex book. Because Michael is narrating the story I can understand the ending and the reader is left making up their own reasons for Hanna's decision."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I haven't read the book, but just saw the movie on the eve of the Oscars and have been more affected by this more than any other movie of my life I think. Its grey-shaded ambiguity really made me philosophically ponder the complexities presented and all night my subconscious wrestled with theme and meaning until in the morning I awoke with an insight (as so often happens in that alpha/theta twilight zone). Don't we all place people in a burning church sometimes and lock the doors? Didn't Michael effectively do that to Hannah in the end?\\"What would you have done?\\" Hannah asks her judge in one of the most poignant sentences of the movie, referring to her assiduously carrying out the responsibilities of her \\"job\\". I ask myself, what would I do if someone I loved only as deeply as one can love one's first love and the one who has exquisitely introduced one to the world of sex and the heart, if I discovered that the beloved had committed a heinous crime? How would I feel about that person and about myself in my capacity to love someone who could commit mass murder by action and by neglect?Beyond the generational German themes mentioned in other reviews, the practical consideration of issues deeper than forgiveness, victim, victimizer, guilt emerge: How does compassion for self and the other manifest in this complex story of heart opening and closing and opening and closing? Visually I am imprinted with the eloquence of Hannah's mute head shakes in the bathtub after the anguish and argument of the trolley scene. Do you forgive me? Do you hate me? Do you love me? Wow. A hurting human emerges. Second visual: Hannah, lover of words, is moved to tears, her head on her young lover's chest, nourished beyond food, sex, surroundings to her very soul by beauty of language which she herself cannot decipher nor express as it appears on paper.What kind of colossal shame chooses 18 years in prison over the admission that one cannot read nor write? . . . and suffers the injustice of suffering for 5 others who happily pile all the blame and hatred on a woman who is innocent of the particular if not the general accusations of degree of murderous responsibility? This shame apparently shapes every aspect of her life.In all other parts of the trial, Hanna was guilessly honest. She was uber-responsible to both her job as ticket-taker and her job of guard -true macabrely so for the latter. What values in what order of priority brought her to the point of participating willingly in the excruciatingly painful deaths of at least 300 human beings? Who can say from the perspective of one's own different life what Hanna should have done? She acted from the life she had lived.Why did Hanna hang herself? I think Michael rekindled the possibility that she mattered to somebody. But he couldn't offer her an unmixed compassion, particularly without some sign that she had \\"learned\\" from her \\"mistake\\" and its consequences. For Hanna to encounter compassion mixed with something akin to revulsion when her unexamined mind had so simply lived out the punishment that was meted to her, must have been more than she could bear to see in her former-lover's face. She took it into herself and took herself out of it all, finally. Gave herself that absolution at least.Visually I wonder what was the meaning of the contrast of the very opulent apartment of the Holocaust survivor with the sparse, closet-sized cell of Hanna - with its magazine cutouts of flowers taped to the wall by her bed? What about the survivor's statement that the camps were not a place where learning took place --- as the prison was not a place for Hannah to learn anything either, except to read? She served her time with a good chunk of her life -warm, fed and clothed it is true but ongoingly horrific all the same no doubt. Beyond the Absolute where forgiveness does not even need to exist, there is the Relative, where accountability plays out. It seems to me no human could do more penance than Hannah did for herself and five others and maybe Germany at large. And what, after all, did Michael learn from his experience? Perhaps that he was a distancer who withheld love. I expect, however that he absorbed those traits from his parents more than from his experience with Hanna. I'm sure he learned from her some things his family of origin could never have taught him.I look forward to reading the book for the possibility that I might gain more insight into the inner workings of the characters than a purely visual portrayal of this story, albeit by the most extraordinary of actors, can give."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I will preface this by saying that my parents are both Holocaust survivors, so I was expecting a lot from this little novel which was written in acts as is a play. The first \\"act\\" described a very intense relationship, obsessive in nature for one and passive for the other party; the time was post World War II and the place was Germany. An adult man described his youthful experience, but even the man at 15 seemed to be aged. I had no previous knowledge of either the book or the film, I just saw this at the library and checked it out, knowing that a film was to soon be released. No character in this book gave me enough to care about them and no event surprised me, rather I felt that my expectations were repeatedly confirmed. The conflict was not really resolved, things just happened and then the next followed, not really building into a climax. I wonder if the translation was the weak link. I also wonder if the book was titled something other than, \\"The Reader,\\" would I then not been able to figure out the bottom line of the story. Philosophically speaking, I also thought the book was weak and could have been deepened. Had the first act not been so graphically sexual in nature, this story could be on the high school reading list for Holocaust studies, followed by a discussion of the effects of war, any war, on the common person's struggle for survival in inhumane times. I will see the film because I am very curious to see if it is shown in three acts in a linear representation and how much time is devoted to Act 1."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Some things in life are just inexplicable. In a rational world, we spew forth words to express meaning, as though we really \\"know\\" something. In The Reader, we are faced with a story where the familiar is just a facade; like a building in war torn Germany. Underneath that facade there is a 15-year old boy trying to be a man. There is a 36-year old woman trying survive in literate world with an inability to read. There is a mother and daughter deserving justice, who never find it, even when their perpetrator sentenced in a court of law and dies in prison. There are silent victims who speak loudly from the grave, but are only faintly heard. Most inexplicable, is human compassion, where one can love even heineous war criminal, yet not \\"know\\" them for who they truly are."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was amazed by the power of this book. I bought it in the used section for a dollar and didn't expect much from it. The book was so cheap because it was on Oprah selection so it sold lots. Take the time to read this frighting tale of obsessional love and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is a simple love story. Yet it is much more than just that. It is also a very sensitive portrayal of how post war Germany is struggling to come to terms with its past. I liked the lucid and simple style of prose, and for this the credit goes to the translator."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A truly remarkable work by Schlink. The book grips you from the very start and fills you with conflicting and ultimately philosophical emotions. The compelling characters strongly convey our feeble human nature and in an uncompromising manner, stress the totality and melancholic finality of our existence. A story of immutable guilt and self destruction, not only of the blameworthy (Hanna) but also of the innocent (Michael). As a Jew, the book left me with very strong impressions as well as with some different perspectives to grasp the ungraspable. And yet, as in life, there is no closure in the book - for Michael, Hanna or the victims. But most importantly - there is no closure for the burdened German conscience. Perhaps there should never be one. This is a book I would carry within me for a long while."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I haven't read many novels regarding the holocaust, but i have always felt emphatic towards the jews and their struggle. It was interesting to see a viewpoint on how the Post-War Germans dealt with the conflict.The central characters in the reader,Michael and Hanna were very well drawn, and though at times it may have seen impossible to sympathize with them and their struggles, my heart went out to them, as they struggled to deal with the atrocities of war, and their love for each other. The prose in the book is clean and straightfoward, and yet its power is luminous from beginning to end. Anyone who is curious about the holocaust, or simply about how the power of love can affect two people should definately read this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"An interesting read- I only wish that the author had delved deeper into the book's characters. We see them all through the eyes of Michael Berg, yet the author stops just shy of letting us fully understand them. This is particularly the case with Hanna. As much as I could comprehend the author's wish to keep her a mysterious object of Berg's affection, I felt that if I knew more about her- her drives and desires- I could relate more to their mutual attraction. Apart from the love story, this book is about guilt and forgiveness. We get a glimpse of what Berg feels, yet we're left hanging with regards to Hanna. How does she feel about the crime(s) that she has committed? This novel is a baby step shy of being great. Entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book, written by a morally confused author, reads like an assignment for a university course studying both turn of the century German intellectual history with contemporary German Holocaust hand-wringing. It's basic premises are unbelievable in the abstract and in the execution. The chief sin of this book is its desire to make Michael Berg's moral dilemmas serious ones. In fact, his relationship with Hanna is less interesting than his inability to confront his own emotions. The most sensible discussion about the Holocaust comes from the mouth of a man driving Berg, and is presented as intolerable. The man blames the holocaust on the ability of humans to become indifferent to the suffering of other humans. This is more compelling than the idea that an inability to read coaxed Hanna into the SS. (As if reading confers understanding and wisdom!) There are also far too many useless references to now classic literature - Emilia Galotti, Bachmann, etc... The reader interested in moral dilemmas would do better to read Solzhenitsyn, or someone similar, where such dilemmas are at least confronted honestly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The literary and philosophical beauty of this novel lies in its narrative structure, taking the audience from the protagonist's personal dilemma as an adolescent to the his ethical and political responsibilities as an adult. The Reader delves courageously into the postwar German psyche, taking into consideration the anguish of both personal and collective guilt.While this book presents philosophical and legal hypotheses in plain, accessible language, the depth of these fictionalized ethical quandaries may not bid the younger reader's attention or comprehension to the extent that he or she may finish the novel with a sense of enlightenment or satisfaction. However, The Reader is most certainly appropriate - and recommended - to college level readers and above. The translation preserves the author's terse, yet engaging style with only several grammatical glitches that cause only minimal distraction. On the whole, though, The Reader is a superbly written and engaging novel not to be missed by those who appreciate an ethically-based, yet solid, plot graced with character-driven circumstances."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink's &quot;The Reader&quot; is a wonderful novel that goes to the heart of the post-WWII German social problem: how do we reconcile ourselves with our past? The two main characters, Hanna and Michael, live out this question and provoke the reader to consider the moral issues at stake. Who is &quot;guilty&quot; for Nazi attrocities? Should the post-war generation take responsibility for the actions of their parents? Schlink has is own, very unique, and sometimes disturbing answers to these questions. But more importantly, this easy-to-read, thought-provoking story should raise questions in the American mind about our own guilt for horrors such slavery, segregation, and Nisei imprisonment carried out by our forefathers. It certainly is a novel everyone should read to get a clearer understanding of how to live with a guilty past."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"While I found the relationship between the boy and the woman objectionable, it isn't the reason I didn't care for the book. I found the writing sparse. The characters weren't fully developed and the reader was left not knowing hardly anything of their lives or feelings. It was an interesting idea for a story; however, I feel that more should have been said about the characters' lives and feelings and less about simply their repetitive sexual affair. The chapters are annoyingly short. The feelings of the narrator seem immature and undeveloped. I realize he is 15 at the beginning of the book, but 15-year-old boys can still be interesting. Besides, the narrator ages and still no real insight is gained. Skip this one. Read instead The Pilot's Wife by Anita Shreve, or Snow Falling on Cedars by David Guterson."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I had never given it a thought on how the German people were victom themselves during times that were so differant than today. Oh, I am not excussing the horror that that country put upon the world, only trying to understand the complexities of it all. It has given me the opertunity to have great conversations with a few older friends that actually lived on the same street Hana lived during the sametime. My friends had no idea that that was going on right next door. And the emotional tramma that occured from having a long term sexual relationship with an older women who he really didn't know and how it affected his whole life. This book was stimulating because of the history in German life and mentality, before and after the war."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was a quick read. Started off slightly unrealistic by a woman in her thirties having a love affair with a boy the age of fifteen. Grew to be more interesting as the book went on. I would recommend with fair marks."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am 15 and I thought that this book was great. Even though the book started out a little boring at first once Hanna was introduced the book got more interesting. The reason for is because Hanna and the other main character Michael got into a relationship and the book started to pick up speed. The two main characters have so much in common. Michael is attracted to Hanna yet he never reveals it to the reader. They both are single people living with a secret to tell at the end of the novel. If you like a surprise at the end of books this book is for you!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book drew me in right away with what it didn't reveal. The characters were a mystery from the beginning, and I kept pursuing them, hoping that they would be revealed. Unfortunately, they never develop into real, believable characters. I wouldn't mind that they weren't sympathetic, if only I could believe in them. Hanna's story requires a little too much suspension of belief. How would someone so desperate to conceal her secret (which becomes obvious early on in the book) decide to become involved in an intimate relationship with someone she had only briefly encountered once before? And how could Michael have such an unfeeling attitude towards her when he meets up with her again at the end, after his obsession with her destroys all his other relationships? And the hardest thing to believe is that Hanna would so willingly allow her secret to destroy her life (and the lives of others). Despite the unbelievability of the story, however, the book still gets two stars for the translation and the beauty of the language. Too bad the story itself doesn't match."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Is Hanna not culpable, due to her illiteracy, for her crimes? Is Hanna's illiteracy a metaphor implying that Germans perpetrated the Holocaust simply out of ignorance? Many of the perpetrators of the Holocaust were educated and &quot;cultured,&quot; so it doesn't seem that the metaphor is apt. Maybe, the point that Hanna's illiteracy is trying to indicate is that education doesn't protect one from committing a crime. Also, one can easily justify their crime behind the mask of intellectual reasoning. Education can act as a shield, as an excuse. Hanna stands naked in her wrong doing. This book belongs in the tradition of &quot;Sophie's Choice,&quot; books that focus on the Holocasut, yet do so from a gentile position. Does the fact that both Sophie and Hanna are anomalies, Hannah in her illiteracy and Sophie as a Polish Catholic, make light of atrocities of the war and therefore diminish its horrors? I don't think so. Even though all of the Holocaust's victims were Jews (the final solution, which the defining element of the Holocaust, was for only Jews), others suffered from the war. Their story is valid, and they have the right to tell it. Through fiction, the reader can become sympathetic towards the perpetrator of a crime. However, to deny one's humanity is wrong. -Sarah"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"You will love this book for its surprise ending.

After young Michel is abandoned by Hanna, he tries to forget her, but everything reminds him of her. Their paths cross again years later when Hanna is put on trial for crimes committed during the war, when she was an SS guard in charge of transporting Jews to concentration camps. Despite the horror and shame of Hanna's past, it does not seem to compare to the one secret she has kept within her all of her life, a secret Michel discovers while wishing to save her from the grips of a conviction and prison sentence. The story is wonderful, the characters real and the plot heartrending and unforgettable. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book yesterday. I read it fast and I'm still trying to digest it. It leaves me with a lot to think about and I don't know how I'm going to rate it yet. I'll have to come back to it later.Updated: Jan. 28, 2010.I still don't know how to rate it. It was disturbing and dark though well written and intriguing. I think the author may have obtained his ultimate goal of causing the reader to think seriously on unpleasant but legitimate topics. In that case, I would have to rate it five stars.Did I enjoy it? Not really. I don't think the reader is supposed to.I definitely think Michael was a victim (albeit willing). Is Hanna a victim too? Of Hitler? Were they all victims? When do people cease to be the victim and become the perpetrator?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"kudo to the German authur's soul searching masterpiece. has ayone seen a Janpanese being remorese about the horrible crimes that they commited in Asia or tring to do some soul searing?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I picked it up. It was entertaining and thought-provoking, but it did have a bit too much \\"telling\\" for my particular taste. Still, it was a very good read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There is no need for me to rehash the plot given the number of reviews and the movie treatment which has alerted many to this story. What I will cover is its length as a novel (or novella) which provides a sparse and focused account. This was a redeeming factor for the book given the much trod ground it covers. The moral ambiguities presented by both characters are clinically interesting but I was never drawn in emotionally. The Reader is definitely a worthy effort but I was left thinking more of the deft twist in circumstances that led Hanna to her fate and the random choice of Michael to join her on part of her journey rather than the larger 'good versus evil' and atonement aspects the author intended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book all at once is a tear jerker as well as a thought provoker. Nowhere before had I ever seen the ideas of sin, forgiveness, guilt, and duty explored in quite this way. Before it is over, we hate what the obvious villian has done, but we cannot hate her as much as she seems to hate herself, and isn't this punishment enough? At least in the American community, not many people understand the guilt that pervaded Germany's collective conscience for the Holocaust. Some of it they deserved, but how much of that guilt rightfully belonged to whom? What generation or generations should or did pay the price?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I saw the movie, loved it, and felt compelled to read the story in hopes of gaining more insight into the characters. The book somewhat accomplished that goal. It's a well worth read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There are many good books about this painful time in human history but there are some books that have a profound impact on us because they present the real toll of the Holocaust. This is one of those books. The Reader is a work of psychological complexity; an exploration of the painful and difficult process of guilt and atonement. It is also a love story. The story is told in three parts by the main character, Michael Berg. Each part takes place in a different time period in the past.When he falls ill on his way home from school, fifteen-year-old Michael Berg is rescued by Hanna, a woman twice his age. In time she becomes his lover--then she disappears without explanation. When he sees her again, he is a young law student, and she is on trial for a terrible crime. As he watches her refuse to defend herself, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder. The final part the book is about truth and reconciliation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book today. It is clearly and distinctly written; it approaches extremely difficult questions; it does not answer them. It seems to have a lot to say about pity and judgment, in everyday life and in sorting through the history of the Holocaust, again and again. For this book, pity is not an emotion that adheres stably to one group of people: without detaching us from the need to pity the victims and survivors of the camps, pity twists like a dagger through the novel, through our lives and history, and no one can be sure that it will not suddenly rise up in our lives. And maybe we should be surprised in this way more often."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an excellent book. We chose it to read for our book club and most people read it in one session as they could not put it down. It is very well written and the characters well portrayed. It is the story of a young boy's obsession with an older woman. Years later he finds out about her past life and the big secret that was really the cause of what happened. It is quite a short book but has a lot of content."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In spare and simple language, The Reader shows us how complex the interweavings of love and hate, good and evil, can be. The two main characters are interesting in themselves and fascinating in their relationship.Henry James wrote that the value of a novel was a matter of \\"the amount of felt life concerned in producing it.\\" By that standard, The Reader stands high despite--and because of--its brevity."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As a fan of the Oprah Book Club selections, I was a bit disappointed by this particular book. The Reader is quite somber and dark. Given the topic (holocaust) this is entirely understandable. This aside, I found the novel to be a bit of a &quot;downer&quot; and not uplifting or motivating in any way. Perhaps that is not the intent? However, if you are craving a read that will fill your spirit with the &quot;warm fuzzies,&quot; The Reader is not it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; is not an easy read. No tbecause of length or difficulty, but because of disturbing subject matter and because, quite frankly, it is not very well written. Certainly the sunbject of guilt relating to the Holocaust is not new. How should those who stood by and did nothing atone for their silence; even worse, what about those willingly particpated in the atrocities of this dark period. Readers are faced with these issues, but given little to think about. It seems as though we are supposed to feel sorry for Hanna, but I just cannot. She is a reprehensible person; nothing can excuse her actions. Even her affair with Michael is nothing but a confused, ugly woman using a young man. Michael, too, is conflicted many years later when he discovers the truth about Hannah. He is sickened by what he knows, but his character seems to lose strength--in the end, he seems shallow. While the novel hopes to pose serious questions and raise thought-provoking issues, it does not succeed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book really difficult to justify. I don't really know if I enjoyed it or not. But, I certainly can appreciate the talent and expertise that went into writing it. I just don't know if have the knowledge to completely understand all the many complex and intriquing aspects of this story. Perhaps it could be due to my age (24) and not being able to relate to the subject matter in my own way. None the less, I can certainly understand the drama, shocking turn of events and emotional response that others have had to this book. This is a book that takes over a person and requires a lot of attention. Not a book to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Well, maybe he's not that bad, but it sort of rhymes. From the title of my review, one knows that I did not enjoy this book. Almost the entire time I was reading the book, I felt grey on the inside. Only when Michael begins recording his readings aloud for Hannah do I ever feel a little warmer to this story. I thought the book was predictable and simple. Hannah's &quot;secret&quot; was apparent to me after the first few hints. This novel was no fun, and I read for fun."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is an adolescent who has an affair with an older mysterious woman who suddenly disappears. Several years later, they meet again, in a courtroom where she is sentenced to life emprisonment for the crimes she commited as a guardian in a concentration camp.

As I read more and more I lost all hope and wanted to throw it away. The story moved so SLOW and the big secret was not worth the terrible punishment. I recognized more with the culture gap here then the whole story plot? Maybe I'm just not getting it?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have very little free time to read books of pleasure and I am very disappointed that I chose this one to dive into.

Instead, it took him years to figure out what I knew on the bike ride and the historical context was just there to trigger all of the emotion that each reader brings with themself about the holocaust. If you want a book to sink your teeth into, there are unlimited titles that would do a better job than this. Oprah's Book Club is a wonderful idea, but I think that she missed the mark with this one."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Michael Berg is fifteen years old when he is diagnosed with Hepatitis. During a difficult bout of the disease, Michael falls ill on his way home, where a woman rescues him. The woman is Frau Schmitz, a thirty-six-year-old \\"spinster\\" who works as a tour guide. Michael pays her a visit to thank her for helping him. Before he knows it, he embarks on a sexual relationship with the mysterious, taciturn woman who calls herself Hanna. During their affair, they do two things -- they have sex and he reads to her. Hanna loves to be read to, and Michael derives a certain pleasure from pleasing her. But then one day she disappears -- not to be seen again until a day in court, where she is accused of a heinous crime. Is Hanna involved in Nazi-related crimes? Had she been hiding in Michael's town for a reason? Hanna, the beautiful blonde who had seen Michael as nothing more than a sexual object, is finally revealed to him in her true colors.This is a unique and beautifully told story set during the late thirties and early forties. Bernhard Schlink wrote this in German, I think, and Carol Brown Janeway translated it into English. I hope nothing was lost in translation because this story is very enthralling and I'd hate it if the original had been written better. In any event, Janeway wrote this with clear and lyrical prose and I couldn't put this book down as Michael told us about his love affair with an older woman. I haven't seen the film this book is based on. Needless to say, I look forward to watching it, especially after Kate Winslet (who happens to be one of my favorite actresses) won an Oscar for this role. I can't recommend this enough. Read it and enjoy it iff you haven't given it a whirl."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink's management of the holocaust theme in my opinon deserves attention. It's a short book which focuses sharply on the interaction between the narrator and a war criminal. The theme almost creeps up unawares, especially to the reader unused to the subject matter. However, I get the feeling that Schlink felt the need to prefigure more than strictly necessary; I believe that it's a first novel, so minor technical flaws where the character-structure of the novel becomes clearly visible at a first reading are entirely forgivable. However, I don't intend to suggest that Schlink fails in his duty to ask and enquire about our intentions to the characters by making them at all obvious - it's more the fact that his (strong) technique shows through. The section of the novel that deals with the Holocaust does so entirely effectively, dealing in quick order with questions raised on all levels about Germany's and everyone else's responsibility."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It makes you think about your life, choices you have made, decisions you have to live with.

It's a great book to discuss with your friends."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"i finished this book in about a day and a half. it is very simple at times, and complex at others. it seemed to be about 4 or 5 different things, as if the author sat down to write about only one and then got off track. it is no masterpiece, but i enjoyed it nonetheless. it has a very &quot;what would i have done?&quot; feel to it, although it is not &quot;morally devastating&quot; as one reviewer stated. it is very real, and that's what makes it powerful in its own way. the other reviewers are right, it is not about the holocaust. it is about a love forever written on two lover's bodies and minds, and trying to forget to only relive the past. it is about guilt, passion, confusion, and something not quite sorrow or regret or acceptance or understanding...if that's the way you want to take it. it is not that deep because it is so short, but it has those basic elements. _The Reader_ also has some interesting twists, which catches you off guard. not boring as some reviewers claim. i do recommend."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The novel focuses on the events of post-war Germany through the eyes of Michael Berg, who did not experience the holocaust first hand but must deal with the consequences of Hanna's actions. This is a compelling novel that everyone should read to understand what it was like growing up during the time period after WWII and learning how to deal with the knowledge of the atrocities of war."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I must admit, it took me a few chapters to get into the book. But after I did, I could not put it down. I can only describe the book as simplistic, but I mean that as a compliment in it's highest form. The author tells a beautiful story, rich in detail, but sparce in words. He gives you the dots, and it's your job to connect them. FABULOUS! Oprah has (yet again!) picked a winner."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The moral ambiguities and the Nazi connection certainly make this the most surprising book Oprah has ever chosen. I think that this book should be read together with Timothy Garton Ash's classic, THE FILE, as well as Jan Philipp Reemtsma's very bizarre IN THE CELLAR. The Germans, they are some people!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and didn't want to finish it. 48 hours ago I'd never even heard of the book and now I can't stop thinking about it.

After reading it, I loaned my copy to everyone I know who couldn't move fast enough to avoid me. Two local book discussion clubs selected it as their February choice. Aside from the questioning of guilt and inocence, I was interested in the issue of shame. We all have things in our past we would rather no one ever finds out about. Very often it is something that another person would not hesitate to discuss. The second person is hiding a fact that we would consider inconsequential. The story is not embelished with unnecessary side plots or characters. The writing is lean, thoughtful, and beautiful. This is a wonderful book to read and a great book for a discussio group. djohnson@gamewood.net"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought the book was really good, it kept me wanting to finish reading it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book on trip between Sydney and Seoul in November 1997 and it has stayed with me since. It is the best book I have read for some time. It is memorable for its emotion, intelligence and the spareness of the writing. The nearest comparison I can recall would be Annie Proulx (&quot;The Shipping News&quot; and &quot;Postcards&quot;). It packs a great deal to consider into its modest length and deals with the issues of war crimes at very personal and human level. I am surprised that it has not, to my knowledge, won any major awards because I consider that it outranks many of the recent Booker and Pulitzer winners."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read The Reader last year on the recommendation of a friend in Germany, where this was the No. 1 best-selling novel for many months. This book helped open up discussions of the Holocaust and the impact it had on ordinary people in Germany. I found the writing beautiful, at times breathtaking. I would have to put the book down occasionally because I was so moved. So, I was disappointed when the climax of the book became clear to me pages before it actually happened. As this is a short book, that happens fairly quickly since I think most people will try to read this in one or two sittings. Also, I'd like to warn people that they may not be comfortable with the relationship between the older woman and the young boy. It is justified in the context of the book, but some might object. In all, this would have been a perfect script for Marlene Dietrich 40 years ago. Now, I suppose we'll see Meryl Streep do it, and she will be great."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Okay, maybe &quot;nice&quot; is too weak to describe this book, but that's what comes to mind.

The writing is elementary, the characters poorly drawn. Melodramatic."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader seemed to take two different paths in this novel. The first path is the affair between Michael and Hanna. Hanna teaches Michael the ways of loving and showers him with attention and love. The second path seems to be the path of Hanna giving advice to Michael about his life and his future. The two seem to conflict at times but the novel is very well written. It seems like they're an old married couple at times. The book is touching and it shows the love that they have for one another but yet can't continute acting on. Later in the book, Michael finds out a secret about Hanna and he is forced to face her once again. It's interesting how their relationship is like a circle. The book is easy to read and follow and is full of rich detail. I would recommend the book to everyone because everyone can benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The author raises complex questions about guilt of the generation caught up in Nazi Germany who were faced with extremely difficult choices in a culture where the norm was to dehumanize and to perpetrate unspeakable crimes. Just as powerful as a subtext to this broader story, was the story of the author's personal relationship with Hanna, a sympathetic yet profoundly morally ambiguous older woman with whom he began a sexual relationship at age 15. As a result of this relationship, for which he was emotionally unprepared, and which ended traumatically with an abandonment, the author is unable to love another or sustain his later marriage. As the questions of guilt, knowledge, and responsibility were raised about the generation who lived during the holocaust, the layering of the same questions about Hanna's guilt and personal responsibility to the author add a dimension of intensity and ambiguity to the story. I found the book profoundly unsettling and thought provoking- the themes haunted me well after I finished reading it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I'd just finished reading &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, an inspiring new novel that concludes in post-war Germany with the epic Berlin Airlift, when I saw this book posted on Amazon. I ordered it immediately, just finished it, and thought it was exceptionally gripping, a profound statement about life in post-war Germany. The entire subject is fascinating to me, my step-father was born in Germany in the 1930's and grew up in Berlin during the war, so both of these fine books hit close to home for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink accomplished exactly what he intended in this book. Maybe it is from the German culture, or the translation of the German language, but what you get from this book is not a set of fictional circumstances. You get the examination of a tortured mind. A boy has to deal with becoming a man at the hands of a woman he loves without discretion. Now he must face that he may not have ever really know her. He is taught to examine as an intellectual process, but emotions will not be controlled by any intellect. He is faced with more questions at the end than at the beginning. Children are always sure. They believe that daddy is the strongest guy in the world. It is when they become adults that they must deal with the truth and still love their fathers. We must examine ourselves in the light of Mr. Schlink's questions and yet, in the end we can only guess how we would handle ourselves in the circumstances of the Holocaust. Hopefully, we will never have to deal with the reality of that situation. Nor condemn those that are."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"...but it never did. The big secret was a let down, and the characters were void, &quot;numb&quot; was the word the author used. This book is alright for those who have a good imagination and can fill in the emotions and motives of the characters, but isn't that the writer's job? To be fair, there were a few pages in the book that should be read twice because they are quite profound (and there is also a need to get something for your time), but as a whole, the book may have lost itself in the translation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book oddly mesmerizing. It's an unusual story"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a novella that presents several issues that might be too difficult to understand for someone who is not connected to that time or the German people of Schlink's age that have struggled with the guilt of their fathers for all of their life. Schlink tries to differentiate between love, guilt and his duty to accuse or defend Hanna, who represents the German people that committed these crimes during the holocaust. As a German I have struggled with the same guilt, have gone to the camps to find an answer, so that I can understand. But can anybody ever understand? This is an extra-ordinary book that confirms to us, the children who were not involved and yet carry a tremendous guilt, that we will never be able to free ourselves from that guilt."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel is a beautiful, haunting story of love and loss that readers won't forget. Part 1 is sensual and honest...poignant and tender. The remaining two parts echo the beginning. The reader goes on a psychological journey through the mind of the narrator as he chronicles his adulthood and the haunting of that life he can't seem to lead. This novel deals with coming of age and the Holocaust in a very different way, and readers will struggle with moral and ethical issues. I could not put this book down...and I read it in one sitting! I highly recommend this book. It's one I will never forget."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am amazed at the negative reviews on The Reader. This book is incredible in its depth contained in the wonderful story which wastes no unnecessary words. It asks a number of questions, it asks us to consider another perception other than our own, to consider all sides of an issue and how complex life really is. On the surface, it would appear that Hanna was a cruel SS guard, and yes she was. She was also much more than that and we know her as a kind friend before we know her as a prison guard. A person reading about this trial would assume that Hanna was gulity as sin and deserves to die over her crimes against humanity. And yet we know the story is much more complicated than that. Who can question the shame that brings people to act as they do? Don't we all cover up shame and at what price? The author also raises the excellent question of what we as the next generation are to make of the Holocost, what are we to do with our knowledge? This book is beautifully written and highly recommended for those who want to ponder some issues and not simply be entertained."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is the story of a fifteen year old boy and a woman twice his age who find each other at the wrong time and place, not to mention their age gap. It is a story of love, lust, loneliness, hoplessnes and loyalty. I learned from this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is about a woman who is willing to go to prison rather than own up to the fact she cannot read. I thought that was a little silly, especially when there were holocaust issues to consider.

Was something essential lost in translation? It was a very quick and easy read - I can't say I lost interest in the story at any time, but nothing every seemed to actually happen in the story itself. When I finished it, I felt as though I'd just read an abridged version of a better novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a magnificent, thoughtful, lyrical work, one which is utterly unforgettable. The clash of morality and the deepest human love is explored in a way that provokes the most profound thoughts.

My advice to you obtuse, impervious folks: Stick to Danielle Steele."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I could not put this book down and eventhough I was somewhat uncomfortable with the characters' moral values I had to get to the bottom of this strange story.

You get very emotionally involved with the characters. I highly recommend it for anyone. Anyone who has anything negative to say about the book missed the point of what the author was trying to convey."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink's terse, strong writing provides an edgy counterpoint to his almost-parable of the conflicts of love and honor. The reader is dragged rather unwillingly into the discussion of how, and whether or not, one can provide one's own redemptive act to 'pay' society back. Our women's literature group was sharply divided on whether or not we 'liked' this book--but all agreed that it was important and provocative."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Every bit as good as The Triumph and the Glory, Memoirs of a Geisha, or any of the other mega-hits of the summer, The Reader is very intriguing, I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a rich, haunting, existential novel that offers new insights into the human condition with each revisiting. It belongs on the same shelf as Albert Camus' The Stranger, Ernest Becker's The Denial of Death, and Erich Fromm's Escape From Freedom. Its treatment of repression --- or numbed indifference -- as the pysche's defense against pain and horror is identical to that found in the film, The Pawnbroker. It's a book that resonates."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; should be read not in comparison to other much more complex contemporary novels, but must be read by those who wish to have a break from such complexity. It is a simple story that Schlink tells: a love affair between a boy and a woman. Yet it is dense in issues and themes that Schlink presents subtly: secrets and deceptions, courage and fear, love and lust between two people, each having a different history, and each from a different time and place. Schlink does not force the reader to think about the issues now, but puts the ideas in the reader's head to drift and wallow, until they evaporate. Schlink asks the question: Could love be possible in such a context? An answer to this question is a re-examination of the reader's values and morals. For this, &quot;The Reader&quot; becomes a sparkling grain of sand in a vast, vast beach."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The reader tells us of the emotional struggle of one who has been torn between his love for a woman and the knowledge that she has committed an unspeakable wrong. It evoked a lot of compassion in me. I cared about Hanna and Michaelm they seemed real to me. I could not stop turning the pages. Hanna's mysteriousness and Michael's behavior during her absence drew me in. Both sad and sweet in the beginning, the reader is unprepared for the harshness of Hanna's trial. I liked the way that this novel took three very different paths, although I was dissapointed by the ending, which I though lacked the same amount of feeling as the rest of the novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was instantly intrigued by a summary I read in the paper of this book. I finally purchased it and immediately began reading. It was slow at first and I only kept reading b/c I thought it would pick up - but it didn't. There really was no climax and the ending was depressing. I gave it 2 stars because it was a great plot, but it did not live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is not a book about a relationship. Although a relationship is the central element in the plot, the main focus of the book is what the relationship causes. This focus is aided by the fact that the book is narrated by one of the two main characters in an autobiographical form. This gives Schlink the ability to cast the characters in a protagonistic light in the beginning of the book. The reader is thus encouraged to grow familiar with the characters before knowing the whole story. Because of this, if the reader is willing to have his/her opinions challenged they will be, which in my mind makes this book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"An interesting and original twist on a worn theme. A unique thought process that delved further than than the &quot;facts&quot;, and delt more with happenings and emotions."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink succeeded in representing an average man's struggle to find love, and the unaverage man's resulting eternal misfortune. Mike Berg fell in love with Hanna Schmitz for obvious reasons at an extreme early age in his life: she pampered him like a helpless child and introduced him to physical love. However, when trying to capture love's essences apart from the physical, Mike soon learned that he was doomed to fail. Hanna, an overly insecure woman who focused only on her well being, became as ruthless as ever through verbal and physical abuse. As Hanna had undoubtedly been overly neglected in something as a child, her resulting actions only hurt her. Hanna had been ultimately charged with a crime committed as a guard in Nazi Germany that sent her to prison. One reading this novel may easily be persuaded, as Mike eventually seemed to be, that her evil actions became justified because of her insecurities. What one must keep in mind is that a lover would do anything to protect himself in a relationship, and believing her actions to be justified is a typical thing men do to reduce their own cognitive dissonance. If we believe Hanna's actions to be justified, we are looking at it subjectively, as Mike, or the author. Understanding Hanna as a self-centered sadist, I believe is the correct way to look at her because there are certainly some essential rights and wrongs in this world that there are no exceptions for. Hanna violated them, and coerced a man to obsess over her through excessive physical attention, mental neglect, abuse and abandonment."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought The Reader was a wonderful book with characters that could be easily identified with. My only qualms with the book were that it did tend to be a little slow at times and occassionally a bit hard to believe. I think that everyone who has read and enjoyed Camus' The Stranger should read The Reader as well. It was beautiful in its tragedy and heartbreak and yet not the least bit preachy or overdone. Simplicity worked well for The Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book has several areas of lovely, gripping description. But neither the verbal beauty of the book nor its plot is powerful enough to hold the reader. The book's strength lies in its characters; both the narrator and Hanna are strong, unique people who shine through the sometimes-oversimplified language used to describe them. I think the readers who will get the most out of this book are the ones who can relate to the characters--to their personalities, their experiences, or their guilt--regardless of the inadequacies of the text."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Schlink pulls her reader in from the very beginning. We then stay completely engaged by her imaginary, eroticism, and over-all flow throughout the novel, making it a quick and pleasurable read. However, this is certainly not the point of The Reader. It is profoundly thought provoking. While it is easy to get swept away the passion between Micheal and Hanna at the beginning of the novel, one must also keep in mind the historical context. It was (and is) such a difficult point in Germany's history. Hanna and Micheal are but devices for Schlink's ponderings on the issues that post WWII Germany faced. The real food for thought did not come from the romance, but from Micheal final musings on the &quot;collective guilt&quot;, and how it affected every aspect of his own story. Readers of The Reader should keep this in mind before being so quick to judge."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was somewhat disappointed by this book. With all of its back-cover promises of moral challenges to the reader, Schlink backed down precisely where he should have held his ground. By sentamentalizing his main conflict, he compromised any of the prospectively troubling situations he raised with the novel's unique multi-taboo premise. Where the novel could have been emotionally and intellectually effectual, it ended in being simply a somewhat forgettable, if enjoyable, piece."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This brief, very readable book moved and impressed me as none other since David Malouf's &quot;Conversations at Curlow Creek&quot; with which it shares the theme of profound human understanding and owned psychological falability. Schlink's writing is direct, unadorned (unlike Malouf) and beautifully paced, as well as nuanced. He made me feel sympathetic to Hanna, a woman who had participated in one of the horrors of our time. it's a moral tale without moralizing...a sign of greatness in my book!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I think the word I would have to use for this book is shocking. More than once I was shocked reading it and actually gasped at one point. The story starts with a young 15 year old boy being helped by an older lady when he is sick, upon returning to thank her for her help they embark upon a physical relationship. This in itself is quite shocking as she is around twice his age but the relationship is very turbulent and bizarre not counting the age issue.The book jumps on in years and Michael finds himself once again with Hanna in his life when he least expects it and a huge secret about her past. Does this explain why she was the way she was with him or is there something else she is keeping hidden?The book is written in very short chapters so makes for a quick read and the writing and story itself is very easy to follow. The end takes a turn that I was not expecting (as it had done at the beginning despite knowing a relationship was on the cards).The book has riled a few feathers with some readers as they feel the author trys to evoke sympathy for Hanna despite what she has done, some have slated the actual writing and felt the content was poor. I for the most part enjoyed the book and as I said it took a few turns I did not expect, it kept my interest and was for the most part easy reading. I think it is fair to say we have another marmite book, I am on the side of liking it and for me it is a 4/5."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Perhaps this one was better in the original German. I can't see what all the fuss is about. It didn't strike me as particularly well written nor did I care for the subject matter. Maybe it was just me...."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There were parts of this that were a bit hard to read, but I don't regret it at all. A beautiful, sad story. I was profoundly impressed."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One day fifteen year old Michael is on his way home from school when he becomes violently ill. A 36 year old woman named Hanna spots his distress, cleans him up and walks him home. Michael lands in bed with hepatitis for several weeks and when he recovers his mom asks him to personally thank Hannah for her kindness. And boy does she ever.The two become bed-mates for a time and she enjoys listening to Michael read to her. Michael fancies himself a little in love with Hanna despite her odd, aloof behavior. He also struggles with keeping the affair a secret and behaving like a normal teenager. The affair comes to an end when Hanna spots Michael swimming with friends and doesn't acknowledge her. Hanna then disappears.Years later Michael is a law student sitting in a courtroom and learns that Hanna is on trial for murder and that she spent time as a concentration camp guard for the Nazi's. As the trial continues Michael realizes he knows a secret that can significantly reduce her sentence. But it's a secret that Hanna has kept to herself entire life and he's unsure if he should speak out when she refuses to defend herself.This is a story with some heavy moral dilemma's but it's ultimately a story of regret of wasted lives. It's a quick read but not one, I think, I will easily forget."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is the kind of book that stirs many different feelings. It is complex, disturbing, heartwrenching and thought provoking. Everything a good book is all about."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book is divided roughly into three sections. The first is the encounter of the main character (Michael Berg) with the seducing woman (Hanna) and the subsequent readings; the second is his witnessing of her trail or what was behind the true nature of the woman who seduced him; and the last - takes place several years after his readings to Hanna when she is close to concluding her term of imprisonment.The first part is the strongest and most interesting as Michael attempts to explore the nature of his relationship to Hanna. I found the second part with its description of Hanna's performance at the trial to be very distant - almost like he didn't want to visualize her true nature and what she was capable of doing. Was this a metaphor for how Nazi Germany is viewed by Germans today?There is an initial intoxication with the erotic encounters; but after, the evil is viewed from afar. The trial is like a series of words that one reads through a telescope; as if these events did not happen from the same people and geography.The continued readings to Hanna could be interpreted as an attempt to educate her - to remove her from the Nazi past.I found the movie (of the same title) much more emotional; it added needed feeling to the raw complexity of the story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a great book in part because of the literary traditions and associations with which it finds itself. I was immediately reminded of Marguerite Duras' The Lover, which describes her youthful affair with a Chinese man, and is somewhat similar not only in subject matter but also in tone: there is an atmosphere of shadows, veils, floating memories, punctuated by arresting physical detail. The Reader is a classic 'coming of age' story, which in this cultural context is also a part of the German Bildungsroman. A meditation on the role of memory and search for truth personally is echoed by the search for truth in German society of the 1960s, which reminded me of my favorite movie of all time, Die Zweite Heimat. However, this general motif of memory and truth is latent throughout the 20th Century, beginning with Proust, and is perhaps most urgent in Holocaust literature. In Panorama, by Czech novelist H.G. Adler, a Jewish academic who survived Birkenau and Buchenwald, and the perils of representation his main character, Josef Kramer, observes how \\"unreal it is when one gets involved with past suffering,\\" because each person's experience is too intimate and terrible to be fully conveyed. Ultimately, Adler writes, \\"one can see others but never reach them.\\" That book chronicles the past in every traceable detail, while this one builds a story, many stories, actually, according to the narrator, but this is the one he settled upon. In that regard, we also have to consider the 'reliability' of the narrator dealing truthfully with his own past, his own agenda or baggage.Inevitably, we're invited to ruminate on the crime of sexually abusing a minor, which isn't taken as seriously in this culture when an older woman 'seduces' a young man. We don't know what the 'age of consent' is however in the Reader's world, and there is never any hint that 'legality' or discovery was a strong concern.It's also difficult to sort the issue of abuse to the phenomenon of being scarred by love, or something like it, the 'regular' abuse of a love affair gone bad. The narrator observes that all's badly that ends badly, which is a variation of the Shakespearean observation that all's well that ends well. Still, isn't in the case that all love affairs end badly, or in marriage. Abuse or not, it is clear that an important relationship can have consequences both near and long term. In the short term after the affair ends there is a \\"juxtaposition of callousness and extreme sensitivity seemed suspicious even to me.\\" 2.1 In the long term, the consequences are visited on his daughter Julia, because his ex-wife Gertrud compares badly.The most daring comparison is the experience of a love affair gone badly and the Holocaust: \\"my love for Hanna was, in a way, the fate of my generation, a German fate, and...it was only more difficult for me to evade, more difficult for me to manage...\\" 3.1 And, \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it.\\" 2.15 The \\"numbness\\" of the daughter who spent time in the camps and the narrator's \\"numbness\\" are compared explicitly. The juxatposition of investigating Hanna's 'crime against love' and 'crime against humanity' is fascinating. It is implied that the narrator's studious involvement with exposing German collaboration wit the Nazis made him feel that he \\"belonged, and that I was at peace with myself about what I was doing\\" in the seminar studying the camps, which alienated many. 3.1 It is more human to be able to relate to an individual, and it's difficult to relate to a huge number. We feel the loss of one more than the loss of twenty million. Even visiting the death camp, it was incomprehensible. Is this self indulgent moral myopia, or a gateway to trying to understand the huge loss? How do we face the incomprehensible in the most public, and the most private, of circumstances?A darkly amusing motif is the incapacity of conventional means of understanding or resolving these difficulties. Philosophically, this is the case in the encounter of the narrator with his father, who failed to give him satisfying advice, and especially lawyers. The trial which occupies most of the second section is filled with obfuscation of the truth. Hanna in the dock seemed as lost as Meursault in the Stranger, caught up in the process of a society finding an explanation and finding someone blameworthy.Is the third section necessary? on the one hand yes, to understand the effects of the relationship. it wouldn't be a complete story. but no, on the other, the story is complete as she is sentenced to life. There would be no resolution of the relationship as it were, but wouldn't that have been a more honest assessment of the love affair, and even the larger question of the Holocaust in German society? Although it may not be necessary to include III, it would be a different book entirely, and more truthful in a sense. The least successful passages occur in the third section, where the author descends from showing to pontificating, as in 3.4, where there is a an extended meditation on escape, the past, the present and future. That isn't to say that astute observations aren't continually made,e.g. about whether 'late' is 'too late', or the nature of handwriting, communication, reading, the distinction between 'light' notes withstnding the weight of 'actual closeness'.Finally, the title is intriguing. This title boils the narrator down to a single function, the Reader. It might be useful to consider a thought experiment of different titles. The Lover. The Student. The Lawyer. Of all these roles, this story focuses on this unique aspect of the relationship. But, what about those young women that Hanna forced to read to her before she sent them off to their deaths? Maybe this story is more properly 'A Reader.' And, after all, we're the readers, too."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book worked best for me as a sort of \\"parable\\", although I'm not certain to what extent the allegory--if any--was intended. Naive 15 year old Michael Berg is sick on the street and a woman cleans him up and guides him home. Later Michael's mother sends him by to thank the woman with a bouquet, and the pair begin a steamy, illicit (and illegal?) affair, part of their ritual being that Michael reads aloud to the woman, Hanna, until she mysteriously disappears. Years later Michael sits in on a trial for war-crimes and recognizes Hanna as one of the defendants. In terms of allegory, Michael seems to represent an idealistic German people besotted with--yet ignorant of--the alluring, dangerous fascist state and must come to terms with this love affair for the rest of his life. Also fascinating is the take on the postwar German generation who must grow up doubting/questioning the authority of their parents, the generation who allowed the holocaust to happen. For all these lofty themes, Michael's story is (mostly) related in simple, pared-down, stark prose that matches the subject matter well. Michael's occasional digressions into philosophy and law slow things down in the middle. Some of it comes off as authorial self-indulgence, perhaps, but also touches on some important and relevant aspects of guilt and laying blame. It can be difficult at times to identify with the perpetually moping Michael and cold Hanna (whose secret is fairly obvious early on). The ending left me rather cold and numb--the author's intent?--but I actually prefer the way the novel has recently transferred to the screen, especially the semblance of closure the film offers versus the open ending here."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"After seeing the movie, I was looking forward to reading the book to tie up some large loose ends. While the book was more insightful, I was still left with unanswered questions and no real sense of closure.The story takes place 30 years or so in post World War II Germany and uses the Holocaust as the backdrop for a plot that centers around a passionate and yet mysterious love affair between an attractive 36 year old woman, Hanna Schmitz who befriends a 15 year boy, Michael Berg on the way home from school when he falls ill. Michael is soon bewitched by the older woman and an obsessive love affair blossoms. Hanna delights in being read aloud to from various literature classics that Michael is studying in high school and over time this becomes something of a ritual that unites the two. As their relationship deepens, however, he is puzzled by her bouts of moodiness and at times secretiveness. Some months later, Hanna abruptly and mysteriously quits her job and leaves town with no word of where or why she has gone.Flash forward 10 years and Michael, a law student, is assigned to attend a local trial of 5 woman charged as Nazi war criminals, accused of unspeakable crimes against prisoners while serving as prison guards at a Nazi death camp. Much to his horror, Michael discovers that Hanna is one of the defendants. However, during the trial, he also discovers a secret that Hanna has been hiding for years that may explain, although not condone, her behavior as a prison guard and as his lover.What follows is a deep psychological exploration by Michael into the motives and drives behind both those who participated in the Holocaust and those who committed no atrocities and yet passively turned a blind eye to the crimes both during and after the war.Although the plot is very good, I never really learned why the primary characters failed to act or speak up at crucial times when doing so could have easily lessened the burdens that haunted them. While many may argue that this was precisely the message of the book I still found the lengths to which this occurred to be unreasonable given the specifics the story provides, especially with regards to Michael's inactions later in the book. I felt like the story could have been much more satisfying had the author provided more insight into what Hanna was truly thinking and feeling as well as why Michael failed to make more of an effort to understand Hanna rather than just lamely guess at why she acted the way she did."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"One gets weary of WW2 novels but this was clever. Young man meets an older lady and has a relationship that becomes part of his life and hers. Fast forward and back and the tale is complete. She is constant through their relationship. He waffles and stays close. His connection keeps him from developing as an adult male. She completes her journey through life. The main concern is that his voice never changes much as he grows older. She stays consistant."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I often read the amazon.com customer reviews after I've read the book, as a substitute for a good book club discussion. It was interesting to me that so many people disliked The Reader. Almost all of my favorite books have centered on a strong female character, with multidimensional characters, detailing of events and lush description. I can't even remember a favorite book with a male protagonist. Spare prose is normally depressing to me. Thus, I was surprised at how much I loved this book. The spare style is perfect for the author's purpose in that it allows the reader to fully reflect upon and identify with the moral questions; allowing you to examine the answers to those questions in your own life and in the collective consciousness. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is a metaphor for the post- and pre-war generations, respectively. I see Michael's love for Hanna as the love that generation had for both it's parents and pre-war Germany. It is only after the KNOWLEDGE of their involvement with the Holocaust that there is shame and guilt over that love, even though the love was experienced after the actual fact of it. Towards the end, Michael realizes that his desire for Hanna did not have her as its object; it was, in a sense, a desire to come home (almost exact quote). this implies a desire to return to the hearth of childhood, i.e., a time before the war. In the past 6 months, I've started a dozen books and not finished one. I'm a pretty picky reader. I loved Schlink's prose and ideas. That I could love a book so seemingly contrary to my idea of &quot;a good read&quot;, and that it could make me think more than any book in recent memory, puts me in awe of The Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I feel like I haven't read a good book in so long-- correction, felt. I have told all my friends about this book. It gripped my life for the few days I was reading it. I had just finished The Notebook and felt incredibly uninformed and dumb. It was so wonderful to read things that made my mind being to twist and contort in new thoughts again. I think the thing I adored most about the book was the analogies. There are more underlined words in my copy than not underlined. I haven't actually cared about a book in a long time. Throughout parts II and III I was totally held in suspense. If given the chance I would kiss Bernhard Schlink's feet. I loved it! If you like the romance stuff, part I will completely fulfill you. If you like the fast paced intellectual action, part II will keep you on your feet. And if you love plot twists, stick around for part III. Seriously people, you cannot pass this book by. You have to meet Hannah, wonder about this time period, go through the confusion and anger of it all. I adored it! Those of you who had tons to say about this book-- please e-mail me. I would love to hear it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is one of the worst books I have every read. Part I was simply awful.

I eased into my couch (it's a cushy couch), tossed a blanket over me, took a sip of my tea, and then lifted the first page of The Reader. In one afternoon I read the book cover to cover. I sat there wondering what would happen to Michael Berg (the narrator). How would these events affect the rest of his life? How would they affect my own? It made me realize the impact of one decision, not only on one's own life, but on many. I can't tell you what happened otherwise I would give away the story, but let me say that the story was told simply though the topics were far from simple. I found a connection with Berg's reflectiveness and hoped him well. A very good book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book starts out promising and goes downhill fast. It was predictable.

This book does an excellent job in describing and emoting that numbness of the Germans. I was disappointed in the character development of the book. I did not get a sense of any real personal growth from either of the characters; other than the oft used learning to read in jail motif. I was extremely disappointed in the narrator's lack of development; maybe that is part of the numbness... I enjoyed the read and am thankful for the reiteration of the holocaust experience. This horror should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is so rare that I come away from a book almost in a state of speechlessness.

The story twists and turns until one day for no apparent reason, the woman dissappears. Years go by. The boy grows up and we are introduced to the womans background.She is brought up on horrendous charges which I don't want to go into, for the reader's sake, and there is a trial.The book gets it's name from the fact that when she was having her affair with the boy she has him read to her.Read it.

However, no book has moved me as much as this one. Written by a German, this book takes a completely different approach to the topic of the holocaust and the rise of the Nazis, a human approach. It allows the reader to read about this time without feeling intimated or uncomfortable. Schlink broaches the subject in a very unique way, very indirectly, but lets the reader understand the horrors of that period in German history - I was very moved. The story itself is very clever and well written. It's hard to say that one enjoyed reading about such a topic, but it was for me a very refreshing and refined way to look at how this period in German history affected Germans. Not in an in your face way.

Sometimes I poked at them, and imaged Hanna doingwhat she was accused of doing as clearly as I could, and alsodoing what the hair on her neck and the birthmark on her shoulder recalled to my mind. It was like a hand pinching an arm numbed by an injection. The arm doesn't register that it is being pinched by the hand, the hand registers that it is pinching the arm, and at first the mind cannot tell the two of them apart. But a moment later it distinguishes them quite clearly. Perhaps the hand has pinched so hard that the flesh stays white for a while. Then the blood flows back and the spot regains its color. But that does not bring back sensation.I tried to talk about the problem with friends. Imagine someone is racing intentionally towards his own destruction and you can save him-do you go ahead and save him? Imagine there's an operation, and the patient is a drug user and the drugs are incompatible with the anesthetic, but the patient is ashamed of being an addict and does not want to tell the anesthesiologist-do you talk to the anesthesiologist? Imagine a trial and a defendant who will be convicted if he doesn't admit to being left-handed-do you tell the judge what's going on? Imagine he's gay, and could not have committed the crime because he's gay, but is ashamed of being gay. It isn't a question of whether the defendant should be ashamed of being left-handed or gay-just imagine that he is.I tried to approach my later relationships better, and to get into them more deeply. I admitted to myself that a woman had to move and feel a bit like Hanna, smell and taste a bit like her for things to be good between us. I told them about Hanna. And I told them more about myself than I had told Gertrud; they had to be able to make sense of whatever they might find disconcerting in my behavior and moods. But the women didn't want to hear that much. I remember Helen, and American literary critic who stroked my back silently and soothingly as I talked, and continued to stroke me just as silently and soothingly after I'd stopped speaking. Gesina, a psychoanalyst, thought I needed to work through my relationship with my mother. Did it not strike me that my mother hardly appeared in my story at all? Hilke, a dentist, kept asking about the time beforewe met, but immediately forgot whatever I told her. So I stoppedtalking about it. There's no need to talk, because the truth of what one says lies in what one does."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was an okay read. I haven't read many books with a male perspective and it was a refreshing change to have \\"The Reader\\" tell the story of our male hero. (Most of the books I read have female characters as the main focus).I thought the story was original, and dealt with difficult subject matter: Hannah seducing our hero when he was only 15, the shame and secrecy of illiteracy, and Hannah being put on trial for her crimes in a Nazi concentration camp. It is not an uplifting story, but it kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next. I was a bit perplexed at their relationship, and found myself wondering if the only substance to it was of a sexual nature.I found the ending a bit rushed, and not quite satisfying for that reason. Overall, this book was a very quick read, and is only worth about 3 stars."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an interesting parable, as appropriate for today's financial scandals as for the aftermath of the Nazi era which it depicts, with its focus on the consequences of tacitly \\"going along to get along\\" instead of making moral choices.It begins with a 15-year-old boy who has a tempestuous affair with a 36-year-old woman -- two people at the height of their sexuality who are mutually exploitative. But, they also have a sense of responsibility for each other; Hanna Schmitz insists that Michael Berg apply himself to his schoolwork, in return, he reads a variety of books to her (her shortcoming is illiteracy).Now, think of this in terms of some recently failed businesses; where the chief executive is obsessed with showing profits or making his company the dominant one in its field. So, the books are cooked to show desirable results -- and, the employees who must \\"go along to get along.\\"Hanna's story is of an illiterate peasant girl swept into the Nazi SS during the war, ending the war guarding some concentration camp inmates who die brutally. She had many opportunities to spare them, but refused on the grounds of loyalty to what she saw as duty rather than an ethical issue of humanity by doing what was right. Think of her in terms of employees of companies who remain silent in the face of wrong doing rather than \\"betray\\" a greater loyalty to the business.In brief, it's a parable about the price of doing right in contrast to the expediency of \\"going along to get along.\\" Hanna is eventually brought to trial for her wartime actions and sent to prison; Michael becomes a lawyer, with a career that is haunted by Hanna and their relationship. Both used each other, and as a result both hurt each other.Sound familiar ? Of course, it's the age-old story of the consequences of taking ethical shortcuts for personal profit or pleasure. How many Europeans made similar choices in World War II ? How many business executives made similar choices in recent years to enhance their reputations or profit ?\\"Ah, you want to understand why people can do such terrible things,\\" a motorist asks Michael when he at last decides to visit a concentration camp to try to understand what Hanna did during the war. Hanna's whole life was a lie, her complicity with evil had a devastating impact on others -- not because she was inherently bad -- but because of her tendency of \\"going along to get along\\" rather than facing any risk or hardship.Even after her conviction, Hanna had \\"A proud, wounded, lost, and infinitely tired look. A look that wished to see nothing and no one.\\" Think of contemporary executives who destroy their companies by endorsing expediency rather than ethics, and proudly refuse to say as much as \\"I'm sorry\\" for the harm they cause.Schlink used a horrific example to make his point; he is a law professor, skilled in dealing with the aftermath of cases where expediency overrules ethics and morals. But, to a much lesser degree, it is a choice we all face -- using an expedient \\"white lie\\" rather than upset a friend or colleague with some honest advice.Do we ever escape the consequences of such actions ?A few sentences from the end of his parable, Schlink writes: \\"The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on the top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as a matter that has been fully formed an pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive.\\"Think of it the next time you tell a white lie, or decide \\"going along to get along\\" is better than being honest to yourself and others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This emotional book is worth the read for its ability to make one think about the many issues that were layed out brilliantly: a young man and an older lover, his high social status versus her working class, his education versus her ignorance. Add to that the guilt that the new generation of Germans who had nothing to do with the Nazis are still faced with; the guilt that is the curse of their heritage.Schlink brings all of these points togther for a fascinating and emotional book through the poignant characters of Michael and Hanna.Although the translation creates stilted reading (thus 4 stars and not 5), I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I haven't read this book yet, but I never will because it's on Oprah's Book club.

So there."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found the subject of a young man having an affair with an older woman disturbing. There was too much focus on the affair, and not enough on the real story; the woman's involvement in the Hitler times.

So if you liked that book, then buy this one."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader captivated me from the outset and never let go. It is one of the most moving books I've ever read. It's also the only book that my book club has unanimously loved in the 2 years that we've been meeting. I can't imagine anyone not feeling as if they've learned something valuable about human nature after reading it. If you only read one book this year, make it The Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Once again, Oprah has chosen a book and turned it into an immediate bestseller. Even acknowledging that every reader must bring his or her own body of information to understanding a particular work, I found THE READER to be totally predictable.This obviously autobiographical novel is set in the Germany immediately following World War II. It concerns the fortuitous love affair between an adolescent boy and a mature woman.There's plenty of foreshadowing, so the reader instantly realizes that this woman harbors shameful secrets. Considering the moment in time, it is easy to guess at what those secrets may be.It is a telling comment on the attitudes of the Nazis that the secret that a modern person, of any non-German background, will find so horribly appalling is not the same fact which so shames the woman. Instead, there is another secret which she would choose death over revealing.I found nothing surprising in any aspect of the tale. Since I read it in English, having been translated from the German, I am not able to say whether the quality of the writing of the original was superior. The translation certainly was acceptable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Perhaps it lost something in the translation? This book could have been a decent short story but unfortunately it just dragged on and on. The characters were flat and unpolished. The message was merely whispered, and almost lost entirely in the cliche romance. This book failed to evoke any emotion, and the ideas behind it seemed unfinished and confused. The holocaustic backdrop seems to be more of a commercial hype machine than anything necessary for the progress of the story. This is one of those books you might pick up at the airport and finish only because your flight is long. Skip it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a classic book that is part of \\"Oprah's Book Club.\\" I gave it three stars because I do see some merit in the book. It has been translated from the original German text. It is well written yet the plot seems vague and loosely formed. The style of the author somewhat reminds me of the style of The Virgin Suicides. I know that this book is being turned into a movie, probably thanks to Oprah. The author gives the reader some play in how we will interpret the book. The style is different that what I'm used to but I definitely see the merit of The Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one of those rare instances in which the film is better than the novel. Kate Winslet is beyond belief in the role - as is everyone else in the movie. Another film you might like that comes up to this one, on the same subject: \\"The Music Box\\" with Jessica Lange. Wow. In fact, that one is even more vivid, however, thanks to the performances, \\"The Reader\\" is also a major stand-out."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Maybe it's the translation, but what was the point of this book? It struck me as entirely superficial. The one interesting point raised is how the generation after the Nazis felt, and how they coped, and it is glossed over and dropped.Don't bother."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really liked this novel, not just because of the content but because the size of the column of text on each page is so narrow that it can be read in just a few hours. Kept me interested and made me think."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I just had to write a response to Cybertoe.

I am glad I did. The story line is like none I have ever read before. It made me think what I would have done in the subject's shoes. It was worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read quite a lot about the Holocaust, most of it is, understandably, from the victims' perspective. I found it eerie and fascinating to read an account of the Holocaust atrocities, from a post-war German author. The book takes a grip on you, causing you to think about the story and it's meaning weeks after reading it. From a literary point of view, too, the book is compelling - the language is austerely beautiful, the way the sentances are strung together makes the prose seem like stark poetry at times... I recommend the book highly, and was very saddened to find that some readers gave this superb literary accomplishment 1 star - I hope (and assume) most of them didn't read the book. You should."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I picked this book up not realizing it was one of Oprah's book club picks. Once I started the book, I couldn't put it down. Mr. Schlink's writing style is unique and refreshing. His perspective and presentation of the story is detached and without judgement. The tale allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusion on the subject and it is intellectually provoking. I look forward to more titles from Mr. Schlink. He is unique. I recommend the book highly!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A rare book that I will remember for a long time. I can rarely tolerate fiction, but I found this author's writing very effective and haunting. The book is a quick read but worth the time.

I was amazed on how Schlink was able to evoke imagery and range of depth in such a succinct fashion, while not sacrificing believability and humanity in the characters; I was sad to say good bye."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed by this book. It might have worked better for me as a short story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is an interesting book in that it reads as a simple novel of a young man's first sexual experience with an older woman, and yet we all know it is so much more than that. Like all stories relating to the holocaust it is disturbing and I found myself thinking of the story long after I finished reading it. But I also wanted more - I wanted to know more about both of the major characters, and what drove them both. I wanted more of the history, horrifying and disturbing though it is. I wanted to identify with them both because what makes a truly great book is the ability to absorb the reader into the story. It is a very good book, but it just falls short of being a great book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A really different kind of book from Oprah but one that is powerful and compelling. I'm glad to see Oprah pick something so thought provoking. I would like to suggest that she pick FRIED CALAMARI next month."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; has been a bestseller in Australia for about six months so I was surprised to receive an email from Amazon to let me know that this was Oprah's newest book club selection. Not that it worried me. In fact this proved to be of benefit as this meant that I could read a book at the same time as it was supposed to be and not the two months later when it actually arrived on our shores. The reason I think that it has done so well here is not so much that it is about the Holocaust but more so that as people we are fascinated and intrigued and are constantly looking for some sort of understanding of why we do the horrible things we do to each other. This is is why I think what the &quot;The Reader&quot; sets out to do and what it actually involves is not so much the telling of the people of the Holocaust but those looking back on it. To read statements further down this page by people who haven't even READ the book troubles me as it would seem to me that this idea that &quot;The Reader&quot; is set in or is predominantly about the Holocaust is being pedalled. Those reading this review please understand that it is not. In fact it will be interesting to see when they make the movie - and you know they will - whether they focus on the love story or the courtroom angle. This is a lovely little story told in a very big way. Sure there are some times when you can really see that this has been translated with some inappropriately short sentences, but once you get past it you'll find like I did, I'm sure, that &quot;The Reader&quot; is a story about us as people and not so much the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed this book, but I found it lacking in charactor development particularly in the case of Michael. Perhaps it was the main charactor's detatchment from his family, friends; everyone but Hanna. Although perhaps this is what made this book brief and to the point. It wasn't until the end, that I could really feel for the main charactors. Believe it or not, I felt intensely sad for Hanna. She seemed to be an ignorant woman, who had made horrendous choices in her life, and then was left to reflect upon them for years. Ultimately killing herself rather than go on living. The scene in the book that particularly bothered me was when Michael finally goes to see her in prison. &quot;I saw the expectation in her face, saw it light up with joy when she recognized me, watched her eyes scan my face as I approached, saw them seek, inquire, then look uncertain and hurt, and saw the light go out of her face.&quot; This woman saw judgement everywhere, and I believe became involved with Michael as boy out of extreme loneliness and unbelievable shame. While her actions were deplorable, I still found sympathy in her charactor. Michael was aloof and alone by choice. I felt his anger through most of the book, and only saw a glimpse of his humanity at the end."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader could've been one of those truly riveting, thought-provoking books which linger in the minds of readers because of the humanness of its characters against events and conditions devoid of humanness. However, Mr. Schlink's executions renders the characters, especially the protagonist, so detached and aloof and without human depth that the story itself losses its sting. The first part was exquisitely written but once the narrator grows up, the novel falters. Mr. Schlink seems fearful of empowering the narrator with anything more than the basest and most rudimentary of emotions when the situation, the importance of the story itself, called for it. A good read, but not the one it has been made out to be..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Americans hold the firm belief that all Germans living during the Third Reich have been &quot;willing executioners&quot; and, given the chance, those living nowadays also would be. Never in a million years a book written by a German author dealing with the most German of all topics of this century could even come close to a bestselling list in the US. Being an Oprah recommendation means for a book that it is an easygoing read totally lacking any depth. Now, to my great astonishment, browsing through the Amazon homepage, I found out that the &quot;Vorleser&quot;, as the book's title is in its original language, has made it to the top of the Amazon bestselling list, obviously due to a daring Oprah recommendation. Can this be true? Isn't this only a practical joke of a computer kid hacking in the Amazon homepage? If not so, this would mean that indeed postwar Germany is being regarded and treated as a &quot;normal&quot; country, something Germans of my generation (born in the Sixties) always dreamt of but never thought of being possible to come true. Then, we would not object to some of our most dear prejudices on Americans being shattered with a mighty bang. By the way, in Germany the book was quite a success but never reached any top positions and did not create any public discussion of the kind as it started in the Amazon reviews and probably in the American public. I still cannot believe it !!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Having grown up in postwar Germany, as a German, I only gradually learned of the terrible history of the war and the crimes of the Holocaust. Naturally, this raised many doubts and questions in my mind as to where my loyalties should lie. How can I accept that this horror touched everyone's lives and only a few were willing to stand against it? This book deals with exactly the same problem - a young man falls in love with an older woman with a secret past, later revealed in the book as a Holocaust crime. How is he to reconcile his feelings for her with his abhorrence of her actions? This book is a relevant and necessary read for anybody who has ever asked him/herself questions like these. It is not a book to be read when one only has a few minutes here and there. Its soul-searching essence is revealed through careful and thoughtful reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A lot is packed into this quick-read. A reader needs to &quot;feel&quot; for the protagonist; therefore, at first, the lack of background character development is bothersome. Yet, as you read further, you'll find this stripped approach adds to the starkness of the subject matter. You'll find yourself thinking about aspects of this book long after you've put it down (war atrocities, complicated love, self-guilt, etc.)."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Please note that the reviewers who didn't like this book, also can't spell very well.

It's disturbing but it's also a very good book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a wonderful book, extremely well-crafted and rather thought-provoking. Ironically enough, it is probable that the literacy of those individuals who disliked the book is questionable at best. Perhaps these individuals should go back to reading their types of literary masterpieces (such as Micheal Crichton and JOhn Grisham novels). Oprah does have an incredible amount of power.

Fairly good writing, poor novel.A compelling part one, a curious look at a dysfunctional relationship, setting up an exploration deeper into the two main characters...one that has no payoff whatsoever. This is simply a lazily written novel. If given its due, perhaps twice the heft of the published form, perhaps we could have learned something about Hanna and Michael, but no.Part 2 is an unfeeling, surface exposition. Details are employed for episodes unrelated to the characters or their plights.Michael feels absolutely nothing when he sees Hanna in the courtroom. Utterly inconceivable. Persistent numbness is not an endearing quality for protagonists. The build up was great and Schlink gypped the reader.Michael: \\"I felt nothing...why could that be?...I've often wondered...hmm, strange.\\" Not verbatim, but that's the depth of his exploration. Weak.All of the episodes that would constitute a novel are passed over as recollection. When Schlink needs a plot point, he invents a recollection, everything else is forgotten by the narrator. How many times does the narrator admittedly not recall some detail or another? That would be fine if all of these blank memories led to a greater understanding of the character, if the reason for his inconsistent recollections was elucidated later in the novel, but it was not.Schlink scratched the surface everywhere but in the first part. By the end of the novel I expected Michael to feel nothing in reaction to some event or revelation, I expected him to do nothing in response to the challenges beset upon him (by a lazy novelist), and those expectations were met.The tiny points of conflict were brush strokes, undeveloped, and reeked of deus ex machina, therefore. The gentleman who picked him up hitchhiking leapt right into the heart of the conflict, being brash and forthright in a totally unbelievable way. The same with the survivor at the end of the story. \\"So you slept with her.\\" The way Schlink shoved the character right into that degree of confrontation was unbelievable.It seems that Schlink decided to write short, thumbnail chapters and squeezed the story into that format, rather then letting the story dictate its length and the length of the chapters.It irks me that such books are touted as exemplary by the Oprah's Book Club brand. The classics she chooses are indisputable (by and large) and the modern works are all over the map. The brand on modern literature now reads \\"AVOID!\\" for this and other disparaging experiences, not to mention the Frey debacle. I think her book club is a good thing only in that it get a lot of people reading literature who might otherwise click on the tube, but I can only hope that some of those people develop a discerning palate for the books they read. If they read for escape, that's fine, but they are missing out on a great deal of what fiction has to offer."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"While at the dentist office recently the hygienist and I disagreed on the timeline of the movie-The Reader- we had both seen.

Although there were a few slow moments, I thought it was a great read, and a truly touching novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The reader is definitely worth reading. In the beginning, the author created a dramatic scene which led the two main significant characters to meet. It raised eyebrows, as the author describes the controversial issue of a young boy falling in lust/love with an older woman.Later on, the author conveys two types of passion: a sexual/physical passion which heightens as the boy continues to quench his sexual thirst from Hanna and a passion for culture, knowledge, and imagination as Hanna continues to persuade her young mate to read to her.Both characters had needs... they both knew what they wanted from each other yet it was not revealed until years later.The book had history because it referenced one of the most important and unforgettable period in the past. It also brought up a question on integrity and pride. This book made me think about how integrity and pride become important factors in our decision making.

At least it was a short read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was different, but that made it very refreshing. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was so much, I can only address a small part of it here. As an adult daughter of German immigrants, I have struggled my whole life with the guilt of the Holocaust. My parents are in their late fifities, and were young children during the war. My grandfathers both served in the war; one as a soldier who was held prisoner of war, the other (an epileptic unable to be a soldier) sent to a concentration camp by his neighbor for speaking out against the Nazi's. The neighbor's family and mine had lived and farmed next door to each other for over 100 years. This book identifies my personal identity crisis; proud of the rich history of my German heritage, the music, the land, the wine; yet ashamed of this horrific offense to mankind.Secondly, I think that Hannah attempts to hold us all responsible for social issues that affect our own country, wherever that may be. In asking the judge, &quot;What would you have done?&quot; I think that she also asks us, &quot;What have you done, what are you doing?&quot; The author chooses illiteracy as a modern plague, there are certainly others. What have you done about youth violence, the homeless, the mentally ill, racism? What are you doing to end child exploitation, domestic violence, poverty? Hannah attempts to hold us individually accountable. She also offers a warning. Do you expect the governemnt to address these issues? Due you allow them the authority to act upon moral issues on your behalf? If so, you, we, are at risk for another 'Holocaust'."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This author has a way of engaging one into his narration and story at once. It was beautifully written. It was full of believable characters, and the pain of a horrific time in history. As a Jewish woman I was highly impressed and touched by the sensitivity and clarity of this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was really excited to read this book, and the writing was amazing. I read it all in one sitting but mostly because I was waiting for it to get good. After I read the book I was confused as to weather or not I liked it, I loved the way he wrote, the imagery and sybolism, but the plot itself was lacking."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The beautiful prose in this book really helped create vivid and believeable images in the reader's mind- I couldn't stop reading once I started- the author takes you on a journey through many moving and personal memeories, and you are engaged right from the first sentence..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Everyone suggested that it was a real quick read-short in length and you can't put it down. Well, I had a hard time picking it UP!!! I despised Hanna even before her past was exposed. The book was hard to get through but I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I found it very disappointing!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"DON'T WASTE ANYTIME ON THIS BOOK. I COULD BARELY GET THRU IT. SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO FINISH IT SO I WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE I HAD WASTED MONEY BUYING IT."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read the book in 4 hours. I'm not trying to say it was an easy read, but wow, what an interesting one at that. In the beginning, I was a bit embarrassed at the fact that my nana was the one who recommended it to me. I didn't really see the importance at first of the author's need to be so specific with their sexual encounters. But as I read on, towards the end, I realized just how important it was that he included those details for his readers in order to understand the effect Hannah had on Michael. An effect that never escaped him. I'm sure glad nana didn't let her delicate side interfere with her recommendation of the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I find it interesting that many don't value a work unless they can &quot;like&quot; the story or characters. This book poses questions that shake belief. Its value is in the simple presentation of the complexity of human experience once judgement is set aside."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was good, a good read, but it lacked something that would make it great. It's thought provoking, but I don't see people getting much out of it unless they actually paid attention in High School English (as I did) and can take the symbolism and style to the next level. I almost was talked out of reading this BECAUSE of the Oprah recommendation."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am from England and grew up with a different view of the Germans and the war(Schooling and peers). I found it very interesting to get a &quot;German&quot; view, be it fiction or not. I enjoyed the book and I would be interested to read more of Mr. Schlinks work."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As one reviewer stated, this is really 4 books. I would give the first 3 1* and the last 3*. Who couldn't figure out early that Hanna couldn't read? Isn't it widely known that when an adolescent has sex with a mature adult, that adolescent will eventually have severe psychological problems? And, I found Hanna's desire to hide her problem at all costs to be unbelievable. And, for someone like Michael who let his life revolve around his affair with Hanna, and then to not &quot;rescue&quot; her or contact her in prison, well, it just didn't jell. I just didn't care about the book and I certainly didn't have any feeling for Michael."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I would put this on a ten-best list. Well written with an interesting if unremarkable story on the surface, but beneath the lines, provocative moral questions just itching for discussion... formost in my mind: Can one generation really judge another?????"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I felt this book very interesting in that Hanna's illeteracy was evident from the very beginning however the other issues were not,including the ending which quite surprized me.The guilt that the main characters felt has stayed in mind and made me realize that one never knows how one will react or feel until being put in a particular situation. Every one should read this book with the knowledge that Hanna cannot read but really that is not the sole or main &quot;story&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"While I was captured by the beginning of The Reader, I soon found myself longing to put it down, and had to force myself to finish. When I did, I realized why. When finished, the reader hasn't learned any lessons, there was nothing to take with you. I wasn't sure what the story's moral was, nor was I sure that I wanted to know."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am stunned to see reviewers here use words such a \\"totally devoid of emotion and character development... shallow... simplistic and trite\\" to describe The Reader. But then this is America, where few have an appreciation for anything subtle or understated. For too many people here, \\"If it ain't in your face, it ain't there.\\" Just compare, for example, French films and American films.Bravo, Oprah... keep challenging the depressing status quo of the average American. If anyone really stops to THINK for a few minutes, they might realize what a tragic, profound, heartbreaking story this book paints. There is a complex universe beneath the surface simplicity."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I had great expectations for this book, as it was an Oprah book selection and dealt with a subject that I find intriguing--the Holocaust and the concentration camps. However, I could not get into this book. I didn't think Hanna's character was developed enough, and I just couldn't get into the main character at all. It was mildly entertaining, but that's the most I can say for it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a book that will bite into your heart and not let go. It will drag you, bewildered and yet mesmerized, into its intricate world of tortured betrayal, obsessive love, and layer upon layer of gripping moral conflicts. I was torn between adoration and loathing, finally succumbing to the absolute magic of the story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Having read &quot;White Oleander&quot;, &quot;She's Come Undone&quot; and &quot;Vinegar Hill&quot;, I made the assumption that &quot;The Reader&quot; was an intellectual and cultured choice made by the new-age matron of popular fiction, Oprah Winfrey. I should've known by now that you never assume ANYTHING. &quot;The Reader&quot;, in my opinion, was a beautiful, crisp, fragrant ten-dollar bill held high above the menacing abyss of a cold, porcelain toilet and sucked down into the typhoon of chlorine and waste matter with revolting fury and impenitent spite. I am sorely regretful that I ever spent one red cent on that book because the story was incredibly disinteresting and the diminutive plot infuriated me. I went through 207 pages to find out that the pedophilic Hannah was short on common sense, couldn't read worth a lick and was responsible for the death of 20 some odd Jews. I can understand the terrifying reference to the Holocaust (the church incident), but this is a character I simply cannot have any sympathy for or any understanding. She has sex with a fifteen-year-old boy, and even though both parties are willing, I do not consider it consensual sex because of the incredible age difference. This shows that she has no responsibility, morale or principles. She cannot read or write and conducts a railway train. This illustrates that she is at the murky depths of the education triangle and is also at the bottom rung of social standing plus income. Yes, WWII was an impoverished period for many countries around the world, but I'm willing to bet that Hannah only made enough to buy milk and bread each month after covering her other expenses being rent and utilities.Bernhard Schlink may be a brilliant writer to some, but I'm tired of the excuse that something was lost in the translation. I honestly think that none of his writing contains any sort of imagination or instinct. He seems to be writing what's on his mind more than direct storytelling, like a diary or journal of sorts. Maybe this was his intentional literary technique but I don't think it worked to its potential besides the failure of the diluted plot. The summary on the jacket is deceiving in its dark prose pertaining to Hannah's deadly and poisonous secret when no such intrigue and macabre exists. She couldn't read. She, along with other Gestapo officers during the Holocaust, were responsible for about twenty deaths to the 6 million lives lost during WWII's head-spinning war between Hitler and a sacred religion. Why is this not a surprise? There's no suspense, for one, and the outcome is highly predictable. What sickens me most is that Michael is sympathetic towards her plight and continues to humor her burgeoning illiteracy by reading and writing to her while she serves time for her war crimes in a woman's correctional facility. My beautiful 10-dollar bill, swirling in the muck and decay, gone forever over this miserable piece of literary filth. I pray I never make a mistake of this proportion ever again!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A small town in Germany, 1958. A 15 years old boy, Michael Berg, becomes ill in the street, and is soon diagnosed with hepatitis. As soon as he recovers, he goes to see the woman who helped him when he fainted on the street, the 36 years old Hanna. He thanks her for her action, they become friends, and soon lovers (statutory rape? what's that?). Hana, who works at the trolley as a ticket expender, asks Michael to read her books, classics mostly. Their relationship lasts a few months, and includes a visit to the countryside, but soon Hana mysteriously vanishes, after she was offered a promotion at the trolley company. Some years later, Michael has become a law student. As part of his training, he is asked to go and witness a trial of former Auschwitz guards with his class. And, who knew, Hana is among the accused. The crux of the novel is when Michael realizes (SPOILERS AHEAD) that Hana was illiterate. She was sent to Auschwitz because she feared that if she continued working at the factory, her illiteracy will be discovered. Therefore, she was really innocent (hey), but she is too ashamed to admit her illiteracy to the judge. I don't want to add more, but this novel, while correctly written, leaves a very bad taste, a combination of sleaze, improbable situations and opportunism (another novel that uses the Holocaust as a poor excuse for a plot?)."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The early scenes when the young Michael was with Hanna were good; afterward the story just had too much telling, not enough showing. In the end the book just felt like a public service announcement against illiteracy. If you don't learn to read, this is what will happen to you!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"My Mum advised me to read this book and I did, and was more than pleasantly surprised. What a masterpiece! I didn't know what it would be about, as I hadn't read any reviews at all. I didn't even know it would be a book about the Holocaust... but it is also a book about a complicated and tortured relationship between an adolescent and a mature woman. Her crimes are well-defined and as I read on I hated her more and more, not only for what she did during the War, but also for how she treated Michael. I couldn't really work out what his crime was, and why he thought he'd betrayed her, and why he was beating himself up so much. I think she made him totally neurotic. If my own son was underage and got into a relationship like that, I'd probably kill the woman. She basically destroyed him the way she destroyed so many other innocent people before him. I felt like crying for Michael, but I didn't feel one bit sorry for her and was glad when she had the wisdom to do what she did in the end."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The &quot;Reader&quot; was the first book i read out of the Oprah Book CLub, and i must say it impressed me enough to read more. However, once i read another from the famed club, i realized this book was only mediocore. It was a very simple read. The kind of book you could put down for a months time (which i did), then come back to it. Now i will say that i couldn't just stop reading the novel, i had to finish it. The first part of the novel was very well written in aspects of storyline. In characterization, it was not all that good. I didn't have any feelings or emotions for the characters, none at all. It was just a simple story to keep me busy when i had nothing to do. Now if you want a REALLY good book for the club, try &quot;House Of Sand and Fog&quot;, by ANdre DubusIII, that book was an amazing read, however the ending left you hanging and you will want to know so much more about the characters. It was still an extrodinary book!!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This books starts out strong. Through the developments between the main character and hannah, his older lover, one learns much of both of these characters and in an interesting manner. the language is engaging eithout being either too complex or too plain. The second half of the novel, for the most part, plays on moral issues that are somehow related to the first half, namely, the main characters relationship with hannah, who turns out to be an ex-nazi. Unfortunately, Schlink merley presents these various issues without really any deep introspection. i suppose that this allows for extended discussion on the book, however, it still seems as if the authour could have delved deeper into the issues himself. we are only given the surface. This is the only book of Schlink's that i have read, but it also seemed as if the style of writing better suited the first half of the book, which was light and airy in comparison to the morality-laden second half. Furthermore, the first half of the book kept me interested by presenting the dynamics between the two primary characters, however, even thouugh both characters continue to develop, much of the vigor runs out. In the second half of the book, the character development seems to be subserviant to the questions of morality. It goes from spontanious and concise to laborous and predictable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was easy to read and enjoyable, as well as touching. It grabs at your heart, and pulls you along. The past is brought back to us in a whole different light. As much as you don't want to be touched by the story, you just can't help it. The funny thing is, the author won't ever admit whether this really happened to him in his life or not. So, it leaves you believing that it did. He the story with eloquence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I really thought this book was right on time. You can actually read this whole book in one setting. Even if you don't, you'll never have to reread to remember what the book was about. The setting and plot stays with you and actually wants to make you take the place of one of more characters that are presented in the book. This is one book you'll never have to (you may want to though) pick up again. It's just that interesting; you wouldn't want to leave anything out when explaining because the book's just that good. There couldn't be a briefer explanation. This book was recommended by Oprah's Book Club."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is well written, and flows smoothly from chapter to chapter. It is a book of love, war, lust and ultimately disappointment. The book is full of disappointment and timidness. The writer does not make any progression throughout the book and ends up in same place he started. The heroine of the book is a female named Hanna, she is the only one that evolves, but to late in life for it to matter.If you want to sit back relax, and read a story in the post WWII era this is a great book. However, if you are looking to increase your understanding of the world or find a deeper meaning in life, you will be truly disappointed with the Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader paints a vivid, sometimes dry, sometimes poetic, journey of a young man's development of sexuality, intellect, and a system of values, weaving all of these facets together and ending his tipsy turning knit with a knot of disillusionment. The narrator, after taking us through his first sexual encounters with a woman twice his age, a train conductor who turns out to be an illiterate Nazi, and through her prosecution for war crimes and his coinciding discovery of her guilt, dedicates a small partition of his literary time to explaining the process by which he comes to peace with his adolescent affair and with himself. The most touching and humane aspect of relationship between the two characters is the woman Hanna's illiteracy and reliance upon as well as passion for hearing great works of literature read aloud to her by our narrator Michael. The two characters, each evidently in need of personal growth at the time of their first encounters, albeit for similar reasons, do in fact grow, while apart from each other, and, after Hanna's release from prison the two are united to compare growths; our narrator telling Hanna that he is &quot;proud of her&quot; for learning to read and write, which is touching, we feel, as he has almost certainly inspired her to do so by sending her tape recordings of his voice during the eighteen years in which she is held captive in prison, as she tells him, &quot;You've grown up, kid.&quot; Shortly thereafter, she hangs herself, leaving a note instructing good intentions with regard to an accompanying tin filled with money that she hopes will provide some consolation to a surviving victim of her Nazi prison camp affairs. The narrator donates this money to a Jewish fund for the prevention of illiteracy on her behalf. What he in turn receives is a computer generated thank you response with the name of his former lover mechanically printed before a comma, which he takes with him to stand for the &quot;first and only&quot; time at the grave of this illiterate beauty submissive and controlled by forces beyond her cognizance who, having redemption politely tap her on the shoulder, turned and slapped it in the face, perhaps out of realization of the general futility of most everything when faced with larger opposition which exists in undertones throughout the novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book is set in post WWII Germany and told by Michael Berg. It starts when he was 15 years old and Hanna Schmitz came into his life. Although Hanna was twice his age, Michael was seduced and immediately fell in love with her. For a period of time they were lovers, and one of the things that Hanna liked was when Michael read to her, until one day Hanna disappeared and left no way for Michael to contact her. Years later when he is a law student, Michael is assigned to a trial and there he unexpectedly sees Hanna again. This time things have changed, she is being trialled as a guard in one of the concentration camps and there is so much about Hanna that Michael doesn't know. As he sits through the trial he tries to understand her motive, until he discovers the secret which is keeping Hanna from defending herself.I found this to be a very easy and a quick read, and although it is a short novel, the topics it deals with give you a lot to think about. I liked the two main characters in this book, yet I thought that Hanna was much stronger and at first I was a little disappointed when Michael discovered her secret. My initial reaction was that it was impossible for someone to behave that way, but thinking about it made me realize how much it must have meant for Hanna if she was willing to get a harsher sentence to conceal her secret. In the end I was eager to see what happened to Michael and Hanna, but again was disappointed by what she did. I may have been hoping for a happy ending though, and the fact that it did not happen could have something to do with why I was unhappy with Hanna.I think I expected more from this book, probably because of all the hype surrounding the movie that was released in 2008. All in all however it was still worth reading and I think it would make a great book for discussion, it is surely good food for thought."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I listened to Campbell Scott read this to me; funny since the main charachter spends much of his time reading aloud. This is a short, bittersweet love story which posed an intriguing moral question. I am glad I had the opportunity to listen to this book and will see the movie soon."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Powerful book that fleshes out the two main characters extraordinarily well. This book reminds me of the book, \\"Doubt\\", in that it leaves you with lingering thoughts regarding the intentions of the main characters."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bought this book together with the Spanish edition of the same titlefor my Spanish study. Because the story is cut in short sections, it was great and covenient for my language study. However more than my initial intention, the story of The Reader touched my mind at the deepest place. For one reason, I witnessed a similar incident in a war tribunal in Japan after the world war ll. It is a part of irony of human history, but the book described well while helping my Spanish study."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader, this was an amazing story, not the easiest of reads but if flowed well for me even though. It was a thinker,one you really wanted to think about what you were reading and how it pertained to you or your life experiences. What would you do? Type questions.

It just stopped short of being really good."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is right up there with the Catcher and The Rye. I even had my highlighter out so I could mark the enteries that I wanted to come back to. Once I finished it I picked it up and read it again. Superb"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Being in my end 20s and German at the same time I found this book a very valuable and new approach to the Holocaust history. It reflects emotions and feelings of our young German generation that is still struggeling with the history of their parents/grandparents. Schlink is able to look at the history from a different angle with a modern approach, bringing together the young generation that is not to blame with the generation that is to be hold responsible. Presenting those two generations in a couple of lovers and adding an age difference of the &quot;other&quot; way (the man being much younger than the women) makes this book remarkable, rich in diversity and definetly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I agree with the masses that this was a good read, it did have twists and turns, but still worth it. Unlike many, I did have compassion for Michael. He was stripped of his innocense at such a young age. This, I feel, set the stage of aloofness and depression that seemed to consume him throughout the rest of the book. Of course, he was interested in sex.. he was 15, but he was taken advantage of by the older woman in a very sick way. This odd obsessive love affair affected his every relationship; from his father to other females his own age. Hanna was his teacher in the beginning of the novel and later you see Michael become her teacher. Hanna taught him about passion, however warped it was. Then in the end you see that he taught her literacy and kindness. I would not rank this book very high with other stories of the Holocaust, but i think the story is a good one. I considered it more a focus on Michael as the Reader... her Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel by Bernhard Schlink is a captivating tale of an erotic relationship with all it's twists and turns. I really enjoyed the Reader and felt that it was so captivating because it included many aspects of life and growing up. I am only a few years older than Michael Berg, the main character, and i could relate to his struggles in life and love. Schlink puts you right in the shoes of Michael and the reader is able to experience all his trials and tribulations as he matures. The reader can sympathize because at one point or another we have all had the same feelings or experiences and we become captivated with the novel. Another reason that Schlinks tale is quite captivating is that the story takes place in postwar Germany. In my experiences, I enjoy books that seem more realistic and have the element of history involved. It gives the reader a better appreciation for events during that time period but also makes the novel itself more interesting. So, not only does Schlinks incorporations of a young boys desires, thoughts, and disappointments help to captivate the reader, so does the history integrated into the novel. This novel was very cpativating from the beginning to the end. Because you know all Michael's thoughts and desires towards Hanna, his older lover, you become more involved in the novel. Michaels thoughts are like everyone's unspoken words about many aspects of life. Some that we just don't like to express or feel comfortable expressing. This novel appeals to everyone's senses and is a captivating love affair that most can realte to. I recommend the novel for anyone looking for easy reading to pass the time away."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book began has all of the basics that often catch a readers attention, but the plot seems to fade in and out. The Reader begins with a twist of irony which continues on throughout the plot. Michael, a young 15 year old boy with Hepatitis, is drawn in by a 36 year old woman, Hanna. One would not see a homely, sick individual falling into the sexual desires of another person, but after a short period of time, the two of them develop a relationship, that eventually falls apart. The story unfolds with the consequences that Michael and Hanna must deal with. A lack of communication and understanding destroy their relationship and cause a gap to develop between them. Despite attempts to atone her actions, Hanna fails which culminates in suicide. As I read, the Reader appeared inconsistent in its portrayal of characters. We develop an understanding of Michael in the beginning, but the story later shifts to a focus on Hanna, who we know very little about. This does not allow us to see her thoughts or actions, but it does allow us to ponder questions of why she does what she does. I was empathetic towards Hanna's weaknesses, but Schlink did not allow us to completely understand her reason for concealing troubles such as illiteracy. The story also lacks a solid historical background. It is set in a post World War II setting, but it does not appear to impact the characters, other than Hanna's previous life. The Reader started out a a well written book, but a shift in focus and a poor conclusion allowed me to drift away. I recommend it to others, but it is not very interesting or moving."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The New York Times Book Review describes &quot;The Reader&quot; as &quot;moving, suggestive and ultimately hopeful.&quot; While I do concede that &quot;The Reader&quot; is partially suggestive, I did not find it to be in any way moving or hopeful. Perhaps there was something lost in the translation (isn't there always?) but I found the novel to be ultimately disjointed. My main dislike of the novel was the lack of chemistry between Hanna and Michael. It was unfathomable to me that certain people described it as a love story. Where is the love, the chemistry, the connections? Furthermore, I was not at all empathetic towards Hanna, in fact I found her to be a very poorly drawn character. I cannot understand why anyone would go to jail to keep their illiteracy a secret. The novel is set in the context of the Holocaust, and the biggest &quot;secret&quot; of all is illiteracy? Please. Although I did enjoy some of Michael's philosophic musings, they were not fleshed out, and the disjointed language made them hard to understand. As to the length, just because a book is short doesn't mean the author has poetically reduced the information to the bare essentials--it may simply mean the author either didn't have the time or the desire to resolve any of the questions being posed. Unfortunately, that's how I ended up feeling about &quot;The Reader&quot;--lots of valid questions, no answers and no characters to care about."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was very interesting. My grandma grew up in Germany during the war and this story took me to that time. I really enjoyed the story of the strange relationship that these two people shared. The ending took a strange twist but that just made it all the more real."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I have to admit to reading this book due to the movie hype I have seen recently of it. That said, I'm certain this will be one of the rare instances we find the movie to be better than the book.While the story line had such promise, the principals are obviously wounded but boring. Character development would have made this so much more interesting and a little more tutiludge of the era would have drawn us into the period."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I just finished The Reader and really enjoyed it. BUT could he really have spent his whole life agonizing over a woman twice his age that he lost his virginity to at age 15? He worries that he loved someone who could commit a horrible crime but never realizes that she couldn't have been a very moral person to seduce him in the first place. He never loved her - it was simply schoolboy lust. He didn't even know her and she never called him anything but kid. Obviously he knew the relationship was wrong because he never told anyone about it, yet he allowed it to completely dominate his life. That was sad, but add the Holocaust into the mix and Hannah becomes a complete B----! I found myself wanting to slap some sense into that &quot;kid&quot;."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It was an insipid story told with very little style or emotion. The author's attempts to enlighten are pathetically juvenile. This may be the last time I follow one of Oprah's recommendations. A true waste of my time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I feel like The Reader gave a pretty good insight on what it is like to be in Hanna's position. But it also gave just as good an insight into being the victim at a concentration camp. What happened in Auschwitz and the other surrounding camps is quite disturbing. My thanks go out to Bernhard Schlink, because as long as people write and talk about what happened in the concentration camps, we won't forget. To be truthful, we can never let ourselves forget. If we can remember, maybe we can stop this from ever happening again.The Reader had some twists and turns that I hadn't anticipated until I read them. I felt for Michael Berg, but also felt for Hanna Schmitz too. I realized Hanna was illiterate when she first asked Michael to read to her. She was to embarrassed to admit her problem and felt trapped when Michael started asking questions about her life. I believe she struck out at Michael in order to keep him at a safe distance. Hanna's greatest fear was being found out. Being a guard, Hanna had to protect herself by doing her duty, or take a chance on loosing her life. In her eyes there was no option. When her trial finally starts and things are looking grim she still can't face her problem. Which ends up getting her convicted of murder. She does her time and on the eve of her release she commits suicide. I think inside the prison she felt somewhat protected and understood. But things would be much different on the outside, now that her secret is out. Maybe she felt she couldn't start over againI also in turn felt sorry for Michael. I believe he would of done anything for Hanna, but he was still having a tough time trying to figure her out. Her mood swings were so drastic and physical, Michael felt he was the cause. But he wasn't. Hanna hadn't yet learned to deal with her problems. Then one she just up and leaves. Michael dealt with her leaving the best way he knew how. He kept the feelings he felt for Hanna fresh in his mind, in turn he didn't have to deal with the loss.

This was described as a book which you could read in two nights yet it would haunt you for weeks afterwards. It took me many more than two nights to plod through this book. I thought the style was extremely dull and difficult to get through. The only thing that haunted me about this book was how truly bad it was. The character of Hanna as a war criminal turned child molester who jeopardizes her own trial because she doesn't want to expose her lame secret is supposed to provoke deep thoughts and discussions? Please!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in about three days because i had very high hopes for it. The hole time though i felt like it was going to get better but never did. Im not saying its a bad book but i just didnt like the direction that it went."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I found this book to be very dark and unrelenting as if to say that nothing the Germans can do or say will ever be enough to assauge the Jewish pain. The characters as written didn't illicit any sympathy from me but the subject was enough to be thought provoking. Later I watched the movie and it was wonderful because finally the characters came alive and three dimensional."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I just read this and found it very thought provoking, it is a quick read but full of intense emotion."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"simply put, this story is amazing. it is vivid, to the point, and wonderfuly written."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I've read a few books about the Holocaust but always from the Jewish point of view; never one from a German point of view after the war. This book focused on the German guilt after the WWII for the next generation of German children. I gave this book a two because while I felt the topic was interesting, I also thought the writing was too choppy (probably something lost in the translation).I also felt little for the characters of Hanna and Michael. It wasn't just the fact that I didn't like or dislike the characters, but I also didn't understand them. I felt the writer could have given a little more detail about Hanna's past in the concentration camp and the trial. It was also hard to understand how the relationship between Hanna and Michael even started.While a portion of this novel did focus on the Nazi crimal trial of Hanna and 4 other female guards, the majority of this novel centered around Hanna and Michael's relationship. The guilt, confusion, and hurt feelings Michael had over Hanna leaving continued into his relationships during his teenage years, his young adult life, and into his forties. It was an incredibly sad story because no character ever seemed happy or complete.I think I would like to continue to read novels about the after effects of the Holocaust both from the perspective of Germans and Jews but perhaps novels that focus more on historical facts."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"My reading of the English translation of this book may be influenced by the outstanding movie version, which won Kate Winslet her (well-deserved) Oscar.Often, when I read the book version of a movie that has moved me deeply I'm disappointed (or vice versa - the movie version of the emotional \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" was a huge disappointment.)The Reader doesn't disappoint on any level. Perhaps because of my personal experiences (a white South African born to the generation who voted the Apartheid government into power), this novel moved me in ways I can't begin to describe.Stripping away the love story between Michael and Hanna, the way this novel explored and articulated the nature of guilt reflected many of the questions in my own mind. The deceptively simple prose style is ideal for keeping the focus on the soul-wrenching and difficult issues the illogical love Michael feels for Hanna raises in the reader's mind (excuse the pun.)At times I wondered if Hanna wasn't symbolic of Germany herself, and Michael's statement \\"I wanted simultaneously to understand Hanna's crime and to condemn it\\" is a poignant echo of the post-war (or, for that matter, post-apartheid) generation's complex patriotism.Is Hanna's illiteracy and ignorance enough to excuse her? And is it a metaphor for previous generations of people the world over who were simply unaware of the darkness to which that ignorance/lack of education/whatever could lead them to? Should we condemn or understand them? And, if we condemn those who have lived before us, what will future generations - those yet-to-be-born generations who will have more knowledge on which to base their choices and actions than we have - find to condemn in our behaviour? Perhaps in a hundred years times vegetarian children will have to bear the guilt of previous generations who (considering themselves perfectly civilised and moral beings) today deliberately slaughter living creatures to eat.This novel almost defies categorisation and review. As Michael himself says, \\"The tectonic layers of our lives rest so tightly one on top of the other that we always come up against earlier events in later ones, not as matter that has been fully formed and pushed aside, but absolutely present and alive. I understand this. Nevertheless, I sometimes find it hard to bear.\\"Sometimes I find it hard to bear that I and my beloved parents - good, ordinary people, all of us, or so I like to think - were simply too concerned with bread-and-butter issues to fight the evil of apartheid and become heroes of \\"the struggle.\\" Sometimes I find it hard to bear that, just as the German psyche will never be entirely free of the guilt of the Holocaust, so the white South African psyche will never be entirely free of the guilt of Apartheid.Bernhard Schlink does an admirable job in addressing a topic that raises difficult moral and legal questions, none of which has easy answers.\\"The Reader\\" is a necessary read for anyone who needs to learn that there are three sides to every story in our collective and individual histories: the victim's side, the oppressor's side and the truth that can never be fully known or understood. As Michael says \\"Whatever I had done or not done, whatever [Hanna] had done or not done...it was the path my life had taken...there are many different stories in addition to the one I have written.\\"There are no guarantees that the story of the good and evil that mankind is capable of will not be repeated: the victim may become the oppressor, the oppressor the victim. As I write this review, the Palestinians live in ghettos under Israeli rule. On Black Tuesday 22-11-11, in South Africa, the black ANC government has voted in favour of an information bill, which limits the democratic freedom of speech, while the good, ordinary people (as in previous eras) were too concerned with bread-and-butter issues to care about some law whose significance they didn't fully comprehend.So, who knows what those who find it easier to condemn than to understand would do if a malicious Fate places them in Hanna's shoes? \\"What would you have done?\\" Hanna asks the judge presiding over her war crimes trial. But she got no answer and nor did she expect one.This simply written tale is a melancholy and insightful book that will linger in my mind for a long time. While it gives no easy solutions, it does provoke a deep and thoughtful analysis of how the human spirit copes when confronted with deep and horrifying truths about one's individual and collective identity."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When 15-year-old Michael Berg discovers an older woman willing to become his lover, he thinks he's the student. Yet, intimacy with Hanna comes with one condition--he's got to read to her first.Michael never thought much about this odd form of foreplay until years later when Hanna's on trial as a Nazi war criminal. Michael, who is now a law student, watches as the other guards do their best to shift their blame onto Hanna. But, she couldn't be to blame, he realizes Hanna couldn't read nor write.Yet, Hanna takes the fall for the other defendants. She's sentenced to life. Their roles reverse and Michael is now the teacher. In the time before talking books, he records chapters and sends them to her.\\"The Reader\\" appears a short, quick read, but the content within is thought-provoking and intense.

There is often a controversy and debate as to whether the book or the movie is better; I think this is one of the situations where they complement each other. The book provides a deeper insight into the psyche of the characters and helps one understand more fully their actions and motivations. The movie provides stunning visual images of the intense emotional drama. I saw the movie first, and thought that Kate Winslet was outstanding as Hana; it was only after I read the book (actually listened to it on audio), that I truly appreciated what an extraordinary performance Winslet gave of a very complex person. Well deserving of her Academy Award.A similar complementary scenario was No Country for Old Men - the movie and the book.Igor Dumbadze"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"this book has stayed with me since i first read it. i've been going over it in my mind over and over again. the movie was so good i felt i needed more and was not disappointed. of course i am now totally hooked on this author. i want to read all lf his books. what a mind and one who can it all done on paper so brilliantly."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Let me start by saying I have not seen the movie version of this book starring Kate Winslet. It did help having the vision of Kate playing Hannah in this book because you can visualize the story taking place.The book is divided in three parts. If I were to rate this book based on the first chapter, it is a 5+ star. This starts out with a bang. You fully dive into the relationship of the young boy and Hannah. The author is masterful in describing their relationship, the scenery and you feel as if you are in the room. Unfortunately, this part of the book set up such high expectations for the rest of the book that I became disappointed.Parts Two and Three of the books dive into how Hannah comes back into the young boys life. I won't write about this as it gives away too much of the plot of the novel. I believe the author did a wonderful job of pulling their lives back together; however, it left me wanting more. When I finished the book, I still didn't feel like I knew Hannah or why she did what she did. I wanted more from the relationship. I wanted to hear more about the impact of Hannah on his life other than reflections back in time. I guess my expectations were just so high based on the expert writing of the first part of this book.The chapters are short which makes this book a breeze to read through. I am looking forward to seeing the movie as I can see them taking the flashbacks to the concentration camps to a much higher level than what I received from the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is one of the most haunting books I have read in quite a long time. As someone who reads 2-4 books a month, this book stopped me in my tracks. The questions raised by the author are difficult, if not impossible to answer; therefore, making them stay with you, turning them over and over in your mind. The question of \\"collective guilt\\" is very interesting. Additionally, the main character, Hanna Schmitz, is complex in her simplicity. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who is a serious reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Just a short comment. Of course it is inappropriate (and in most countries illegal) for a 36-year old and a 15-year old to have a sexual affair, but that is so beside the point of this book. Others have rightly pointed out the moral dilemmas of those involved, and they had nothing to do with sex. Rather, they have to do with having the moral integrity to sacrifice oneself for a larger good, an act somehow beyond the scope of either Hanna's or Michael's character. But who of us has not gone along with the crowd? Have we not all failed at times to buck a tide of prejudice or political correctness? There is a fine line to walk between recognition of human frailties and condemnation of despicable acts.The undercurrent in this book is sex, a sex that for Michael grew into an all-consuming passion, one that formed him and haunted him the rest of his life. And no one should underestimate the capacity of a 15-year old to be passionately, deeply, if unwisely--in love.I read this book several years ago in my book club, never imagining that it would some day be a film. (And I just learned today that it was an Oprah's Book Club choice!) Haven't seen the movie, but I do recommend the book. Read it thoughtfully. It's not just about Hanna and Michael, nor about Nazis and the holocaust. It is about all of us, and our integrity or lack of it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I liked the book, it was well written and touching. It's just that I kept reading every chapter expecting a resoultion or something to happen differently, but it didn't ever come. It kind of just leaves us hanging and doesn't tie it all up for us in the end. I just wish things would have ended without the despair and doubt. Does it make it a book that shouldn't be read? Of course not, it is worthy of anyone's time who likes to read. However, if there is something out there you've had your eye on and want to read then get it and read this when you just need to kill some time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"When young Michael Berg meets Hanna, she is more than twice his age, but in spite of this they soon become involved in what many would call an inappropriate love affair. Their's is an unusual relationship, with Berg reading to Hanna each day before making love. While Hanna is clearly keeping secrets, Berg willing overlooks them. Eventually, Berg develops other friendships and feels the need to move on in his life, and one day Hanna simply vanishes.When Berg next sees Hanna, she is on trial for war crimes she allegedly committed as a Nazi during the Second World War. Berg watches her trial unfold and puzzles over Hanna's behavior. Eventually, he solves the riddle of Hanna's secrets, but can't save her from a life sentence in prison.The ending is a bit of a surprise, and raises powerful questions of moral responsibility. Berg loved Hanna, in his way, but distanced himself from her. In the end, he's left wondering how his actions impacted Hanna and her life. This was a quick read, especially for a translation, with prose that was rich with vivid imagery. A wonderful book that will leave the reader with much to ponder."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book in one sitting! It held me captive. The young boys relationship with the older woman at the beginning of the book was written beautifly. It set me up perfectly for the rest of the story. It's been a long time since a story has brought me to tears.... this one did. I especially enjoyed it because it didn't have a &quot;Hollywood&quot; plot or ending, it spoke more of real life where things don't always go the way we'd like. It touched on alot of moral and ethical issues without deciding the answers for me.....I appreciated that. It made me THINK and that is a wonderful gift to get from a book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernard Schlink is a dynamic story teller with great writing style. I was spellbound throughout as it flowed so beautifully. I felt the energy, pain and confusion in the relationship, but I especially felt the pain of the troubled young woman holding a personal secret she felt too terrible to reveal. I recommend it highly for excellent reading material."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I could not wait to read other reviews after I finished The Reader and I am so disappointed that very few people are shocked at how Hannah took advantage of a 15 yr old boy! If the sexes had been reversed, this book would have never made any book club lists. Why does the general public seem to think it's okay if a young boy is involved in a sexual relationship with a woman his mother's age, but a 36 yr old man having sex w/a young girl would be considered outrageous? This whole issue was difficult to get past, therefore the more serious Holocaust issue became secondary to me. Hannah's illiteracy is sad, but no excuse for her behavior."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I purchased The Reader due to Oprah's recommendation. I respect Oprah's book selections because I have liked almost all of her selections. But this book was hard for me to get into. I read it three times, hoping I had missed something. But I don't think I did. This book asked so many questions of me. Something that was both uncomfortable and distracting. I'm not used to being interrogated in a way by the book I'm reading. Not to say that this is bad, but merely something I am unaccostomed to. I thought the book was inciteful, but it did not give me what I had hoped. I probably went in expecting too much, several of my girlfriends loved it. This book did not leave me with anything I didn't already have, only with a feeling of 'that's it?'"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"If you have ever had a memory that clung to you despite your efforts to forget, this book is for you. Bernhard Schlink turns remembering into a journey into self. A bittersweet and tender lesson in how and what to remember."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book on my day off and it left with a very unresolved feeling. While the story progresses with an extremely thought-provoking plot, I found the moral dilemmas presented a little unrealistic. For instance, the premise that Hanna's deep secrete of illiteracy drove her to murder and her ultimate self-destruction during the trial is a little hard to relate to. I suppose it is a comment on the dangerous nature of pride, for she would rather commit herself to a life prison sentence rather than face the embarassment of her inability to read. This inability is also supposed to be the cause for her initially accepting the job as an SS German guard and as the original foundation for her relationship with the main character. She makes ammends for this in prison by correcting her handicap, but then it ends with the shock of her final decision. Throughout the story, the main character also feels like he has somehow betrayed her, and he lets their failed relationship practically haunt the rest of his adult life. I found the characters' motivations a little hard to relate to, but then again, who ever said the type of complex emotion expressed here had to be rational? I was left with a variety of valid questions, but it seems as though the answers can only be found within the heart of every individual Reader."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The writing was very simple, however it seems like some things might have gotten mixed up in the translation at times. It was interesting in a kind of &quot;passing the time&quot; kind of way."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The book speaks about a young boy's journey through adolescence into adulthood &amp; the single most important factor that shaped his personality. The author is very vocal about the protagonist's frame of mind which is what i liked. The background against which this story was set was unimpressive, confusing and i could not relate to that post-war era relating to present day decisions."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I did not enjoy reading The Reader for several reasons. I'm usually attracted to very strong characters, and the boy/law student allowed himself to be a victim throughout the story. He allowed his teenage affair with Hannah to affect his whole life. I couldn't respect his attitudes.I thought that Hannah would be the strong character. She endured prison and overcame her illiteracy, but then killed herself at the very moment her life could have begun.I hate to call a book a waste of time, but this was close to it for me."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As an American living in Germany I have confronted many of the issues that are addressed in this book. I was especially taken aback by the analysis of what the second (and in my case the third) generation should do with the information it now has of the Holocaust. In my time here I have visited several of the terrible concentration camps, and each time I am just as horrified at what I see. I think that this book does a good job of addressing these issues. While I can't say that I loved the book (the relationship between the young boy and 35 year old woman was especially troubling to me), it really made me think."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Berhard Schlink reveals subtle truths about how individuals and whole nations of people can forgive, and move forward even after the most numbing and base experiences. Schlink also uses clear language and wonderful imagery to help us develop empathy for a situation and a person whom we might normally dismiss. It is a great, easy read with a big intellectual impact."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In the late 1950s, Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German schoolboy, meets and falls in love with an enigmatic working-class woman more than twice his age, thirty-six year old Hanna Schmitz. Thus begins Bernhard Schlink's short, sparely written novel, \\"The Reader\\". From there, the plot of this best-selling novel is well known. Berg spends many days with Hanna, reading to her and making love, the mysterious woman becoming the obsession and fulfillment of erotic desire. Then, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Berg's life as quickly and mysteriously as she had entered it. Several years later, in the mid-1960s, Berg once again encounters Hanna, this time standing trial for war crimes as a former guard at Auschwitz. His obsession rekindled, Berg's narrative follows Hanna's trial, disclosing her wartime crimes and her \\"secret\\", and relating the austere relationship which continued between them during Hanna's years of imprisonment.\\"The Reader\\" is a little novel which has big aspirations, its austere prose and simple plot suggesting to the reader that there is something more, something unsaid, about the engimatic Hanna. Unfortunately, Hanna's ultimate \\"secret\\"-her illiteracy-does not bear the weight of Schlink's story, does not adequately explain Hanna's actions. It may become a wonderful television movie, but \\"The Reader\\" is not the classic work that, for example, George Steiner's profuse praise suggests. While the first part of the novel, a little erotic fairy tale of the affair between Berg and Hanna, is a concentrated work of spare, lucid prose which \\"hooks\\" the reader, the remainder of the book is not nearly so good and never carries the weight of the big questions Schlink wants to raise-questions of guilt and love and the relationship between generations in post-War Germany.It is certainly worth spending a few short hours with \\"The Reader\\", an interesting, if not profound, novel with some very good writing. Just don't expect a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book was first introduced to me while I was living in Germany by a German high school girl who had to read it for school. Having read the book first in German and then the translation in English years later, I found the English translation to be as stylistically beautiful as it was in German. Perhaps the only problem I had with the translation is that _Der_Vorleser_, which is the German title, really means a person who reads out loud, not just someone who reads.The secret romance, of a 15 year old boy and a woman in her late thirties starts off as a novel accident. But their relationship deepens as the boy discovers love and the woman discovers a person willing to open the portal of literature to which she has no access; She's illiterate. She mysteriously disappears one day, but the boy doesn't find out what happened until years later while he is a law student witnessing her to be on trial for having been a Nazi camp guard.The book goes beyond the microcosm of two people, into the psyche of post WWII Germany. The audience to profit most from this book are current German youths whose connection to their Nazi past has been only through their textbooks and their aging grandparents. To appreciate this book, it helps to be familiar with the internal conflict between guilt and disassociation that Germans have with their recent history. And I can see why others, who probably have not probed deep into modern Germany can miss the crucial theme in this book.To enjoy the beauty of Schlink's style, it has to be read in German. Like any work of literature, something is lost in translation. However, the books stylistic beauty survives in English for the most part. After finishing this book in German, I thought this book was great. After rereading it in English, I understood why it is now being taught as a modern classic in German high schools today."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I was able to complete this short novel in only two sittings. For the few hours it took to finish the book I was totally absorbed in other points of view, other perspectives and problems. The author wonderfully brought out how difficult it really is to be human. Since the book is so short, giving anything away about the plot is to give too much away."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"As I read Schlink's novel, it was nearly impossible to believe it was not a memoir. It was also nearly impossible to put down. I started reading the book yesterday morning, and for the entire day I took it everywhere with me. I read it in waiting rooms, traffic jams, while the potatoes were boiling. And at the end of the day, I picked it up knowing that I would not sleep until I had come to the end.The honesty with which Schlink approaches the inherited guilt of the \\"second generation\\" of Germans, those who were born either during or just after the war, was truly remarkable. While the book is ostensibly about the love affair between a young man and a former concentration camp guard, it is really a showcase for all of the moral, ethical and personal dilemmas faced by these alienated post-war Germans. Schlink tackles the problem of inherited guilt with a clarity of vision that is startling in its depth. At one point Michael asks the plaintive question: \\"..we of the second generation were silenced by revulsion, shame and guilt--was that all there was to it now?\\" (p 104). That silence--manifested in the numbness which was shared by both the victims and their persecutors,as well as by Michael himself--was symbolically and materially represented by Hannah's illiteracy.Illiteracy, the inability to read and write, was Hanna's downfall. But in a deeper sense, Hanna's illiteracy represents the unwillingness to become self-educated, to make the independent, informed decisions that all Germans faced under the Nazis. Indeed, Hanna's \\"illiteracy\\" is something we all share. The Milgram experiments, originally intended to discover what it was about Germans that made them so cooperative with Nazi outrages, demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that most people, anywhere, will cooperate with atrocities. (I would strongly encourage anyone who believes the Germans were somehow \\"different\\" to read up on the Milgram experiments.)Eventually the silence of complicity is overcome by Hanna herself, when she finally cures herself of illiteracy. When Michael discovers the literature of the Holocaust in Hanna's cell--Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Hannah Arendt--he begins to weep. That scene represents one of the most moving and significant statements of faith in humanity that I have ever encountered: We can all overcome our complicity. We can all overcome our ignorance. We can all overcome our silence."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The premise of the book is quite good and seemed to hold so much promise. But the author fails to develop the characters or the core ideas beyond the superficial. The main character raises a few questions about the generational guilt of Nazi collaboration, but never really moves past the question of \\"what would you have done?\\" - other than to state that it makes everyone uncomfortable. Certainly the author could have spent several chapters grappling with this either through internal monologue or by introducing additional characters that the narrator interacted with. The father character is so under developed I was left wondering why he was introduced into the novel at all. His only purpose was to drive a brief chapter moralizing on whether one should intercede on behalf of someone whom you feel is acting against their own interests. Even this exchange is all to brief and doesn't move beyond a superficial raising of the issues. Its followed later on with a comment on the narrators painful relationship with his father - again another potential vehicle for developing the main character that goes undeveloped.I'd be interested to read the original German to see if it was the English translation that was at fault, or the author's own writing style at fault. Given that most of the problems I have with the book revolve around undeveloped and explored ideas, I'd have to lay it at the feet of the author not the translator."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The hype about the movie based on this book spoiled the plot for me, but the plot is not what's most compelling anyway. The book takes place in post-WWII Germany, where thirty-something Hanna comes upon fifteen-year-old Michael Berg, who is obviously ill. She walks him home, and, after getting over a bout of hepatitis, Michael visits Hanna to thank her. Thus begins an unlikely affair. (I'm reminded of \\"The Last Picture Show\\" without the comic element.) Moreover, Hanna harbors two big secrets that are wildly different in magnitude, but she guards them both equally closely. Hanna exits Michael's life abruptly but leaves a lasting impression, and then their lives cross again under very different circumstances while Michael is in law school. The book is largely about sins of omission, on the part of both main characters. It raises several disturbing questions, such as what constitutes betrayal and whether one should risk embarrassing a person in order to save him/her from larger consequences, when that person seems unwilling to save himself/herself. The biggest question, though, has to do with the Holocaust and what steps should or could the guards have taken to save the prisoners. Translations always seem a bit dispassionate to me, but in this case, emotional numbness is one of the primary themes, so that the absence of passion seems to be appropriate."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This must be the year for books which have a profound effect. What genre this book fits I am unsure about. It could be one of many things: a holocaust novel, a philosphical exploration of collective and personal guilt, human nature, freedom and love, a love story, a coming-of age-novel. What I do know is that I have been deeply touched by the humanity of this novel, by the intense honesty and emotion in it. The writing is deeply touching, close and real, and I would say it would be near impossible to read this and not be drawn into the world of the characters.The story deals with the weaving in and out of each others' lives of two people, Michael and Hanna, in post-Nazi Germany. Throughout the narrative some terrible secrets come to light and have to be dealt with. But it is much more than that...Beside the main thread of the story, I was also fascinated by Schlink's treatment of the impact a relatively brief encounter can have on a person's life. An interesting subject of discussion indeed. The protagonists, Hanna and Michael's short time together would impact the rest of both of their lives to a significant, indeed determining degree. After marrying Gertrud, Michael cannot settle, even though during Hanna's trial he admits to feeling nothing, and being completely numb, \\"I could never stop comparing the way it was with Gertrud (his wife) to the way it had been with Hanna\\". He wants to be \\"free of Hanna\\", but finds himself incapable of escaping her memory and the guilt associated both with having been in a relationship with her as well as his notion that he somehow betrayed her. Here Hanna becomes a symbol for the old regime and Michael of the new Germany, the new world perhaps even, trying to break free of the past, and finding the task impossible to achieve. It raises the question: Can any person, group or nation ever break free from its past? Should one fight or deny that past? Or perhaps accept it, with its beauty and shame, and move from there? The answer is not given in the novel, but perhaps the answer is in the question and in the lives of Hanna and Michael. In each of our lives? Michael describes it perhaps when he muses on re-reading The Odyssey, \\"The Odyssey is the story of motion both purposeful and purposeless, successful and futile\\". And so perhaps are all of our lives as we live and breathe on this planet stories both successful and futile.The book deals with the three different periods where Hanna and Michael's lives come together.Part One of the book introduces the story powerfully, which gives the reader the persuasion to work through Part Two, which was much more harrowing. Schlink deals with a very difficult subject in this part of the book. He manages to be somehow objective without going flat, which is an incredible feat in itself. Part Three was for me the most powerful and touching acount imaginable. The expressions of love, the tone and feeling, the sense of irredeemable loss were so touchingly written that it sent shudders up my spine. That feeling of doing and choosing, but knowing it's not enough...Is this ultimately a novel devoid of hope? Is there hope of redemption? Is it ever too late? Who is more guilty, the perpetrator, or the person who brings them to justice, looking for revenge? Do circumstances justify crime? Does shame? Is the choice not to choose a choice in itself? Can one ever love again, fully, after having loved once?Schlink leaves the reader with so many unanswered questions. That's good, right? Thinking is good, especially when it hurts a little.Perhaps I need to read this in the German though, even the title carries more meaning in German than in English. 'Vorlesen' means reading to someone out loud, not ever to onself, that is simply 'lesen'. The English does not make this distinction. I wonder what other nuance is lost..."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"In the book The Reader, Bernhard Schlink narrates the story of Michael, a fifteen year old boy who has a love affair with Hanna, a woman over twice his age. Schlink's novel follows Michael through adulthood as his life intermittently intertwines with that of Hanna. Set over the backdrop of Nazi and post-World War II Germany, The Reader offers more than a fictional tale of one man's struggle to come to terms with his past. Through the characters of Michael and Hanna, the author provides his audience with insight into German society and its attitude toward the past. Although Schlink's novel appears incredulous at times, his metaphoric approach to Michael and Hanna's relationship illustrates the difficulties modern Germany has faced in acknowledging and overcoming its Nazi past.Schlink's characters have a metaphoric quality. Michael represents modern Germany while Hanna's character is symbolic of old Germany. The relationship of two Germanies is expressed in that of the characters. In the book Michael asks himself \\"Why does it make me so sad when I think back to that time... Is it the knowledge of what came later, and that what came out afterwards had been there all along?\\" Michael is referring to the knowledge he gains later in life when he discovers that Hanna was employed as a guard in a Nazi work camp. Michael's reaction of sadness or even a sense of disappointment can be seen as symbolic of the reaction of Germany's modern youth to the involvement of their parents in the Nazi regime. Schlink's generation in Germany finds disappointment in their parent's acceptance or lack of resistance to the Nazis. By questioning how involved their parents were, Schlink's generation can no longer look back on their youth in the same way. It has become polluted by knowledge.Michael's relationship with his father further serves to metaphorical express that of old and new Germany, as does many of the other relationships throughout the book. If the audience wishes to examine the content of the book through a metaphorical analysis, they might also imagine Michael and his ex-wife, Gertrude, as symbolic of East and West Germany. His daughter, Julia, \\"who swam like a fish in water\\" when he and Gertrude were together, yet seemed out of her element when they were separated could be seen as the German people. Numerous metaphors exist or could be imagined within the text. Instead of focusing on who or what is represented by this or that person, it might be more helpful to analyze the behavior of the characters to better understand West German society.Three events within the book stand out to me as revealing of attitudes, both of the old and the post-World War II West Germany. All of these events occur in the last chapters of the novel. First, I found it interesting that Hanna refuses to acknowledge her illiteracy even though it might spare her harsh sentencing for her crimes. Her unwillingness to admit her inability to read seems prideful. This act suggests that in a society in which the literacy rate is above 90% an individual who is illiterate might be ostracized. Hanna's refusal to allow anyone to know that she is unable to read also implies that being illiterate is worse than admitting you were a member of a party that killed innocent people. It is worse to steal than it was to kill an individual. By suggesting that killing an enemy of the state (Jewish or foreign worker) was better than illiteracy or theft implied that old Germany had no remorse for its actions. That being indifferent to murder of such \`enemies' was just part of doing your job and no one should be held accountable for these actions.In addition to the nonchalant reaction of old Germany to murder as portrayed by Hanna, I also felt that Michael's resuming his reading to Hanna provided insight into West German society. Although Schlink's generation was saddened by their parent's involvement or lack of revolt against the Nazi regime, it seems that they ultimately forgave them. Michael's reading to Hanna is symbolic of this forgiveness. His initial reaction with Hanna is to be accusatory. After Michael moves beyond his desire to accuse he does not altogether forgive. Instead, his reconciliation with Hanna occurs in steps. He begins to send tape recordings of various books to Hanna while she is in prison. However, this is the only contact he allows. After some time, Michael agrees to see Hanna and assist her in the process of assimilation into modern society. Michael's actions seem to represent new or modern Germany's forgiveness of their parent's or their country's past actions. Although they might not agree with these actions, it is necessary to acknowledge the past in order to precede forward.Regardless if the audience approaches the book from a metaphorical analysis or just as general fiction, the book seems to be speaking about acknowledgement and forgiveness. Not that one must agree with what has happened, rather forgiveness in the sense that what has happened is our past. We must accept some responsibility or ownership for this past in order to move forward. The book is extremely open for interpretation. I do not feel that my perception of the overall message is the only possibility. This lack of absoluteness and the length of the book might be its most interesting aspects. Although the novel is only 218 pages, it speaks volumes."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"&quot;The Reader&quot; was a partially interesting book. I appreciated the spare prose, but it fell slack too often (many &quot;I don't remember&quot; phrases) and weakened the novel. Examples of spare prose that sustain tension throughout the story are &quot;The Retreat&quot; by Aharon Appelfeld (deals with the beginnings of the Holocaust) and &quot;The Liar&quot; by Martin Hansen (different subject matter, but a &quot;dark secret&quot; theme).The early relationship between the boy and Hannah was the best part of the book. If the rest of the story had been as detailed and taut, the impact would have been much stronger. Instead, the obviousness of the secret and the glosses over key events blurred other sections.I did like the ending's restraint; neat explanations or happy endings would have completely belied all that came before."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The author makes important points about responsibility to other people. However, the story and characters seem to be tools to deliver his message. The book reads well, but the characters are not convincing. However, it is more interesting than reading a philosophy book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book has an intriguing premise, but it underdelivers. Example: The main character gets married in one paragraph and divorced in the next. It certainly didn't pull on my heartstrings."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I am normally a non-fiction reader. This novel may bring me back to fiction. I basically agree with all the 4-5 star reviews, so I won't repeat. This novel is divided into three books. Book 1 was what I deem a typical novel with alot of sex. Book 2 explored some important moral issues (predominantly Germany during and after WWII). Book 3 completely overwhelmed me, and is the reason I am submitting my comments. Although I would rate the first two books three stars, the third book was a strong 5."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Let me comment on four issues raised in this outstanding novel: The position of women in post WW2 Germany, where many men had died in the war, is described by the example of Hanna, a middle aged woman, who reached out for romance to a 15-year-old boy. Romances and marriages between older women and younger men were quite common then. Hanna's illiteracy: The reader of the book should be aware that illiteracy was virtually nonexistent in Germany, and Hanna was certainly an oddity. Discussion of the holocaust since WW2 in Germany has been the touchiest of issues among large segments of the German population. While the young man in the book represents attitudes about the holocaust among liberal groups of people, this view is by no means the national norm, where antisemitic feelings tend to outweigh these conflicts of conscience. Finally, let me say that I believe the issue of guilt as regards the holocaust is not alone a German one as many reviewers seem to suggest. While our own parents were, of course, not the perpetrators, were they not in a position to rescue many of the victims of the holocaust? One may look, for example, to the ill fated Saint Louis. Do we in the United States have intergenerational discussions about this?"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I enjoyed this book. The ending wasn't the climax I expected, but it was still very thought provoking.

Endless discussions for students and book groups. Appropriate for mature students."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I could't put this book down. The imagery Michael presents of his memories with Hanna--juxtaposed with the realities of who she really was--allows us to consider our own frailties and our own ideas of both who and what we are. What is real? How do we cope? Michael's discussion with a man who justifies his involvement in WWII continues the underlying dichotomy--what is the manner in which we would have behaved under the same circumstances? What would you have done? The moral dilemmas stay with me. The characters and theme are reminiscent of Camus' The Stranger. I was thankful for the sparse yet powerful language. It allowed me to ruminate on what occurred without telling me how. A disturbing and intriguing read."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this book a few weeks ago and it continues to haunt me. I realize most of us will never deal directly with anything so horrific in our own lives, however we all have demons to deal with.

The novel has so many layers for such a short novel--it leaves you with much to think about and much to share with your children."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book has a very important message and is extremely well written. I loved the author's style which is simple and not overly wordy. However, I did not like a single character that I met in this book. Perhaps that was intentional.

The story of Hanna and Michael, in my mind, is a metaphor for the brutality that the Germans perpetrated on their victims. Hanna may have had excuses for her behavior (everyone does), but in the end what she did was very harmful to a young and impressionable boy. Why does the author segue from this odd relationship to a depiction of the horrors of the Holocaust? He is trying to force us to think about the moral choices that people make in situations that are not simple or clear cut. Is Hanna morally innocent in her relationship with Michael and in the way that she behaved in her former life? Should she be forgiven by Michael and by her other victims? Schlink raises these and other questions that make the reader uncomfortable and that force us to think about difficult issues. &quot;The Reader&quot; is intriguing and unnerving but it is also unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I started reading 'the reader' with great enthusiam. I found that the writing style was clunky and overly simple. I had trubles reading and continuing to read the book because of this. I thought that Schlink asks many interesting and moraly devastating questions to the character's and to the readers but it never eally answers them. The book is very predictable and overly simple. Skip this one it's a waste of time."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was a cut above the yearly crop of books seeking to be more literary than the mass of junk novels. It dared to take on the unpleasant topics of a psychologically damaging child seduction, Germany's post-war attempt to live in the dark shadow of the Holocaust and the alienation of human beings in the midst of society. The writing is economical, wasting no words on idle observations. I found myself brought somewhat hesitantly into a cold, harsh world, with the two protagonists exhibiting no great degree of humanity and evoking no warm feelings from me. My sympathy was given grugingly and almost with an embarrassment in feeling it. The only redeeming character in the story is the daughter-survivor, but even she is protrayed in a somewhat standoffish, chilly manner. I felt that the author wrote from the perspective of the rather overly self-controlled, self-conscious Germanic culture, uncomfortable without permitting himself any deep or unpleasant emotions. No one cries for the victims in this story, but that fact alone goes a long way towards understanding the type of personalities that could perpetrate the greatest evil this world has ever experienced."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I thought the book started well, telling the story of the boy and his relationship with this German woman. Once the affair ended, the story was lost in what he experiences in law school and how he finds out what happened to the woman after he last saw her.They never talked again. It took forever to get to the point of the book and her secret.It was a good story that could've been exploited better in the book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I know this book was panned in Oprah's Book Club of the month. Mostly because of the age difference between the two characters. I did not necessarily approve of the relationship but I don't think this book was really about the two of them. It was more about the depths that a person would take to cover up the fact that they could not read. What the character did to cover this was horrible. We all have some secret we're ashamed of but I know I would not have gone so far to hide a shameful secret. It's been a long time that I have read a book that made me think. It's been over a week since I have read it and it's still fresh in my mind. I recommend this book to anyone who has an open mind and can overlook the relationship between the two characters. Read on and don't close your mind to something that may shock you or even discust you. I read this in one sitting. It's an easy read and very well written."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Throughout the book, Michael talks about different images of Hanna that he can always recall (i.e. Hanna holding out a towel for him, Hanna biking, Hanna in his father's study, Hanna by the swimming pool, etc.). After finishing this novel, I found myself recalling the same images of Hanna and trying to make sense of her character. This was impossible to do, of course, because Schlink depicts his characters as so detached from each other that we can't make sense of who they are through their interactions. The numbness that Michael refers to in the second part of the novel is so poignant and relevant to out times as is his comment that tragedies sometimes become mere cliches that no longer interest people. Not so uplifting, but quite memorable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader was an interesting read. It was a bit short, but I don't think that the story could have been stretched out any further. It tackled important issues about life and love. However, if readers feel that they cannot overcome the concept of an adolescent being with a woman in her mid-thirties, perhaps they should stay away from this book. But hopefully, the age difference is not a deterrant for people because it is a well-written book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader by Bernhard Schlink is a book which deals with the themes of everyday life. A sample of these themes include love, betrayal, secrets, death, and denial. Schlink incorporates these themes into his writing through the characters lives, their thoughts, and their actions. An example is when Michael feels his betrayal of Hanna, &quot;This one moment summed up all my halfheartedness of the past months, which had produced my denial of her, and my betrayal.&quot; Schlink's writing captured my attention at the beginning with his strong sentence structure and imagery, with sentences like, &quot;When rescue came, it was almost an assault.&quot; The writing is what kept me reading till the last page, with more passages like, &quot;Her handwriting never became fluid, but it acquired something of the severe beauty that characterizes the writing of old people who have written little in their lives.&quot; The Reader is a great book which has the reader thinking about the themes in the book for a long time after the book is done."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A thoughtful, philosophical account of a marring, coming-of-age sexual experience. Although the translation is wanting at times, THE READER forgiveness, shame, sexual passion, diminished self-esteem among a few. The illiteracy explanation, however, is weak.

Nevertheless, it does serve to further weaken Hannah's character making her even less likeable."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I never wanted to finish a book so much as I did this book. I have never read a book by Mr. Schlink but now I'll be on the watch. I recommend for other people to read it."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts. The first part of the book deals with that encounter.While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials. The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war, had tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity, as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna. He stoically remains throughout the trial, realizing as he hears the evidence that she is refusing to divulge the one piece of evidence that could possibly absolve her or, at least, mitigate her complicity in the crimes with which she is charged. It is as if she considers her secret more shameful than that of which she is accused. Yet, Michael, too, remains mute on the fact that would throw her legal, if not her moral, guilt into question. Consequently, Hanna finds herself bearing the legal guilt of all those involved in the crime of which she is accused and is condemned accordingly.The third part of the book is really the way Michael deals with having found Hanna, again. He removes himself from further demonstration and discussion on the issue of Germany's Nazi past. It affects his decisions as to his career in the law, eventually choosing a legal career that is isolating. He marries and has a child but finds that he cannot be free of Hanna. He cannot be free of the pain of having loved Hanna. It is as if Hanna has marked him for life. He divorces and never remarries. It is as if he cannot love another, as he loved Hanna. Michael then reaches out to Hanna in prison, indirectly, through the secret they share of what she seems to be most ashamed. Yet, he carefully never personalizes the contact. The end, when it comes, is almost anti-climatic.The relationship between Michael and Hanna really seems to be analogous to the relationship between the generations of Germans in post-war Germany. The affair between Michael and Hanna is representational of the affair that Germany had with the Nazi movement. The eroticism of the book is a necessary component for the collective guilt and shame that the Germans bear for the Holocaust, as well as for the moral divide that seemingly exists between the generations. Yet, the book also shows that such is not always a black and white issue, that there are sometimes gray areas when one discusses one's actions in the context of the forces of good and evil. There is also the issue of legal and moral responsibility. One would think that the two are synonymous, but they are not always so. It also philosophizes on the ability to love another/a nation who/that was complicit in war crimes. This is an insightful, allegorical book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book. Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The topic of the Holocaust is raised almost every day in some manner. Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, \\"he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today\\" and \\"thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future.\\" Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in \\"The Reader\\". \\"Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame\\", his narrator and protagonist contemplates, \\"but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it\\".The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime. \\"The Reader\\", set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg. Michael, while not refuting guilt, shame, and atonement, is led to examine and dissect the complexity of inter-generational conflicts in the context of his personal experiences. Like Schlink himself, he grapples with the fundamental problem of the relationships between these two generations.Michael recounts the most important stages in his life, starting with experiences long passed in his youth. While his account follows the chronology of events, he progressively interleaves retrospective reflections on his past conduct, questioning his conflicting emotions - his behaviour. The story starts with Michael's first, secret, love affair at age 15 with a woman more than twice his age. The blossoming erotic relationship strengthens his self-worth and confidence yet, at the same time, increasingly isolating him from his family and peers. Hanna Schmitz, of whose circumstances and background Michael knew very little, was affectionate and standoffish at the same time, prone to abrupt mood swings. The young lover is completely captivated and eager to please. He is the \\"Reader\\", in German \\"Vorleser\\" is a person who reads aloud to an audience. At her insistence he reads his books to her and it becomes an important element of their shared intimacy. When she disappears one day without any warning, her loss leaves him devastated and scarred for life. He can only seek the reasons in his own actions. Seeing Hanna again years later and in unanticipated surroundings, triggers a flood of questions about the person he loved and thought he knew. Her behaviour raises many questions and Michael discovers a long secret that puts in doubt the facts as they are exposed. He also wrestles with himself over his own inaction when confronted with choices. \\"What would you have done?\\" Although addressed to the judge by the defendant, this question hangs over Michael, as it does over his whole generation. It encapsulates the primary dilemma of the child-parent generations relationships. Finally, writing the story of his life, drafting and redrafting it in his head until it is in a publishable form, is seen as a chance for his own recovery and for living his own life.The Reader, while a work of fiction, is deeply anchored in the personal experiences of the author and symbolic for his generation. His spare and unemotional language underlines the impression of a biographical investigation and is used quite deliberately. The English translation captures the tone and style amazingly well. Reading this book should not be an \\"easy pleasure\\" as some reviewers have suggested. The Reader covers difficult and complex terrain in a way that it forces the reader to reflect and question their own position long afterwards. Although written directly for a German audience of Schlink's and my generation, the novel, surprisingly, has attracted world-wide attention. While reviews and reactions among readers are highly diverse and even contradictory, it should be read by as many people as possible and with the care the subject matter deserves. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"What impressed me far more about this book than the main plot (15 year old has sensuous affair with much older woman who turns out to be former SS Guard), was a seemingly minor issue in the book. That issue was that of how the sons and daughters of the Germans who lived in Germany during WWII dealt with their &quot;Holocaust Legacy&quot;. My parents are Holocaust Survivors, and I have read a lot about the Holocaust, but little has been written on the topic of that first generation of Germans born after the end of WWII. The author articulately and clearly describes how the sons and daughters of those Germans who lived through WWII absolutely had no respect for their parents; that the sheer force of the genocide that their parents conspired in, ignored, or did whatever, demanded that their children's feelings toward them just had to plunge far deeper than the &quot;typical&quot; disdain which every generation of young people have toward their parents. My only wish is that the author had delved into this topic even further; as he himself was born in Germany in 1944, he is indeed a member of that postwar generation of Germans, and therefore has a unique perspective on the subject. As for the book generally, the plot was nothing short of incredible. With that said, I thought Parts I and III (the beginning and ending of the book) were very well-written; the author does a great job describing the sensuous affair of the teenager, and a great job at the end, about his conflicting feelings towards his former lover during and after her trial, and about what ultimately happens to her. However, the middle of the book was awful; it was written in a superficial manner, with no real character development. So remember: just keep reading until the end. All in all, a fascinating portrayal, from a German, of what it means for the post-war German generation to live with tremendously complex feelings concerning the Holocaust and their parents."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For the three hours it takes to read this short book, the outside world disappears. When it reappears at the book's conclusion, the reader's view of the behavior of some &quot;ordinary&quot; Germans during and after World War II is changed. Schlink sweeps up the reader and totally immerses him/her in dramatic tension, quick narrative pace, and thought-provoking views of the German past by creating a unique love story involving singular characters and spanning several decades. The book would have had a longer lasting effect for me, however, if an important &quot;secret,&quot; one which, in fact, impels Hanna's actions, had not been obvious to me from the start. Her behavior as the book progresses simply confirmed my early suspicions, preventing the suspense from developing fully. By the time the author formally reveals Hanna's secret, almost 2/3 of the book has passed. Additionally, I am not sure that protecting this secret is sufficient motivation to rationalize the full extent of Hanna's self-destruction. Michael's philosophical questioning, which adds immeasurably both to the thematic scope and pleasure of this book, does not fully explain his motivations, his actions, or his inactions, at least on the human level. Nevertheless, this is a totally absorbing, memorable novel with unusual characters in unusual conflicts, one which will reverberate long after you close its covers."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" is an intensely moving novella in which Michael, a fifteen-year old German boy, falls in love with a thirty-six-year old woman, Hanna, a streetcar conductor. A story as old as the hills, yet their affair became a life-altering event for both of them. The narrative is divided into three sections: one, the affair, two, Hanna's trial as the perpetrator of war crimes atrocities while she was serving as an SS guard in concentration camps, and three, Hanna's years of imprisonment following the trial and Michael's half-life seeking answers and salvation.In Part One Michael thinks he has betrayed Hanna by disavowal, by not admitting her existence to his friends. That is nothing compared to his betrayals of her during the trial and in her prison years. In the sections of the book in which Michael is trying to probe his own moral predicaments and dilemmas, his philosophical positions, his reasoning is complicated and convoluted.He goes to the judge to give him information, and he chickens out. He goes to his father and is satisfied with non-answers to his problems. He lacks moral courage and conviction and is willing to let events take their course. It is not a story of redemption, and no one gets off easy in this sad story.Michael attended all of Hanna's long trial and watched her tortured and damaging testimony. She realized he was in the courtroom but didn't acknowledge him. Hanna had a cold-blooded streak, and Michael had a selfish, cowardly stripe.When they first met he could see her tough side, her coldness at times. She called him, at first sarcastically \\"kid,\\" but it becomes obvious that she loved him. She loved to be read to, and he read serious stuff to her. When she left him, he vowed \\"never again to love anyone whom it would hurt to lose.\\" In later life he can't get over two parts of his life: Hanna and the trial.The book gives no easy answers. We cannot forgive Hanna for what she did. She had a secret that she tried desperately to keep.I think each reader will come away from this book with a different outlook, different opinions, different conclusions, but with a recognition of how real the two people have become and how they continue to inhabit and haunt our minds."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I will give you some good reasons why you should read this book.Although this is a book about the Holocaust, it is not primarily a book about the suffering of the Jews. It is instead a book about the Germans and, more importantly, the legacy of the Holocaust which has been left to a new generation who have had to deal with the disturbing and sometimes cruel knowledge of what their parents and loved ones may have done (or failed to do) during the Nazi era.When reading this book, I found myself wondering what I would be like if I were a young modern German and had to deal with the knowledge that my parents and grandparents did nothing to stop the horror of those times or perhaps may have actively contributed to it. Michael has the misfortune to fall in love with an older woman who was complicit in a horrible crime. The question that torments him is this; how can I be a good, warm, loving person if the person I love more than any other has done such a terrible thing? The story of Hanna, and his own inexplicable love and regard for her, haunts him throughout his life. Michael's quest to understand why this should be so is the basis for much of this subtly compelling book.Perhaps it is the banality of Hanna's secret - ie. that she is illiterate - that is the reason some reviewers have felt disappointed by this book. We are so used to stories of the Holocaust such as &quot;Sophie's Choice&quot; where the magnitude of the suffering seems to dwarf anything we could possibly imagine and if that is the type of story you are looking for, &quot;The Reader&quot; will not deliver that. However, the value of this work is that it looks at another aspect of the Holocaust, that is to say, the way in which young Germany has had to try to come to terms with the crimes of the past. This is an interesting subject to me.If you do not want to read yet another forumlaic book about those dreadful times, and if you want your mind to be open to another perspective of the Holocaust, then I recommend that you read this book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Once again, I read an \\"Oprah Pick\\" without realizing it until afterword. Anyway... this is a superficially simple novel that, for all its flaws, is worth spending a little time thinking about. The foremost thing to realize about it, is that it's main theme concerns postwar Germany's grappling with the legacy of the Holocaust. It's about those who were adults during the war, and the next generation. It's about how that younger generation (of which Schlink is certainly a member) reacted to the generation and individuals who participated in the Holocaust.Recounted in memoir form, the story begins with the tale of a 15-year-old boy and his sexual affair with a 36-year-old tram female tram conductor. The man tells of this time with a certain air of nostalgia that is somewhat understandable. And yet, if one thinks about the ages of the two people, it's also horrific. Make the boy a girl, and make the conductor a man, the psychological dynamic becomes rather clear. This is a problematic element in the novel, and one that is never dealt with in any way.Years after their affair had ended, the now young man discovers that his older lover was a concentration camp guard and was involved in an incident in which a number of prisoners were locked inside a burning church. The twist in the matter is that she fails to properly defend herself of the charges of being the ringleader in the incident because she is secretly illiterate. Clearly the author isn't trying to excuse her war crimes in any way, or imply that she's somehow not really at fault. In prison she learns to read and studies the Holocaust in great deal, and importantly, decides that there is no redemption or atonement available for what she did.But does the author mean this to apply to all Nazis? Or just those who fell into it? And what precisely does that mean? And, and important, but unexplored point, why does he chose to mention at the very beginning that she is Romanian, and never again? So, plenty to think about and discuss. I found the writing to be very precise and clean, an apparently excellent translation, although others' tastes may vary. Someone should translate and publish his crime novels."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"For the first part of &quot;The Reader&quot; I was totally engrossed by the powerful tale of passion so eloquently expressed by Mr. Schlink. As the plot unfolded the writing appealed less to the emotions but more to the intellect as the author dealt with the complexities of the German postwar conscience. A tribute to the power of this work is the fact that I finished the book over 2 months ago and yet I still think about it regularly and still feel the passion between the characters as if I myself had been part of their story"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\", like a fine play, evolves over three acts.In Act I, 15-year old student Michael Berg falls for an anonymous older woman who he later learns is Frau Hanna Schmitz. She helps him as he falls ill on the way home from school and he is so touched by her gentle and quiet deameanor that he continues to visit her. This love affair is more than physical and they connect deepest when Michael reads to the illiterate Hanna. He reads classic novels, philosophical essays and poetry. The prose Bernard Schlink uses to describe the blossoming love affair is tender and deeply affective.In Act II, the startling revalation that Frau Schmitz was guilty of several war crimes as a member of the Nazi party - specifically causing the death of many women and children at various concentration camps. A startled Michael sits through every day of the trial in disbelief - right up to her conviction of life imprisonment.Act III finds a broken Michael - divorced after 5 years and leaving a young daughter behind. He has never gotten over Hanna and she haunts him still. He begins to record full novels on cassettes and mails them to her jail. Upon learning she may be released early - after 18 years imprisonment - he meets with her again. She is now a quiet old woman and he no longer a boy. The ending is both tragic and just as the questions of life & death and morale beliefs are strained.I can only hope Stephen Daldry's film with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes can carry even a little of the emotional energy brought forth in this moving novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I loved this short little book which brings up so many deep questions about life. A 15-year old is not emotionally mature enough to cope with such an intense relationship and will more than likely be affected for the rest of his life. How well do you know the people you become involved with? Is it wrong to love someone who has done bad things in the past? Do we ever really &quot;get over&quot; anything? And how true, the last chapter is. Whenever I cry for any little thing, I cry for the unhealed emotional wounds of the past. I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one of the books that just embrace you in the time that story is told, with considerable amount of subtile emotions which probably has erupted only from author's private life. Life of Hannah is itself very interesting, but story of passion between young boy and older women which can be lock only in their private little own world is a sensitive story which last all life. Story explains in melanholic matter how early experiences are very important for adult life, no matter how long are lasting, just to have very strong emotional impact. The book says one impotant thing about our life, that little, tiny moments, matters in our life are important to us, on which we reconcile with each other."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader, by Bernard Schlink, was a moving book. When the aurthor describes the relationship of the two,Michael and Hanna, it makes you feel like you were there going through all that they did. The way he wrote this made me feel like I was in the shoes of one of the character's. I love how he runs through Michaels life at a great moving pace, and then when the problems occur he uses such great structure of how it was. Bernard Schlink uses so many emotions throughout this book you never get tired. When he starts the book with Michael getting sick and being helped by Hanna you never would think anything of anything. Then he goes and describes how they have a very intimate relationship as those of adults, with all the fights and emotions. When you think everything is good for the two he surprises you with the sudden disapperance of Hanna. I thought it was great how he could show how years later after alot of maturing Michael could still love a woman who walked out on him and was now being tried and convicted of murder years ago. At the end when Michael gives Hanna's money to the soul survivor of the murder at a concentration camp, he sends it in the name of Hanna who was sentenced to death for a crime that both she and Michael knew she would have prevented if able. I love how he uses a whirlwind of emotions and at the end gets you with the best kinds, heartbreak and ever lasting love."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I object in principle to books of fiction that use the holocaust as a background or as a means of furthering a plot. Go somewhere else to find the motifs of fictionalized drama, and leave those things which are sacred and still painfult to thousands, alone. It is a very rare writer who can touch that theme without cheapening or trivializing it, and this is not one of them.The theme of the book (love between and older, experienced woman, and an adolescent boy) is a cliche, and the book is riddled with one improbable event after another, making for a distracting and tedious reading. The characters in the book do not become alive, and in part this is due to an improper anchoring of the point of view. An omniscient writer is bad enough, but an omniscient protagonist is intolerable.Are there no redeeming values here? Of course there are. The story is sweet and sentimental and, from reading some of the more of 500 reviews posted here, it has obviously been very pleasing to many people. In my view \\"The Reader\\" should have been rewritten a few times more until it condensed itself into an acceptable short story."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The first time I picked up The Reader I was astonished at it's boldness. I was not prepared for the oncoming adult content but nevertheless I enjoyed it. The Reader held my attention throughout the entire novel. I did not run into any slow points nor did I run into any really confusing areas. I enjoyed the level of difficulty in the writing but it was never too hard to follow. I think the sexual anecdotes also kept my attention.

Schlink incorporates adolecence, sex, war, and The Holocaust as he tell the story as a flashback. His intergections of what he has learned throughout his years allows for the &quot;reader&quot; to have an idea of what is happening in the bigger picture. The book is very easy to read and follow.

He uses sex, love, and war to keep his audience attached and reading. He questions humanity with the stories of the Holocaust and love between a 36 year old woman and a 15 year old boy. By attaching the audience to Michael, Schlink shows how it is human nature to forgive the people close to you. I recommend this book if you are looking for a perspective on how post WWII Germans could forgive their families for such attrocities."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Tihs is a great book to read.

Some of the reviews see this as a love story or one of pedophilia, but I don't really think either of these views are correct. What Hanna did was pedophilia but I do not think this was the focus. In the same instance, I do not think Hanna ever really loved him. It was about the boy's love and devotion to her. I found that the writing for the court room scene was a little much. What he wrote could have been cut down in half. He continually wrote on how her neck tensed or what her body language was for pages on end, when we just could have heard the story of the victims and the trial. At first I did not like the ending, but after thinking about it I changed my mind. Sometimes we hold on to memories because we don't want to think any different of how things can be, and the reality of change can really frighten us. It was kind of like the Great Gatsby where he wanted to hold on to this image that was just not true. I think the beggining is great, the middle is a little bland, and the ending really makes you think."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a fairly simple easy reading. I wasn't involved with the characters. The author told his story and I felt very distant from everybody. I could understand where he is coming from, but I didn't relate with the author's drive.Everything was gelid. Gelid way of love, gelid way of killing people, gelid way to live in general. But it still caught my interest. There are some interest topics as, for example, the post-war German generation having to come to terms with what their parents did.I liked the book. Not spectacular, but readable and above the average.PS. I haven't seen the movie yet."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Being intrigued by the movie, I read the translated book. It is a very small book, but written well. Very simplistic, without the build up and climaxes of most fiction.

At her insistence, he reads to her, constantly. She suddenly leaves and then shows up, years later as a defendent in a trial. The young man is now a law student studying her trial. Is she guilty? Probably. Evil? No. In her own soldier-like, proud, primitive way, she is the perfect fall guy as we all have seen in history. The law student, now a lawyer has his own dilemna of protecting a friend or watching her being punished. Given the situation, he does the best that he can while still trying to convince himself of right and wrong.

Read it in a day."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is one story that has levels upon levels, or is it meanings that multiply. The story is simple enough: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get along without, girl comes back, boy loses girl. At first, being a guy, I felt that his love affair was not out of the norm or bad, but when she left, it created a very big hole for him. Then, during the trail, I thought that the problems were with the guilt and whatnot of being German after World War II: were all those people guilty just by being there? Truly the bad people who were cruel or sadistic deserved punishment, but what of the others, who did what they were told, following orders, or who just watched neighbors being taken away, were they so guilty, as well? In the end, it is presented that he was abused, just as any girl might have been, and it affected him. He did not even realize it, but there it was throughout his life, she hovered and poked at him.I am sure that there are meanings I have not understood or seen, but it still affected me as a great story would.I saw the movie first and thought there should have been more to it, so I read the book to find out.Addendum: After listening to the author discuss this book on a radio show, I got to thinking how I had missed the point of the story, but on rereading this review, I see I did not miss it by much. His point was the guilt of the German people was also for loving to those who committed the atrocities of World War II. How can you love them? How can they be accepted back into society so easily? These were more serious questions in the Fifties and Sixties since there were guilty ones still around and the next generation was getting to know them, to understand somehow they must answer these questions. The timeliness may be passed for them, but it is still here for those who have murderers, rapist or other criminals in their circle of family or acquaintances.

The language is simple (I can't belive that somebody complained about it being too simple!), and there were deep underlying themes to the novel. For those of you who thought the characters were not deep enough, I don't think the auther intended tham to be. He wasn't just talking about Micheal and Hannah, he was talking generally. I don't think it was Schlink's intent for the reader to focus soley on the two main characters. As for Hannah, one cannot understand the shame of illiteracy if one has not experienced it themselves. I don't understand Hannah's motives for her actions (or lack of them, I should say) or her reasons for her suicide. But for me, that did not take away from the meaning of the story.

The author and publisher of this book should be condemned for writing and publishing it.I am not impressed with a story that would let an accused person suffer because the protagonist's character, especially a protagonist who is attending law school, is too weak to speak up concerning the special knowledge he has that would reduce the culpability of the accused...unless the central part of the story was his character and the moral dilemma he was in and subsequent suffering for not have more moral courage to speak out. However, his lack of moral courage does not seem to be the point of the story.

It seems that the movie deals more with child abuse and the inability to feel.The boy was from an emotionless family and he was attracted to an emotionless older woman.Don't the psychology books tell us that we are attracted to the people who are most like our mothers and/or fathers who have impressed upon us for the majority our youth.My feeling about the book is we as a society in the present or in the past choose to overlook the morality of government whether it be Germany or the US. The government is there for control, to make people rich, to control our beliefs and keep us dependent on the government. They want to be mother and father and for us believe in them to make the right decisions. Then we don't have to take responsibility or think or make the decisions which requires time and energy.When people disagree with government decisions, they can easily be outcasts or called \\"un-American\\" as we saw happen 7 years ago. People who didn't believe that the Iraqi war was morally right were labeled anti American. Have we forgotten that???? Many Right-winged Republican have forgotten and the only excuses they seem to come up with are\\" Bush was advised poorly and Hillary voted for the war\\"....not that Bush lied along with his leadership to have the war they had prepared for and yes, Hillary did vote for the war in fear that she would be labeled anti-American.So back to the book.... many soldiers who are sent to war probably to do not have good reading skills nor reading comprehension skills, does this excuse them from killing? Do we honor our soldiers who kill? Do our churches ask us to honor the soldiers who kill and send letters that they are doing a good job and we support them? So are we not as quilty of supporting killing?Was Hanna part of the wheel of the government that asks no questions but just does the job??Do our own young men and women end up with tortured lives from the wheel of government which sends them to war to kill?I thought the book to be thought provoking!I thought the movie missed the mark!This is a book to be read more than once to produce thought and questions.The first time I read the book, it did not produce the questions it does now.Isn't this good literature when it provokes thought, reaction, emotions and discussion???What is Right?Is it what our government leaders tell us or what we feel inside? Are we able to feel inside if we only accept what the government tells us?If this book were not about the Holocaust, how would it be evaluated?Would it be evaluated the same for the sexual abuse of a 15 year old boy in Iraq or Afghanistan?THE READER is a wonderful book to read and think about!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"A beautiful, haunting book. Sags a little in the middle when the author gets heavy with the holocaust court hearings, but the pace soon picks up again and builds towards a shattering, numbing climax. Leaves you with a tingling feeling down your spine, the sign of a really great novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This novel is one I would classify as a \\"tale\\" because it has the moral weight and simple elegance of one of Hawthorne's tales. There are few characters in this tale. And the two main characters seem to represent so much. These two characters are the narrator, Michael Berg, who begins his account with the story of how he lost his virginity at age 15 to a 36 year old streetcar conductor named Hanna Schmitz, and the streetcar conductor herself, whose life continues to interlace with Berg's. Their story spans a period of about thiry years, a period long enough for Michael to learn much about pride, guilt, shame, disappointment, and the ability of human beings to numbly accept just about any degree of indignity. At first I was taken aback by the affair between the schoolboy and the conductor (were the sexes reversed, I wondered whether most readers would have been either outraged or guiltily titilated). But, in the end, the narrator seems to come to a point where he has a perspective on how he had been exploited. Indeed, this experience of exploitation seems to parallel even greater forms of human exploitation and becomes key to understanding many of the other things that unfold in this tale. The way the story progresses is truly masterful and to describe the plot would deprive readers of their own first impressions. Schlink seems to have William Faulkner's gift to force readers to reconsider each character's merits chapter after chapter. If you can, stay away from any review that reveals too much about the storyline. Surrender to the experience of discovery and reflection.This brief novel seems grounded in major philosophical and theological issues--like the roles of conscience and the will. In fact, the stunning paragraph on pp. 19-20 about conscience (\\"Often enough in my life I have done things I had not decided to do.\\") seems to come right out of St. Paul (\\"I can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I do.\\" Romans 7:18,19). The nature of evil and moral lassitude is at the very heart of this book. Another association: The narrator's description of his desire to achieve numbness on a skiing trip called to mind the conversation between the man and the woman about indifference in Marguerite Duras's screenplay for \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\" (ISBN 0802131042). This association may be especially apt considering that Renais's film involves painful recollections of the World War II experiences of a French woman who was ostracized for her love affair with a German soldier and of a Japanese man's experience of the Hiroshima bombing.The \\"tale-like\\" quality of the story also made me wonder if the reader wasn't being asked to make something of the main characters' names. \\"Berg\\" is somewhat ethnically ambiguous; \\"Michael\\" is the name of one of the militant angels; \\"Hanna\\" means \\"grace\\" and was the name of a pious Jew in the Hebrew Bible.\\"The Reader\\" is a powerful story. It's one you'll want to read carefully...and more than once."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is difficult to write a synopsis of The Reader. The intellectual interpretation is that it is a very good story of a relationship gone sour with lack of closure. The emotional interpretation is that the book is filled with anger and resentment. We meet the narrator as a fifteen year old boy. Although he is a grown man now telling this story, his character remains static as he lacks compassion and refuses to understand the world at levels below the surface--i.e. there is no introspection that allows him to grow, understand, find piece. As children are narcissists interpreting the world unto themselves--forever responsible for the actions of the universe--so is the narrator. All of a sudden his lover abandons him. But, as we learn she had a dynamic and perplex life of her own that motivates her. The tragic flaw of the story is the lack of communication. The gift of the story are the questions it raises during the debate which is the most moral decision: to support someone's autonomy and freedom or to support their happiness? For any of you who have children, this is the question that keeps us awake at night. This is the question that shadows this novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is a wonderfully constructed novel in every aspect. It tells the story of a young man, his older lover and his rediscovering her while he is a law student and she is on trial for Nazi war crimes. There is a wonderfully dramatic scene during the trial. Layer upon layer of meaning and questions evolve from the narrative, the characters. In retrospect the reader sees 'clues' to the secret held by the woman that generate a moral delemma and pose social questions relevant today.If a task of a really good novel is to draw the reader into a world and have him see through others eyes a different reality that changes the reader's insight, this novel more than meets that goal."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"It is much easier to write a scathing review than to be humbled in the face of what for me is, to date, the best book that I have ever read. THE READER By Bernard Schlink is only one of ten books that I have already read this year and though I have recommended it to others no one has had quite the irreversible effect from its reading that I did. I finished it awhile ago and yet there is not a detail that I don't still recall. I am not often up for a second reading of anything except WUTHERING HEIGHTS and yet I can hardly wait for the third copy I have purchased and loaned to be returned so that I can read it again. I am so afraid that I may have missed something in my first and second reading.The reviews on this novel are honest and for me they spell out clearly why it meets so precisely my criteria for the near perfect story. Schlink never uses an extra word, never describes an event not absolutely essential to the story, never wastes or neglects a minute of your time. Truely, this is a story for the ages.For weeks after reading about the middle-aged woman who would rather be exposed for an ex-Nazi guard than be found out to be uneducated in post-war Germany,I could only debate the decision of her former lover not to help her at her trial. I kept remembering how he had once loved her and how he had failed,in the course of his life, to find a relationship as important to him as the one he had had with her. I debated his choice with a vehemence I rarely feel, for any characters in a novel; afterall, it is once and for all only fiction, correct?I was truely sorry to finish this book; it is unfortunately, a very quick read. Though it needed to be no longer in length, it was a genuine loss when it was finished and a story that I am still dizzy from.This is a very small investment with a king sized reward!"},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"\\"The Reader\\" explores Germany's guilt-ridden relationship with its own past by objectifying it in the sexual and emotional coupling of a 15-year-old boy and a 36-year-old woman. On the face of it, that doesn't sound like the premise for one of the best pieces of Holocaust fiction available (certainly the best I've read), but it is. Far from eroticizing Nazism or trivializing the Holocaust, using the metaphor of a human relationship makes them both more accessible. Schlink provides a way into the unique postwar experience of the German people by relating it to things we have all experienced: guilt and romantic love. Issues and events which usually repel or dismay us with their enormity are taken out of the zones of History and Philosophy and reconfigured on to a human scale - the scale on which they happened, and on which they must be confronted if we are ever to understand them fully. I was surprised and moved to find a novel which treats the Holocaust in this way; a novel which risks being horribly misunderstood in order to foster understanding. The erotic aspect of the novel is, in the end, a minor one and hardly the point: it's about so much more than that. Through careful characterisation and plot development, Schlink manages not only to make plain the ease with which German civilians were drawn into unspeakable roles, but also to explore the difference between a legal conviction and real justice, between retribution and recompense, and, most importantly, the almost insoluble situation in which Germans born postwar find themselves - laden with guilt for things they did not do and for which they cannot possibly atone. Interestingly, Schlink's book also becomes a sustained yet subtle commentary on the function of literature and literacy as ways of recording and recovering the past. (Those interested in this subtext might like to read next W. G. Sebald's \\"On The Natural History of Destruction\\" which explores the historical unwillingness, and therefore the contemporary inability, of German literature to deal with the terrorist victimization of German civilians at the hands of the Allies.) For all its high intent, and equally high achievement, \\"The Reader\\" is almost an easy read. Schlink's language (or Carol Brown Janeway's translation, at least) is smooth, straightforward, concise and precise. His subject is dignified by such simplicity."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I've read this book in Polish so literary values of the English translations are not the point of my reflexion.I just wanted to say - this book will make yours eyes sweat...It never happened to me while reading. I just could not stop crying.No great classical novels have ever made me feel this way. This modest book appears in an era when writing a GREAT novel is wirtually impossible. We all know why, and we all agree. Of course - great novels can appear in the context of postmodern American Literature, but they don't necessarily make a great read.Schlink does it with his modesty and understatement.And one more thing: THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT HOLOCAUST. The author had chosen the Poles to be the victims in this book - please respect it. 3.000.000 Poles (besides another 3.000.000 Jewish citizens of Poland) died from German atrocities during WWII - and when one uses the word Holocaust it denies them the right to memory."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink's \`\`The Reader'' is a fascinating book, at first, a kind of first-love story of an adolescent and an older woman and second the emotional trial of both the boy and the woman in a postwar Holocaust trial. I feel it is the second part of the book which really captivates, the first part, as the relationship between the boy and the woman develops in a stunted way with a lack of emotional attachment or closeness by the woman, something which the boy craves, does not capture me anywhere near as much. I could feel for the boy, his first crush if you like, something all boys go through, who hasn't suffered through a crush on a teacher for example. The writing is simple and to the point not too much beating around the bush and yet still eloquent, maybe because of it. In the second half of the book one finds out why the woman is so distant and why she moved away so suddenly with the boy emotionaly distraught. She was a concentration camp guard during the war and her inability to form close relationships are part of her, possible self-hatred/guilt, and fear of any sort of vulnerability especially as regards her inability to read. Through the trial we find out much about the feelings of the boy and the aftermath of his own guilt and fear and the subsequent sending to her, in prison, of tapes made by the now adult boy while he read books to her. Its remarkable and hard to put down.A good book."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"At first I was not excited to read The Reader since it had already been movie-ized. When there is already a movie, it usually kills the book for me. HOWEVER....not in this case.The Reader as a book is first rate. Schlink is a simple, clear, and highly effective writer. What I enjoyed most about the book was the thought provoking nature of the characters and their relationship. Certainly, the facts of Hanna's crime are horrific. But her character, and relationship with Michael Berg and his with her left so many avenues of mental exploration open. To me, the way Schlink sublimely accomplished this open-ended invitation to the nuances and angles of judgment was shear literary genius.Regardless of a reader's ultimate opinions of Hanna and Michael, and what the story says about the German people's relationship to their Holocaust History, I count The Reader as a book I adored being bothered by. (And for the record I thought Hanna was a ignorant sociopathic pedophile)."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I don't read a variety of books, so I especially found the exploration of Hanna's involvement with the German SS during World War II provacative. The impetus for committing atrocities during the halocaust is indeed questioned. An examination and a resulting attempt at seeking a further understanding of \\"man's inhumanity to man\\" is presented in a format and at a level new to me and perhaps to many other readers.I agree with some other readers' viewpoints as to the apparent shallow nature of the affair between Hanna and Michael. I do not agree that the author tired of the plot and sought to end it in a careless manner. I felt that the story ended in the only \\"comfortable\\" way that was possible. Michael paid a price in the end for jumping to conclusions as to the true appeal of Hanna as a human being. But giving Michael the opportunity to interface again with Hanna would have led to the substance of another book with even more interesting, conflicting, and probably discouraging interaction.Is it possible this was a memoir? I have not heard this nor researched this question as yet."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"There were many levels of insight that were striking and new for me, but it was also just a great read. I couldn't put it down. I kept thinking back on conversations I had had at different times in Germany, some late at night after glasses of wine, but one with an aloof airport official in the glaring light of day. We talked around this national consciousness of a crime that was somehow everyone's. And yet how long should or would the people carry this dark millstone? This book illucidated all the backs and forths of that shared sense of darkness, and why lots of German citizens would rather do anything but dwell in those memories.But I don't do it justice by giving the impression that it was only about war crimes. It was a fascinating, sometimes sad and thoroughly beautiful story from beginning to end. A very good book, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This book came very quickly and was in the condition promised. It was a pleasure doing business with this seller and I'll look for them again in the future."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I just finished reading this book and i just had to say it was amazing. I read it in less than 3 days it got me hooked from the first page til the end. The way in what is written from the main character's point of view makes it somehow more personal and it was for me as though i was reading that person's memories and thoughts through his teenage years and into adulthood and the way this woman became such an important part of his life.I think what i loved the most was also the fact that since he was talking about his past the story moved on really quick. I mean is not like an everyday book written in present tense but mostly was like a jump into his memories with details about the many things that surrounded him through his whole life and his thoughts about it, from friends in school to the way people act everyday and it makes the reader analyze these questions at the same time with the author.The ending was really emotional i could feel myself holding back some tears through the last couple of chapters making me feel as though i was part of the story myself.I recomend this book to everyone is beautifully written and pretty fast reading. I can't wait to see the movie now which probably wont be as great as the book but i'll have to try."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"The Reader is a simple book with a simple story. It manages to be both intriguing and interesting... yet very predicable at the same time. It's predictability doesn't really hamper the book, but the emotions of whoever reads the book might be hampered slightly.Michael Berg, when he's fifteen, is stricken with Hepatitis. When he's weak, he's helped by a mysterious woman named Hanna, who is twice his age. She's a mysterious character with a very mysterious past, as well as her own secrets she wants to hide. As time carries on, Michael and Hanna begin to have an affair. Their relationship soon evolves from lust into something more romantic... and mysterious. One thing that strikes Michael as odd is that Hanna insist on one thing: that he read to her.One day when he comes to visit her, however, she has just disappeared and has not left any hints as to where she has gone. Michael, devastated, can do nothing more than move on with his life. He eventually finds himself studying law in school, with an Instructor who insists on them viewing and analyzing a trial. It is here, years later, when Michael sees Hanna again... on the stand. He will now learn more about his former lover than he has ever known, and much more than he'd like to. Only her secret can save her... but she's so ashamed of it that she considers it worse than murder.Unfortunately, the only real place where The Reader goes wrong is that \\"secret\\". We're dropped many hints throughout the book. And while the trial and story are compelling, some may not exactly like the idea of reading through so many pages just to find out she can't read, which is really not much of a secret through the book. However, there's more after it which is very nice to read. We get to learn more about Hanna's character and really see her develop. This does turn out to be much more than just what she has to hide, and that helps it become a much better book. It just feels a little anti-climatic. But it still works.The characters are well developed and the language is, overall beautiful. The Reader isn't a very long book, nor is it very difficult to read. Many readers will probably be able to finish it in a single sitting. At the very least it shouldn't keep you busy for much more than a week.It's a good book overall, but many will come to her big secret a little differently. It brings about an interesting question as to whether self preservation is more important than shame, but many readers still might not come too kindly to this aspect of the novel."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"I read this a few years ago when it was recommended to me to help improve my rusty German and was gripped by it. It offers an insight into the dilemma which has faced those generations of Germans who were too young to be personally guilty but who knew those who were; as colleagues, or worse as friends, or even worse as family. In this case as an early sexual partner; and as having a Nazi criminal for a father or uncle might blight your family life when you found out, so might what happens to the narrator here blight your emotional life.As those who bore personal guilt die off and even those who knew them age (most of today's Germans have never met anyone who was of adult age during the Nazi era) this dilemma ceases to arise, but since evil will occur again it behoves us all to think how we would act if we were faced with those who had perpetrated it. In short, what we would do if we were this young man."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"This is the story of a woman (Hanna) who once committed an unforgivable crime, but who nevertheless receives lifelong love and devotion from a boy (Michael) who she seduced when he was only fifteen. This story isn't for prudes, even though the sex in the book isn't graphic. Rather, you can't be the type to shy away from the darker side of human nature and still appreciate the truth and beauty of this novel. Usually when evil is shown in popular books and movies, it takes an exaggerated, almost comic oppositional tone (ex: Hannibal Lector). So rare is it to find that the true face of evil can be not only attractive, but sympathetic. Bernhard Schlink makes us understand and care for Hanna, because we only see her through Michael's eyes. We know intellectually that she was evil (especially at the end, when the survivor he encounters states \\"she really was a brutal woman\\"), but we don't want to believe that any more than he does. Schlink's book was written to explore the moral qualms experienced by second generation Germans struggling to reconcile their parents' roles in the Holocaust, but I found the individual, human elements of this very honest love story even more compelling than the political issues the writer linked them to."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Who are the people you meet on the journey through life and how much do you know about them? Here we see a snapshot, a true and lovely snapshot from The Reader's point of view. Then in a shock, the Reader looks into that he never saw. The writing is heavy in the first section and quick and shocking as the Reader takes off the rose colored glasses. We are all human and some of us more human than others."},{"Title":"The Reader","review":"Bernhard Schlink's THE READER is written so simply and perfectly, that any one of any age, gender, ethnicity, or other can enjoy this book. In order not to spoil a thing, all I will say is that the story surrounds the relationship that forms between a teenage boy and an older woman in mid-20th century Germany. Later in life, when they are brought back together in unlikely circumstances, Schlink examines not only their history, but the very recent history of Nazi Germany in a trial that is difficult to forget.While I have not read the original German, the translation by Carol Brown Janeway is exquisite. The writing is so simple, and yet the way in which Schlink describes emotion and relationships makes the character's turmoil so complicated. The conclusion of the book is very well done, whether you find it inconclusive or not. The point is not to wrap up every emotional detail into a nice little bow, but instead to leave you with a proper finish, thinking about the 200+ pages you have just (speedily) read.It is a very quick read that you will not forget due to the depth that somehow arises from such simple words. It pulls at your heartstrings to know the lengths these characters will go to protect themselves. And now that it is being made into a movie, I am certain that the excitement surrounding this book is only bound to increase. As in every case, read this book before you see the movie! I am certain it is going to be very well done, with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, but I think it will be difficult to completely live up to the perfection of Schlink's writing.Become the reader yourself and pick up this book. It's just too good to pass up."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Christian Tradition","review":"I have used this book heavily to build my library of classics. It is an annotated book list divided into Christian, non-Christian, and Children's literature and by historical periods: The Ancient World, The Middle Ages, The Early Modern World (The Reformation, Renaissance), The Eighteenth Century, The Nineteenth Century, The Twentieth Century, and Contemporary Candidates for Greatness. Parents, such as myself, will greatly appreciate the separate chapter and list dedicated solely to Children's literature. I have used this chapter to collect quality books for my children.Glaspey gives you a short commentary on each book (and excerpts from some authors), and tells you how best to make use of the reading lists he provides. He also gives good reasons why Christians should read non-Christian books. Also provided is a list of ten books which he feels every Christian ought to know. Included are books by C.S. Lewis, Dostoevsky, Augustine and Tozer among others.This is a book for Christian biblioholics to savor. It was through this book that I discovered some of my favorites such as &quot;A Testament of Devotion&quot; by Thomas Kelly, and Christian authors such as Walker Percy, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and Flannery O'Connor. Many books he names, Christian and non-Christian, I already knew and read and others, such as books by Norman Geisler, I was disappointed to find missing. But overall, this is an excellent resource and one that is unique. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Great Books of the Christian Tradition","review":"This book provides an excellent curriculum, if you will, of books every Christian should read in his or her lifetime. Although the focus is on Christian literature throughout the centuries, there is also a list of non-Christian works that have shaped our world which the author rightly advocates reading. There is even a separate list of books for children (although adults could benefit from reading some of these as well). The descriptions of each work are very concise, with excerpts from some works scattered throughout. One can read through this book in a couple of hours; that way, one has plenty of time to start digging into the books themselves, which is the whole point!"},{"Title":"P-51 Mustang (Combat Legends)","review":"I thought it is a combat history book, but disappoint me"},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"I liked \\"Two Demons and a Dead Man\\" by Chris Lindsay. Each work of Chris has its own certain precious qualities. I found this work as a mixture of allegory and comedy. You may start laughing somewhere in the play, but suddenly you come to realize that they are also laughing: you can hear them laughing at people in society. The other interesting new feature of this work is that it has gone beyond a \\"social criticism;\\" it is a \\"Universal Criticism,\\" or it is better to say, it is an \\"Us Criticism.\\" Though a criticism, it gives us some hope at the end; and this is a new, rare, and invaluable style: perhaps the best for our time. Chris Lindsay, so artistically, has preserved all these qualities by means of an uncomplicated, but still impressive, language in his work."},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"Just when you thought it was over for Bob, back he comes. One of BC's best characters is resurrected in this sequel to the hilarious \\"The Man Who Loved Working Women\\", and the introduction of deeper beings only adds to the storyline. Definitely designed for a dual or split set, this play stays true to Chris Lindsay's form, continuing the pace set by the first. I have shared this with a few friends and the reaction was unanimously positive."},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"Don't be fooled by the title, because this play is anything but dark and sinister. Lindsay has done a skillful job of incorporating wit and humour into the normally disturbing topics of hell, devils and demons. The characters' antics are sure to generate a smile or chuckle. Prepare for a funny and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"Chris Lindsay's play \\"Two Demons and a Dead Man\\" has seen multiple incarnations over itslifespan. \\"Formerly entitled \\"Burn in Hell\\" then \\"Journey to Hell,\\" the play is now being re-released under its most clever and original title to date. The play itself has received a major overhaul, with existing scenes and characters receiving makeovers of varying severity, while several secondary characters have been cut out completely.For the uninitiated, this play is the tale of Bob, a womanizing accountant who dies of a heart attack in the opening scene. Of course, it's after his death that the real story begins.We follow Bob through his descent into Hell, his meeting with Deadly and Firehead-- the titular two demons, and his guided tour of the underworld. I should point out that this is no Dante's Inferno, though. Lindsay's Hell is a darkly comic world of boilings in oil, endless stairways, and flame-spewing demons. And of course, a handful of colourful damned souls forBob to meet.The play's scope, however, is--for better or worse-not limited to the depths of Hades. The hellish scenes of Bob's torment are juxtaposed nicely with scenes of Bob's grieving loved ones getting up to all sorts of bizarre antics in his hospital room. Their quasi-successful attempts to revive Bob supply ample humour for the audience, as well as endless aggravation for the demons, as Bob continually shifts back and forth between worlds.The hospital, as it turns out, is no less colourful than Hell. A place of alien doctors, escaped mental patients, andatrocious medical care facilities, it holds up quite well as a secondary location for goings on.As you may have already guessed, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest version of Chris Lindsay's literary journey to hell. Sadly, despite its many improvements the play still has its flaws. Some of the dialogue remains awkward, longwinded or even unnecessary, and a few of the jokes are just plain unfunny. But these are minor quibbles. \\"Two Demons\\" is, as they say, more than the sum of its parts. Sarcastic, clever, sometimes irreverent, and always entertaining, \\"Two Demons and a Dead Man\\" has become the play it always should have been."},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"Two Demons and a Dead Man is a great sequel to Chris Lindsay's first screenplay, The Man Who Loved Working Women. With the strength of some of the original characters and the introduction of new ones, Lindsay succeeds in tackling the touchy topic of Hell in a hilarious fashion while adding in a humourful dose of insanity, love, lust and religion. Don't let the title fool you-- there is nothing serious about this play, nor its subject as the playwright takes you on a ride to Hell-- and back-- and lets you be the judge."},{"Title":"Two Demons And a Dead Man: A Screenplay","review":"We've all used the term \\"this is hell\\" in our lives. But for Bob Hule, it's doubly true in Chris Lindsay's Two Demons and a Dead Man.If you've read The Man Who Loved Working Women (if not, I recommend it) Bob winds up in a hospital bed, with his life of promiscuity hanging in the balance. He is supported by his ex-fiance Lucy Bigg and his good friend, now in love with Lucy, James Thwarp.Bob winds up punching his ticket and descends into Hades, where he meets some poor souls who are paying the price for their wicked ways by sitting in boiling oil and adjusting to their new eternity. Not Bob. As stubborn and self-centered as he was on earth, Bob refuses to accept that this is his destiny and attempts to call the shots down in hell. His tour guides, a horn-nosed demon named Deadly, and a low-IQ brute named Firehead begin to prepare Bob for his lifetime of torment. But not so fast...While down there, Bob realizes that his life of chasing women and cooking books as an accountant are the reasons he is in Hell, but compared to some of the others who really deserve to be there (like TV evangelist Nick Diotrophes). Bob feels like he needs to plead his case to The Big G and work out a deal. After all, spending an eternity in boiling oil just for being a jerk doesn't seem right. But before he gets a chance to convince the Demons he should have a trial, Bob winds up back on earth again.The characters who steal the scenes are Doctor Jack and Nurse Jill, two runaway mental patients that pose as medical professionals that inject Bob with every drug they can get their hands on to revive him. They have no medical expertise, but are committed to saving Bob (at Lucy's request) while conveying their love and lust for each other. The dialogue between the two of them diverts the attention away from the dying man on the hospital bed which adds to the zaniness of the already over-the-top story.Two Demons and a Dead Guy is great for anyone looking for a quick, funny read. It's a complete fantasy, but some elements are worth thinking about like life after death, staying monogamous with the one you love, euthanasia and faith. Lindsay is able to combine all these things in his plays while getting you to read fifty pages with a smile on your face."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Robert Gandt takes us into the bowels of the USS Ronald Reagan where some of the ugliest of battles are played out between the best and worst of fellow Naval Aviators. Killer Delancey typifies the hotshot, blowhard pilot who ruthlessly works the promotion system and dares anyone to stand in his way. Spam Parker is like the unwanted, unsolicited piece of e-mail crammed into your mailbox, only she is the Navy's Poster Girl for Political Correctness post -Tailhook and she is not going to let anyone forget it! Gandt sets the stage perfectly for the reader to hate these black hats. An absolutely riveting account of air combat in the Persian Gulf and a behind-the-scenes look at the lives of fighter pilots. The lead-in for #2 in the series is palpable! Can't wait!"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Wow! After reading all of Gandt's previous non-fiction works, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he was releasing a novel to complement his preceding books.This book is set aboard the United States Navy aircraft carrier U.S.S. Ronald Regan. Tensions are high after an Iraqi Mig-29 is splashed by an F/A-18E Super Hornet while approaching the no-fly zone. The Mig-29 pilot just happens to be the nephew of an infamous tyrannical leader......and the battle is just about to begin.Enter the lead character &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell. Brick is privy to certain information about the engagement that the United States Government would rather remain unknown. His commanding officer, &quot;Killer&quot; Delancey is somewhat of a loose cannon when under pressure, and will do damn near anything to become the first &quot;Ace&quot; since Vietnam.Without ruining the rest of the book, lets just say that it is quite action packed, with great character development, and real-world fighter pilot tactics.Pilots and non-pilots alike will appreciate the exceptional authenticity that can only be provided by an experienced Pilot (30,000+ hours of flight time, 300+ carrier landings, trained F/A-18 pilot, aerobatic pilot, and retired Airline Captain) like Gandt. In the words of another reviewer, Gandt also happens to possess the &quot;...pen of a poet&quot;.I absolutely can't wait to read the next &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell adventure!"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Robert Gandt's first fictional book is very good, and I'm looking forward to reading the other books about &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell, the U.S. Navy pilot who is the hero of &quot;With Hostile Intent&quot;. I'm a sucker for techno-thrillers that focus on naval aviation, and Robert Gandt does a great job of writing about life on an aircraft carrier and what it's like to be a pilot of an F/A-18 Hornet.The story takes place in the Middle East, with the U.S. Navy (and U.S. and British Air Forces) enforcing the &quot;no fly zone&quot; over southern Iraq. The year is 2000, 10 years after Desert Storm but before the Iraq war in 2003, so Saddam Hussein is still in power and playing the role of super bad guy.The major conflicts in &quot;With Hostile Intent&quot; are, however, not the ones between the U.S. and Iraqi forces. Instead, we have several members of the U.S. forces who are so egotistical and ruthless that they provide the greatest threat to the &quot;good guys&quot;. (I don't know how realistic this is - for the sake of the U.S. Navy I would hope that people like that would be weeded out very early in their naval career.)One of the things I liked best about this book were the descriptions of aerial dogfights between the F/A-18 Hornets and MiG-29 Fulcrums. Sidewinders are flying, high G turns being done to evade missiles, chaff and flares being ejected and there's lots of excited chatter between the pilots. &quot;Fox two!&quot; &quot;Bandit on your six!&quot; &quot;Splash one!&quot; Great stuff for us armchair warriors!So why the lack of a fifth star?Mostly because the plot is a bit too contrived and thus not very plausible. In order to maximize the conflict between &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell and &quot;Killer&quot; DeLancey it's necessary for Brick to refuse to reveal something he knows about Killer, but without a reasonable ground for this refusal. Then at the end of the book there's an even more contrived situation, which I'll refrain from talking about here.Also, the characterizations of the people in the book are rather &quot;wooden&quot;, especially in the first part of the book.Still, I'm definitely looking forward to following &quot;Brick&quot; Maxwell in his further adventures, as chronicled by Robert Gandt.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Naval aviation thrillers aren't just for guys anymore. I'm a twentysomething woman, and a lot of my favorite books have to do with the men and women who fly high-performance jets off of U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.'With Hostile Intent' is the first book in the Brick Maxwell series. Commander Sam \\"Brick\\" Maxwell, USN, is an F/A-18 Hornet pilot who is loathed by his commanding officer \\"Killer\\" DeLancey because Brick knows the truth about a kill that Killer claimed to get during the first Gulf War, has a mentor in the ship's CAG (Commander of the Air Group and the highest-ranking pilot aboard) Captain \\"Red\\" Boyce, and has to deal with two female pilots joining his squadron, Killer's attempts to get him transferred to shore duty, and the return to his life of his old flame Claire, now a journalist separated from her Australian journalist husband. (Brick was widowed when his wife Debbie died in a space shuttle launching accident.)Killer is a pain in the six (or tail), but Brick juggles the demands of piloting the Hornet, Killer's rotten attitude, his seesawing emotions about Debbie and Claire, a tragic accident involving his friend and squadronmate Commander Steve \\"Devo\\" Davis, and the arrival of the two women pilots, one of whom is hellbent to cause as much trouble as possible and the other of whom just wants to fly Hornets for the Navy.Brick is a great protagonist and likable hero. He is not infallable and doesn't pretend to be. He makes mistakes and owns up to them, but he's also not afraid to take charge and be accountable for his actions when necessary. The flying sequences are some of the best in-the-cockpit descriptions I've ever read, and they're understandable and make sense to civilian laypersons like myself. The aboard-ship actions and port calls provide just the right counterbalance to the aviation sequences.And for my fellow romantics, Brick and Claire start to explore future possibilities in this book, and there's nothing rushed or phony about their issues, questions, and hopes.Being a former naval aviator himself, Mr. Gandt knows whereof he speaks. If you're interested in naval aviation fiction and good, solid storytelling, pick up 'With Hostile Intent.' You won't be disappointed, and you'll be headed back to the store to get the rest of the Brick Maxwell books as soon as possible."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Former US Navy aviator Robert Gandt's first work of fiction is a superb, unpredictable roller-coaster ride through the inner workings of a fighter squadron on the USS Ronald Reagan. Though Gandt has previous writing experience with his five nonfiction books on aviation, he greatly exceeds expectations by his mix of three-dimensional characters in truly intense and unheard of situations. Though the premise of a strike on Iraq is nothing new in military fiction, Gandt separates himself from other first-time military novelists by continuously building up his characters and leaving out pertinent bits of information in the numerous subplots so the reader is forced to finish the entire novel. While everything is tied up at the end, Gandt does a great job of keeping predictability to the absolute minimum by not rehashing conflicts found in previous novels in the genre. With Hostile Intent is an original and sometimes brutal novel of men and women at war with the outside world and with their own personal demons. There is no doubt that with this debut, Gandt has the potential of becoming one of the top writers of military fiction. I wish him the best on his future novels, and I very much look forward to reading them as soon as possible."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Gandt starts his fiction career wonderfully. He takes his first hand knowledge of life for F/A-18 pilots, tactics and naval life in general and composes a great story with several subplots that allow for the story of Brick Maxwell to continue in future volumes.Keeping it simple, the main character, Maxwell, returns to a carrier squadron after several years test piloting and as a NASA astronaut. He must deal with a hot-shot commanding officer with something bordering personal hatred for him, gender politics of the new Navy, and an Iraqi threat following the first Gulf War. Gandt neverloses focus despite having so much to contemplate.If you like this one, try Punk's War and Punk's Wing by Ward Carroll for similar life and battle stories in the Navy."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"With the ease of a former fighter pilot and the style of a Hemmingway, Gandt takes his readers into the cockpit, across the forbidden land and, yes, even into the bedroom of the brave men and women who patrol the 33rd parallel.The book captures the very soul of aerial combat and is an absorbing read for anyone who treasures the excitement of aviation."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Good story, compelling characters. I liked this book and give it 4 stars. I hope that my review helps you!"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"This review is for all 5 books in the series, since I found I had to get them as quickly as I could and read most of them in a day. Definitely page-turners.If you have been, or know, people in the U.S. Navy, especially aviators, and you have a fondness for the service, as I do, I think you will find this series immensely rewarding. As a Navy brat with an uncle who was a Navy pilot, it had great immediacy for me. If you watched, and liked, the character of Harmon Rabb in the TV series \\"JAG,\\" you will relate to this series as well, since some of the best episodes involved his carrier flying when he wasn't a lawyer, and the lingo (e.g., \\"call the ball\\") is much the same. If you find the Middle East a quagmire and its intricacies interesting, again, you will like the series.They are intense, and I would advise reading the books in order as they build on what came before, though you needn't do that. The main characters are very well-developed as the books evolve, and they all center on combat pilot Sam \\"Brick\\" Maxwell, his missions, his love life, his concepts of the chain of command, morale, so much else. The combat scenes are great, and I loved the dialogue as well. And for Kindle books, very well-edited. Just a few of the usual transpositions of words and the like.The best recommendation I can give is that I was sad when each book ended. I don't really see how there could be another one, but with Mr. Gandt, you never know. I wouldn't mind one bit (hint!)"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"With Hostile Intent.A good yarn, took a bit of effort to stay engaged at times but enjoyable none the less. Good technical description, a little light on action for my tastes but ok considering the story was more about shipboard/military politics."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"The book is riveting - I couldn't put it down. It puts you in the cockpit of the most advanced war plane in the world. The book should come with a supply of Xanax due to the stress of the situations and aerial combat. Well written and very timely (seen the news lately??) I can't wait for more. . ."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"The PBS series &#34;Carrier&#34; tells the same story much better. This has a fair plot with stilted characters. Ok read."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"A winning read if you're into &#34;war stories&#34;. The accounts of flying the aircraft on the carrier are detailed and accurate. The story is well spun, with multiple inter-weaving plots, and comes to a very sharp end. Engaging from the start, and couldn't put it down at the end."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"I like the style of this authors writing and the technical aspects of the aircraft carrier, the flying and ground warfare etc. However, the author really needs to consider the plot of the story. A rogue pilot manages to acquire a few Mig 29 fighters with their ground crew, and a submarine with a view to attacking an American fleet. Plus there is a spy on the carrier that is going to assist the submarine in sinking the very ship that is under him. I don't think so. This writer has huge potential but needs to look at the believeability factor. I finished the story but it was too predictable, and for me it would almost fall into an action Mills and Boon catagorie."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"A book I found hard to put down. Shows me and all readers just what is possible in the world, even though fiction, it could happen."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"First book I've ever bought and downloaded from Kindle and I loved it. Great story line and had me wanting to keep reading and not put it down til the very end. Now I'm gonna look for more Robert Gandt and \\"Brick\\" Maxwell. Love being able to have my books with me wherever I go."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"First, let me say that the views I am expressing are strictly my opinions and I'm not looking to debate anyone. I have been an avid reader of action/adventure, military and WWII/aviation history as far back as I can remember. This is one of the best books I have read in a long time! I found it to be a fast-moving high-flying adventure. The characters were easy to identify with as they spoke and acted like people you would come across in your (almost) everyday life! As for the villian 'Killer' DeLancey, three-fourths of the way through this book I was so into this story that I was tempted to look in the phone book for someone named DeLancy and pop him a good one in the mouth! I knocked off this book in only 3 days. Bob Gandt's style of writing was, to me, reminiscent of early Tom Clancy (before he got verbose) and early Dale Brown and early Clive Cussler. He knows his military flying and weaponry. I was so impressed I immediately got online and ordered his other 5 books. If you like true fast-moving action/adventure then strap on 'With Hostile Intent' and hit the throttle! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Bob Gandt writes with authority about naval aviation. Hostile Intent is tightly written and once started is difficult to put down. It's a real page turner. The development of his characters is very well done, and the plot finely tuned and topical. I look forward to reading further adventures of Brick Maxwell and his antagonists.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Robert Gandt's new book &quot;With Hostile Intent&quot; is all I hoped it would be .. and more. It is definitely hard to put down. I found myself rereading passages after minor interruptions just to be sure I didn't miss anything. His characters are most believable and I felt as though I was there.If you are at all interested in aviation you will like this book. If recent events make you curious about what life is like for a fighter pilot, you must read this book. It is enlightening and entertaining.. enjoy!"},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Bob Gandt has found his forte: riveting fiction, combining his extensive experience as a naval aviator with a highly imaginative mind. He's up there with Clancy with this gem. I could't put it down and can't wait for the second in this compelling and timely series."},{"Title":"With Hostile Intent","review":"Excellent story as told from a fighter pilots point of view. The action scenes are easy to imagine and are obviously told by someone who knows how to fly. I couldn't put the book down and stayed up half the night ot finish it."},{"Title":"Karen Kilimnik: Drawings","review":"This book is great, and it's all about the artist in every way possible. The reason why the photos are blurry is that Kilimnik took them herself. From what I know of the artist (and that's not much, because she's pretty reclusive) her love of fashion, celebrity and castles and faeries and is so deep, she's as near to a fantasy world than any adult artist that I've ever seen. Her obsessiveness with pop-culture borders on the outsider-artist, and everything she touches is pure and untainted by the expectations of the art world, its business, and its commercialism. Open this book and enter the world of a fabulously talented (and wonderfully weird) woman-child, and get off your notion-of-standardized-quality high-horse. If the publisher and author hadn't meant for the blurry photos to be there, would they have been put in? Honestly. Open your mind. This is Art, remember?"},{"Title":"Karen Kilimnik: Drawings","review":"Karen Kilimnik Drawings is a large format book that fails miserably because most of the photos of the artwork are out-of-focus and blurry. You'll have to see it to believe it, but when you do see it you'll wonder how a book as poorly made as this even gets printed. There's nothing else to say I'm afraid. This is horrible. Buyer beware: you have been warned!"},{"Title":"Popeye's Big Surprise","review":"First, gotta love Wonder Books, advertised with Washable Covers! I wonder why they stopped that?Quick read; nice story. Olive Oyl notices Popeye's boat is in serious trouble, so she decides to surprise him. She and Wimpy can't afford to buy a new boat, so they buy boat plans.Wimpy is, as usual, ready with his hamburger (and little else), and Swee'pea gets to play in the coal bin while Olive toils away, doing most of the work.It takes awhile, but the boat is finally ready, so the surprise is on, first for Popeye and then for the rest of the crew. Here's the problem...where, inside a house, can you build a boat so someone won't see it before you're finished? Take a wild guess!Thank goodness there's plenty of spinach to save the day!"},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"This doesn't really go in depth. I learned a few new things but it didn't really change my way of thinking. To get further and do more I recommend getting a book that looks at practical issues and actual Web site promotion.

It is clear that businesses that establish intimate virtual relationships will be at a competitive advantage.The book is well written, but repetitive--half the pages would have been sufficient.

However, too much has changed since then, obviously through no fault of the authors. I knew I was in trouble when the authors raved about Motley Fool and asked &quot;can online trading be far behind?&quot; Save your money."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"I read this book pretty much cover-to-cover and found it very thought provoking. It does a great job of explaining the opportunities in creating &quot;Virtual Communities&quot;. Virtual communities are described as areas where a group of users sharing common interests gather to learn about and discuss information. These communities create an information source that shifts power from the vendors to the customers. Longer term, vendors can capitalize on this community by selling directly to the community members, and more importantly by using the customer interaction to create word-of-mouth advertising. Who are you more likely to trust: another user of the product or some sleazy salesman?Up until this book, I have seen little written on the longer term business models on how to make money by aggregating users. This book will explain the rationale of why there is enormous value in web sites with a large base of users.The book has a very interesting chart which describes the return on various strategic investments for a startup trying to build a virtual community. The conclusion was that far and away the most important investments were vendor acquisition (i.e. companies wanting to sell products to the members of the community), member-generated content, and member acquisition. Interestingly, usage fees for the site had an enormous long-term negative impact for the site (despite their short term ability to generate revenue).There are a couple of points that I think were not well addressed in this book:1) I don't believe that the authors make a compelling argument about how to sell the first vendors on the advantages of being a part of the virtual community. From my experience, vendors don't sign up for a new product or service because &quot;that's where the market is going&quot;. They need to be convinced that there's an advantage for them to be first, and that reason was not adequately described in the book.2) The book states the importance of member-generated content as a way to build up the community and keep traffic coming to the site. It was never clear to me from the book how to do this through a commercially sponsored newsgroup versus the already existing Usenet newsgroups today (which already have a pre-existing and active community). For instance, there are already many Usenet newsgroups related to Travel. Why should potential travelers use a commercially sponsored site instead of a Usenet group? Clearly there are sites that have been successful at creating their own newsgroup areas so I believe that there are justifiable reasons. I'm just not sure what those reasons are and the book didn't explain them.Overall, an interesting book and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"The thing I really like about this book is the specifics. You find much more substance--including dollar amounts--in this book than you do in many e-biz books, even with the usual dollop of rah-rah. Several chapters are very helpful in making the business case for online communities, and in uncovering success/failure factors for this approach. I can't say that Hagel and Armstrong have it *all* right, but this is book will be one you refer back to on a regular basis. The management agenda in the appendix is a nice touch, as well."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"According to Hagel and Armstrong, virtual communities that combine content and communication can expand market opportunities, and those who form these online communities will experience commercial success. Throughout the book, the authors stressed that those organizations who wait will lose out. However, the emphasis of the book is not about making money; rather it's about forming communities, collecting information on members' preferences, interests, etc., and using that information to meet their needs.In my opinion, two of the most useful components of the book are a listing of personnel required for the implementation and maintenance of an online community, and steps needed to help managers get started in organizing a virtual community. The book is certainly worth reading, whether you are developing websites for business, education, recreation, etc. Hagel and Armstrong present valid reasons and practical suggestions for developing online communities that will help members connect, as well as seek and find."},{"Title":"Net Gain: Expanding Markets through Virtual Communities","review":"A book which has been at the basis of our company.
