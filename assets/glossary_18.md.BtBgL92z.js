I did not realize at the time that we would then go into Vietnam and that mass movements and the birth control pill would change the moral and political landscape as it did. I did realize, however, that post war prosperity created new possibilities. Somehow, all the stuff that was going on seemed to be related to that. This book reflects the thinking of a remarkable man who was in the midst of the US Labor Union's response to the emergence of the Post WWII age of Progress and Prosperity. The days in which he worked as a Union Organizer were vastly different than The Great Depression and the rise of Nazism and Communism, but people remained the same. So he mined the experience of the previous generation in order to understand his. We live an a time of the rise of Asia and the reemergence of Islam as a world economic and political force. Global prosperity is creating new mass movements. The world that is coming is different than the world of the cold war, but people are the same.

At several points, though, I feel Hoffer could have showed greater sensitivity. I simply cannot recognize Hoffer's blanket characterization of Christianity as a mass movement, although there are pathological manifestations of 'religion' with exactly this character. Hoffer wouldn't be the first writer that failed to make the crucial distinction between true religion and organized neurosis. But this at least throws the reader a challenge: Hoffer should make us think very carefully about our motivations for what we 'truly believe'."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Following the horrific tragedy at Fort Hood, I felt the need to better understand the mind set of a fanatic (or a true believer) The book by Eric Hoffer offers many insights and has answered many of my questions."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This is a very good book for anyone wanting to know why people follow mass movements or if they want to try and start a mass movement!"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer expands on Macchiavelli's pragmatic exploration of political power in terms of both nuance and moral responsibility.

This was the era in which Maoism was fashionable among a few western academics who, unlike their Chinese counterparts, did not have to do cultural duty on pig farms and in rice fields.Hoffer is, however, up to date. His argument is not about left-wing fanatacism in particular, but instead discusses the causes of fanatacism in general. The book may help you somewhat to understand the tendency of internally-unhappy people toward extremist movements of all stripes, whether fascist, communist, El Quaida, the Taliban, the Christian Coalition, neo-conservative, or others.

It doesn't seem to matter much whether they have anything original or accurate to say about the world, so long as they can say it articulately with enough fancy words. This was the case with William F. Buckley, a reactionary creep of the highest order who managed to forestall, until the end of his life, the completion of any of his sentences, a feat which kept millions of American conservatives enthralled and convinced of his staggering intelligence. Lesser known and considerably more blunt, but equally pointless, was Eric Hoffer, who worked as a stevedore for most of his life while writing about politics and philosophy in his spare time, making his books perfect for some middle-class Republican to put on display in a show of phony solidarity with the working class.But Hoffer himself was not in solidarity with the working class, as he displays in his first book, The True Believer, ostensibly a treatise on the psychology of fanaticism that reads like a poor man's version of Escape from Freedom by Erich Fromm (Hoffer even steals his thesis wholesale on page 31). Speaking of poor men, under the category of \\"potential converts\\" to what he calls a \\"mass movement,\\" Hoffer classes no less than five different types of poor people as \\"undesirables,\\" this being the overall class of human slime which have formed the base of popular movements from Christianity to Communism, according to him. The word \\"slime\\" comes by way of a quote from Genesis at the beginning of the book. I infer that this is what he thinks of his subjects because, after describing them with such contemptuous arrogance in Part 2, he makes it perfectly clear on page 124 that it is the attitude of these failures, weaklings and mental defectives which constitutes the glue holding a revolutionary movement together.I should point out that I am not defending the Nazis, Bolsheviks or any of the other groups at which his criticisms are levelled, and since his analysis ignores every factor in the success of totalitarianism besides the despicable character of people who didn't have the strength to embrace their alienation and accept the status quo, it has little real connection to that phenomenon in the first place. This is political philosophy for children. It will make right-wingers feel better about hating the groups they already hate, as evidenced by the fact that it enjoyed a resurgence of interest among them after 9/11 as an explanation of Islamic fundamentalism, but it adds nothing to our understanding of the subject it claims to address. It is simplistic, dualistic, and promotes the classic American Dream myth that the only thing stopping us from realizing our goals is our own flaws, including the flaw of having pathetic goals in the first place.President Eisenhower mentioned The True Believer during a press conference, and Hoffer won the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983. The ringing endorsement of this man by the United States government shows that he was a tool of the establishment as well as a hack.

His concern is less with the spreading mechanism in recipients than with the people who originate and manipulate mass movements."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"\\"The True Believer\\" is one of those profound books that make you stop and think in terms of sociological change in a psychoanalytic way because he writes a little like Sigmund Freud. Several pages can bring you to a pause and send you into reflection for the meaning and import of his words. How does fanaticism develop? Who are the fanatics? How do the poor and destitute differ from the intelligentsia in mass movements?Anyone looking for an explanation will find it in Eric Hofer's \\"Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements: The True Believer.\\" Hofer breaks mass movements down into all its working parts: the appeal of mass movements, the potential converts, united action and self-sacrifice, and the beginning and end. Hofer details the players in mass movements: the poor, the misfits, the inordinately selfish, the ambitious, minorities, the bored, and the sinners. He examines their motives and gratifications. He explains the background of leaders of prior movements, in particular, Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini, telling us the strengths and limitations they brought to their respective movements. The reader will note the insight that the author can bring to the historical events that fit neatly into our knowledge of history.What is even more fascinating is the background of the author. A stevedore working on the docks of San Francisco in the 1940's, he penned his treatise from his home in the railroad yards. It is evident that Hoffer's genius far exceeded his level of education. His writing is lucid, thought provoking, and he writes his assertions using a rich vocabulary. He has many highly regarded references from Pascal and Guglielmo Ferrero, to Kenneth Scott Latourette and Machiavelli.Freud's psychoanalytic theory was the catalyst for modern psychological thought, but wasn't proven. It was accepted on faith or personal experience. Hofer's work can also be thought of as work like Freud's. The insights and conclusions are captivating, but lack empirical validity. It is the only limitation I could find in this book, but it is an important one. It is like knowing that tree moss will kill an infection, but not knowing why.This work is extraordinarily interesting, has great insight into the human character as part of a mass movement, impressive references, but ultimately requires the reader to take the author's words on faith.This book is worth it for the true believer."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"If you are looking to study mass movements, or have been studying mass movements, then I highly suggest you turn to Mr. Hoffer's \\"The True Believer.\\" The book is indeed dated (published in 1951), but it is timeless in many respects.The book is short in length and small in size, thus making carrying the book with you a breeze. Furthermore, you can start and stop reading in this book quite often and not damage the overall message of the book, so this will make a particularly good selection for you readers on the go.Also note with Hoffer that he is very different from much of the academic writing on the subject of mass movements. Generically speaking, much of academic writing about the causes and nature of mass movements focuses on injustices imposed upon a certain class, race, etc., and the movement is largely reduced to pent up anger finally being united and simultaneously released by a charasmatic leader. Hoffer argues no such thing in \\"The True Believer.\\" He argues that there are human propensities in the \\"outcasts\\" of society that almost automatically draw them to the self-sacrifice and surrender involved in mass movements. Thus, reading \\"The True Believer\\" is likely to give you a very different perspective on mass movements.[...] I strongly disagree. Without doubt, social movements as we know them today often require the same commitment and blind faith that is required by other various mass movements throughout history. Can anyone really read Hoffer, and then look at a radical environmentalist or a radical Evangelical and say that those two are not textbook examples of a true believer? Certainly both feel that they are advancing mankind's best interest through their actions, but Hoffer does not distinguish here: a true believer is a true believer regardless of whether or not the ends that he dreams of are socially beneficial or if the means that he uses to achieve those ends are moral and right.Furthermore, I really do not get where some come off as saying Hoffer opposed the mass movement and that he felt is was inherently an evil institution. Hoffer states in the book that mass movements, and the true believer mindset, have at times been useful and have been greatly beneficial to society as a whole. Certainly Hoffer speaks more of the ills of mass movements, but then again he had a perfect right to do so. We must put the book into context by considering that at the time the book was written, the major mass movements of the past few decades had involved Hitler (Hoffer was a Jew, by the way), Mussolini, Stalin, etc., not to mention domestic movements like the KKK. Taken into context, one can forgive Hoffer if the book does indeed give the mass movement somewhat of a negative connotation. If anything, the negative connotation is most likely justified.All in all, a great book that is very deserving of the five stars that I gave it. On the downside for those who are particularly impressed with the insights of Mr. Hoffer, \\"The True Believer\\" is the only Eric Hoffer book still in print. However, you can still find all of Hoffer's book at various internet sites such as Amazon.com, [...]Also, Hoffer fans will likely be interested in the following site: http://www.erichoffer.net/"},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer explains eloquently the various philosophical natures of extremism and radicalism and the various criteria these groups or individuals meet or need to become full-blown true believers.

By showing us what makes a fanatic tick, he also exposes the workings of the more conventional political motivations.

The reader is then immediately plunged into a relentless tide of aphoristic statements that are presented with a breathtaking certainty of tone that sweep him along to the very end, leaving him convinced that Hoffer was the wisest and most brilliant philosopher, psychologist, sociologist and writer who ever was or ever could be, the man who has all the answers and who explains everything. Well, not quite. One has to remember that Hoffer was a longshoreman, a drifter, at the very bottom of the social ladder for a long while. His university was the school of hard knocks. It is not everyone who comes from such a background that can rise to write such a book. Most of such people never even read books, much less write them. He was a product of a certain time and place, a certain social class, and perhaps a century from now he will be forgotten. His book has lasted sixty years, and it still sounds like the correct explanation, but although human nature doesn't change, perhaps there will come a day when somebody, somewhere, somehow, manages to find fault with this book and replaces it with something better.

To be successful, mass movements must be contrary to nature, common sense and pleasure. \\"We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand.\\" True believers are attracted by the prospect of sudden and spectacular change in their conditions of life. Thus, mass movements attract the frustrated and/or unemployed. Those who have the lowest opinion of themselves are ripe for conversion no matter what doctrine is being offered to them. Hoffer shows how the right words at the right time are critical. \\"A [mass] movement is pioneered by men of words, materialized by fanatics and consolidated by men of action.\\" Written in 1951, Hoffer's little book seems totally prescient in today's world filled with extremist views on both sides of the political spectrum.

His basic premise is that there are traits common to all mass movements, whether they are religious, social, or nationalist in nature. He stresses that while not all movements - and followers of such mass movements, the titular true believer - are identical nevertheless (be they Communism, the French Revolution, Islam, or Christianity) all share certain essential characteristics. He also stresses that he is not making value judgments; that while few would dispute that Nazism was evil many mass movements produced positive benefits (for instance the rapid modernization of Japan and Turkey would not have been possible without a revivalist nationalist movement).The true believer in any mass movement shares many key characteristics. One is that he or she is discontented and blames the world for his or her problems. Second is that he possesses some sense of power, whether real or imagined (those who are in awe of the world he wrote do not think of change, no matter how miserable); the true believer is not destitute, as those who are living hand-to-mouth, unsure of food on a daily basis, don't join mass movements. Moreover, this power comes from some powerful doctrine or infallible leader and through these things the believer feels he has power. Third, the true believer has a great deal of faith in the future, that he believes that tremendous change is possible. Fourth, the true believer is inexperienced, that generally he is nearly completely ignorant of the difficulties involved in a movement's massive undertakings.Hoffer identified several of the appealing elements of mass movements to individuals. Though mass movements in their more mature stages attract those who seek self-advancement, they generally at first are appealing to those who seek self-renunciation. They see their lives - and the present in which they live -as irredeemably spoiled. These people seek a rebirth and wish to lose themselves in a mass movement. The true fanatic of a movement is always incomplete and insecure, only finding assurance through whatever he desperately clings to. Hoffers wrote that fanatics sometimes switch movements entirely and the truest fanatics in any movement have more in common with the fanatics in other movements than with moderates, sometimes one becoming the other (Saul becoming Paul, radical Communists becoming radical Nazis, etc.). The fanatic seeks to deal with a pressing sense of self insufficiency with a strong missionary zeal to proselytize and dominate the world.What types of individuals seek the self-renunciation, rebirth, and transformed future offered by a mass movement? The \\"new poor\\" are a key group, those that have a memory of better times, of more affluence and often more power but through circumstances have been deprived of them. The \\"free poor\\" are another vital group. Hoffer wrote that freedom \\"aggravates as much as it alleviates frustration.\\" Freedom of choice places the blame of failure in life squarely on the shoulder of the individuals; they are free to fail and they would rather seek freedom from responsibility. The free poor - perhaps recently freed slaves, perhaps those who once lived under a despotic regime and came to dislike the following anarchy - often seek freedom from being free, valuing equality and fraternity much more than they value freedom. They find in a mass movement a refuge \\"from the anxieties, barrenness, and meaninglessness of an individual existence.\\"Hoffer stressed however that not all poor people join mass movements; as noted the abject poor do not join them, nor do those he called the \\"unified poor,\\" those who are members of compact, tightly knit groups that provide solidarity and support (such as in the past the Chinese family or the Jewish ghettos in Medieval Europe). Leaders of mass movements he noted were aware of these groups and often sought to disrupt or destroy them.Once within a mass movement the true believer is assimilated. This is facilitated by \\"make believe\\" - activities such as parades and by wearing uniforms - that stress the glory of a movement, carrying away viewers by sheer spectacle. Leaders of a mass movement deprecate the present, encouraging a negative attitude to the world as it is and fixing the attention upon the future. Doctrine is key in this, a \\"fact proof screen\\" that insulates the individual from the world, a doctrine that is deliberately not wholly intelligible and that requires no small amount of faith to follow.Mass movements themselves have many similarities. First, all mass movements are competitive. Second, all mass movements are ultimately interchangeable, either changing in character or possessing more than one character, as a religious movement may become a nationalist one or vice versa. For instance Zionism can be seen as a nationalist, social, and religious movement. Third, while mass movements do not require a God they do require a devil, something to focus their wrath on (and if an enemy does not exist it must be invented).For a mass movement to come to pass, three types of leaders at different stages are required. More often than not, each of these leaders is a different person. First is the man of words, an articulate and intelligent person who undermines faith in the existing order and sets the stage for a mass movement. When conditions are ripe the second leader, the fanatic, appears, one who is comfortable in a world of chaos and is not interested in reform but rather revolution, moving beyond mere dialogue - however important - and enacting real change. However, while a mass movement is pioneered by the man of words and materialized by the fanatic, it is consolidated by the man of action, a person who has experience and can consolidate and stabilize the gains made by fanatics. Those movements that lack this person can burn out, destroyed in trying to achieve ever more impossible goals. The man of action saves a movement from suicidal dissensions and the recklessness of fanatics.An excellent book, it was well worth reading."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Here is the first thing anyone needs to know about reading \\"The True Believer\\": Eric Hoffer is not on your team, whatever your team may be, whether right, left, moderate, secular or non-secular, or whatever. If anyone ever attempts to sell you on an ideology with a quote from \\"The True Believer\\", please know that Hoffer is tumbling in his grave.If you are looking to pump your fist in the air at the moment that Hoffer skewers the ideology you oppose, yes, you will have that moment, but please know that you're going to turn the page and find Hoffer is skewering your ideology on the next. There's no escape from \\"The True Believer\\" because Hoffer seems to demand that we be something more than de -politicized know-nothings, but makes the additional demand that we not become ideological sheep in the process.This may, in part, be why \\"The True Believer\\" may be the most popular book of its kind that no one has ever heard of. (Oxymoron intended.) No writer is objective, but Hoffer gets as close to it as anyone and then pulls off something quite amazing; he throws bombs everywhere, reducing any kind of ideological proponent to what they really are; an individual caught up in a phenomena larger than themselves. There are great metaphysical implications in this, but Hoffer doesn't entertain them. He's reporting from a rowboat at the peaceful eye of an ideological hurricane of mass movements, and he's not happy about what he sees and he let's it be known.\\"The True Believer\\" is not wordy in the least, and it's quite short, about 120 pages, but it's a bit hard to get through if you're unprepared because Hoffer writes in a manner that makes one feel they should be scribbling each line down as a quotation to keep in mind. It's a very assertive book and Hoffer doesn't say things, he proclaims them, in almost every sentence. You're just recovering from the impact of one sentence, and then you find you've had a head on collision with the next. You quickly realize that you understood every word, very much so, but you're boxing with a tough s.o.b. This also makes the book very quotable for someone looking to sell an ideology, a practice which indicates that they've read the book, but not understood it.It's important to keep in mind that Hoffer isn't looking for a good guy or bad guy. Hoffer's subject is \\"Mass Movements\\". If you read the book with the \\"eye of the storm\\" perspective in mind, you'll find it fascinating and compulsively readable.

And he ended up in the psyche of an insecure and frustrated individual.His non-academic background largely contributed the book's originality since he was not strait-jacketed by the dominant thoughts in his times. Though some might feel uncomfortable with his sweeping generalisations without the rigors of scientific analysis, I do not see it as a major defect since the subject matter is difficult to be duplicated in a control environment.All in all, this is a brilliant and deeply insightful book for anyone who wants to peek into what lurks inside the minds of true believers or anyone who wishes to lead them."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"This little gem of a book should be required reading to all those who wonder why some people think the way they do as individual and in crowds.

He's not equating them, just showing some of the traits they share.A great read, and timeless, since movements and fanatics always seem to be springing up somewhere."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Though written with an eye toward the mass movements of Hoffer's day--Communism, Fascism, and Naziism--The True Believer is as pertinent as ever if one wants to understand today's religious fundamentalists, suicide bombers, and political zealots of both the Right and the Left. Hoffer's insights, informed by his own observations rather than formal studies (Hoffer was a working class philosopher, not an academic), are nothing short of brilliant. As I read it, I bothered my husband incessantly to quote especially perceptive passages aloud to him.Hoffer argues that the appeal of mass movements lies not in the cause itself, but in the desire of adherents to escape the burden of individuality and personal responsibility, transcending their flawed selves and becoming part of something greater. Perceiving themselves or their lives as inadequate, \\"true believers\\" seek to become part of a uniform mass where their own perceived imperfections and failures will cease to matter. It is the disaffected--the poor (particularly the recent poor), outcasts, minorities, youth, \\"sinners,\\" immigrants, and other marginalized individuals--who are most inclined to throw themselves into a movement. Hoffer also points out that the disintegration of traditional social ties, such as one might find among colonized peoples or societies undergoing massive technological shifts, produces an environment ripe for mass movements. Sometimes, movements themselves will encourage this disintegration by, for instance, undermining the family.In addition to examining the motives of the \\"true believer,\\" Hoffer spends a lot of time discussing the hallmarks of mass movements themselves: a penchant for united action and a demand for self-sacrifice among followers. He dissects the various devices movements use to encourage self-denial, including collective identity, \\"make believe\\" (persuading followers to believe they are taking part in a great scripted drama), deprecation of the present in favor of a glorious future, doctrine, and others. He also shows how movements unify their adherents through hatred of a common enemy, suspicion of outsiders, and identification with a leader.One thing that seems to be missing from the book is a precise definition of what a mass movement is or a discussion of the varying degrees of intensity between movements. Hoffer paints with a very broad brush, and I don't believe all of his generalizations apply to every mass movement or to every individual who joins one. With this in mind, The True Believer is indispensable reading for people with even a passing interest in political psychology and the fanaticism that continues to permeate the world."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"In this remarkable work, Hoffer concentrates on the active phase of mass movements where the true believer has real influence. He cautions that although mass movements share many traits this does not imply that they're equally toxic or beneficent. The work tries to understand and explain, not pass judgment. Their appeal derives from the promise in their materialistic, religious, nationalist or mixed natures. Intense, infectious emotion is the fuel. Hoffer analyses the various causes of the desire for change; discontent alone is not enough. Other factors are needed to activate it, like a sense of power and the ability to spread a vision of hope.Faith in a cause is to a large extent areplacementfor the individual's lost self-confidence. The movement offers a substitute for individual hope. Furthermore, movements are interchangeable to a surprising extent. As he puts it; \\"A Saul turning into a Paul is neither a rarity nor a miracle.\\" The reason is that they attract the same mentality. Antidotes include arrangements that discourage atomistic individualism or offers opportunities for action or new beginnings, like emigration. Creative expression is a potent protector: even the poor that are creatively involved are immune, as are the abjectly poor and members of close-knit family, tribal or religious groups.Potential converts are the disaffected, identified as misfits, outcasts, minorities, adolescents, the ambitious, the obsessed, the impotent in mind or body, certain categories of the poor, the extremely selfish, the bored and the sinners. Hoffer explains that the burden of freedom aggravates frustration in certain individuals. The followers exchange their individual responsibility for the sense of redemption that the movement offers. Those who feel like failures value equality and fraternity much more than freedom. This illuminatesRussia's regressioninto totalitarianism and the passivity of Europeans.Another striking insight is that that visions, dreams and utopian hopes are powerful weapons; people will die for delusions. Craving/desire is what causes the reckless self-sacrifice. Movements always target the family; Hoffer provides proof by quoting from inter alia theNew Testament. Disruption of the family makes the person more dependent on the movement. Movements attract and retain followers due to the refuge they offer from the boredom, barrenness, anxiety and lack of meaning in the individual's life.There are various species of misfit - the permanent misfit finds peace only in a total separation from the self. The extraordinarily selfish are likely to be the most fanatical champions of selflessness. Oddly, spinsters & middle aged women have played a crucial role in the birth of mass movements. Emotions like remorse and grievance appear to lead people in the same direction. Fervent enthusiasm helps to suppress a guilty conscience. United action and self-sacrifice are the elements that determine the vigor of a movement. Both sublimate the blemished self. Ways of persuading people to fight and die for the cause include:(a) separating them from the real self by means of assimilation into the collective(b) creating a make-believe self or a collective show(c) making them hate the present and worship the future; the present is not only portrayed as miserable but is deliberately made so(d) separating them from reality with the wall of dogma. Observation & experience are rejected in favor of doctrine which provides certitude.(e) Keeping them in a state of fanaticism by inflaming passions & breaking down the will, thus transforming them into automatons. Reason is ineffective in trying to free a fanatic from these mental chains.Hoffer's view of how different political persuasions view past, present and future is an interesting aside: The conservative is like the skeptic, echoing the thoughts of Ecclesiastes about nothing new under the sun whilst the liberal (Hoffer means the Classical Liberal, not today's leftist types) considers the present the legitimate offspring of the past, a springboard towards a better future.On the other hand, both thereactionaryand the radical hate the present. They differ only in their opinion on human nature's potential for change. The radical is convinced that human nature is perfectible whilst the reactionary believes the opposite. Fanatics occupy the same space on the political spectrum which is circular, not linear. The real difference is between the fanatics and the moderates of all ideologies. It is the temperament, not the ideological content that is crucial: fanatics often move from one form of extremism to another: communism, fascism, xenophobic nationalism, religious intolerance.Sinisterismby Bruce Walker offers more insight into this phenomenon.The unifying agents are hatred, imitation, brainwashing (although Hoffer believes that the power of propaganda is overrated and that it merely justifies & articulates opinions already present in the minds of recipients), leadership, action and suspicion. His observations on the impulse to convert are most arresting. The missionary zeal emanates from a profound uncertainty, an aching inner void. Proselytizing is a search for something; a quest to confirm that the fanatic's faith is indeed the absolute truth.Three personality types are influential in mass movements: (a) men of words (b) fanatics (c) men of action. The first prepares the ground, the second initiates/dominates the active phase and the 3rd consolidates. Hoffer remarks that the first, whether they be journalists, academics or priests, thirst for recognition & a status above the rest of mankind. They are often the first victims of what they have unleashed. The fanatic thrives on chaos & destruction. The man of action rescues the movement from the recklessness of the fanatic; when he assumes control the active phase comes to an end.In conclusion, Hoffer discusses good & bad movements, the sterility of the active phase and some factors that determine its length, plus benevolent mass movements. The book concludes with notes arranged by chapter, a portrait and brief biography of the author."},{"Title":"The true believer: Thoughts on the nature of mass movements (Time reading program special edition)","review":"Hoffer's book was first published in 1951. I was introduced to it by a student of cultural anthropology in the mid-sixties, a period when mass movements seemed to arise each week. In the wake of the WTC tragedy, my first thought was, &quot;Why do these people hate us so much?&quot; I ran through all of America's potential &quot;sins&quot; as a nation--support of Israel, economic imperialism, dubious foreign policy, IMF, World Bank, human rights capitulations in return for market access, etc.--before realizing that while this litany provided fodder for the disaffected's hatred (and was relevant in any evaluation of our strategy for the future), it was not really at bottom in the terrorist's heart. After going back over &quot;The True Believer,&quot; it's clear that today's terrorism is nothing but the latest deadly form of mass movement, born out of the same appeal, spawning the same converts who are motivated by the same ideals of self-sacrifice and bound together by the same unifying agents--not unlike Nazism or Communism. To combat terrorism, it's crucial that we understand what attracts converts to bin Laden's movement, who they are (ie, their fundamental characters) and what unifying agents help bind them together in united action. Hoffer's book, like the dictionary, the Bible, or any other important household reference, should be in every home, within easy reach."},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"I'm a complete novice to the world of hot rodding, and my actual interest is building electric cars. What makes this book so great in my opinion is that the author starts at the beginning and challenges you to pin down what you really want to build and challenges you to plan it out a little better. The reality check of a price list for all the components of a hot rod is really great.I love the color pictures. Most other books are black and white, and the cars look crapy. Not here, the paint jobs and interiors are shown in full glory.The tech sections are great, and show everything in great detail. For example, the &quot;how to install an independent front suspension&quot; section has 17 color pictures, over 5 pages, with generous text under each picture. The whole process is explained very well.The only thing where coverage is lacking is the engine, but that's good in my opinion. Including it would have made the book much bigger and expensive. There are other books out there that cover just the engine. Here it's pretty much &quot;mount the engine&quot;, and that's it. The author does recommend to test it on a stand first, which seems like a good idea. The whole book contains a lot of ideas and methods that only someone that's actually done the work knows. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"One of the things I needed in a book was to know what order(sequence)do you build your rod/custom in.Thats when I discovered this book.This book tells you what you need to know about planning your project,determine what you are going to use the car for(eg:show car/weekender/daily driven),car selection,component selection,purchase of vehicle,build up tips,when to install each item,electrical wiring,painting and so much more.This book sets it out with comprehensive advice from start to finish,even before you think about buying a car.There is a section on how to perform a top chop thats photographed in black & white photos with plenty of information.This book will help you decide what you want first then how to build it and save money too.For a book thats only got 160 pages this book has plenty of advice suitable for any auto hot rod or custom project so if you are building a hot rod or a custom car or a street machine this book is the best book to start with.Its a bargain at under $14.And,its mostly in colour.This book is an inexpensive investment.I hope the author and/or publishers decide to write a book specifically on building a street machine based on this book.Even though this book has a section on painting the author already has a book specifically on painting your car.I recommend purchasing other books that cater for things like customizing interiors,how to paint your car(and/or)how to custom paint your car,how to rebuild an engine,top chops,etc.You'll need those.I also recommend these books:\\"How to paint your car\\".By Dennis.W.Parks,\\"How to restore and customize auto upholstery & interiors\\".By Dennis.W.Parks,\\"Custom auto interiors\\",By Don Taylor and Ron Mangus.\\"Standard guide to building street rods and custom cars\\".By Ken Wickham.If you are building a later model car you should consider a workshop manual for that car too."},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"Even if you're already pretty knowledgeable about hot rods, this book has lots of good how-to sequences that can make your next project go a lot smoother, or provide you with ideas to apply to your own rod.If you're just starting your hot rod journey, this book will answer a lot of questions for you and get you started in the right direction.Overall, a great book!"},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"I can't believe that I am only the second 1-star review; this book is a complete waste of your time and money! I expected to receive a book filled with diagrams and instructional pictures and this book has neither. There isn't even a mention of how to install the engine and transmission and important items, like installing your pedals, is limited to TWO paragraphs in the whole book! This book is great for learning about the history of hot rods and seeing some cool cars, but if you're serious about building a hot rod, you need to find another book, this isn't the one you need. I'm just SO disappointed in this book - the 4 & 5 star reviews on this book are completely misleading."},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"I'm really glad that I read this book before I started building a hot rod. In addition to all of the technical advice, it prompted me to ask myself some important questions about what I really wanted to build. The layout of the book is very good and is very well written and illustrated. Unlike most magazine articles and other books, it even has a pretty thorough listing of parts and prices for a sample hot rod. That gave me a good place to start when I was trying to figure how much my hot rod would cost to build. All in all I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in building or having a hot rod built."},{"Title":"How to Build a Hot Rod","review":"Boyd Coddingtons Hopw to Build a Hot rod\\" is a 99% word for word copy of of this and you won't notice unless you read the fine print at the top of the page.

I think this \\"the original\\" is better as it has an extra paragraph here and there and also has some costs that are not included in this version. Boyd Coddington had nothing to do with the other book except writing the intro. Although a really good book it is not really that comprehensive, they show you how to build certain types of chassis. As an intro to rods even if you are not building this book is easy to read and a good read at that.

I think we have listened to it almost non-stop since I purchased it over a month ago. He also asks to read the stories several times a day. He has even decided to change his birthday theme from trucks to Pooh.My complaints about it are that, although the narrator's voice is quite soothing, all of the narration is done by the same person and there are no sound effects or music in the background. Also, there aren't chimes for turning the pages. And, beware...it takes at least 30 min. to read one of these very long stories! But this is my adult criticism.

I was looking for any by or about David Lindsay, the author of Voyage to Arcturus. The haunting quality of the book made me puzzle about what it all meant! John B. Pick's book clears up a lot of confusion about David Lindsay. Loren Eisely's forward to my copy of Voyage claims that Lindsay died young; not true! Another website confuses him with another David Lindsay who wrote a Scottish morality play. Since Lindsay's books are hard to find, aside from &quot;Voyage,&quot; this book does a real service by talking about each book and describing Lindsay's life. He is still a somewhat mysterious character, but such meaning as can be obtained is outlined in this book. For those like myself intrigued by Lindsay, I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"I am Russian so I knew quite a lot about Russian history before opening this book. The book is the best guide to Russian history of the period. Here's why:-It is written in a wonderful language - very easy to read, yet directed towards scholars.-History is divided into chapters that concentrate on specific subjects.-It is full of details that other history books often lack. I was surprised to see Bruce Lincoln use original Russian words instead of finding an English equivalent for it (such as \\"izba,\\" \\"domovoj,\\" \\"dvorovoj,\\" \\"lapti,\\" etc.).-Finally, I've not yet read a book that concentrates so much, and gives such an in-depth study, on the subjects that are usually avoided being talked about \\"pre-revolutionary\\" times (simply because they are deemed not important in the light of warfare).With this book you will get a clear idea of what the Russian society looked like on the dawn of WWI. Bruce Lincoln actually spent several years in the Russian archives doing research (but not just for this book), so he has a first-hand knowledge on the subject.The chapters discuss the following subjects:Chapter 1 - 1891: The Fateful Year:Basic overview of the situation in Russia by the year of 1891: famine, construction of trans-Siberian railway, some politics.Chapter 2 - In the Wake of Famine:Famine, peasants and life in the country.Chapter 3 - Russia's New Lords:Emancipation, new layer of society \\"Kuptsi\\" and arts and trade associated with it.Chapter 4 - Life in the Lower Depths:Proletariat and life in cities and towns.Chapter 5 - The Few Who Dared:Revolutionaries - formation of the political parties, radicals, impact on literature.Chapter 6 - Defenders of the Old Order:Royal Defenders - key figures that supported the old \\"tzar\\" order; their lives and activities.Chapter 7 - \\"A Small Victorious War\\":The Japanese War - why, when, and how. Gives the background, as well.Chapter 8 - 1905: The Year of Turmoil:Revolution of 1905.Chapter 9 - \\"What We Want is a Great Russia!\\":Government - parties, duma, people behind the law, the lawmaking process.Chapter 10 - \\"The Children of Russia's Dreadful Years\\":Art revolution.Chapter 11 - The Last Days of Peace:Political situation at the dawn of the WWI - foreign relations and repressions.Chapter 12 - The Drums of War:WWI and how it affected Russia and its people."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"&quot;In War's Dark Shadow&quot; is one of the best histories I have ever read. Lincoln does an excellent job of making the reader feel what each of the major participants of this extraordinary time in history felt, from the peasants (narod) and industrial workers, to the revolutionaries and conservatives, and finally to the monarchs.No stone is left unturned in this exhaustive study of the events and the perceptions of those events that led to the downfall of the Romanovs and capitalism in 1917. Many people will be surprised to see the extent of anti-Semitism and xenophobia that permeated the society that later fought off the Nazis in World War II.For an entirely new perspective on the Russian people, I highly recommend this work."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"In the forward, W. Bruce Lincoln states the book is &quot;...an effort to explore the lives, thoughts, hopes, and dreams of the men and women who lived in the world's largest empire and to convey some sense of the tensions that tore at the fabric of their existence on the eve of the Great War and the Revolution of 1917.&quot; In this effort he succeeds brilliantly.We see portraits of Tsar Alexander III, Nicholas II, Pobedonostsev, Lenin, Rasputin, and a host of other generals, officials and ordinary people who shaped that era.We get an insider's look at what life was like in a peasant community, inside the peasant's izba or house, and their attitudes towards schooling, medicine and religion. We go inside the growing factories and the slums the workers inhabited in the cities with rapidly developing industry. We see the new nobility of the industrial barons, the revolutionaries fighting the tsarist autocracy, the defenders of the Old Order...all come to life in these pages.Graphic descriptions are given of the vicious pogroms against Jews. The impact of the Trans-Siberian Railroad in both economic and a political aspects is covered. The 1904 war with Japan is there with its criminally incompetent generals and and admirals and the war's impact on the development of the Revolution of 1905 as well as the mood of the populace as the nations slides toward the Great War.This well written, illuminating, detailed and well documented book is a classic work on the Russian society of those years and fleshes out the soul of Russia as few other books do. 16 pages of photos. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"I am very interested in Russian history from 1891 through WWII since I collect a certain rifle that was used during that whole period.

At least I might be able to use it for a reference.As I opened the cover and saw it started in 1891, I became optimistic. A few pages into the first chapter convinced me that I found a gem; an interesting and informative overview of what is a very important part of Russian history."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"I bought this book for a class and was surprised at how engaging it is.

The bibliography is extensive and very useful for anyone researching Russia in this era. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"I plan to read Lincoln's two sequels to this book, Russia from 1914-1918 and Russia from 1918-1921, so I anticipate that some of the things I didn't like about this book will be ironed out. The first is somewhat trivial, namely Lincoln's penchant for language color, war's dark shadow and the like, which is facile and used over and over. I guess we have to forgive Homer's, \\"wine-dark sea,\\" but let's be mean: Lincoln is not Homer. Sorry, Mary Lincoln.The second is more serious, and that is the seemingly hagiographic character of his treatment of Russian capitalists in Chapter III and of Russian artists in Chapter X. I usually send an Amazon book which I especially like to friends of mine, and I would send this one but for Chapter X, whose description of Russian art and letters devoted to sexuality of all genres puts it beyond the pale as a gift. But more importantly the author has missed an opportunity to comment on the artistic frivolity and chatter of Russia's educated in the midst of the misery of the tens of millions of Russian agrarian workers (the Russian \\"peasants\\") and urban workers (the Russian \\"proletarians\\") who were paying for it. The parallel with our own epoch in America is all too obvious. The contrast of our own time with an earlier America is also obvious. Writers such as Upton Sinclair, Theodor Dreiser, and John Steinbeck were the conscience of the earlier America. Tolstoy must have realized the economic hammer and anvil used by Russia's educated classes against the Russian people when as an old man he seemed to renounce his great novels as not rising to the level of serious work.One thing puzzles me about his Chapter X. How could the author write about Diaghilev and the ballet russe without mentioning the Stravinsky ballets - Firebird, Petrushka, and Rite of Spring - which were premiered by Diaghilev's company in Paris from 1910-1913?"},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"I chose this title, because it was true, at least for me.

I never knew this before purchasing and reading Mr. Lincoln's book!If you cannot be convinced by the poverty imposed on the Russians through Mr. Lincoln's words, you will be convinced by the heart-wrenching photographs; the children who appear as hopeless, hovels designed as homes with animals living within, death from starvation was not uncommon. And all the time, Russia refused (those in power prior to the Revolution)to feed her people, wheat was being shipped to other European countries.And the Russians never questioned the motives of the Tsar; after the Revolution, they still starved and were murdered by Stalin and Hitler.We need to change our attitudes and this book did it for me."},{"Title":"In War's Dark Shadow: The Russians Before the Great War","review":"The book I ordered, In War's Dark Shadow, was exactly as the seller described it - in perfect condition.

Under the Japanese in Caricature","review":"I received this book from my grandfather who is listed in the back as one of the POW's with Col Malcolm Vaughn Fortier. There are not many paragraphs of text, aside from the Foreword from the Author and poetry in the back. The book consists mainly of pages and pages of caricatures which, as the title states, depict \\"the life of a POW under the Japanese\\". There are however small handwritten captions with each drawing and printed ones added later for the making of the book. The drawings chronicle the time between April 25th, 1942 at Camp O'Donnell in the Philippine Islands shortly after their capture at Corregidor through the transports on the death ships and all the way to their liberation by Russian officers at Camp Hoten in Japan on 7PM August 20th, 1945.While looking at the drawings and reading the captions I got a sense of the hardships and horrifying conditions underwent by these soldiers. There were many more drawings but many of them were censored by the Japanese officers once they found out about Col. Fortier's endeavors. In fact, what we have in the book is a very sterile version of what actually happened, according to other accounts I've read in other books about these dark moments in history.All in all, I think it's a book worth looking through to honor and remember these men. At the end of the book is a meticulously kept roster of all the other prisoners of war at the camps in the Philippines and in Japan."},{"Title":"Surf Life 32 To 02","review":"A richly edited compilation of surfers and coastal dwellers.Busy and lively with images from early Hawaiian and Californian eras to the worldwide surfing scene of the present day .Abstractly put together ,it's a lovely mish mash of surfing's highly visual imagery.I really enjoy this book and go back to browse through it often.It complements the other books put out by Tom Adler."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"This is the second book I have read by this author. She has an astounding talent for weaving a story. One thing she can do that many people can't is description. Detailing everyday events in ordinary people's lives turns tedious and boring in the hands of many writers. With this author, reading her description is like listening to a beautiful piece of music. Her plots center around tensions between people stuck together whether they like it or not (usually family members), and build to a catastrophic crescendo. The last part of this book is lived by the reader along with the characters. She also knows her subject matter. She gave a really accurate picture of what is was like for a person suffering from a major mental health disorder, and for the person's family. She made the valid point that no matter how supportive and sympathetic others may be, they can't cure the condition. She also gets across the fact that other people's behavior, good or bad, does not cause the condition (although it may help or aggravate it). The illness is no one's fault. I also liked her discussions of environmental issues, including the argument around the family dinner table (think back on it when you have finished the book). I personally will want to get my hands on everything this author publishes."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"This novel caught me by surprise. I expected the writing to be good, but it's nearly perfect. Robinson has created highly believable characters and a story line that grips from beginning to end.

For the first time she meets her parents-in-law, Douglas and Charlotte, and her brother-in-law Whit. Against a background of drought and the possibility of forest fires, an old family feud is played out in front of Isabel--who's exactly the wrong person to be the audience. She's one of those people who can take any bad situation and make it worse.Isabel's a mess. She works in environmental protection and has spent her entire adult life in New York, Baltimore, London, and New York again. Now she's actually seeing \\"the environment\\" for the first time; it's more than she expected. In flashbacks we learn that her first husband was bipolar and suffered from serious bouts of depression. She has an adolescent son she has no idea how to talk to (she won't discuss drugs with him because she's afraid she might learn he's taking them); and when she calls her first husband's doctor to learn how he is progressing with his latest treatments, she is curtly told he cannot discuss the case with her (implying she's the cause of his illness), and she does not even confront him.Roxana Robinson relates all this in a lean photorealist prose style. There is no excess; but she tells you everything you need to know. Her descriptive passages are so lush, you'll probably smell the fish in the water, and the smoke and ash of an oncoming forest fire. The tale unfolds in traditional novel style--no picture inserts; just one typeface; no blank pages. And while there are sections in the early chapters that might just as well come supplied with the label FORESHADOWING in Arial bold, when the events occur or issues are resolved, the resolution never happens quite the way you'd suppose.Superb."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"This is a wonderful book with a subtly interwoven plot and a mystery at the heart of it. I can't imagine that anyone wouldn't like this novel. This is a very fine writer in wonderful form, and I couldn't put &quot;Sweetwater&quot; down even though I had many other things pressing. I'm online just to order everything else I can find by Roxana Robinson."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"I love the written word and enjoy many authors. I enjoy them so much that I forgive inaccuracies and suspend belief for the sake of the story. I also forgive just adequate writing because an author's characters and plot are well developed. But with Roxana Robinson's novel Sweetwater, none of that was necessary. All I had to do was settle in and devour what has become one of my all-time favorite novels.Isabel Green took a vacation from life following the death of her first husband. Then she met Paul Simmons, married him because it seemed right, and attempted to reconnect again with the world.Seven months after her marriage to Paul, he and Isabel travel to the Simmons' summer lodge in the Adirondacks. There Isabel struggles to connect with and understand her husband, his complicated parents and his brother, who appears to have a thorny relationship with Paul. Isabel's time at the lodge brings up the painful reality of her first marriage and awakens feelings that she doesn't understand - and that evoke guilt.Everything in Robinson's book is married to the environment, reflects the delicate balance between nature and the humans that inhabit the world, and speaks of the author's deep relationship with nature.Robinson's prose is fluid; her character's are complex, rich with flaws and deep emotions. The plot is compelling and unique. It is expertly constructed and the ending is both sad and satisfying at the same time. I can't wait to read Robinson's other works."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"Robinson has a knack for telling stories about people starting over and this novel is so fine in that regard. But &quot;Sweetwater&quot; isn't only about starting over but locating self in the world such that both benefit, or, at least, hope to.This is a quiet book in the midst of which a fire rages literally. Yet it's the fires raging below the surface that captures the reader's attention and holds it perfectly to the end which is imperfect but that's not Robinson's fault since she merely reflects the imperfect world in which we live. Yet, that ending, aspires, at least, to perfection.I loved this novel, finest kind.And, if you're one who revels in nature, the refection of it in this book is a special treat."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"Pair erupting forest fires and an environmentalist involved with a family simmering with incendiary conflict, and you've got the makings for an atypical story of love and loss.

The consequences of making a choice to be merely \\"content\\" are great for the main character, Isabel, who plods through her new marriage like someone forced to take medicine - she knows it's good for her overall, but reluctantly does so.Then, she meets her new husband's family - a group with lots of under surface tension for reasons unknown to Isabel. This seems to interest her more than her husband. In the end, it is her new brother in law who she finds most interesting. Consequences ensue.Robinson does a brilliant job of weaving nature throughout the story, as it is set against the backdrop of a lovely lakehouse cottage in the Adirondacks. But most of the story development seems to have been spent on the woods and forest and not enough on the character's development. It felt rushed in some places and too long in others. Overall an interesting story, but I was left with many questions."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"I read this book in hopes of giving to my Grandma as it sounded like somthing she would enjoy.

Her books weave thematic threads that evolve into a rich, complete tapestry of life.\\"Sweetwater\\" is a journey with two generations on a family vacation. As with any family vacation, we look into their cabins, fraught with both pleasures and anxieties. This vacation, set in the Adirondacks during a drought, carries even more tension than most, for not only is the environment at risk, but a new wife is being inducted into the clan.For Isabel, this time in the woods promised to be a bonding experience with her second husband, Paul. Instead, his family's language of certain looks and inexplicable, casual references turns her confidence inside out. It doesn't help that Paul has a sexy, unmarried, wonderful brother along: Whit. Isabel finds that she has too much time to think during their canoe trips and long hikes of the mistakes she made during her first marriage to Michael and ponder the future with Paul. Has she made another huge mistake? And what about Whit?As in Robinson's other books, \\"Cost\\" and \\"This is My Daughter,\\" no one is completely right and no one is completely wrong. This family simply mirrors the macrocosm they have left behind, and yet they have not left it at all.A fabulous, modern story. I love this author and her thoughtful, thought-provoking works.

A woman makes the terrible mistake of marrying in haste for very understandable and realistic reasons, and must repent at leisure. The writer has a gift for summarizing and conveying the emotional truth in relationships, and can express it through the actions of characters or a brilliant summation like this one:\\"She thought there was something crazed and pathetic about herself. She was like a dog who did a trick over and over for a master who used to praise him for it but now beat him for it; a dog who continued to perform the trick, hoping that the master would return to his earlier behavior, longing dumbly for the return to the other life...\\"There are seven characters of import in this book, and I can see the face of each in my mind and I know exactly how they felt about each other and why. Over and over again, I was struck by how well-conveyed love was; the love of parents for children and children for their parents, romantic love in all its variations and hopelessness, as well as the lack of love, the feeling of \\"settling.\\" All this love stuff happens in a larger metaphorical context about the natural world, and at times the environmental observations went on a little for my taste, but I always appreciated the beauty of the prose, the cool, measured telling of this very powerful story."},{"Title":"Sweetwater: A Novel","review":"Sweetwater is, on the whole, a very engaging novel. Unfortunately I read it after Ms. Robinson's best yet--Cost--so I could not give Sweetwater a five-star. I really liked the elderly characters as well as the setting, the now non-existent cottage grouping. The foreshadowing is maybe a little too obvious with the constant references to a dry summer and the potential for fire. The ending is very disappointing in this novel, in my opinion.

But is this the only conclusion that we can get from scriptures? Some respected authors argue otherwise.\\"What about those who have never heard\\" was written by three authors (Fackre, Nash, Sanders) who each holds to a different scheme for grasping salvation. But what is important, is that all three agree on the authority of the scripture and on the fact that anyone who is saved is so because of Jesus's ultimate sacrifice; without Jesus's sacrifice on the cross, all humanity is doomed. What they disagree upon, is the degree of knowledge one should have about this great atonement event and the timing of this awareness.John Sanders argues for Inclusivism meaning that God saves people only through the work of Jesus, but some may be saved even if they have never heard about Christ. The importance is not the degree of \\"knowledge\\" about Christ, but the \\"faith in God\\" as it was revealed to the person. So, according to this view, responding positively to the light and the law written in their heart will be viewed as righteous and thus, the work of christ will be counted on their behalf. Romans 2 is given as a basis.Gabriel Fackre argues that receptive knowledge of Christ is necessary for salvation, but that this knowledge is not restricted to this lifetime. Non-christian believers will get the chance to hear the gospel post-mortem and decide whether they accept it or not. Fackre calls it \\"divine perseverance\\", meaning that death will not stop God from allowing us to know the true gospel. Fackre relies mainly on Peter 3:19 and 4:6.As for Nash, he strongly attacks the other views and argues for Restrictivism: receptive knowledge of Christ in this lifetime is a must for salvation. He builds his case by showing the multitude of loopholes and mistakes in the previous two views, and cites many bible passage to support his stand(1Jn 5:12, Jn 1:12, Jn 20:30, ...)Each author presents his idea in a chapter, then the others are given each a space to respond; so a total of 3 presentations and 6 refutations. This make the book a very thought provoking and not one sided discussion. I loved this approach!As much as i deeply want to believe in a wider hope, restrictivism sounded the most biblicaly based. The other two concepts have serious mistakes that Nash quickly points out. One frustrating thing, is that Nash doesn't build a structured positive case for restrictivism, but concentrates on \\"bringing down\\" the other views.Reading this book will NOT convince you of any of them, since each has a scriptural case, but when you take the whole scripture in perspective, i think you will tend to lean more towards the restrictivist (although, inclusivism sounds the most \\"logical\\": for example, a few days after jesus death and resurrection, only a handful of people are believers in the atonement. Does this mean, that the rest of the planet in billions was doomed? The message didnt have time to reach them yet..hmmm)Although the book quickly mentions it in the introduction, i had wished the ''universal opportunity'' concept was developped in its own chapter, since i believe it is also quite biblical: receptive knowledge of Jesus Christ is necessary for salvation, but any sincere lover of God (as he knows him) is given a chance to hear the gospel. Look at the story of Cornelius (Acts 10): he is a believer in the God he knows, so GOD sent him an angel to direct him to Peter so he hears the gospel!To conclude, the book is an excellent introduction to the subject, which give you different angles to look at. Although it is incomplete and although restrictivism isnt presented in a positive case (after lashing out at the other views, which leave you a bit in the unknown), the book will make every single neuron of yours fire up. At the end, neither of the three concepts 100% convinced me, but i sure learned a lot.

Again, as it seems to be, not all Christian views are presented.Certainly, we who hold the Lutheran confession would side with Nash, who easily out of the three represented does the most exemplary job of using God's Word correctly. Nash is correct in his chastisement of his two opponents for not lack of good exegesis of the Bible. It is truly sad but commonplace to find such poor, hurried exegeis as exemplified by Sanders and Fackre.It would have been good to have one argue: univesal grace, grace alone, the means of grace, and the mystery of why some saved and others not? This would have given the complete Biblical picture. This is not demonstrated by any of the three in this book.However, as exemplary as Nash is with his defense of restrictivism by not only showing the proper exegesis and hermeneutic of the other two sides, he has some glaring weaknesses himself. As those of the Reformed are bent to do, they always want to let logic and reason dominate, rather than letting God's Word suffice.Or as Luther would say, &quot;What is not spoken of in God's Word must be left to the heavenly academy for resolution.&quot; We do not have all the answers to all mysteries in God's Word!&quot; As Moses said so profoundly on his deathbed, &quot;The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons forever.&quot; (Deut. 29:29)Nash suffers, as Sanders catches him, on Double Predestination. Calvinists cannot say that Christ died for all, but only for the elect. This is the classic error of Calvin. As well, they hedge the truth of God's Scriptures of the Real Presence in the Sacrament. Sanders does not confess the B.C. Means of Grace as St. Paul does in 1 Cor. 10:1-11, that Christ was present with them, but most did not have faith and were disallowed into Promised Land. This typology extends throughout OT, allowing OT saints the same (Romans 4) as we NT saints, faith in Promised Messiah (Christ).However, to deny infant sin (Age of Accountability) that Nash puts forth is unbiblical (Ps. 51:5) Furthermore, Nash is wise to attack inclusivism on premise that grace is with all until rejection of Christ and Gospel, and he shows forth Biblical attack to destory this false teaching.Nash certainly is far and away the more faithful Biblical presenter, aside from the errors already identified. Further, he does not profess Christ's descent into hell as for what it was: Christ's victorious announcement of victory over the demon angels, nor is he correct is declaring Luke 16:19ff as being a parable. It does not necessarily have to be interpreted as parabolic, see Art Just's Commentary, Volume II, pg. 630ff.Cudos to Nash for calling the other two's hand for not showing the Biblical evidence for their positions, while discounting his opponents Biblical proofs and offering restrictivist passages, Nash has provided the debate with the sure foundation of what God says about this controversial topic."},{"Title":"What About Those Who Have Never Heard?: Three Views on the Destiny of the Unevangelized (Spectrum Multiview Book Series Spectrum Multiview Book Serie)","review":"This is an extremely important topic, and it is interesting (even intriguing) to read Sanders' and Fackre's atypical views on this subject.

Why the authors chose to exclude the ancient church Fathers and their teachings on this \\"lost\\" practice was baffling to me and would have saved a lot of ink and paper.Paul taught the doctrine, the early Christian Church practiced it, and those who did not hear the Word were given a chance to accept Christ vicarously through it. These baptismal fonts are still visable in the city of Rome, today. San Clemente Church is one of the best excavated examples dating back to the first century.

Though I don't agree totally with Nash's restrictivism (since I hold to unlimited atonement), he does a good job presenting a very persuasive case for the traditional evangelical understanding of the destinies of the unevangelized. Sanders' inclusivism leads to the heresy of works-salvation (unbelievers who positively respond to God's light and walk in His ways will be saved even without knowledge of Christ). Such heresy leads to another heresy: that Christians also must do good works to earn or maintain their salvation. His interpretation of Romans 2 on pp. 46-7 is horrible (he follows the interpretation of the \\"new perspective\\" that Paul was not opposing Jewish works-salvation but Jewish nationalism). ... Overall, a good book for those who want to be convinced of the truthfulness of restrictivism."},{"Title":"Nourishing Recipes with 100 Chinese Herbs ('Bai lei zhong yao bu liao shi pu', in traditional Chinese/English)","review":"The Chinese are strong believers in taking nourishing food similar to those vitamin pill poppers.

Much of what Chatelain writes continues to be unique information in our struggle to understand our pre-history, despite revolutionary contributions in this field by other authors such as Graham Hancock, Zechariah Sitchin, etc.While one other reviewer has objected that he doesn't understand Chatelain's sources, I rather think that the fault lies with that reviewer's having too readily recurred to the now-tired \`debunking' litany accusing an author of building proof of a theory based on nothing more than having taken speculation for fact. Trouble is, as chief communications engineer with the Apollo space program during the 1960's and 70's, Chatelain's credentials are impeccable and Chatelain's evidence is also clear cut: how does one question simple measurements and mathematic equations? Or perhaps the reviewer is calling into question the fact that there *exist* such things as the Nineveh Constant (2,268,000,000 days of 86,400 seconds each) or the Precession of the Equinox (9,450,000,000 days). These, along with a quantity of other astronomical numbers, were translated by a George Smith from Sumerian tablets in the British Museum one hundred years previous to Chatelain's original publication, but this information was largely ignored by archaeologists of his day, probably for the same reasons that orthodox archaeologists of today have so much trouble with it.Chatelain gives the background for these discoveries and goes into some considerable detail on the cycles derived from this constant and other ancient weights and measures, including currency among different ancient nations. This is all great stuff.Although Chatelain does mention, without specifying, more recent books in which he found this information repeated (possibly one of the publications listed at the Sacred Science site), for me this doesn't detract one little bit from his argument. It's a simple matter of cross-checking the concepts and their background in any encyclopedia. If you are looking at it purely from the point of an academic reference, it really is not that difficult to understand where the *Nineveh* Constant comes from!Finally, I do worry that so much credence is given to a reviewer who not only doesn't get the review placed with the proper book, but also is so ready to judge the labour of years of study and writing with little more than subjective criticisms. And incidentally, the quote about the Greeks IS taken out of context. Chatelain was referring to the crew of a sponge divers' rig and the need to keep them occupied, in what I thought was quite a humourous fashion (page 111).All in all, I found the book to be highly readable, the author in his own way to be rather charming, and the mathematical and theoretical information highly useful to the debate."},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"I have met religious and scientific experts from all over the world, but find they fail to measure up to the work of this genius who offers real answers to the questions we have had since birth. Once open, one cannot put it down. Other tasks of importance are put aside. Don't be afraid of all the numbers he uses. Rather keep an open mind and examine the logic. And part of his genius is his ability to express in simplified terms such an astronomically complex subject. He reminds me of Carl Sagan. You will soon find yourself succumbing to the irrestible attraction of true answers at last. I am impressed at M. Chatelain's courage in expressing such convictions."},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"In my opinion, a book every human needs to read. Very detailed calculations and explanations. Real human history has been so distorted by the media and the corrupt people in charge, this book offers help to begin connecting the dots. Good luck on your journeys!"},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"I found this book to be quite unfulfilling. The author is really a little full of himself. In the first part of the book, he talks about his life and how he came to be a &quot;Nasa expert&quot;. He then talks about some of NASA's early space missions. Mind you none of this has anything to do with what the book is REALLY about and most of it could easily have been summed up on the inside leaf of the book itself (in I'm sure a more digestible manner). I believe it was only written to lend some credibility to the incredible claims he makes in latter parts of the book and it made for some nice fill. The remainder of this book does have some interesting math soup about what ancient people may have known and when they knew it. However none of what he proclaims is documented well (i.e. it is difficult to check his &quot;facts&quot;) and it is up to the reader to accept the author's facts based on no more than faith. Some of what he said is accurate but it would be quite difficult for anyone to verify all of it. He also plays the game of taking a hunch or guess, molding it into a fact, and then using it to prove his theory. This is done throughout this book, and it is so obvious even a casual reader like me could smell it a mile away. I can't really say anything of what he said is untrue. All I know is that he never proved anything to me about &quot;Cosmic Ancestors&quot; and that's what the book was suppose to be about.I do have to add that I found some of his personal remarks somewhat unprofessional. Firstly, his computer expertise for those who are serious and can understand it is almost condescending. At the time this book was written, I'm sure that sounded good but now it's laughable. Secondly, the following remark speaks for itself..&quot;The Greeks are charming people whom I love very much; but when they have nothing else to do, they can't stop drinking, gambling, and fighting. The trouble is that they seem to have very little to do, far too often.&quot; This was not taken out of context. Does this sound like a book by a zealous researcher looking for the truth in a scientific manner? I would not personally recommend this book."},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"The book was very enlightening, and Chatelain discusses things that are of great interest to myself and anyone that is into this stuff. However while reading this book I found myself extremely bored because of how he organizes his information. First of all, the entire book is filled with ridiculous mathematical equations that about 90% of your common readers will be completely baffled by. They proved and meant nothing to me. Every page is just filled with numbers beyond numbers. Sometimes I felt like it was a joke because of how many numbers I was looking at on one page.Also, the information in each chapter is organized in these small paragraphs. It's just really strange to read something like this, organized this way. Once I feel like an interesting idea is coming, the paragraph just ends and he moves on to something else.I couldn't even get through the whole thing. Buy it if you're a fan of this guy but otherwise, you might want to skip it. I give the three stars for the insane amount of effort it took the author to put this book together. But the lack of the 4th and 5th star is because this book will NOT appeal to everybody."},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"In \\"Our Cosmic Ancestors\\", Maurice Chatelain identifies some of the unexplained phenomenon of his time and tries to relate it to a race which visited our world in the remote past.Maurice talks briefly about the Egyptian Pyramids, The Mayan Calendar, The Maltese Cross, Antikythera Computer, The possibility of earth having four moons, Atlantis. As I mentioned earlier this may be a lot of information for a reader when this book published, in late eighties. Now we have volumes of books dedicated to these subjects.Maurice tries to make a case for an extraterrestrial contact which resulted in a out of phase and sudden change in the civilizations and the way they prospered from average to world class execution in religion, architecture, astronomy and star lore.Contrary to the title of the book, the author is not able to narrow down his assumptions of foreign interventions to a specific area in the sky or to a specific constellation or a star or planet. Hence the book doesnot shed light on the origins of our cosmic ancestors.Overall it is a pretty okay read for someone who intends to get familiar with some of the unexplained realities and doesnot want to delve deep into them."},{"Title":"Our Cosmic Ancestors","review":"I am trying to get to the root of the &quot;invade and conquer&quot; dynamic that threatens to destroy what is left of life on this planet.

I have great respect for the author Erik von Daniken (Chariots of the Gods, etc.) and find this book a more scientific backup to von Daniken's philosphical and historical point of view.

The Buhle/Wagner work remains invaluable for filling out the historical record of the notorious Hollywood blacklist. The inquisition itself (1947-circa 1952) has been recounted in a number of worthy volumes; however, this is the only one I know that tracks down careers during the decades that followed.One salient point: the book is not research friendly. The material, though fascinating, is not well organized. The text does read like a collection of essays, as one reviewer points out. Thus there's no particular development of themes or chronology. An individual listee may appear in one context and then in another 50 pages later with no connecting thread. The index is helpful, but cannot connect the threads. (Joseph Losey remains a notable exception.) Also, no bibliography or list of interviews is furnished. Thus researchers must piece together from the footnotes. None of this is meant to detract from the excellent research behind the book, nor from the contribution towards understanding how money and politics play out in the entertainment industry. What is clear from the book is that a lot of producers got a lot of high-priced talent for a lot less money as a result of the purges.A personal note. The other night, I watched a 1957 teen movie, The Careless Years, which posed the typical quandary of 50's lovelorn youth-- Are we too young to marry. Nothing here beyond the banal except for one aspect. The boy's dad works in a machine shop, where he takes the son who wants to work there so he can marry the girl and forego college. Nothing unusual, except Dad (John Larch) goes into some detail about the lamentable work conditions that a machinist must put up with. That detail seemed a little out of sync with the prevailing social theme, but was informative, nonetheless. Come to peel back the writer's credit and, lo and behold-- thank you John Howard Lawson for those few moments of blue-collar reality in an otherwise whitebread 60 minutes. Yes indeed, the big band may have scattered, but the beat goes on, even where least expected."},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight: The Hollywood Blacklistees in Film and Television, 1950-2002","review":"While many books, essays, television shows and movies have made us all more sensitive to the dangers of McCarthyism, most of us don't quite know what happened to those who were blacklisted after the HUAC meetings in the early 50s. Hide in Plain Sight filled that void for me, and expanded my understanding of both the event's consequences for society and of the artists involved.The book uses a variety of methods for capturing the subsequent history of those who were blacklisted. Some chapters focus on particular forms of artistic expression, while other sections look at individual producers, directors, writers and actors. As a result, there's some redundancy . . . so the book often feels like a series of essays rather than one seamless nonfiction book. That quality, however, makes the book easier to use for those who just want to read about a single person or genre.I was very surprised to learn that almost every adult television show that I liked during the 1950s and 1960s involved blacklisted writers. Perhaps it's just because my tastes run to history, underdogs, unusual approaches and conflict, but what was interesting about television then (and often isn't now) came from those with a strong ideological bent toward Marxist or antifascist thought. This book forms an important document in helping all Americans to understand how dialogue in our society needs to be maintained through providing free access to all media. Much great work would have been lost if these blacklisted writers, directors and performers had lost their artistic lives.I found one aspect of the book to be tedious though. Every person was characterized by her or his political beliefs. In most cases, this was done with a simple label (antifascist, Marxist, liberal, etc.). That way of characterizing people seemed to me to make the book overly political. As a result, the book constantly displays a battle between left and right . . . and almost leaves the audience out in the process.I did not know many of the films that were described, especially those that were done in Europe. I appreciated the care with which the films were described. In several cases, I learned important back stories about the meaning of metaphors that added to my understanding of the films.A real strength of the book is showing how the careers of individual blacklisted people were affected. The analyses of how their subsequent works developed (especially those of Joseph Losey) were quite extensive and intriguing to think about.The final paragraph is unusually eloquent:&quot;Hollywood was always about money. It still is. But at its best it was and eventually might once again be something a great deal more--a glimmering of a democratic art form returning the embrace of its vast audience with equality sncerity and the sense of a common fate.&quot;As I finished the book, I was reminded of John Donne's famous poem. &quot;Ask not for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee.&quot; As badly as individual lives were harmed by the blacklisting, our democracy and culture were harmed even more. In realizing the full depths of that loss, we are all the losers."},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight: The Hollywood Blacklistees in Film and Television, 1950-2002","review":"\\"Hide in Plain Sight\\" is the latest book co-authored by Paul Buhle on the Hollywood blacklist and its impact. As is the case with the previous books, this is as much a celebration of what radicals in the entertainment accomplished as it is about the terrible loss when they were purged.For people who came of age in the 1950s, the book is an exceptional treat. Who knew that many of our favorite television shows drew upon the talents of writers, directors and actors hounded out of the Hollywood film industry? Covering the period from 1950 to 2002, it proves dramatically that the radical politics of the 1930s never really disappeared but found ways to express itself through popular culture. The television shows and Hollywood movies of this period were just as important a link to the New Left as the folk music revival and leftwing beat poetry.As is the case with every book in this series, the index can provide a kind of shortcut into the treats within its pages. For example, a reference to \\"You Are There\\" reveals that some of the 1953-1955 teleplays were written by Walter Bernstein, Arnold Manoff and Abraham Polonsky--3 blacklistees. Each show was pegged to a real historical event. The central drama of such shows involved heroic efforts by figures such as John Peter Zenger to stand up for democratic principles against a repressive government. Such messages were not lost on baby boomers, including myself.While it is not too difficult in retrospect to detect the footprints of radicals in such a show, there were others that were more cleverly subversive at camouflaging their true intent. For example, the children's cartoon show \\"Gerald McBoing Boing\\" was a product of United Productions of America, which was launched by John Hubley, a New Deal era radical. Fellow UPA'er Dave Hilberman had been fingered by Walt Disney for the sin of having \\"spent considerable time at the Moscow Art Theater\\".Not that Gerald McBoing Boing was about socialist tractors and the struggle against fascism. Instead it is about a child who speaks entirely in sound effects. The real inspiration for this cartoon was not Marxism, but the playful inventive spirit of the Hollywood left going back to Charlie Chaplin and a host of others open to surrealism.Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hide in Plain Sight: The Hollywood Blacklistees in Film and Television, 1950-2002","review":"The movie studios RKO, MGM, Paramount, Warner Brothers, and Twentieth Century Fox (all familiar to the movie-goers of the Fab Fifties) struggled for survival by focusing on large-budget blockbusters. Later Universal, United Artists, Columbia Pictures and others found life different after the Cold War mania in which writers, producers and directors (some actors) were blacklisted by McCarthy as pro-Communism in this country.McCarthy ruined reputations and stunted careers in Hollywood in a grand style, but at what a cost -- he was the one to die early. It's a proven fact that hurting others in any way (even by neglect) hurts the tormentor more, usually in physical health. \\"Tough things can kill. They kill the spirit, hopes, dreams, vision and even desire (to live). Excessive pressure can make you explode or make you learn new ways to constructively vent.\\" (Mtn. Wings #4271)The wild McCarthyrite charges of conspiracy were as common in the Fifties as they were devastating. Some of those blacklisted by 30's radicalism had been unfairly smeared and even damaged in the McCarthy Era. The Hollywood screenwriters were infiltrated by former Communists for the congressional investigators for the FBI. It is sad that producers testified against some of their best writers and best friends.But they continued to work on films without credit for their work at lower wages than they deserved. In fact, they contributed immensely to the creation of the 1950's Golden Age of Television, to the dramas and sitcoms. Some moved to New York and were productive on the stage.Technology in the form of CinemaScope, camera innovations such as the zoom lens, location shooting, and color film saved the industry. The Arbitron surveys killed off some special programs. I'd forgotten about those; as we were never chosen to keep track of what we watched. Today, they are used for radio also and I took one myself in 2001 -- gave Nick Clooney lots of play time in the early hours of each morning.These historians explain all you'd ever want to know (also some better not known) about every movie you might have seen or just heard about. There is quite a listing throughout this volume.Some brought back pleasant memories included were the Armstrong Circle Theater, Philco Television Playhouse, Studio One, Four Star Playhouse, NBC Television Theater, Alcoa Aluminum Hour, (also Alcoa/Goodyear Theater) and Ray Bradbury's Science Fiction Theater. The best drama series of this \\"Golden Age\\" was one of my favorites, TWILIGHT ZONE. Reruns are still on the tube today.The cowboys listed were Hopalong Cassidy, Andy Devine, Roy Rogers, but not Lash LaRue (why not?) as he was great. One year he came to our Fair and silly me, just a wisp of a girl, volunteered to stand on stage while he tore a piece of paper out of my mouth with his whip. He was something!Of course, the music shows to which I was partial and played a big part in my young life. Bing Crosby Productions used blacklisted talents in their shows, BREAKING POINT, HOGAN'S HEROES, and BEN CASEY later in 1959. The mini-studios brought out the detectives we all loved. And who could forget Loretto Young and her beautiful costumes or Dinah Shore and her downhome shows to show the world that we Southerners do know a thing or two.This would make a good reference book for movie buffs."},{"Title":"Transdisciplinary Play-Based Assessment: A Functional Approach to Working With Young Children","review":"It is great book.

Accordingly, the important task of interpreting that conflict has been left largely to Israelis, who done an outstanding job fulfilling it. In the present study, a mostly Israeli cast of authors looks at the Iraqi decision to go to war, and the consequences of that decision. Baram draws on his unique knowledge of Iraqi politics to take on that most difficult of tasks, probing Saddam Husayn's mind. Mark A. Heller explains why the Iraqi army regularly performs poorly. Ofra Bengio looks at the balance of power within Iraq's ethnic communities. Patrick Clawson points out the subtle economic impact of the sanctions against Iraq while Robert J. Lieber argues that Saddam Husayn's adventurism could easily have deeply harmed the world economy. A host of authors-including Rubin, Shaul Bakhash, Joseph Nevo, David Kushner, and the late Avner Yaniv-then look at Iraq's foreign relations through the 1990-91 crisis and war. But perhaps most interesting is the chapter by Joseph Kostiner on the much-neglected Kuwaiti angle. He establishes the basic precepts of that country's foreign policy-essentially neutralism and good Arab citizenship-and then shows how these guidelines were maintained throughout the crisis leading up to 2 August 1990. He finds the thesis that Kuwaitis provoked Iraq to war not convincing.Middle East Quarterly, June 1994"},{"Title":"Mutuwhenua - The Moon Sleeps (Wildfire Books)","review":"Mutuwhenua (The Moon Sleeps) is a very good book which deals with the cultural differences between the two main racial groups in New Zealand.

Not only was this book badly written, but even the professor was frustrated with the terseness of the material. My opinion is that if this is a textbook, one should not need a PhD to read and understand it. Unfortunately however, the authors assume that either you already know everything there is to know about the subjects that they are trying to explain, or that you have read all of the papers that they have ever published and are familiar with their work (from which they draw most of the examples of the book). In summary, if you want a good textbook about forest ecosystems, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"Mackey's book is an interesting read, she uses a different style than most other authors in the genre. She spends some time discribing how mountains look when pulling into port and the like. It gives the book a different tempo, which could be good or bad depending upon your personal tastes.For the good aspects of the book, I suggest reading the Editorial Reviews on this page. They'll do a better job than I explaining the good.There are several things I don't like. This is a re-print, and as such it advertises a \\"new introduction\\". It really isn't an introduction, as it only explains why she decided to re-print the book and that she is going to be releasing a second volume on the subject.The second problem is, in my opinion, rather large. She only includes a four page selected bibliography. I give her the benifit of the doubt that she isn't making up the contents of the book, but I still want to know where she got her sources. If I want to further my reading on the subject, or if I need to come up with additional sources for a paper on Lebanon, or if I decide that I want to check her sources the bibliography offered makes that largely impossible.The 15 pages of notes don't help either. The authors quoted there appear in the selected bibliography. The rest of the notes read somewhat like a glossary. For example, on page 268 you can read her definition of Imam: \\"Regarding the Twelve Imams of Shiism, an imam is a divinely inspired successor to the Prophet. In general terms, an imam can also be simply the spiritual leader of the community, not unlike the village priest in Catholicism.\\" To somebody with a basic knowledge of the Middle East or Islam, the definition isn't needed. To someone who has little to no knowlege, they would be better served by having this definition as a footnote on the page this occurs rather than forcing them to break the flow of reading to search in the back of the book.I'm aware my concerns may not be shared by others who are just looking for a good read on Lebanon. This is a good read. However, notes and bibliographies give a good base for further reading and research. To students (or at least to me), these things can be more important that the book they are in.Hopefully in her second volume these things will be complete and intact. I eagerly await its publication."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"This was a great book.

Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand Lebanon, its 15year civil war, and some of the background behind the conflict in the Middle East."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"The book is extremely well written, which gives it a sort of \\"feel good\\" sense about it. In that sense, it's not surprising that it's selling well, or it's getting excellent reviews from beginners who want to understand something about Lebanon. The author does an excellent job of captivating the reader.Nonetheless, substance-wise, it's severly lacking. For one thing, there are statistics on pre-war Lebanon with no references, no sources, nothing. There are quotes without any mention of who actually wrote/said them, nevermind any references. It certainly does not conform to any shape of scholarly rigour. We are told in the introduction that there's a lot to talk about when it comes to Lebanon and so 'space must be saved.' Yet, in order to support her explanations of \\"Lebanese psyche\\", she uses such compelling evidence (note: sarcasm) as verbal disputes between drivers on the streets of Beirut or the answer of a single young boy about a question on arithmetics (of course we are spared any background information on the boy). The Maronite community is criticized for its 'unwarranted/desperate' needs to associate with the Phoenicians, yet the author has no trouble associating the Phoenicians' supposed lack of ethical conduct (again, no references) with current 'Lebanese behavior.' The underlying thesis of the book is that Arab culture, which is shared by all communities (we are told), is the root of Lebanon's problems because of its propensity for violence and conflict, and thus Lebanon is the key to understand all other Arab countries.For a much better, academically-oriented, account of the divisions that plague Lebanon, I recommend Kamal Salibi's \\"A House of Many Mansions.\\""},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"If you lived through the seventies and eighties, one thing which was constant was the Lebanese Civil War. In this war, endless fractions paired off against each other destroying a country so throughly that it now only coming out of this dark period. There was the war between the Shiites and Sunnis, the war between the Druze and other faiths, the inter Christian clan war.Throw in the Israelis and Palestinians, and there were plenty of enemies in this war.The author Mackey examines the country and the various factions and tries to make some sense of how this war came about. Her sub title is indeed her belief that Lebanon was dying. When even the Red Cross pulled out of Lebanon, many in the West simply gave up on this country.Mackey does a good job of detailing a little bit of the history of the country and why the various factions could not live together. She puts into her perspective that Lebanon was not going to survive the Civil War. It has, first under Syrian tutelage, and now as a completely independent country."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"Because Lebanon-Death of a Nation and Lebanon-House divided are the same books.The reader is deceived into thinking that House divided is a continuation of Death of a Nation. Unfortunately, after purchasing both books (because of different titles), we found out that they are exactly identical. The claim of \\"with new introduction\\" is nothing but a measly page and a half write-up that adds no value to the overall read, but certainly puts more money in Sandra's pocket.Getting over this disappointment, Sandra's book about the war in Lebanon during the 1975-1989 period is a great read. Without judgment or prejudice, she sheds lights on the politics of the \\"Zuama\\" their alliances and re-alliances during that period of Lebanon and how all Lebanese have suffered because of them.It will be interesting to see if she will write a true-continuation about the period 1989--2003 and the similarities of those situations with the past."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"I purchased this book in hopes of getting a back ground to the current political situation in Libya. What one actually gets is not history but an extremely one sided story with little supporting data.From the out set of this book the authors views are clear the Lebanese Christians are blood thirsty, powerful, moneyed, religious fanatics. The Sunni are described as corupt but little, next to zero mention. The Druze as well are barely mention and the massacres they commited are summed up in a paragraph where as pages are devoted to the Christians. The author reserves all of her sympathy for the neglected Shiite (Hezbollah/Amal) and the freedom seeking Palestinians(PLO).The authors skewed views even come into play when describing foreign intervention. Syria is basically described as trying to keep the peace while a sentence is devoted to the possibility that Assad was responsible for hundreds of political assasinations within Lebanon. Israel as one could already guess is accused of genocide and war crimes with no mention of PLO attacks against Israel. The multi national force instead of being described as peace keepers is described as being a support system for Israel.I am astonished there are so many positive reviews for this book, one can only assume that the vast majority of people are simply uninformed and like a good story with a clear good and evil charater; however sadly in civil war there are just shades of grey."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"This is a highly-readable history of the Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1988, that is actually much more.In order to give the reader a better than superficial understanding of the warring factions, political personalities, and historical grievance that combined to spark a brutal war, the author goes back decades or centuries, as necessary, to explain the origins of Maronites, Orthodox, Sunnis, Muslims, Druze and Palestinians. As a result, when Mackey begins with the actual narrative of the civil war, even the beginning reader can follow the plot with little difficulty. As a result, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the Lebanese Civil War and the role of Lebanon in the greater Middle East.Mackey's approach to introducing the warring factions, however, leads to confused chronology. Perhaps this is unavoidable; or perhaps the benefits of a more straightforward chronology would inevitably weaken the explanation of the different factions. Regardless, it may be hard for some readers to keep timelines straight as they continually jump back in time as new factions are introduced. Mackey aggravates the problem by sometimes failing to mention pertinent dates, even where doing so would not detract from the narrative.This history often does not read like a history book. Mackey delights in inserting the occasional vignette, the anecdote about nameless actors that possibly captures a moment better than a rote recitation of names and dates. I enjoy the effect, but it serves to expand the text where it could otherwise be more streamlined, and a reader who is looking more for specific information (as for example the researcher or student) might find it tedious and unhelpful.Also, because anecdotes are not inherently reliable evidence, they are only useful to the extent one trusts Mackey to have accurately interpreted the zeitgeist the anecdotes are intended to portray. Is Mackey sufficiently trustworthy? Unfortunately, because her sourcing is so weak, it is impossible to say. She has no footnotes. Her endnotes are sparse and often unhelpful. The Selected Bibliography is thin, and should have been grouped by subject matter.In another departure from a straight history book, Mackey writes primarily to argue and defend her conclusions. Her goal is not just to say what has happened, and when why, but who is at fault, and the way things should have been done, and (by implication) how things should be done in the future. As with other issues observed in this review, I enjoyed Mackey's approach (even where I disagreed with her conclusions), but I see how a reader might find her emphasis on the didactic tedious or unhelpful, or both. This is especially likely for American conservatives or supporters of Israel: Mackey is virtually silent about Jimmy Carter, but has nothing good to say about Reagan, Thatcher or any Israeli.The final problem is timeliness. The book was published in 1989. The new introduction is copyrighted in 2006, but the text has not been updated, and the introduction is only two pages. A purchaser who thinks he is getting a \\"new\\" book is reading material that is a decade old.I recommend this book in spite of its weaknesses, but the reader should know what he is buying, and what he is not.NOTE: If you find my review unhelpful, please tell me why in a comment."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"The author describes the life and culture of lebanese people in a hystorical review. Objective book that explains the political situation in depth."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"This is a compellingly readable book about an immensely complex subject. As history, it provides a vivid picture of the almost countless competing political and social interests that have brought about the \\"death\\" of Lebanon. Existing until 1975 as a kind of mirage on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean, Lebanon fell into a years-long civil war played out most dramatically in the international media as heavily armed militia blew apart the city of Beirut and then, later, as one westerner after another was taken hostage by clandestine insurgent groups. Mackey's argument is that Lebanon has never existed in any real way as a nation, its affairs managed by various Christian and Muslim mafia-like families, a precarious arrangement that functioned in the absence of an actual government and for good or ill falling within the spheres of influence of other countries.The resulting social inequities permitted great wealth to exist side-by-side with conditions of abject poverty, and all may have continued indefinitely except for the mass displacement of Palestinian refugees by a militant Israel after 1948 and the rise of militant Shiism that came with the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979. When scattered skirmishes among armed groups exploded into full-scale civil war, the author argues, there was nothing to stop the collapse of all order. Intervention by Israel and Syria, the UN and the US merely confounded the tangled objectives of the combatants, while escalating their brutality and further polarizing those caught without mercy in the crossfire.Reading this book is like watching a train wreck in slow motion. Calamity follows upon calamity with the inevitability of Greek tragedy. While it ends in 1988, when it was first published, the author's account of the rise of Islamist-inspired Hizbollah points directly to events that fill the news 20 years later. This is an excellent primer for readers who want to understand the continual bloodshed in this tiny country - once called the Switzerland of the Middle East. Mackey writes fluidly and coherently, enlivening her historian's distance with a journalist's on-the-ground observations of key moments, public figures, and the miseries and sufferings of unnamed noncombatants. There are extensive notes, a lengthy bibliography, and a helpful index."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"If you already know about the civil war in Lebanon then this book is a wonderful way to get a different perspective. It is not a comprehenisve study of the wars."},{"Title":"Lebanon, Death of a Nation","review":"This book is an easy read, and very simple to understand. I felt depressed reading through it, but this is the harsh truth of what was really happening. I recommend the book to all those who would like to have a basic understanding of the complicated situation in Lebanon, and how internal and external interventions turned the country upside down.I *love* the fact that Sandra is trying to analyze the mentality and the psychology of the Lebanese mind, and its effects, which in my opinion could give a lot of answers about the chaos that was (is) happening there. I haven't seen any other book that deals with the psychology and the social behavior of the Lebanese (If you know about one, I would be happy to read).I hope to see a secular Lebanon, away from a cancer called religion and sectarianism, that deludes people and make them do crazy things.

I also had no idea about the involvment of Israel and Palestine.I won't lie though, parts of the book are dry and probably go into too much detail. While I did enjoy reading the majority of the book, I actually did fall asleep while reading it once. Still, I would recommend this book"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"OK. I have now read Al Franken and Bozell. I find both books to be of similar value; which is to say no value. If you are a conservative then you will find lots to agree with in Bozell's book. You will also find much that you need to ignore. Franken's book is only slightly worse.The first problem that I have with both books is the evidence they use. They often use evidence that is either annecdotal or case study. Anecdotal evidence has always been known to be of little value; furthermore, any researcher will tell you that case study research, while popular on both sides of the political spectrum, is only one half-step from anecdotal evidence. Also regarding evidence, both books use studies generated by think tanks, which is also problematic. Left or Right think-tanks have an answer they are looking for, and they then search for the evidence to 'prove' their result, which they derived before they started. Both sides hurl studies and statictics at us, with the all too common effect of making Joe Six-Pack feel more faith and passion in football reporting.Second, these authors both are so biased that anything they say is bound to be bogus. In this sense I will give the edge to Franken because his book's title gives readers a chance to see his bias immediately. I find that Bozell is reluctant to dismiss his authority directly, although he implies his impartiality in almost every paragraph. I do think that Bozell is onto something when he states that he is dicsussing 'newsrooms' not 'news programs,' though not in the way he intended. Bozell, begrudingly and indirectly, concedes that conservatives dominate talk shows and programs, while liberals dominate the news reporting. Bozell decries this as unacceptable, but really, doesn't that seem like a fair trade to you?Third, both men are ignorant reagrding basic economics (or perhaps not). Economics is widely depedant upon statistics, and statictics can submitted and omitted to paint a ugly or pretty picture. Economic statistics are not meant to taken in part. As one example (the quickest one to explain), Bozell uses medain income as proof in the 1980s of the economic success of the Reagan years. Any time you see the words 'average' or 'median,' perks your ears because you are about to be deceived. If Bill Gates moves into your neighborhood, your nieghborhood's median income just went through the roof and you are not any richer. It is possible for median income to rise while the majority gets poorer. Franken, on the other hand will point to huge deficts for future generations to pay off, while ignoring the potential benefits and successes that accompany them. Remember Hoover, \\"all I want is for someone to find me a one-handed economist.\\"In conclusion, this book is the conservative version of Al Franken. Franken is more fun (he did write for SNL for eons), while Bozell's book attempts to be more factual. Both books are biased in the extreme. Both books can be completley dismanted, paragraph by paragraph, if one had the time and energy. Both had an answer before they asked questions. Both books do a disservice to their political positions.The fact that both are unhappy with the media is the best endorsment for the media I have heard yet."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"I read this book when a relative left it in my bathroom during a visit. My eyes almost got stuck in the back of my head as many times as they rolled.Simply put those with money are the ones with power and are the ones who control the media (get a clue it is not the liberals.) Sinclair would be a good example of right-winged media conglomerates in control. They wont allow the names of soldiers who have given their lives to this country to be read on their stations - what a slap in the face. The Smith brothers (Sinclair) would not want us to realize just how real this war is. The reality of the situation may make us look at Bush a little differently.Then they have the nerve to run an hour long anti-Kerry commercial questioning his service to this country? They should remember Bush stayed as far away as possible from Vietnam shaking in his shoes. Why does the media keep forgeting this!Why is it that over 80% of Bush supporters believe that the U.S. has found WMDs in Iraq? Could it be that our right-winged media fed that to us and never corrected themselves?Anyways ...the book gets one star for being so useful when we ran out of toilet paper."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Brent Bozell takes aim at the so-called liberal media, but misses his target. The problem is apparent early: Bozell is so far right-wing that even Fox News is not \\"conservative\\" to him. Of course the media is \\"liberal\\" to someone like Bozell. Bozell picks quotes at random from journalists trying to prove his premise. This gotcha approach is less than convincing.What are the real facts? The right has Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Times, all of talk radio; yet they cannot stop whining about the \\"liberal media.\\" The press was far tougher on Gore then they were on Bush, despite Bozell's weak attempts to deny this fact. And Brent, if the media is liberal, why did they not question Bush's false claims of Iraq's WMDs? A truly independent press would have probably stopped the war by exposing Bush's lies on Iraq. Furthermore, a truly liberal press would have torn apart the lies of the so-called Swift Boat Vets. The bottom line is that the media is simply not as liberal as Bozell would have you believe.The real problem with the media is simple. It is not that that the media is too liberal or for that matter conservative, it is that it is too reliant on the government sources for information,e.g. Judith Miller's reporting on Iraq's alleged WMD's in the New York Times. Bozell's book simply misses the mark."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"This argument is useful for one thing: fueling a nice little cottage publishing industry, telling the same old story with all its 'irrefutable' evidence.The media is liberally biased? Even engaging in this discussion betrays a simple understanding of what the media in the US really is. Perhaps people still believe that the news is always objective, and balanced, or even that it should be.The American corporate media shares the interest of its owners, its advertisers, and ultimately of the state. The intellectuals and commentators it hires and features make a living justifying actions with impressive rhetoric and lofty terms. That's their job. The media is not liberal or conservative by nature, or by control. It is an arm of state power. Do liberals work in the media? Yes. Do conservatives work in the media? Yes. Is one man throwing the switch in an underground bunker for CNN in favor of 'liberals'? No. Does Rupert Murdoch invent stories every night for Fox News? No.This argument is very popular, and for good reason. You'll never get a straight answer, you'll hardly ever get a discussion WITHIN the media about how they themselves operate. Therefore, you can continue to bandy it about, point fingers, and hold up 'irrefutable evidence' of how biased the media is.Does the media betray bias? Uh, yes. It is biased largely toward state power, and will frequently line up with the interests of the people who own it and who pay for it. Cable news and newspapers do not sell news; they don't make money writing 'liberal' stories. They sell their audiences to the powerful advertisers who pay them, which is how they operate, at a very basic level.You can sit there and document the examples of liberal thought in the press, and find many. Or you can document the examples where the press is mysteriously silent or is subordinate to their controlling interests, something that will tell you far more about the media than how many stories about Bush's military record appear in the New York Times or about how many commentators criticize John Kerry on cable. The most laughable arguments frequently occur WITHIN the media, when they point fingers at each other, trying to assert that another news source is NOT fair and balanced.This certainly does not justify what the media does. In fact, they deserve much blame for their practices, which serve to indoctrinate the public by and large, and ensure the people have little to no real power on major issues. Is it 'liberal' that we are bombarded with useless information about Scott Peterson? Or Kobe Bryant? Or obsessed over the trial of an obviously guilty ex-football star? Or what candidate goes to church more often? Does the media keep people interested in the wrong things because evil liberals work there? Or do they serve a function for the state and for the maintenence of power?"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Sorry Limbaugh boy, but calling the media liberal even when it supports rightwing lunatics is nothing more than blissful ignorance.

The arguments presented in this book read more as personnal commentary and criticism than actual analysis. This is one persons opinion. Despite the claim that the book is based on research, there is no research data given. Anecdote and perception are used in place of rigorous analysis.I do believe that there are biases throughout the media, and the business world. Yes, Dan Rather and others are liberal democrats. But, by the same token, the popularity of Limbaugh, Coulter, O'Reilly, Libby and the Fox News Network (the number one watched news media - and very conservative), shows that there is balance. In fact, research, actual research, regarding the coverage of the Afghan and Iraq wars shows that the media had a conservative bias in coverage.So I have this message for Mr. Bozell and all the neocons: there is no liberal biased media, liberals do not hate this country. In fact, we are on to you and your ilk: there is a conservative conspiracy to engage the country in a divisive debate over fictious perceived injustices, over ownership of &quot;morals&quot; - all to distract the public from the REAL conservative agenda, which is to enrich the already wealthy at the expense of the middle class and poor.If one would like to spend time thinking about the issue of conservative versus liberal politics, I suggest that you read &quot;What's the matter with Kansas ?&quot; by Thomas Frank, or any book by Al Franken or Michael Moore, along with books by O'Reilly, Limbaugh and Coulter - and then make up your own mind.I have done just that, and based on this I have become a liberal democrat - after having voted for G.W.

I studied every word looking for some little corner of truth or decency, insight or understanding, and it was a tremendous waste of time. Ideologically, the book is no more and no less than a quagmire of corruption and deceit. The only accuracy anywhere is the title, which defines the contents quite well.This book, as well as the novelty imprint \\"Crown Forum\\" which \\"published\\" (vanity printed?) it, and the oft cited \\"Media Research Center\\", are all products of the same foul cesspool. Spindoctoring is one thing, but the kind of purely false propagandizing that flows from this waste pipe would make Herr Goering proud.The \\"Media Research Center,\\" along with other dangerous and hate-driven radical totalitarian organizations like the \\"Conservative Communications Center\\" and the \\"Conservative Victory Committee\\" are actually the mutant would-be brainchildren of L. Brent Bozell 3, yet he carefully avoids mentioning that he is founder and president of the MRC, instead he attempts to cite it as a valid source. Supreme corruption.So instead of wasting time pointing out the thousands of factual and philosophical absurdities presented in this sad tome, I will comment only on its literary merits.There are none.The first three-quarters of the book is a ridiculous, and profoundly boring, laundry list of spun statistics. I don't mean the same old boring dreck of a backwards-thinking inbred pundit, I mean boring raised to an art form, boring utilized as a weapon system, a skull-scraping boredom that plunges one into a deep, dreamless grog from which one awakens achingly tired and unrefreshed. The kind of boring that makes you long for the excitement of watching an old dog drool. A depth of boring that stunts the brain and corrodes the soul. Really, it is just not interesting. At all.The last quarter, which you can be sure L.Brent Bozell 3 assumed no normal person could reach, is made up of a series of op-ed style tracts so vile and so poorly written that I felt like I was wading through the ideological offal of an eight year old raised by a deep woods militia. One should realize that this is, after all, L. Brent Bozell 3's target market.Though the book is subtitled \\"the coming meltdown of the liberal media\\", there is no hint of any such thesis until the last three pages! After 259 pages of utter tripe! I would flunk any 6th grade student that presented such shoddy organization and ignorance of the rules of logic. And his big case? Fox News Uber Alles! Seig Heil!I love to read, and read an average of 100 pages per day, but this hateful Sominex between hardcovers tortured me for the three brutally painful weeks it took to slog through it. A few pages, and your brain screams that it is time for a coma or a migraine. If you press forward, expect both.I would recommend this junk to someone that is actually titillated by the violent hate and lies offered by Rush the Limbaugh, but finds Rush's bloated redundancies to be too enervating. Here, what L. Brent Bozell 3 tries to pass off as \\"narrative\\" is so slow, the language and style so devoid of language and style, that one is forced to consume the toxic lies and hypocrisy of the radical right at the rate of a receding glacier. It is pacing designed to appeal only to a Limbaugh-like couch spud strung out on hillbilly heroin.If this is you, enjoy!

Early in his career he was brash, bold, unconventional and exciting. Later he was called difficult, out-of-touch and lacking sympathy for ordinary people. The change? Campbell switched parties, going from Democrat to Republican. Though his voting record didn't vary, the media account of him did. This singular event, thoughtfully examined tells you everything you need to know about today's modern media. Thankfully, we have LOTS more examples due to the fine work of Brent Bozell and his Media Research Center. They are the authority on analyzing and categorizing the leftist tilt of the national news media. In the last 15 years both the Congress and Presidency have been held by each major party, yet the way the media attributes credit or blame to each somehow varies. When there was a budget impasse in 1990 it was Bush's fault, when again in 1995 it was Newt Gingrich and the GOP Congress' fault.Of course much more than Congress is covered here. Nearly every social and cultural issue that can be politicized is examined. One of the most damning studies involves media labeling. Did you know you can be a Republican with a view on abortion shared by 51% of Americans and be labeled &quot;extreme right&quot;? Not coincidentally, your liberal counterpart can hold truly extreme positions advocating government funded abortion on demand and be labeled a &quot;moderate.&quot; In fact if you had a nickel for every time the national media used a term like &quot;extreme left&quot; you might, with a little luck, one day own a nickel.Economic studies are also devastating. The U.S. economy has not been recession for 2 years, and for nearly a year our economy has been growing at the hottest pace in 20 years. Despite this, the people whom the media inform still think the economy is IN recession. If you were a journalist, should you not be ashamed that people are so uninformed about such a vital fact? Not our national media, who don't mind misleading Americans about the state of our nation so long as it hurts Bush.Bozell names names and tells it like it is in reporter's own words and exhaustive media studies. The 2004 race will be nasty, and the media has their job cut out for them in getting a democrat into the White House. Kerry doesn't have Clinton's charm and blarney so the press will be in turbo-mode to attack Bush and push Kerry. The media inform the public and characterize the state of the world -- such as with the state of our economy -- and are thus far more important to the state of society than ANY elected official. Read this book. Understand how those who control and disseminate information affect the nation and our future. This year it is as important as ever."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"I just finished this book and logged on to write a review about it. I previously wrote a review of Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman, written by my friend Steven Travers, so I checked it out. I was amazed to see all kinds of negative reviews of this book, which sold well and even won an award, I think. Then I read these reviews further and discovered that none of it had anything to do with Steve's book. It turns out Steve writes reviews of books and movies on Amazon himself. Like me, he is pretty conservative. He wrote some reviews about Michael Moore, books and documentaries by him, a few about him, etc.Anyway, the stuff Travs wrote about Moore was not real flattering of Moore, but it looked to be researched and was basically within the framework of the stuff a lot of people write and say about Moore, who is pretty controversial either way you cut the mustard. It turns out somebody turned the Moore supporters on to Steve, how I'm not sure, but they all decided to give a bunch of negative, fake reviews of Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman. Lord, I could not believe some of the stuff people were saying about my friend. Terrible reviews. One stars. Calling him a liar, claiming all kinds of untruths about him, and the Bonds book had nothing to do with politics. One clown apparently wrote more than one of the reviews, and when I looked at other reviews I saw this dingleberry shadowing Steve's reviews, sort of the way a kid repeats what another kid says on a schoolyard. The guy looks like he has several aliases or something and gives Steve &quot;unhelpful&quot; votes even when Steve gives the best review in the lot.Is this the way the left operates? This book by Bozell details these kinds of tactics, and wouldn't you know that here it is, up front and personal. These people just hide and do hit-and'runs. Steve puts his name and email address up there like a man. If you like him or not, and he's opinionated so you might not like him, you know who he is and what he stands for. These people are cowards. This is what Bozell talks about. These people used to have all the power in this country, but not anymore. The way they deal with their lack of popularity is so telling. Just shut up or, if you have anything to say, be up front about it.The mainstream media wants us to believe they are just reporting the news, but it is filled with bias. Conservatives stand right up and identify themselves and say, &quot;Here I am, this is who I am, agree or disagree.&quot; Judging from recent elections and ratings, most people agree.These liberals are so...untruthful."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"This book covers the well documented shift in the media over the last decade. At some point, and it's hard to tell exactly when, the media evolved to be politically biased. The objectivity the previous generation grew up with was replaced by increasingly obvious attempts to make and impact the news through political labels, and clearly biased language and news coverage.Much of this book covers issues well documented elsewhere, most notably in Goldberg's expose \\"Bias\\", wherein Goldberg describes how the CBS team became little more than paid Liberal spokesmen. So, as a few other reviewers have mentioned, the overall effect of this book is that is feels a bit dated. However, if you have not previously read or studied this issue, then this book is a great place to start.The topics are organized into three sections. The first, The Real Source of Bias, covers the fact that the vast majority of those in media positions simply see the world through their own lens and project that outward, often without realizing it. Section two depicts how many of the significant moral and ethical issues of our time are increasingly presented with a slant far to the Left. So when election results and polls that show the American public is no where near at the level of alignment with how the media elite would have us believe, the media seem genuinely surprised. The key issues include abortion, the environment, religion, gay rights, gun control, and others. The final section looks at some of the most egregious depictions of bias, including the hilariously biased coverage by the networks in the 2000 Presidential election.The book is so well documented it would be impossible to start quoting some of the hundreds of quotes and evidence of this media shift, and represent the book. I will say that those who may find themselves on the far left politically or socially may not want to read this, as the book itself is, ironically, biased against that end of the political spectrum.Overall, easy to read, fascinating and well documented information, but perhaps a bit dated. Recommended for those who have an interested in better understanding why and how the media became so obsessed with being the news, instead of reporting it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"That there is a strong liberal bias in the mainstream media may be no surprise to you but, after reading Brent Bozell's \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\", you'll never watch another ABC/CBS/NBC/CNN story, or read the front page of the New York Times, Washington Post, etc., without recalling this hard-hitting expose. Backed by exhaustive research, Bozell recounts case-after-case backed by statistic- after-statistic of how the media distorts the news to promote their biased points-of-view. The media elite, Bozell correctly contents, sanctimoniously assumes the exalted position of America's cultural and moral arbiter and watchdog, positioning minority views as mainstream. Meanwhile, conservatives are consistently labeled and derided -blatantly or more subtlety - while liberals and liberal causes are given a free pass. But more than simply distorting the news as reported, Bozell cites numerous examples - the 2000 Presidential Election, Elian Gonzalez, the war of terrorism - where the media actually influences events rather than simply reporting them. \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\" takes head-on the ludicrous claims of Al Franken and Eric Altman that there is in fact a conservative bias to the news. Not that further proof is needed, but the recent CBS \\"memo gate\\" debacle, and the even more recent ABC memo clearly instructing favorable coverage for Kerry at Bush's expense, again validates the truth of Bozell's words.Fast moving, well paced, and well written, this is still a frustrating book. Frustrating in the sense that, despite gains by cable channels like Fox News, alternative press like The Washington Times and The New York Post, and more balanced news accessible on the Internet, the old media still maintains a stranglehold on much of America's audience, shaping thought and opinion to coincide with the minority views of the media establishment. While Bozell ends with a chapter describing the growth in alternate news channels coming at the expense of the old guard, and the \\"meltdown\\" of the Liberal Media, one can only hope that change comes before irreparable harm in done."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"L. Brent Bozell's \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media\\" arrived on the scene long before the recent revelations linking CBS news to documents, since revealed as counterfeit, impugning President Bush's National Guard record. Too bad. The author could have written his book on this issue alone. Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, spends his days investigating incidents of media bias. Not surprisingly, the bias he uncovers is decidedly liberal in scope. This conclusion is no surprise to me or to millions of other Americans who have known for years that news outlets like CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, Time Magazine, and dozens of other purportedly \\"balanced\\" sources of news absolutely reek of left wing favoritism. What else could you expect? The employees at these places consist primarily of graying baby boomers; those spoiled, insolent brats whose existence has been a pox on our country for four decades. Not every baby boomer is a problem let alone a frothing at the mouth radical, of course, but the ones who are unfortunately decided to pursue careers in the public spotlight and never tire of giving the rest of us headaches. Bozell's book excoriates these capering clowns, nearly all of which we know all too well.Actually, I shouldn't call these fire breathers clowns since what Bozell explains to us in the book is deadly serious business, touching every aspect of our lives as well as influencing the nation's future. \\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\" begins with a survey of recent literature dealing with media bias. The usual suspects appear--Al Franken, Dan Rather, Peter Jennings, Eric Alterman, and Joe Conason--all of whom scoff at the idea that the mainstream media support left wing agendas. In fact, some of these guys argue that the media have a right wing bias, citing such incidents as the 2000 election to bolster their claims. Nonsense, argues Bozell, who then sets out to prove how time and again the media mandarins set the agenda. How do they do it? You already know. It's how Katie Couric sighs when interviewing a conservative figure, or the eye rolling and tone of exasperation when a reporter or interviewer must deal with one of those clueless right wing evildoers. It's the unabashed gushing, giggling, and general sycophancy whenever Hillary and Bill Clinton roll into the studio for another round of self-promotion. It's labeling news stories with the tag \\"conservative\\" as a signal for sinister activities while left leaning organizations and figures get a pass. It's often just not covering stories at all if the left will suffer as a result.Bozell sees these things happening repeatedly in coverage of the Clinton presidency, gun control, the economy, abortion rights, religion, and the environment. Stories of major import receive coverage based solely on their relevancy to pre-conceived left wing agendas. The media always support pro-environmental activism even though the science behind the blathering is often crackpot. If you're a Christian, forget about getting a fair shake from the mainstream media; they despise the Catholic Church and conservative protestant denominations for having the temerity to actually oppose certain behaviors. The gall! Where the book really shines, though, are the chapters covering the horrors of the Clinton regime and the travesty that was Election 2000. Bozell proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Slick Willy and Red Hilly received favorable treatment from the media during those scandal plagued years. Sure, the media threw a few punches over the whole Lewinsky incident, but other more sinister scandals dropped out of the headlines never to return (if they got their in the first place). Even worse than the eight-year lovefest accorded the Clintons was the disaster of the last presidential election. Bozell indicts the media with nothing less than creating a constitutional crisis because their man Gore didn't win the election.\\"Weapons of Mass Distortion\\" concludes with a thoughtful analysis of the coming implosion of the liberal media. According to Bozell, the proliferation of alternative media on both television and the Internet presents a serious threat to business as usual at CBS, NBC, ABC, and all the rest. Viewers are defecting in droves to search out less ideologically driven news sources, forcing the big outlets to adapt to the change by adding conservative voices to their staffs. Most continue to resist the looming disaster, steadfastly standing by the old \\"we're not biased\\" mantras that served them so well for decades. Bozell says they do so at their own risk. The world is a constantly changing, dangerous place that can no longer support the slanted viewpoints of a coterie of wealthy liberal media celebrities (who are predominantly white, by the way, a fact that seems lost on these people even as they brand other institutions as racist and exclusive).If I had a problem with the book, it is the omission of Hollywood as a prime force of liberal media. I realize Bozell wanted to focus on news organizations, but we cannot forget that Tinseltown disseminates most of the left wing propaganda we see and hear. As bad as Rather, Jennings, Brokaw, and the rest of the motley crew is, they don't hold a candle to the poison oozing out of California. It's gotten so bad that I have to shut my mind off whenever the extreme left wing themes pop up in a movie or show. If I didn't, I couldn't watch most of the stuff produced in the last twenty years! Bozell's book is a good read, although I don't see it changing anyone's mind. Liberals will continue to deny bias while conservatives gnash their teeth in frustration. By all means give it a shot."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"No matter what our political persuasions happen to be, the news media and its biases are important to us, because that's where most of us get our information. If most of the people reporting the news lean one way politically, that is important news in itself and Mr. Bozell makes it clear that most media people and organizations lean to the left. Who owns a media outlet is irrelevant. What is important is how the media outlet slants the news. Most of them slant it left. Mr. Bozell proves it. Read this book and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"I purchased this book at a Brent Bozell book-signing event in our area. I got mine signed and then started reading it immediately. It reads fast and is a pleasure from end-to-end. The personal stories make the book fun to read, and the well researched facts proves beyond a doubt that liberal bias exists in the media. Bozell has been in the media and was a pioneer in researching bias in the media. He is a well respected and most informed person to date to author a book on this subject."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Liberal news media bias has been discussed since the early days of the Nixon administration. One book from that era - possibly written by Raymond Price - emphasized that near-unanimous liberal bias was a \\"conformity, not a conspiracy\\".Well, things are much worse today. Liberal media moguls really do conspire now, even if there are some cracks in the wall.Brent Bozell sure does have timing - a ticka ticka ticka ticka.His book on liberal media bias appears to have been finished before the onset of the current political campaigns and was probably timed for release toward the end of an election year. But only in Bozell's dreams could it have come out at roughly the same time that Dan Rather and the honchos at CBS got caught with their pants down trying to use forged documents to do the nasty to George W. Bush.As if that weren't enough, this book also coincides with Matt Drudge's unearthing of the memo written by ABC Political Director Mark Halperin to his staff, which virtually amounted to a \\"how-to\\" campaign manual for the Kerry candidacy.Liberals and leftists are forever using the fiction of opposition and identity with the underdog for self-promotion. So they don't respond very well when they are in control and are loathe to acknowledge actually being in control, preferring to manufacture opposition and oppression.Most liberals deny that there is, in fact, a liberal news media bias, but this is nothing more than pseudo-sophisticated flat-earthism. Even without the two aforementioned recent examples, one would have to be living in a cave not to see how the mainstream media has been co-opted as another arm of the Kerry campaign. This reviewer, by the way, is not voting for either Bush or Kerry.Bozell starts out very strongly - hitting on the head all of the arguments that are conventionally used to bely the existence of liberal news media bias: 1) what about conservative commentators/talk-radio? 2) the news media is owned by corporate conglomerates 3) not ALL conservatives believe in the boogeyman and 4) look how mean everyone was to poor old Al Gore.But as the book advances, Bozell often makes the same mistake that liberals make when raising the talk-radio red herring. His response to argument (1) is appropriate: there is a difference between openly-ideological commentators who overtly seek to persuade (some are conservative and some are liberal) and reporters who try to disguise biased commentary as objective analysis (almost monolithically liberal).Yet much of Bozell's criticism is directed towards morning-show personalities such as Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric, who seem to be his favorite targets. They're both leftist, mean-spirited, and mentally-challenged fluff-deliverers, but no one regards them as anything other than commentators.Still, Bozell never wanders that far from the target - reinforcing the standard analyses of media slant delivered by Rothman and Lichter, by Bernard Goldberg in his own book on the subject, and by Bozell's Media Research Center. He also provides a wealth of anecdotal evidence of liberal double standards that will make your blood boil.Having said all that, I think that it's over-simplistic to analyze news media using a pure left-right dichotomy. Media is at least as woman-centered as it is liberal-centered. The two concepts are often synonymous: what passes for liberal ideology today is largely emotion-centered (i.e., female) pap. That explains the sentiment for gun control, where logic and objective analysis tend to show that it doesn't work.But the news media isn't always as anti-gun as Bozell thinks. Yeah, they USUALLY cover gun stories from a Million-Soccer-Mom-March earth-mother perspective, ranting against bad men with guns. But when the discussion turns to FEMALE ownership of guns, guns don't seem so bad. These stories are inevitably written from a female-empowerment perspective.Women shooting men doesn't sound particularly \\"liberal\\", but clearly women are virtuous whether they seek to eliminate guns or shoot men, who, of course, are never virtuous. This is just one example of a women-good/men-bad mindset that dominates media and popular culture and actually trumps conventional leftism.Bozell expresses optimism that the wall of liberal news media bias is being torn down. He bases this cheerfulness on public skepticism about news sources, the emergence of Fox News as an alternative source, and the strength of conservative philosophy.Amazingly enough, as recently as this book was completed, Bozell does NOT anticipate the blogocracy that brought Dan Rather to his knees. Conservative publications are now bubbling with the proliferation of web-page addresses of pajama-clad warriors looking for fresh game. Hugh Hewitt is their Schwarzkopf, and THESE are probably the best weapons against the liberal overlords that rule mainstream media.Beyond that, I think that Bozell is somewhat nave. The human mind is very easily fooled and people do not have to BELIEVE what they are receiving from mainstream media in order to find themselves acting on it.Fox News might be more balanced, but Rupert Murdoch is too sordid and Fox's entertainment programming is filled with as much filth as that of its competitors. Fox's emergence as a fourth network hasn't exactly spawned a rebirth of wholesome entertainment. Clearly, Fox is not a reliable conservative warhorse.And as for conservative philosophy, it is indeed more well-grounded in nature and logic than is liberalism. That's not proof that it's going to prevail against a still-entrenched liberal mainstream media and pop culture. As a conservative, Bozell shouldn't be such a happy warrior in the face of such opposition. Conservative philosophy requires one to walk a straight and narrow path but is cognizant of flaws in human nature that make it unlikely that many people will do so.When Whittaker Chambers moved from left to right, he declared that he was joining the losing side. Bozell forgets that to be a conservative is to have a wry pessimistic sense of humor grounded in a fatalistic view that the life of a conservative in the libertine West is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"It is easy to argue bias in either direction, and thoughtfully excluding examples of the counterpoint does not help the author's position.However, the author does raise some specifics which largely go ignored or unanswered in most of today's press.A sad era has come upon us, in that today's corporately-controlled pseudo-news infotainment outlets pass themselves off as &quot;voices crying in the wilderness&quot; or some other such nonesense - and a signifcant portion of the US population take the media at their word without doing one moment's worth of research on their own. The condition of today's press is our fault alone.The phrase below is not original - but I do not recall it's origin, it shocked me long ago when I once believed that news anchors and reporters actually reported instead of developed the news:&quot;The Media: Forging reality from preconceived editorial notion&quot;Far too appropriate today."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"This book may actually deserve four stars. But I spent many years in journalism myself, so to me most of Bozell's revelations are old news.Among general readers his insights may prompt an epiphany. Even conservatives will be surprised, not at his examples of slanted coverage (they deal with that every day), but at his exposure of the roots of bias: the sanctimony and visceral anger that animate many individual 'mainstream' journalists. Bozell documents credibly that if there's a stronghold of white male rage in America, it's our newsrooms - not our trailer parks or gun clubs.He fails, however, to explore the single most important strategem by which reporters and editors distort the news: the selective omission of key background information. Hence, articles on gun control regularly allude to the wholesale British gun ban. But most carefully avoid mention of the explosion of violent crime in the UK that followed the ban, much of it still committed with - you guessed it - guns.Another example: Reporting on the federal budget regularly highlights Democrat complaints that 'tax cuts caused the deficit.' But 'mainstream' reporters rarely mention that such complaints are utterly baseless; that sweeping tax cuts have, on the contrary, caused sharp revenue growth every time they've been implemented - under Kennedy, Reagan and now Bush II. Nor do they explore the competing theories among serious economists over why (NOT whether) this happens.Despite my grumbling, buy this book! Unless you're some kind of bleeding-heart PC girly-man lightweight, you would spend more at happy hour ... or on a carton of smokes ... or a morning at the range (depending, of course, on what caliber ammo you shoot)."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"With all the complaining about conservative reporting, I was happy to get another view. Of course, the content is well written, and well backed up.An excellent, insightful, and truth-telling read!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"For those with any doubt that the mainstream media (MSM) is dying or, better yet, why it is dying, Brent Bozell puts those doubts to rest. Rush Limbaugh's audience of twenty million is almost as big as the CBS, NBC, and ABC evening news audience -- combined. Tom Brokaw \`ascended' to number one among the big three during his time by letting the size of his audience decline at a slower ate than did Peter Jennings and Dan Rather. The good news is that Rather is leaving; the bad news is that Katie Couric may be taking his place.Having defined the left side of American political thought and values as the center, it is easy to see how every smug MSM anchor, pundit, and columnist (few of them have the skills, balance or professionalism to be a real journalist; they are talking heads, entertainers, and armchair \`experts') thinks that he or she represents the bright, center of the spectrum. Bozell dissects these \`enlightened' positions on abortion, gay rights, taxes, the environment, and guns, allowing the MSM's own words to destroy what little credibility they ever could have claimed to possess. Then Bozell takes on Bill and Hillary, Janet Reno's seizure of Elian Gonzalez, the \`disputed' 2000 election (it was those same dim network bulbs who said the Florida polls were closed and that Gore had won, when they weren't and he wasn't), and the war on terror. Maureen Dowd repeatedly shows her own special form of ignorance and hypocrisy, but she has a lot of company.The counterargument from the left, from Eric Alter, Al Franken, Michael Moore and their ilk, is quickly dispatched with cogent rebuttals. Even the advent of Air America, failure that it is, can be seen as a conservative triumph, as the liberal moguls pour money into a no-win situation. It's the audience, stupid!The basic problem is that the MSM critique, promote and reward themselves, with a tin ear for facts and for their audience. Brokaw claims that no one would listen to him if her were perceived as being biased. Well, he is and they aren't. His shrinking audience is fewer than 9 million in a country of almost 300 million. The audience is voting with their ears, their eyes and their pocketbooks, and then showing up at the polls and not on the MSM's Nielson ratings. And the result is a self-congratulatory, barely ambulatory MSM, withering away. Good riddance."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"***NOTE: The person who composed the Publisher's Weekly review for Amazon about this book mistakenly refers to best-selling author Bernard Goldberg as \\"tilting-Right.\\" That is patently false, as anyone who has done their homework knows. Goldberg is liberal and proud of it...and he is that rare liberal reporter who has integrity.***Now, onto Bozell's book...since Bozell wrote this book, recent events have certainly vindicated his premise, that the mainstream media is not only dominated by Left-leaning newsfolk, but that many have an agenda to distort and destroy the records and credibility of Right-leaning politicians. Bozell has done a tremendous public service with his meticulous research and eloquent presentation of his case. This book makes Liberal apologists like Eric Alterman and Al Franken look foolish, ill-informed, and manipulative indeed."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Until Bernard Goldberg in BIAS publicized the extent of left wing bias in the mass media, most Americans had been blissfully unaware even of its existence. In WEAPONS OF MASS DISTORTION, Brent Bozell goes one step further. He not only documents the pervasiveness of left media bias but he also refutes the left response that the bias is from the right. Bozell notes that this bias is not the result of a smoky back room cabal where leftist kingpins plot the destruction of George Bush. Rather, he sees this bias as a world view in which the liberal left sees American society, mores, and institutions through the filtered lens of a mindset that labels itself as moderate, regardless of what poll indicates the opposite. Further, if there is any objective proof that suggests that President Bush is on the right course with the economy, Iraq, the Supreme Court, or any of the other hot button issues that divide the two parties, then the media will simply ignore such proof and act as if the left's objections and vicious spleen at Bush are eminently justified. Thus, the mass media's attitude is to verbally Tar and Feather the right, being secure in the knowledge that the American voters are basically too dumb to note the difference.However, Bozell indicts the left with a many sided accusation ranging from reported and distorted acts of commission to unreported acts of omission. Bozell, because of his association with the Media Research Center, a group that tracks bias in the media, has uncovered some interesting statistics that bear out his claim that as far as the left is concerned, idealogues like Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Howard Dean, Al Gore, and Dan Rather are \\"moderates,\\" and therefore mainstream. Anyone who opposes such moderates are labelled \\"extremist,\\" and thus out of the mainstream. Bozell zeroes in on a number of issues, all of which encompass the leftist world view that the best of all governments is mass socialism and the best of all Americans are alumni of the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. His most telling point is that it is the left's fascination with pressure groups that drives the Democratic party. When Michael Shephard, a gay American was murdered in the midst of Republican mid west America, the New York Times ran front page stories for weeks about how alleged right induced intolerance for gays was the driving culprit. Yet, when thirteen year old Jessie Dirkhising was similarly murdered in a Democratic eastern state by a pair of gay men, the silence from the left was deafening. Clearly, Bozell points out, murder is not unlike real estate--location is everything. Bozell also faces counter claims by Eric Alterman and Al Franken that bias is indeed manifest, but it comes solely from the right. When both Alterman and Franken shout that Gore was pummeled by the media for his many gaffes, Bozell responds by proving this pummeling was far more muted than is now being leveled at Bush for his gaffes. What becomes clear after reading Bozell and Bernard Goldberg is that the way America, through its media, sees itself is the way that America will judge its leaders, its future, and ultimately itself. And as long as the left is forcing America to wear a kaleidiscope, then America will be unable to see either world events with a dispassionate eye or itself with anything that resembles honesty."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"This book is useful for empirically documenting the relentless campaign of TV, newspapers and magazines in promoting the New Ideology and its pundits, but . . .The idea that the \\"liberal\\" (i.e. New Ideology) media is declining is not supported. Bozell points to the decline in viewership of TV news but then notes the increase in people getting their news from the Internet. First, he claims this as a victory for conservatives, then he admits that the usual media have set up their own websites and that their sites have by far the most viewers. Point: How does this add up to a decline? He does not give the relative numbers. Nor does he note that many other general-purpose sites (such as ISPs) have news on their sites and it is rigorously New-Ideological.Yes, there have been gains by Fox TV and talk radio, and people who want to have access to more than one point of view should be thankful for them. But to think that the news establishment is on its last legs is wishful thinking.Note: the point about using commentators and stars as examples. Bozell's mistake was to say that he wasn't going to use them. They probably have more effect that normal news, and should have been given more prominence.Note 2: The word \\"liberal\\". When are conservatives going to open their old textbooks and find out what that word means?! These people are anything but liberal! As has been documented many times, they are anti-liberal. The New Ideology developed out of liberalism thirty years ago, and the people still call themselves \\"liberals.\\" Hiding behind that label does not make them liberals. It is both an intellectual and a tactical mistake to call them \\"liberal.\\""},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"The questions that should be asked is \\"WHY\\" and \\"HOW\\" has the liberal media in America come to be controlled? And \\"WHO\\" is behind their acquisitions?The Bush adminstration got elected on its conserative platform, by convincing the public that the Republican Party is feeding on conservative roots. As conservative parties go, the current adminstration doesn't resemble its party's past, confirmed by their budgets submitted to Congress they appear to be left of the most liberal of former Democratic admistrations.The bottom line is that ALL of our Presidents are errand boys (liberal or conservative), no more than compromise figureheads with the unenviable job of simultaneously trying in some way to accommodate the brays of the \\"Business-Merchant-Manufacturing\\" class who generally tend to be nationalist and provincial, while kowtowing on pain of media death to the imperatives of the much more powerful, vastly more wealthy, and far more sophisticated Anglo-American Aristocracy, who of course are the \\"internationalists.\\" Anyone who blames them for their policies doesn't understand the job description.To add to the politicians' problems, the American people are obviously divided into a majority of red-staters whose \\"common sense\\" tells them that their interests are better represented by \\"Main Street\\" than by \\"Wall Street\\", and a minority of blue-staters who are well-educated, which all too often means that they blindly follow the dictates of their pre-programmed political correctness -- a mind-set tightly orchestrated by the best of the best (but sadly bought and paid for) media manipulators and Ivy League opinion makers. Hence, anyone who for whatever twisted reasons wants to be elected President, must appear to tow the red state party line to keep the grass roots from going to seed, while in fact \\"secretly\\" following the \\"offer you can't refuse\\" dictates of the aristocrats who own the media and who can destroy them on a whim. Does it seem odd that the power structures who put these poor fools into office also on occasion orchestrate their destruction? Not at all, as ONLY the master can wield the whip!Indeed it is a very tough balancing act for any Republicrat, whether your name is Bush or Clinton.Remember (if you will), that our country was founded by Whigs who represented the business classes; and, who were nationalist and protectionist. The elite Republican class interests are more in alignment with the people who earned their money through free enterprise than for those whose far huger fortunes come with the name and title. But money doesn't talk it swears, and so the \\"Tories\\" really never went away, but rather took the names of, and imbedded themselves in, the \\"loyal\\" parties. Clearly they've gradually won the day, starting with Watergate, and are now consolidating their control over America. So let's not in any way confuse a free-trading, free-spending Tory from the Eastern Establishment like ANY Bush with the \\"conservative\\" movement of the nationalists, let alone with the mind-set of our Whig founding fathers.America's media has been bought and paid for by the elite, and over time has been converted to propagandize the advance of an agenda that was secretly founded in 1891, and further their quest for power and influence to be extended across the globe in fulfillment of their cause."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"In this book Bozell absolutely destroys the mainstream media.

I was shocked that I could not read a story or hear a single TV news station report the situation involving our own intelligence (who are supposed to be bi-partisan) and a memo circulating among them suggesting that they take their \\"one time only\\" shot at the president via an investigation. This investigation into Iraq or any situation or decision in which would bring the most upset was to be called for in the beginning of the year 2004, I would gather to make the most impact. Even more disturbing was the fact that they stated that they would take this \\"one time only\\" shot at President Bush regardless to the situation in Iraq, good or bad, going well or not, they would bring this to investigation and do so with a good deal of voice. The memos were distributed in our own intelligence and passed out and planned by and with democrats only. It was an outrage, being that we were in (and are) war time. They chose party over the good of our country and this memo, (and the fact that they did not deny this), was proof positive. And the day I heard of this, saw the fact and the democrats trying to make it less important than it was and the upset among the republicans in the department and was shocked. However, this news, although it was well known, did not make it to the media. This was not the only occurrence, this was not the only hidden news that I became aware of either.There has been documents theft, detailed documents from the military on Kerry and his reviews while on duty, (and they were horrid and explained why he was discharged, and it was not because of his purple hearts), and those documents were gone as fast as I read them. In CA., you had the top big wigs of the Democrat party showing up in support of one of the biggest crooks our state has seen, Gray Davis. He hid documents while running for office, had extremely suggestive ads (and proven outright lies and slanderous ones at a that) about his competitor and as our state sunk further and further the abyss, the democrats came out in force, Hillary, Bill, Gore, Al, Rev Jessie Jackson and more. They held rallies and tried to make the citizens of the state believe that the whole idea of Gray Davis's impeachment was a right wing plan to take over the white house by getting more power in CA., (highly unlikely considering the democrat counties are the most populated in the state and the majority of cities have republicans, who live in less dense populated areas). They stood there and got air time that was incredible. I could not believe that these people, the leaders of the party, were actually standing up there on their platforms and over the phone on the news and telling the people that Davis was a good governor and he was in essence just a target of the right wing conspiracy. I was in shock. Never have I seen such a display of political proliferations, media bias and out right lies by the leaders of one party to blame the overwhelming errors of their Greasy Davis democrat on the \\"other party\\". I could not believe it, (foot note: this tells you how little your democrat leaders care about the people in CA or the country - because if it comes down to winning an election, they will sell out their own families. They had no regard for the people who would live in CA and suffer for years from the likes of Davis, they had tunnel vision and the media was backing them in spades.Those are just a few stories, but there are many more in this book. If you are so blinded by your leaders in the liberal party and via the news and media, (and the NY Times and the LA Times) who are no doubt at all playing you into believing and thinking exactly what they want you to think, holding back info and telling suggestive stories and inflating them and small trivial things in order to obtain their seats in the go., you really need to get this book, read it with all the perspective you possibly can, and then learn something. These are filled with facts, especially compared to any book out there I have read, including Al Franklin's bashing. This book is not an attempt to bash anyone and doesn't really do so. It even suggests that those newscasters now in tat the news for being liberal and hurting the president, were good at what they did once... and this author attempts to be as bipartisan as possible, in an almost impossible situation to be bipartisan about... When you read this you will know what you are fed, led and now think, is not at all what you think. You may be outraged by the way you have been \\"taught\\" to think and \\"taught\\" to believe. I think that all the reviews I have read here who gave this book a one star and then whined about things totally not in the book, (and by the way, you are transparent on nearly even stupid review you enter... who are you trying to kid out there? You only look like a desperate party of cheats, and if that fits, wear it).Like I said, I knew of the problems, but did not halved such documented and thou gal evidence and documented facts that this author has. Now, it is up to us as a country and citizens, democrat and republican, to be outraged and demand the facts and just the facts alone and take back the truth. This will not happen if there remain those so close minded or pride filled that they cannot even write a real review or look at reality. This has to happen for all of us, and we need to join together and be outraged and demand truth in the news and papers. With partisan blinded eyes, this will not be possible... be outraged, you are fooled, do not let them continue to play us for the fools they take us for."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"I've wanted to be in radio news again since being fired by a radio station who had a liberal news director in 2000. But I wanted to go there to make more money and be there full-time. Needless to say it didn't work out and I blamed the left for it. I still blame the communzis for trying to destroy America and her press. Bozell pulls no punches and shows no sorrow in giving the left who run 90-95% of the commercial media and 100% of Public (NPR, etc) its comeuppance!I think the left runs radio and TV stations to only hire those who went through the indoctrinaiton into liberalism at any college in the country.I also am a member of Bozell's Parent's TV Council--now I'd like to see a liberal pantyweight FIRE MY you know what for that!!!COME ON, LEFT!!!

There will no meltdown of the liberal media because the conservatives DESPARATELY NEED the liberal media to survive to keep third party candidates off the ballot, and dupe the masses into believing that modern Liberalism and Conservatism are different political ideologies (they both came from the same philosophers, Hegel and Machiavelli). Writers such as Bozell, Liberal or Conservative are merely pawns of the Demopublican/Republicrat elitists. My suggestion is to read both Liberal and Conservative books and sort out the lies for yourself, don't just read one side."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"There are many books, written by both Democrats and Republicans, that are polemical, many of which are passionate in their defense of the author's viewpoint. This is such a book. Publisher's Weekly says of the author, L. Brant Bozell, that he allies himself with the \\"right tilting\\" Bernard Goldberg, author of Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News, a New York Times bestseller.The claim would be true, except for one small detail: Goldberg says, in his own book, that he has never voted for a Republican in his life.Bozell says, in this book, that he is not a registered Republican, either, although his uncle is William F. Buckley, Jr., the founder of National Review magazine, often referred to as \\"Mr. Conservative.\\" So there is little doubt where Bozell's sympathies lie.Brent Bozell is the founder of the Media Research Center. That organization has published several books, and is the largest media watchdog organization. This is the first book by Mr. Bozell, himself, however. He is often a guest on television talk shows: the kind where the guests try to shout each other down. He is a well-known critic of the media's left-wing bias and tendency to propaganda.This book mirrors, and reinforces, Goldberg's book, with its accusations of bias in media. Weapons of Mass Distortion details case after case, quotes from examples of highly partisan distortions of the news, and instances of several of televisions news anchors and reporters demonstrating their blatant bias.It covers the disparate treatment of George Bush vs. Al Gore, the pandering to Bill and Hillary Clinton compared to the hostile interviews and the vicious attacks on both presidents Bush and their policies, the National Rifle Association, the pro-life people, Rush Limbaugh, Newt Gingrich and others with whom the radical left disagrees, as opposed to the near sainthood attached to the pro-abortionists, radical environmentalists, people who adhere to an \\"alternate life-style,\\" animal rights activists, Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Earth First!, the feminist movement, and all of their other allies.Altogether, this is a book that will receive plaudits from conservatives and, no doubt, jeers from the left.As a conservative, I found it interesting. After a lifetime (75 years) of watching American politics--and especially the media's treatment of political and cultural issues--during the last five decades, particularly, and observing the drift further and further into socialism, with virtually all of our former values getting trampled and turned on their heads, I have noted both the bias reported here and its result, as the people are brainwashed.This book is needed and informative. Unfortunately, it is probably too little, too late, to change the course of history. This is a different generation of Americans: different than the ones with whom I grew up, in the 'forties, that sacrificed all to save the world. Sometimes I find it hard to believe that they are even related.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"I have found this book to be infuriating at nearly every turn. Bozell is well researched but makes fundamental errors that make this book a difficult read. Bozell states, early on, that he does not consider pundits and commentators as constituting the liberal media, noting that when he speaks of the media he is referring solely to journalists. However, throughout the book he continually cites pundits and celebrities to fuel his claims about the liberal media. Bozell even goes so far to include a quote from film star and occasional political commentator Jeneane Garafalo as further proof that the media is biased. Such inclusions beg the question of why Bozell would take the time to define the media only to circumvent this definition time and time again throughout the book.Secondly, Bozell lambastes liberal radicalism throughout the book but shows no restraint in feeding into conservative radicalism. This book would be far more readable if Bozell had the sense to withhold words such as \\"wacko\\" or \\"nutjob\\" when refering to liberals. Furthermore, Bozell frequently makes bombastic, provocative statements without writing so much as an additional sentence to back up his claims. These sentiments seem like non-sequitors in a sea of otherwise decently researched material making Bozell's writing childish and undisciplined.I have greatly disliked books that promote liberal radicalism just as I dislike this book that promotes conservative radicalism. Bozell's book would be far more sophisticated and readable had he disciplined himself to write about the subject of the liberal media rather than push an entire agenda of feverish, simplistic radicalism."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"GREAT BOOK! BOZELL is very qualified to write it. He shows just how Bias the Partisan, Liberal media is - and he predicts its \\"meltdown.\\" The fact is that most Americans are tired of the bashing of conservatives and Christians by the Far Left Leaning Network and Cable News reporters who are supposed to be impartial. Books like this are eye opening. It is no wonder that Fox News now has more viewers than all of the other cable news outlets COMBINED!! Long live Fox News and Limbaugh!!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"This book is a very well-written and well-researched treatment of the topic. Anyone who reads its massive proof of liberal media bias would have to be very obtuse (or very obstinate) to continue to deny its existence. (And, yes, the author makes it clear that the problem is bias in the NEWS, not editorials or talk shows, which are SUPPOSED to be opinionated. This is a point that liberal bias-deniers are constantly getting wrong.)The only thing missing from this fine book is a thorough discussion of the obvious and glaring CONTRADICTION that media-bias deniers propagate, namely:(1) Conservatives are shills and apologists for the big corporations.(2) The \\"corporate media\\" are corporate-owned, so they too must be shills and apologists for the big corporations.(3) But the conservatives are constantly CRITICIZING these very same \\"corporate media\\"--in other words, they are always COMPLAINING about the activities of their alleged staunch ALLIES!A conservative will defend religion-flag-country-mom-apple pie like a junkyard dog. So the real reason why they criticize the media is because the media are NOT corporate apologists--quite the contrary. (After all, the media made heroes, not villains, out of such anti-corporate activists as Ralph Nader and Erin Brockovich, which could hardly have happened if they were \\"pro-corporate.\\") The media might sensibly refrain from running exposes about current advertisers, but 60 Minutes runs corporate expose after corporate expose. When the program criticizes government bureaus, it's generally for not doing ENOUGH. Ask any working journalist: it is very rare for the \\"corporate interests\\" to dictate editorial policy. They don't want to be bothered with it--as long as the news medium is making the profit margin they expect for it, they leave it the hell alone."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Michael Moore said he is an independent, not a Democrat, but this was exposed as just one of his lies when it was shown that he in fact is a Democrat. In 2004, he has veered from plain ol' anti-Americanism to Kerry's best hope. He is part of the &quot;new religion&quot; of modern media technology and is an example that works against his theme, which is that he is a censored artists, silenced by a Big Brother of corporate Republicans.Moore said Disney censured him by not distributing &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, but this is another lie. Their agreement was to help him produce it, never to distribute it. He used that line only to further the myth that he was restrained by corporate interests and found a huge distributor, Miramax. It was all part of his plan. Disney released another documentary, &quot;The Heart and Soul of America&quot;. &quot;Heart&quot; made no attempt to discredit &quot;Fahrenheit&quot;. It simply is an affirmation of true, good facts about this great nation. Moore called it the work of &quot;right wing extremists,&quot; which is like calling reporters who wrote about the Yankees' fourth World Championship in three years in 2000 &quot;Yankee propagandists.&quot; Speaking of things in New York, Moore expressed anger at the terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center. That makes sense, but wait. He was frustrated that they chose to kill New Yorkers, since the Democrats are strong in the Big Apple. He would have preferred Osama to have killed people in a Republican stronghold. New evidence has surfaced that anti-American Leftists plan to disrupt law enforcement during the Republican convention. The Left is not just a &quot;useful idiot&quot; of terror but an accomplice. Is commentary really necessary?Moore is, in reality, an example of how, as America has become the dominant power in world history, our themes - freedom of press, of expression, of dissent - are not censured but allowed to magnify.What the Left does not understand is that the likes of Moore do damage to the Democrats, and are of great value to the Republicans. They forget that their anti-war protests in the 1960s did not win them any elections but gave them instead Nixon and Reagan landslides. Actually, they may understand it, but they are obsessive-compulsives who cannot control their impulses.While Moore is not part of mainstream Hollywood, he is certainly part of the dominant media culture that the film industry embodies. Moore's documentaries get bravura responses from Hollywood and Cannes.What Hollywood just does not understand is what kind of economic windfall they would reap if they made conservative-theme films. If they depicted the bad politicians as actual Democrats, the word of mouth among conservatives would fuel boffo box office. On the few occasions when they stray to the right, as in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise, they reap a whirlwind of success.What Democrats do not grasp is that Moore is a terrible role model, and that true knowledge of who he is, combined with the fact that he is a spokesman for their party (whether he owns up to it or not) is simply a negative reflection of that party. This fact is obvious on its face and needs no commentary from the right. I will offer more anyway.For years, Moore's work has been discredited, whether it be his documentaries or his books. Those who have seriously studied his work have consistently found him to be a liar in the main. He is a propagandist who takes 15 percent of truth, 70 percent lies and 15 percent exaggeration, and attempts to foist it off as journalism. The fact that he is a darling of the Left is as telling a true statement of their wacko views as any. Moore is the torch-carrier of Emma Goldman. He wishes he was Hunter Thompson, a gonzo journalist and a real talent, but he is a pale imitation.To believe Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; (the title stolen without permission from Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;), one must accept the fact that George Bush knew about 9/11 ahead of time; allowed it in cahoots with Osama bin Laden and the Saudi royal family in order to justify the long-desired American invasion of the Middle East; spirited bin Laden's legitimate family out of the country because they were part of the plot (which would be done to bring oil profits to the Bush family while satisfying their personal vengeance against Saddam for attempting to kill Bush 41). The fact that Bush 41 invaded Kuwait to oust Saddam in 1991, then left without the so-called oil grab, combined with the fact that Bush 43 is in the process of leaving Iraq without the so-called oil grab (again), are just the first two of 6,778 pieces of factual evidence that have been determined by the world to discredit Moore's work as lies.After &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11's&quot; first weekend, the liberal press hit us with big headlines telling us that it &quot;broke records&quot; and is reaching the largest audience in history, selling out theatres and influencing the election. It may have sold out theatres, but only because it played in a limited number of art houses. The fact is, it made $21 million. &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; made $117 million in its first weekend. The truth is that &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; finished with the 228th best opening weekend ever, just behind &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot;. They were right about one thing, though. It will influence the election. In favor of Bush.Still, Moore is a hero of the Left. Because of all the historical reasons cited herein, because they are desperate and see their only source of joy, political power, being pulled away from them more and more each day, they are beyond the Truth. They lie, and we have little choice but to be merciful for those who lie. This charade, however, is getting tiresome.These Truths remain self-evident.

I opened this book inclined to believe its claims. I'm one of those who've for decades watched and read the news in anger. The liberal bias has been evident to me long before this current debate flared up.The biggest advanatage of this book is the use of empirical studies by the Media Research Center. Another advantage is that the author's brush isn't overly broad, showing a willingness to acknowledge the sometimes good reporting by frequently biased figures such as Rather and Donaldson.My one complaint (one another reviewer here mentioned) is that on the one hand Bozell makes a distinction between news reporters and commentators - bias in the former being more insidious - while on the other hand illustrating too many of his examples using commentators such as Gumbel.Finally, I have a question for reviewers here who too easily dismiss criticism of liberal bias by claiming essentially \\"corporate paymasters control the news.\\" Where's your evidence? The claim cannot stand unless it can be proven. Also note that many of the top executives at most media corporations are big donors to Democrats. These reviewer have most likely not read this book, and if they did are impermiable to fair analysis."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"The media of moral relativism?Bozell reports how the media (NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, PBS, NY Times....) has developed an elitist and bias attitude. They of course are the enlightened ones (though I will admit, at times, this does occur on the right also, but usually from commentators not reporters.) They distort the news with minimal backlash. He gives many examples of the media's double standards. This is an endemic problem. He demolishes the myth of a right-wing conspiracy. Who are the real purveyors of hate?Brent brings forth a knowledgeable and entertaining read, but he tends to overuse \\"big words\\". I think his secondary agenda is to encourage us to extend our vocabulary.Brent is the founder and president of the Media Research Center and a syndicated writer. MRC is a Media Watch Dog Organization. Much of this book comes from the information collected from here.\\"The Democrats do not need to fear their actions because they know they have the support of the media.\\" To many times truth is ignored because the facts get in the way of their agenda. With one exposed only to this biased reporting, we won't know if we are actually being fed opinions instead of being reported the news. Will we then not be reluctant to believe there is a bias? Brent does applaud the media for it's coverage of 9/11, although it was short lived. He also commends the hard reporting done by certain individuals.This of course is another book that will be loved by conservatives and hated by liberals. The book will no doubt enforce the conservative mind, and provide confidence when giving answers if confronted. I commend the \\"liberal minded\\" individual who decides to actually read it.The media admires Mrs. Clinton so much they are willing to look the other way. This is going to become more important as she starts her campaign for president. Of course has she not started many years ago?Brent finishes with the coming meltdown of the media elite. The need to emulate Conservative shows such as Rush and Fox may be a sign. Why would they want to after their attacks against them? Only because they work.A good accompaniment to this book: \\"Arrogance\\" by Bernard Goldberg"},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"Nothing could be clearer after the last election than the left-leaning bias of the liberal press. If there is anything we have learned from that election it's that you can't trust or believe one word written in many of the major newspapers in America. Newspapers including the L.A. Times, New York Times, and the Washington Post, which barely qualifies as a newspaper, and many others made absolutely no attempt to be honest, fair, objective, or newsworthy. They ran a campaign for Kerry in the name of a newspaper, with an unending, unrelenting series of negative \\"news reports\\", writing articles on anything and everything they could find to show whatever they thought would undermine the Republican candidate.Some committed left-wingers like the reviewer Carmen J. Lopez, \\"Couldn't be more off\\", October 27, 2004, demonstrate the same kind of dishonesty that exists in the press. No one could have lived through that election without seeing the glaringly obvious anti-Bush rhetoric. It's no wonder there is such a rift in our society; people can't even be honest when the proof is in black and white."},{"Title":"Weapons of Mass Distortion: The Coming Meltdown of the Liberal Media","review":"What the hell are the two \\"Editorial Reviews\\" all about???

The approach taken by the authors is one of the most honest of those in the literature, for throughout the book they are careful to note just how much evidence there is to support their position(s), and to what extent further work is to done. Philosophically speaking, the authors are clearly in the materialist camp, believing that Cartesian dualism does not cohere with current scientific knowledge. But they state that materialism is not an established fact, allowing the possibility, but not the probability, that dualism may in fact be true. They reject early on though any &quot;arguments from ignorance&quot; in their assertion that just because neuroscience does not have an explanation of consciousness, that such an explanation is impossible. The authors call the failure to be able to think of consciousness in terms of neuronal activity &quot;intuition dissonance&quot;, and reject completely its efficacy in establishing the truth of the nature of the mind/brain.The underlying theme in the book is to explain emergent properties as &quot;high-level&quot; effects that are dependent on &quot;lower-level&quot; phenomena, hence rejecting the thesis that they are &quot;nomologically autonomous&quot;, i.e. that such a dependence cannot be done and is outside the domain of science. The science in this book recognizes its historical origins, and it is clear that the authors will not accept explanations of the mind/brain that do not involve scientific experimentation and analysis. Much has been done experimentally in neuroscience since this book was published, especially using the techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A brief discussion of MRI is given in the Appendix of the book, but no doubt if the book were updated there would be a lengthy overview of it. The current experimental situation in neuroscience has led some to predict a total &quot;reverse engineering&quot; of the brain in the upcoming decades. This prediction is an optimistic one, but no doubt detailed knowledge of the brain will continue to accelerate, this being a sign of what the authors call &quot;a remarkable time in the history of science&quot;.The authors devote an entire chapter to the computational modeling of the brain, mostly of course dealing with the mathematics of neural networks. The approach in this chapter though is still at a level that would allow a general audience to follow it. Readers with a background in physics, especially statistical physics, will appreciate more the discussion on Hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines. Experimental results are inserted as graphs throughout the book, with detailed explanation. As a whole the discussion of the biology of the brain is purely descriptive, and the line drawings could stand some improvement.The chapter on neuronal plasticity is the most interesting in the book, the authors viewing the brain as an entity that is continuously undergoing modification. Their stated goal in the chapter is to explain how the &quot;local&quot; property of plasticity can result in the &quot;global&quot; property of learning. Clearly intelligence to the authors is an emergent property, i.e. an object or device may be characterized as intelligent without its components being intelligent. Particularly interesting in this chapter was the discussion of the amnesia of a patient who underwent bilateral resection of mesial temporal lobe structures. The time scales of the patient's memory are striking: he remembered things before the surgery but could not remember things that happened a few minutes or hours ago, but could remember things within a minute in his past. The authors also mention the fascinating work of Antonio Damasio and his collaborators, this research being even more important at the present time. The scientific study of consciousness is just beginning and no doubt this study will give many surprises as it develops throughout the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain","review":"There is an argument that this is a book of its time. It is nearly fifteen years since it was put together and a great deal of neural water has flowed under the bridge. The thematic enthusiasm for computationalism that dominates the book has not been convincingly proved in the meantime. If anything, the computational properties of models have been shown to entertain many unpleasant complexity results. Moreover, the localisation of brain functions grounded in naive interpretations of lesion effects has come under greater scrutiny due to detailed MRI results. Given twhat was known at the time, it is unsurprising that the book focuses on the visual system - a focus also found in Christof Koch's recent book. Acknowleding all that and more, it would be hard to find a better condensation of science, computationalism, and philosophical speculation than in this book.Leaving aside downsides arising from recent discoveries that the authors could not have anticipated, the book can be frustrating to read at times. In particular, there is a tendency to introduce technical concepts and descriptors into accounts without prior definition. For example, very early on in a brief account of monkey vision there is mention of V4, MT, etc. The terms are neither defined nor explained. Strangely, in the introduction to networks, the inner product of two vectors is explained while the outer product is not. Small points but the oversight recurs.The philosophical content in the book is light, but the assumptions driving the work are among the most contentious. There is no point reaming off a list but the book does not shirk supporing the brain-as-a-computer hypothesis.All in all a stimulating work, if in need of updating."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain","review":"This extremely interesting book integrates our vast knowledge of neuroscience with computational models of perception, sensori-motor integration, memory etc.For students of neuroscience, computer science and psychology this book is extremely important, because it gives you the necessary fundamentals of this field(namely computational neuroscience) so you can get to more advanced levels easily.Understanding the book will need some background in higher mathematics (differential calculus)."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain","review":"I bought this book in 1995 and read it cover-to-cover in 2009. It is an enormously valuable tour of many neuroscience topics, but the general (reasonably sophisticated) non-specialist reader must be tolerant of the very numerous gaps and discontinuities. In other words, this book is not self-contained in the sense that a non-specialist can pick it up and understand it.In order to wade through all of this book, one must first know enough to be able to fill in the very large gaps, and to bridge the discontinuities. I think that at least half of the technical terms were not defined at all. I felt it was a bit like picking up the proceedings of a research conference. One does not expect continuity in conference proceedings; nor does one expect everything to be defined. But generally in a book, one does expect definitions and continuity. The authors have given copious references parenthetically in the text, and background reading suggestions at the end of each chapter. But footnotes with definitions of terms would have been more useful. If one needs to look up too many things, one may as well read a different book. (Of course, there is a substantial bibliography at the end of the book also.)Still, it's good for those who are curious about the neurosciences to be thrown in at the deep end to read some snippets about the functional hierarchy of the brain, the basic facts in each level of the hierarchy, the functional capabilities and interrelationships between regions and sub-regions of the brain, numerous specific mechanisms for transmitting information from one part of the brain to another, numerous methods of encoding sensory inputs for transmission within the brain, some intriguing functions of the hippocampus, and the coupling between sensory inputs and motor outputs.The impression I had after reading this book is that the brain is no more nor less than a big associative engine. In other words, it is totally unlike the von Neumann architecture or any other kind of human-made computer. I also had the impression that an amazing amount is already known, and I look forward to the day when enough pieces of the jigsaw have been put in place to see an overall picture emerge for how the brain does what it does. (My own principal interest in the matter is to know the physical basis of the \\"seat of consciousness\\", for some meaningful definition of that naive concept.)My conclusion is that this book is an excellent sampler of research in computational neuroscience. Since it covers a broad area, it gives some perspective on the relations between the different areas of the subject. So it's a good place to start, to get some ideas for what to read next. However, don't expect an integrated, self-contained textbook-style presentation of the subject."},{"Title":"The Computational Brain","review":"This book is an excellent follow-up to &quot;Engine of Reason,Seat of the Soul&quot;.

It's this odd mixture that sets her apart from other romance authors.There's a Dickensian cast of characters: Francesca Davenport, the novel's heroine; mad cousin George; two orphans from China; Amelia, the spoiled daughter; the repulsive Hamish Barlow; the handsome yet questionable Adam Marsh.All set against the backdrop of Darkwater, the Elizabethan manor house with the black lake in the middle of a foggy moor. What more atmosphere is needed?"},{"Title":"Tito: A Biography (Biography & Memoirs)","review":"Nowadays, it is hard to imagine how the world was in the heroic years of 1917-45, when the Soviet Union stood alone, attacked, besieged, blockaded and threatened. It was surrounded by enemies, who had allies inside the country, even inside the Party: Trotsky's provocations invited imperialist aggression; Bukharin's efforts to prevent industrialisation and collectivisation would have left the Soviet Union defenceless against the Nazi onslaught. After World War Two, the Soviet leadership had the sheer courage to rebuild the country, and also to create and aid new socialist societies, in the teeth of the US nuclear monopoly.This book expresses the British Foreign Office's view of the Soviet Union. For, after Yugoslavia won its independence in 1945, with the Red Army's aid, Tito became increasingly anti-Soviet, thus gaining US and British support. The book depicts Tito as Bevin did, saying in 1949, \\"He's a ..., but he's our ....\\" The British and US Governments 'kept Tito afloat' with financial aid. The US National Security Council believed that \\"much as we dislike him, Tito is presently performing brilliantly in our interests in leading successfully and effectively the attack from within the Communist family against Soviet imperialism.\\" (cited p. 300)The British Government told Tito that they would stop aiding Yugoslavia unless he stopped aiding the Greek revolution: Tito closed the border, trapping half the Greek Liberation Army inside Yugoslavia. Tito's colleagues Dedijer and Djilas slandered Stalin, claiming that he told Tito to stop the aid. Yugoslavia abstained on the UN Security Council vote to send troops to invade Korea and on the UN General Assembly Resolution that falsely branded the People's Republic of China the aggressor in Korea. The NATO powers told Tito to establish friendly relations with the ... Greek Government, which he did. In 1954, he signed a defence pact with Greece and Turkey.Inside Yugoslavia, Tito increasingly favoured the free market, and he gave its six republics more and more autonomy. In 1963, he created a federal Constitution; in 1970, he gave the republics even more autonomy, and, in the 1974 Constitution, he gave them almost complete autonomy. This successive yielding to devolutionary pressures gave more power and more credibility to those who sought to break away from Yugoslavia. Thus Tito's policies led directly to Yugoslavia's disintegration and descent into war."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Of all Thomas Perry's books, this was his least attractive. I'm a HUGE fan of Perry, so much so that every 2 years I reread all his books. Unfortunately &quot;Death Benefits&quot; was weaker than those preceding it and &quot;Pursuit&quot; is even weaker. I'm trying to think if I would have felt differently had I not read all of Perry's books beforehand. I don't think so. Since I get annoyed with reviewers who say &quot;there's much better out there&quot; and fail to make suggestions, I'll recommend the late Ross Thomas' books starting with &quot;Briarpatch&quot; and of course Perry's books prior to the last two.The entire book dragged. The killer might be called psychotic (I believe it means they can't tell the difference between right and wrong), but I believes he does, he just doesn't care what is right or wrong. The killer's history isn't interesting but we're exposed to a plethora of it. The minutea of his life doesn't enhance my knowledge of his character, especially since he's certainly not a sympathetic character.The title describes the story. However the biggest disappointment to me was the careless fashion in which the pursuer constantly and incompetently lets the killer get away. Why there wasn't a poison gas canister in the trap in Buffalo, why there wasn't a source of lethal electricity in the house in Minnesota, amazes me. Granted hindsight is 20/20, but we're talking about the pursuer having weeks to plan. Finally, there are a minimum of 4 unnecessary deaths of probably good people before the pursuer follows the course of action he should have in the first place.I'm sorry, this book started well with a nice set up that appeared to be a contest of cleverness, and dragged into a plodding story in which I just wanted to get it over with."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Thomas Perry is a remarkably good writer of suspense novels. You can pick up any of his books without worrying that you'll feel cheated. This book is not up to the level of the Jane Whitefield novels, but is, nonetheless, an entertaining way to spend a few hours. Perry's trademark trope of having his characters travel cross-country makes for a sense of progress, even when there isn't much happening. The games and traps he creates for his characters to evade and escape maintain a fairly consistent level of suspense--more than enough to keep you reading past your bedtime. Finally, his characters are rarely clear-cut good and bad guys, which makes them more interesting and more human.So what keeps this novel from being among Perry's best? Two things:1. Although it is interesting to see things from the antagonist's point of view, he is not a terribly interesting creation--pretty much a montage of stereotypical killers from psycho/spy novels. The time he spends hiding out does not so much illuminate his character (as Prescott's down-time does) as simply provide more of the same. Although the structural parallelling of the two characters' actions is stylistically intriguing, Varney is too conventional for this trick to work well.2. The multiple points of view prevent the reader forming a real bond with Prescott. It would be interesting to deal with the cognitive dissonance created by identification with an ambivalent character, but just when you start to like him, you get a dose of Varney or Millikan, thus interrupting the connection.These minor stylistic difficulties aside, this book is easily worth the money you'll spend on it and provides more entertainment than most authors pack into two novels."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who normally read Perry. For someone new I would recommend trying his Butcher's Boy or Jane Whitefield series first. This book seems to combine people with characteristic of Perry's more notable past characters -- a hitman (&quot;The Butcher's Boy&quot; - his first and in my opinion best book), someone smart and highly trained pursuing him, (&quot;Death Benefits&quot;) and women a bit like Jane Whitefield (many books). It was a very good story and I enjoyed it and would have given it 5 stars but there were some places that seemed to drag, particularily with all the hitman's overthinking and exercising details. As usual Perry does a good job of fleshing out his main characters and a few sub-characters - I really enjoyed the pursuer character (Prescott) and would have liked more about Millikan (prescott's freind - a professor and excop). Hopefully, we will see another book with Prescott and Millikan."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I read this book in manuscript form while working at the publisher's ad agency. Reading manuscripts is often a dreadful task as many novels are poorly written. PURSUIT was a wonderful exception! Whereas most modern thrillers are overwritten (ie: characters with very little bearing on the story get a full page or more of description or there are endless chapters that do nothing to advance the plot) Perry gives us a taut, electric tale of a hunter and his prey that grabs you by the throat from the first page and simply will not let go until the last. Although the styles are quite different, PURSUIT reminded me of the thrill I used to get from reading Ian Fleming's original James Bond novels. Thank you, Mr. Perry, and please bring back Roy Prescott soon!"},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Perry has been a very dependable writer throughout his career but this one is not close to his best efforts. The plotting is, as usual, spectacular, but the characters never work for a few reasons. Varney, the hit man, is a killing machine. He kills everyone, so as a character, he's totally boring. The only conflicts are within his own mind and Perry never really establishes any reason for his makeup. Contrast him with the hit man in The Butcher Boy, Perry's first novel, and it makes for a slow read. Prescott, the tracker, could have been an attractive character a la Jane Whitefield, but while Prescott revels in the chase, he seems remarkedly unable to pull the trigger when he has trapped his quarry. While this might make for increased tension in the novel, the believablility factor goes down to zero.Readers who want the best of Thomas Perry should go back to The Butcher's Boy or his classic, Metzger's Dog, and leave this one on the shelf."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"My first by Thomas Perry. Great pace and suspense, but the killing and Spy vs. Spy pursuit scenes take reality completely out of the picture (and a ridiculous typo on page 155 takes the proofreaders down a peg as well).Thirteen people are killed in a Louisville restaurant. Ex-cop now law professor Dan Milliken believes Bobby Cushner was the target. Bobby's wealthy father wants Milliken to find the killer. Reluctantly, he calls Roy Prescott, a mysterious manhunter who operates on the edge.They profile the killer right away - James Varney a twenty-something reject who first killed a cranky aunt at age 11. Varney's provoked to call his pursuer Prescott on p. 34 (really?), and the chase is on.The first two rounds go to Varney who flies to LA and kills two cops. The rest of the way Prescott, who's pushing 60 by the way but seems to have superhuman stamina, has Varney dead to rights a bunch of times, but Varney manages a series of impossible escapes.In the end there are 25 or so corpses strewn from coast to coast. Two &quot;final&quot; showdowns cap a sequence of great action scenes, but truthfully they'd fit more in a comic book than a novel."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"The book opens in a restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky, the scene of a mass murder that has obviously been carried out by a particularly ruthless yet methodical killer. It's certain that this was no frenzied attack and it's also certain that the killer will eventually strike again. So unorthodox methods are required to stop him.Roy Prescott is such an unorthodox method. He specialises in tracking down particularly hard to find criminals and brings them to justice. This justice is not usually within the limits of the law. Once Prescott begins to hunt, the tempo of the story immediately lifts as you sense that the game is afoot. We are treated to a series of confrontation scenes where the action is intense, punctuated by periods of relative inactivity as both men recover and prepare for the next sortie. It turns into a thrilling game of attack and counterattack.Thomas Perry has virtually created a new sub-genre of his own, starting with the Jane Whitefield books and through Death Benefits and Pursuit. He has been specialising in books that depend on a person trying to disappear while the pursuers use all their considerable ingenuity to track them down. In this case, we witness a man-hunter at work as he alternately flushes and ambushes his prey. The tension is greatly increased because the hunted is not without significant survival skills and is very capable of switching from the role of the hunted into the hunter in the blink of an eye.I found this to be a very enjoyable thriller thanks to the evenness of the contest. Told alternately from the perspective of both men, we are allowed into the minds of both men."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Don't you just HATE books that feature &quot;brilliant&quot; protagonists who are soooo incredibly stupid?In Pursuit, Prescott sets trap after trap for villain Varney and then lets him get away, scott free, every time. (The motel, the booby-trapped office, and multiple times at the country home.) This is implausible fiction at it's worst.In Perry's previous Jane Whitefield series, the reader had at least three &quot;good guy&quot; characters with which to identify (Jane, her husband, and the client). In Pursuit, however, we have 2 professional killers who are little more than nasty, cardboard icons.Further, I'd LOVE to see a word count on how many times Perry used the words &quot;got&quot; and &quot;gotten&quot; in this book - a personal hot button of mine, I know, but puleeease ...To summarize, the last two efforts from Perry aren't even in the same league with his earlier works. If you feel compelled to read Pursuit, I suggest you save your money and wait until it is released in paperback form."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Sometimes I'll finish a book and rush to read the reviews to see if others agreed with me. Many times, I'll find myself scratching my head, wondering if I read the same book as some of the reviewers. This was the case with this book, where Perry has intricately woven a plot where all the pieces in the puzzle are so carefully chiseled leaving no room for error on the part of the protagonist.The story starts off with a bang....well, actually thirteen of them as nine diners and four employees in a restaurant are all gunned down by a lunatic psychopath. While some might have called this the random work of a madman, Daniel Millikan, homicide detective turned criminology professor, knows better once he's viewed the crime scene. He realizes there was a target and the hit man killed the other twelve people in the restaurant just to make the police work even harder to figure it out. The wealthy father of one of the victims hires Roy Prescott to find his son's killer. Perry writes, &quot;Revenge is not sweet, it's a luxury. It's a necessary restoration of balance in the universe.&quot; Since Prescott has a reputation for working outside of the law, usually leaving no prisoners, he's the perfect one to restore this balance.This book was better than any National Geographic episode where the hunter tracks down his prey. In this case, the hunter is Roy Prescott and the prey is hit man Jim Varney....someone who is almost as smart and cunning as Prescott but not quite. This will be a chase to beat all chases.Right from the beginning, Perry lets the reader know who the killer is thereby allowing us not only to get into Prescott's head but also into Varney's as he tells the story through both viewpoints. This is sometimes a dangerous technique but one Perry masterfully employs and one I very much enjoy. So many authors lead you through 300 pages, while you try to figure out who the killer is, only to be disappointed in the end. Since you already know who the killer is here, you'll read on just to find out if Prescott's pursuit is successful. I guarantee you it's one of the best cat and mouse chases you'll read with Prescott coming up with some ingenious plots to capture the very elusive Varney.Towards the end of this book, you'll be forcing yourself to avert your eyes from the next page, the next paragraph, the next sentence dragging out the inevitable climax just a little bit longer. You'll want to read ahead as quickly as possible because, by this time, you'll know that Varney cannot be allowed to live.Roy Prescott is just the type of guy you'd want to hire if you were seeking revenge. A dream book for me would be to see Roy Prescott teamed up with Perry's other recurring character, Jane Whitefield....also someone who enjoys working outside the law. Well, one can only dream."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"This author is very original. A good thing. If you like Harlan Coben and Robert Crais, as you should, they are both great. Then check out Thomas Perry, any novel, especially Jane Whitefield novels-they are great."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"If you like a fast paced, gritty, in your face story, this is the book for you.I had never heard of Perry before picking this book up, now im going to go out and get another one of his books."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"To begin with, I love the Jane Whitefield books but didn't really care for Thomas Perry's others. I thought I'd give this one a try anyway.To my surprise, I really enjoyed it. Very skillful balance between plot progression and character development, even the obligatory flashbacks.I found myself much more interested in the characters than the events. Roy Prescott is fascinating. Reminded me of Jane, come to think of it."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"New characters fuel the lastest work by a very talented author. We visit Buffalo again, as an avenger and killer play a deadly chess game across the country. You'll overlook the coincidences, because Perry has you hooked from the opening scenes. We always learn interesting facts, this time about the trade in stolen goods. Have fun."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Incredible suspense! This story of a brilliant sociopath and his pursuer was the best thriller I've read in years. Hard-edged and very exciting, I especially liked Perry's inventiveness - I could never outguess him. I can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Again - Thomas Perry has produced winner. Unlike most books of this type it doesn't deal with the hunted and the hunter. But, with two hunters. With each circling the other, where only one can survive.This book should be required reading for all future thriller writers and maybe most of the current crop. They might learn a thing or two."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"To simply state this book was great. Prescott is the best character since Chinese Gordon. No nonsense page turner that has you from front to back. The only drawback i feel for all of Perry's books, too short. One year between too wait for his next i always want more. Buy it you will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"After the relative disappointment of his last few books, this is a fine effort from Perry. Having written several of the best of the best thrillers ever (Metzger's Dog, Butcher's Boy, the first two Jane Whitefields) and a number of almost-as-good standards (Big Fish, Island, Sleeping Dogs), this signals a reassuring return to form for his fans. If you're unfamiliar with his work, this is a good place to start. He's a pro with tightly-plotted, tersely-observed action, and a real pleasure to read. Why these things haven't been made into films is a complete mystery to me-- at the very least I hope Perry's making money off a fist-full of Hollywood-optioned works to keep him concentrated on his next five books. I look forward to reading every one."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"This author has a depth to his writing which has not yet been reached. In this story he develops two protagonists with a possible third player, but to even try to describe the story beyond the basics may be difficult.Killing people for hire is not easy..or simple. It apparently takes training. There is a craven, smart, well trained killer for hire out there whose effort becomes understood and appreciated by criminalists in our midst. Please believe me, I am hard on authors, but this story deserves all the stars one can award it. The character development is complete for all players, the story line is compelling....if you want a great read...look no further. Mr. Perry has done it again!!"},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Couldn't put the book down...the details, the dialogue,the characters...only thing that could have been better??? A few more chapters. Mr. Perry rounds out his characters so well that I can see them vividly in my mind as I read. I have not been a fan of the Jane Whitfield(?) series;read a couple of them. I always hoped that Mr. Perry would bring back characters similar to &quot;the Butcher's Boy&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;. He finally did. I highly recommend the book to all mystery/action lovers."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"People may not like this book because of the slow pace in certain sections. This is essential, because if you're trying to catch a mouse, you may have to lie in wait for long periods of time - or in the case of 'Pursuit', spend lots of time establishing you are someone you are not in order to catch your prey. This is typical Perry, paying attention to detailed real life situations of people who make livings either killing poeple of making them disappear. An excellent, if somewhat violent, read."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Thomas Perry impressed me with his extremely talented writing for quite some years ago, i don't rember when, with Metzger's Dog, which still runs like a movie behind my closed eyes.And that was his second novel. I allready WAS hooked, but it took me some time to get his wonderfull violent novel, The Butcher's Boy, to Denmark.Since then I've been hooked on Perry's word's. Hes writing so wonderfull \\"american\\", about the violent heroe's (are they good or are they bad?) .. well, I don't know, but I do love them with all my heart.And, of course, when Jane Whitefield, emerged I was absolutely flat out in love -- a deep and sincere love -- with the woman ..Well, if Perry wrote about the way the grass is growing, it would be worth to read the book -- so never will I miss one little book from him. He's indeed at the top of my list of american crimewriter's."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I first encountered Perry in the Jane Whitfield series and then looked up all his previous novels and read them, too. The protagonist in this thriller does not endear himself to me as Jane did, but no matter, he is as smart and ingenious as Jane could ever be. The chase is utterly gripping and the surprises just keep coming. There is more than aplenty blood and gore. which is in keeping with the story. I recommend that you not read this while eating lunch! Perry always does an incredible job with the occasional characters in his books and this one is no exception. You will not soon forget the folks you meet in this book. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Perry never, ever disappoints me. This tale of a hitman and man hunting him becomes circular as each seeks to destroy the other. The book is strung end to end with psychological tension. How can Perry (anyone???) ever have imagined this series of traps and near-captures and hairsbreadth escapes all turning and tumbling as within the same scene the hunter becomes the hunted and then is suddenly the hunter again? Prescott is an amazing character, and though I'd like to think Perry will write more about him I'm still waiting for Chinese Gordon (&quot;Metzger's Dog&quot;) to make a reappearance!A year? Do I really have to wait a year or more for another of Perry's books? C'mon, if the publishers can continue to crank out wordy tomes of unedited mishmash several times yearly from Stephen King, SURELY Perry could be published more often than annually! Of course it can take longer to write good quality material, so I guess I'll have to be patient and wait upon Mr. P."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Mr. Perry and I doubt I will be reading a second. For me, the main problem is that neither the good guy or the bad guy are painted as characters I can latch onto or care about.The novel starts with the discovery of thirteen people found murdered in a restaurant. When clues point to the idea one victim may have been the reason for the entire slaughter, a modern day bounty hunter, Roy Prescott, is hired by the victim's father and the hunt begins. The story is told from both the \\"good guy's\\" and \\"bad guy's\\" point of view. Unfortunately, instead of the cat and mouse game picking up steam, the story almost fizzles out. The novel gets somewhat caught up in simply repeating scenes where the two almost meet face to face followed by Prescott attempting to unravel the real story behind the killings. By about halfway thru the novel, I simply didn't care about either of them.I guess I just never got caught up in what the author was attemting to create; a protaganist who can work outside the law to get his man yet we still cheer for him and a bad guy who is evil personified. I did not find much intrigue and suspense here and wonder if you will find the same."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"while a hit show like &quot;csi&quot; covers good forensic ground, you need a taut thriller like this gem by perry to get a better grip on two warring homicidal adversaries: the hunter and his prey. except here the roles keep reversing and dovetailing, with the law off in the distance, like a referee in a pro wrestling bout not allowed to really intervene. characterization is superb here, plot tight, solid entertainment. only complaint: when perry overwrites and becomes philosophically forced and flowery, when you just want page-turning action."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Daniel Milliken is a well-known profiler who has successfully worked with the police on several important cases. One night he is asked to come to a restaurant where a massacre had just taken place. He noticed that things were not what they seemed. There were no stray shots taken in the restaurant and every single bullet used had hit a target. He is convinced that this was not a random act of violence and he tells the police that this appears to be a contract killing. The shooter enjoyed the carnage and had no compulsion on murdering innocent bystanders.One of the victim's relatives is convinced that his son was the target and he is prepared to pay Milliken one million dollars for the identity of the killer. Milliken refuses the offer but gives him the number on someone who might be able to help. Roy Prescott is a former cop who does not play by the rules. He will do whatever is necessary to track this killer and make him pay for his crime.The cat and mouse game is very intense for the first half of the book but afterwards the story begins to flounder. Prescott is relentless with his investigation. He manages to track the killer, taunt him and humiliate him. He treats the killer as a little boy hoping that he will make a mistake that will cause his undoing. When Prescott fails the first time he decides to find out who hired the killer in the first place. It is at this point when the story weakens. At the pace the story was going the reader is not interested in finding out the why of the massacre, they are just interested in Prescott capturing the killer. When the author tries to explain the circumstances of the crime the reader feels cheated. There are no clever surprises or cliffhangers. There is a showdown at the end of the novel but by then all the participants are prepared. They know what to expect and perform what they are supposed to do. Once the character's purpose is fulfilled the author has no more use for them and just lets them die. There is a strong sense of finality in the book that does not leave many options for the surviving characters."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I have been a long time fan of Mr. Perry and have read most of his books. &quot;Pursuit&quot; is another successful thriller rendering a compelling story with down to earth, although somewhat frightening, characters. The villian in this book is an especially bad guy and the reader is never quite sure how things will turn out for the &quot;good&quot; guys. The hero is not all that admirable, but he does get the job done, even showing some remorse for the tactics he is forced to use.This is a good book that any Perry fan will enjoy."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"When a diner in Louisville, Kentucky is the scene of a mass murder, the police call in profiler Dan Milliken to help them get a bead on the perpetrator. Milliken quickly determines that the murders are the work of a professional killer, one who knows what he's doing. One who left virtually no clues. The police are stumped. Because Milliken knows the assassin will kill again, he calls in his friend, Roy Prescott, a private investigator who specializes in hunting down killers. Thus begins a cat-and-mouse chase that pits two men of almost identical skills against each other, and the pursuit won't end until one of them is dead.This finely crafted novel is told from several points of view, which is normally a disadvantage. As a reader I normally like to have one clear character to root for. In this case, however, it works. I would name Prescott as the main protagonist, but it's Milliken's decision to hire Prescott that puts everything in motion, and he checks in periodically. We also get inside the killer's head, sometimes for chapters at a time--and sometimes I almost felt sorry for him.The pace is quick and suspenseful, the plot twists clever and surprising. After some gut-wrenching close calls, in which the villain makes incredible escapes, the end seemed a bit anti-climactic, but it was none-the-less satisfying. A solid page-turner."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"The story is intriguing and intelligent. Perry writes well, but sometimes too much - you'll hit a couple of slow spots, but should be able to skim through/past the extraneous detail easily. There are a couple of interesting traps, but they leave you wondering why they were half-baked, seemingly incomplete. You'll wonder why the bad guy leaves his pursuer wounded but not dead.

It was exactly as specified and I am completely satisfied."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"t.p.'s writing seems to become more and more overly old-timer and way too traditional. most of his novels after the \\"disappearing act\\" series have become not so likable and readable. there are more and more illogical thinkings and writings in all the more recent books. the storyline also dragged out with too many blabbering and descriptions. most of the time just like this one, the hunter became hunted, usually turned out to be a not-so-capable prey with lousy skills. the contracted killer for hire in this book also read like a contrite, improbable figure, highly unlikely can kill so many people, and how corporate people or private citizen know him, approach him and hire him? p.t. never explained quite clear. he is like lawrence block, should quit writing long time ago but still keeps churning out way-too-traditional lukewarm and lame novels."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I came on here to write a review.

In some ways, he is highly underrated in that his books are so good, he should be a very well known best-selling author. He has been putting out quality work for years. His latest is no exception and is, in fact, one of his best in quite some time.PURSUIT, as the title aptly describes, is a novel about a cat and mouse chase between two killers. Both of them are professionals for hire. However, one of them works for the good guys, the other is a true monster. When thirteen bodies turn up dead in an intimate restaurant, Daniel Milliken, ex-detective and current professor of criminology, realizes one of the dead customers was the target of a highly skilled and dangerous assassin. He has one of the victim's families hire Roy Prescott, who specializes in hunting down murderers and, in most instances, killing them. Prescott's target is James Varney, an assassin for hire who has no regard for human life. Prescott sets up one trap after another to ensnare Varney. However, Varney eventually starts setting traps of his own.Perry specializes in novels about hide and seek. His series character, Jane Whitefield, makes people disappear by changing their identity. This standalone is again about people trying to disappear. The book takes off from page one and rarely pauses for breath. These types of books make for some fun reading and this one is definitely no exception. Not only does Perry take great care in the construction of the plot of this novel, but, he uses the same care in the creation of his characters. Varney, Prescott and Milliken are all real to the reader by the conclusion of this ingenious work."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"On a purely plot level, Pursuit is a great read about a professional killer and the man hired to stop him. The book plays out like an elaborate chess game, and some of the setpieces - most notably a showdown in an old farm house - are thrilling both as action pieces and as windows into the intelligent, crafty minds of the characters. And yet, as much fun as I have with the story, Pursuit never reads as half as good of a book as it should. Perry keeps an emotional distance from all the characters that makes thematic sense but makes the duels hard to care about. But it hurts the non-action scenes even worse - for instance, there's a long period in which both characters go dormant in which the book flounders for a lack of an emotional hook into any of the internal crises going on. Pursuit would make a hell of a movie - done right, it would be a great mix ofLeon - The Professional (Deluxe Edition)and a 70s character drama (it might be a lot likeThe Hit, even), but as a book, a great story is wasted with an execution that leaves the book just laying flat on the page, wishing it had some more life and interest."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Pursuit started off great. Great characters. Great pace. Good amount of action. Unlike another reviewer, I thought the background information included greatly enhanced the characters. Also, unlike another reviewer, I felt the capture/getaways were completely plausible given the characters.Unfortunately, about 2/3 of the way through, the story slows down to a near snail's pace, for an implausible plot twist. I understand what the author was going for, but frankly he didn't sell it that well. Not given the personalities he had so carefully built up in the earlier part of the novel.Both the hunter and the prey take time out and spend months in one place. Varney knowingly being ripped off by cohorts. His inertia I would probably buy if he didn't spend so much time extolling his hate. Yet, he does nothing about it. Not a good sell given the Varney portrayed until that point.And why Prescott spends weeks in one place cultivating a false identity and life on what *may* be a lead is plain inexlicable.As another reviewer said, at this point I was ready for the novel to just be over.Too bad. It *was* going really well."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Thirteen bodies are found dead in a restaurant, and the father of one of the victims believes his son was the main target. He wants to hire Professor Millikan, a world-renown expert on homocide, to find the killer. Millikan refers him to Roy Prescott and from there the pursuit has begun.Readers learn quickly that the killer's name is Varney and he is a more than worthy adversary for Prescott. We follow Prescott as he attempts to first identify Varney and then learn how he acts in different situations. Prescott's plan is to set a trap anticipating how Varney will react and to be there to catch him.Thomas Perry has many skills as a writer of suspense. He has a patient way of laying the groundwork and maneuvering the characters into position for thrilling and unexpected encounters. He uses a technique of describing the action from one character's point of view and then retraces the event from the other character's perspective, resulting in a fuller, more entertaining and involved understanding of the plot.Perry is also a master of surprise and cleverness with the ability to sustain suspense throughout the story. Each character has distinct personality traits, values, motivations and styles. They develop relationships with each other, using dialogue so realistic it feels like you're eavesdropping. Of course, anyone who has read Thomas Perry is aware of his talent. Without revealing any more of the story, it is fair to say his talent is on display in PURSUIT. It is highly recommended for both old and new readers; you'll love it."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Thomas Perry is one of the rare writers who is always in control of his material. He writes with economy, with a fine ability to create a sense of place and to endow his characters with viable histories. He is also never tempted to write the heavy-handed, graphic sexual scenes that interrupt so many otherwise good novels. In Pursuit, which in theater parlance might be called a two-hander, he deals with the pithy issue of killing--from different sides of the fence. And he does it exceedingly well. James Varney is the ultimate narcissistic, amoral young killing machine. Roy Prescott is the dogged, older, seasoned and moral opposite. How Prescott pursues Varney, how Varney dodges and weaves, unraveling psychologically, then knitting himself back together, is the Pursuit of the title. But there's much more to this book than merely a chase. While we're offered only snippets of Prescott's history, what he is in the present tense is absolutely fascinating and the reader can't help but speculate on what factors might have contributed to making him such a meticulous, determined and farsighted planner. Varney is a compelling yet repugnant character, but so thoroughly fleshed that he is completely believable.Perry continues to grow as a writer; he's never fallen victim to any sort of personal formula in his work and, as a result, his books are always a trip to some place where the reader has never been before. Pursuit is a prose pas de deux, perfectly executed, perfectly resolved.Most highly recommended."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Most books require the reader to suspend their disbelief of things that we know are not &quot;real&quot;. But this book stretches things so far, that the characters are like comic book characters and it was hard for me to think I was reading anything but a comic book.The book is a replay of the movie and book &quot;Shane&quot;, in which we have the good and moral gunslinger heading for the showdown with the immoral and evil gunslinger. The fact that the &quot;good&quot; gunslinger makes a living tracking down and killing professional hit men requires too much suspension for me. And the bad guy only kills 23 people in the space of a few months. But he's not a serial killer.Everyone has super senses, chiseled chins and steely grey eyes, and olympic-class athlete bodies.

Give me a break. I can only say one thing and the only good thing is the author's photo finally changed, to a dandy and smiling one, just wishing it's not a smile caused by how easy he cashed in with this ... book.

Prescott and Varney are both formidable adversaries, and pairing the two off against each other is a titanic struggle to see who comes out on top.

One of Perry's best to be sure."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"This novel from Thomas Perry is an extremely disappointing and emotionally flat read where there is little difference between the hunter and the hunted. As the novel opens, a killer has managed to kill thirteen people inside a restaurant in order to confuse the police over who was his actual intended victim. But, ex-cop and now Criminology Professor Daniel Millikan is invited in to the crime scene by the local police and quickly figures out who the target was. Robert Cushner was the intended target and the killer killed everyone around not only to confuse the issue but also to prove that he could do it and get away with it.Professor Millikan soon flies home to Los Angles from Louisville after helping the Police all he can to find this special unfeeling professional killer. But, after the Police prove that they can't, the son's father, also going by the name of Robert Cushner contacts Millikan. The boy's father is wondering if Millikan can put him in touch with someone who might be able, not to get justice and bring the killer to trial, but to seek vengeance and make sure this never happens again. Millikan knows such a man and his name is Prescott.Prescott takes the job, because that is what he does for a living. Prescott begins an elaborate chess game with the killer and soon other people are dying as Prescott and the killer each try to prove his manhood. Neither wants to admit the possibility that the other is better or going to win the game of death. An elaborate chase across the country and back again, weaves through this 370-page novel leaving a trail of bodies in its wake.This is an extremely flat book where there is virtually no emotion coming through the work. These cardboard characters emote through various descriptions but at such distance from the reader that it never comes through. What does come through is the fact that there is little difference between the two and virtually no feelings over the steadily rising body count as Prescott baits the killer over and over again. This novel becomes an extremely boring piece of work and a real disappointment to this Thomas Perry fan. Fortunately, he has written some very good stuff in the past so check out some of his older titles and take a wide pass on this one."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"As with all Thomas Perry novels, this one is populated with clever, off-beat charecters and a non-stop plot line consisting of unexpected turns, brilliant logic and a satisfying conclusion.

Criminologist Millikan is called in to examine the scene. Later the father of the suspected target among the 13 approaches Millikan for help in finding the killer. Millikan then sends the father to hit man Prescott to kill the killer. The hunter and the hunted trade place here and there in the cat and mouse game that ensues...everything is okay up to that point. Prescott discovers who the real target of the Louisville massacre really is and concocts a much too elaborate confusing sting to reel in the killer. Things go south from there. A new ton of characters are introduced with much verbiage and lifestyle details ad nauseam. Both the hunter and the hunted run into female companions, dragging them around to no real advantage to the plot at all. More bodies, more boring details of all the minute, tiny aspects of everybody's life. This book needed a lot of editing to tighten up the excessive plot lines. Neither the killer and hit man are appealing characters and Millikan is just cardboard prop. It could have been a good book but sadly, it isn't."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Perry has been at this for twenty-five years, and some of the reviewers I've read are of the opinion that his more recent books simply aren't up to the standards set by his early work. If that's the case, this one has to be an exception. Roy Prescott is not one of the Good Guys, not really. He's a predator, a hunter-killer. Fortunately for most of us, he's selective about his targets: He only hunts other killers, especially the professionals. He's willing to accept a fee for this service -- a guy's gotta live -- but there's obviously much more to it than that. Professor Millikin, ex-cop and nationally known profiler, is consulting on a case in St. Louis involving the shootings of all the patrons at a small restaurant. The father of one of the victims is a very wealthy man who wants vengeance for his son's death, and he tries to hire Millikin to solve the case. After some hesitation, Millikin refers the grieving father to Prescott, who takes the job. At this point, we meet James Varney, an emotionally crippled but very skillful killer -- maybe as good as Prescott -- and the rest of the rather lengthy story alternates between their viewpoints, which allows the reader to see how each of them occasionally screws up and misinterprets the other's actions. At times, the action drags somewhat, as one or the other of the two antagonists tries to deal with things, so the reader will have to practice patience. Well, Prescott and Varney are both extraordinarily patient. Perry goes to great depths with the back stories, developing the characters and motivations not only of the three main characters, but also of a number of the supporting players. The plot is highly inventive and the details are meticulously worked out. And even when you think you have things figured out, Perry will surprise you yet again."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Sometimes \\"Do what you love and the money will follow.\\" takes people down unusual paths. James Varney discovered early on in life that he craved adventure; the biggest adventure is killing people and getting away with it. He's made a very successful career out of his craving.Roy Prescott is a specialist. His job is finding killers and stopping them. He does this by learning all he can about the killer, and knowing what the killer is going to do next. When thirteen people are killed in a restaurant in Louisville, Roy Prescott is eventually called in to figure out the why and the who. Varney becomes the biggest challenge of his career. He knows that nothing will stop Varney from killing again and again.As in any investigation, leads are pursued which go nowhere. Of the thirteen bodies, only one was the intended victim. The rest are collateral damage. It takes a while for Prescott to figure out which of the bodies is the true intended victim; this changes the course of the investigation completely.Prescott and Varney are almost evenly matched. Varney challenges Prescott, after Prescott questions his abilities and doubts his history. This would be a much more pleasant prospect if they were chess masters or tennis players. Varney kills two police officers, just to show Prescott what he's capable of. Unfortunately for quite a few more truly innocent bystanders, Varney is a guiltless killer and has no qualms about doing what he does best. The body count at the end of PURSUIT is quite high.Perry can write thrillers as well as anybody out there. PURSUIT has some minor flaws, which I didn't really notice until I was finished reading the book. Varney puts up with a lot of crap from some people in Cincinnati, more than one would expect, even under the circumstances. His emotional collapse under the pressure from Prescott seems (again, in retrospect) surprising. But none of that bothered me when I was reading PURSUIT. I just kept reading, which is what Perry is so good at getting a reader to do."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"To begin with, I love the Jane Whitefield books but didn't really care for Thomas Perry's others.

Roy Prescott is fascinating. Reminded me of Jane, come to think of it."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"Incredible suspense! This story of a brilliant sociopath and his pursuer was the best thriller I've read in years. Hard-edged and very exciting, I especially liked Perry's inventiveness - I could never outguess him. I can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"I've been a fan of Thomas Perry's since his first published novels, Metzger's Dogs and The Butcher's Boy (both of which I strongly recommend). He seemed to have disappeared for a bit, then returned with the Jane Whitefield series, which, although enjoyable, didn't have the same edge for me as the earlier works. But after a few of those, Perry turned back to stand-alone novels, and Pursuit is one of those. It's a decent entry into a real standby of crime fiction, the duel between two equally strong adversaries in which &quot;the hunter becomes the hunted&quot;. Perry's weakness here lies in the very nature of the genre itself--the outcome must be predictable or the story will be unsatisfying or incomplete. The story moves forward with the inevitability of a Greek tragedy. But his strength, here and in the Whitefield series, is the rich detail of the hunt, of pursuit and escape. The situations his characters find themselves in, their actions and reactions, are engrossing, and the characters themselves, especially the villian James Varney, are fascinating. And Perry's pacing is excellent, too. The novel contains a number of stories from the characters's pasts, and just when I was at the point of thinking, &quot;The book's almost over and I still don't know much about what really motivates the hero,&quot; that issue was immediately addressed. &quot;Pursuit&quot; is exactly what it says it is, and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Pursuit","review":"This is the first book by Tom Perry that I didn't bother to finish.

I like the story but I LOVE the soundtrack.Does anybody know where can I find it??"},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"Shortly after it was published, The Tin Flute surprised Canadian readers and was soon widely read and enjoyed internationally. Its author, Gabrielle Roy, reached out to an audience with eloquent, flowing prose, by describing the very depth of the human condition through the Lacasse family.Briefly: the main character of the novel is the oldest Lacasse child, Florentine. Her poor family, residing in the slums of Saint Henri, Montreal, rely heavily on the wages she brings in as a waitress. Rose-Anna, her mother, struggles to care for her growing family and struggle through tragedy, while the father, Azarius, is unable to maintain a job. Florentine's life is turned upside down when she meets a handsome man named Jean, an affair that is doomed from the beginning. A crushed Florentine turns to Jean's friend, Emmanuel, for his love, although she cannot return it, as she is still torn over her feelings for Jean. In the original French, it was entitled, &quot;Bonheure d'occasion&quot; which cannot be perfectly translated. However, the English title of &quot;The Tin Flute&quot; is very suitable and expresses the message of the novel from the smallest Lacasse child, Daniel -- his only great desire was to have a shiny tin flute, a symbol of all that he would never be able to call his own, in a poverty-stricken existence.With this groundwork, Roy paints a convincing and enthralling portrait of an impoverished family, troubled love, and mixed ideals in the midst of World War II. It is a novel well worth reading and will leave you with new insight into the human condition and the brutality of poverty. Although some phrases are lost in the translation to English from the original French, the translation is highly successful in being as nearly as effective as the original.For related themes (although from very different perspectives &amp; times) you may also wish to explore Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, and Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"If only more books were written like this! The Tin Flute is the poignant story of a young girl growing up in poverty in the slums of Montreal. It is the 1940's, war is brooding. And we are introduced to a French Canadian family faced with unemployment, too many children, and despair. We suffer as the mother, pregnant again, searches on foot for affordable housing. Her daughter works at the five-and-dime and is inlove with a man who holds contempt for her class and social background.I have read this story three times. It is without a doubt, one the greatest books ever written of its genre. If you enjoyed &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; or &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; you will no doubt love this story equally well. It is unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"I read this book in a university class on Quebec literature. I was touched by the compassionate, warm portraits drawn by Roy in this sad, haunting story. Like Shakespeare, she is a mastermind at painting the tragedy of life -- the inevetiablity of loss and pain. Reading this book is akin to watching a painfully beautiful sunset -- you know it will end in darkness but you feel compelled to keep watching in fascination.I was delighted to find that the grade 10 class also loved the book when I decided to read my excerpts for our social studies section on WW II."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"It's really too bad that Canadian authors aren't publicized more in the U.S. I bought this book from amazon-canada because I wouldnt have known what to look for. It's won several literary prizes in Canada and is well deserving of them. The story of a French-Canadian family during the depression and early years of WWII in Montreal, it portrays a world that no longer exists. In this country, the people would have been Tom Brokaw's Greatest Generation. The differences between then and now were phenomenal. Men joined the Army to put food on the table. They looked everywhere for honest work, even part time or temporary or low-paying. They didn't join gangs or deal drugs. People weren't afraid of each other, even in the worst neighborhoods. Yet their lives were unbelievably hard. There was high infant mortality. A child with leukemia was doomed. Landlords put whole families out in the street when they got behind with the rent, often due to unemployment. The war ended the depression, but some of the characters ask themselves if it's worth the price, or if peace as they knew it was any better. The author wrote this book at the time it took place, in a city she knew. It could have easily been set in Detroit or Chicago, London or Dublin. There is a universal quality to this story, that gives a vivid picture of the times. The book isn't cheerful, but it's also not hopeless. At the end you don't know what will happen to these people, but they have a chance. A really moving story."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"I purchased this novel for the purpose of completing my B.A. Degree. This book was required in a course for french canadian literture. I have read it in both in english and french. The works of Gabrielle Roy has won three Orders of Canada prior to her death. This book was also considered for the Noble Prize in Lit. on several occasions. It is a powerful novel of the multiple forces that work against people of poor socio-economic status. It descrbes, in detail, the lives of a poor working class family in the industrialized St. Henri district of Montreal at the onset of WWII. Although the characters are fictional, the situation and circumstances of their lives are quite real. The novel has been defined as an example of the realist genre and personifies the era very well. The most interesting aspect of the novel is not the obvious elements of poverty like crime, lack of education and illness but the mental and emotional suffering of its victims. One may judge the actions of the characters harsely but this would be unfair. One must appreciate their situation and thereby feel compassion for them. It is a good story."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"I am consistently impressed with the fiction (mostly) contained in the New Canadian Library series, published by McLelland &amp; Stewart. Gabriele Roy's 1945 novel The Tin Flute is certainly no exception. A story of late depression-era Montreal, Tin Flute is almost a laboratory-like setting of individuals beset by grinding poverty, and how they respond. Very much a novel of characters, Roy continually asks the reader whether, as the novel's eventual hero, Emmanuel, muses after volunteering for the army after Hitler's invasion of Poland, \\"a guy can help himself sometimes by helping other people,\\" or whether the immediate retort of his comrade, \\"a guy has his work cut out these days looking after himself\\", is more true. Florentine, the desperately poor waitress who forms the center of Roy's plot, longs for (and eventually becomes impregnated by) the rake Jean, while Emmanuel more chastely pines for her. Roy gives the perfect one-sentence description of Jean: \\"He could be kind if his kindness caused him no problems.\\" Florentine muses about herself (and I believe Roy asks the reader): \\"Sweetness brought you nowhere. That's what had ruined them all.\\" Roy's ending to the novel is wonderfully ambiguous, and leaves open the questions of goodness, opportunism, and purpose she raises throughout."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"This book was part of the Grade 12 curriclum at my high school in Timmins, Ontario, Canada. It was a well written book, giving up detail and insight into what life was like for a struggling family in the 1940's. My favorite character had to be Florentine.

My favorite Book!"},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"I admit I've had a lot of distractions and that novel reading is not my favorite kind of thing to focus on but I'm having trouble getting into this book. A Canadian friend recommended it and maybe someday I'll have to amend this review but for now...so so."},{"Title":"The Tin Flute","review":"I can't remember how I ran across THE TIN FLUTE, but I'm certainly glad I did. Gabrielle Roy's 1945 novel represents the best of old-fashioned but literate story-telling. In writing about the slums of Montreal and the desperate struggles of one poverty-ridden hard-luck family in the early years of WWII, Roy was writing about a time and a place she knew well, and created what was to become a classic of Canadian literature. There is not much of the sentimental or chick-lit in Roy's story of the Lacasse family, living in the bottom-rung-of-society in the St Henri neighborhood of Montreal. Life is hard for Rose-Anna and Azarius and their several well loved, if malnourished children. The story of the oldest daughter, five & ten lunch counter waitress Florentine, takes center stage initially, but that soon changes, and her hard-pressed mother becomes central to the story. But Roy has a way of making all of her characters three-dimensional and real - the ambitious and driven Jean Levesque, his better-off friend Emmanuelle Letourneau, Florentine's lazy dreamer father Azarius and others.There is a hopelessness to the Lacasse family story, but they are so real and well-intentioned that you keep hoping things will get better. Roy has much to say about the role of the war that Canada is just being drawn into, and the irony of a war offering hope, jobs and stability to a nation caught in the grip of the Depression. The book's original title, in French was BONHEUR D'OCCASION, which translates as \\"used\\" or \\"second-hand\\" happiness. As Philip Stratford notes in the afterword to the Alan Brown translation, \\"there is not much happiness of any kind in the novel.\\" The tin flute image, however, seems apt, the inexpensive toy acting as a fervently desired object for the Lacasse's sickly child, Daniel. Perhaps one of the more moving scenes in the book takes place in the children's hospital, where little Daniel has finally gotten his flute, and is then given an orange by his sister. He is puzzled -\\"But an orange ... was a fruit you got at Christmastime. You found it in your sock on Christmas morning ... An orange was like a new coat, or a shining flute. You wanted it so much you kept asking for it, and when at last you held it in your hand you had no use for it.\\"The poignancy and symbolism here was perfectly rendered, of course, but I also remembered the orange in the toe of my own Christmas stockings so many years ago, in the 1940s and 50s, in a time when an orange was still special, as was a tin flute or perhaps a Red Ryder bb gun.THE TIN FLUTE is quite simply a beautifully written novel and deserves its permanent place in the canon of great Canadian literature. Its particular brand of realism opened the gates. I was immediately reminded of another Canadian novel of Montreal I'd read and loved many years ago, Mordechai Richler's story of the Jewish ghetto of that Metropolis,The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.

Also shared a copy of it with a black friend who is learning about the church.BTW, regarding the other review that claims this is a \\"complete fabrication,\\" I know for a fact it is not. I heard about Mary's story before the book came out, then read the book, then saw her at BYU one day - coming out of the raquetball courts. Didn't look fabricated at all, and seemed like a real nice girl.One other thing: growing up there was a black girl in my high school (in Kansas) who joined the church - I didn't know her very well because she was a year younger. I overheard her in the halls one day having a tense exchange with friends. They were giving her a hard time about her plans to get baptized, and she told them in know uncertain terms that \\" I KNOW it's true!\\" I grew up around a lot of black people and frequently experienced the animosity that many blacks feel toward whites.

This book shines with Ingrid's own personal voice, and in so much of the book you can clearly hear her lilting charm creeping into your brain, so familiar and real that you could almost swear she was talking to no one else in the world but you at that moment. It takes a truly gifted person to transfer that much of themselves and their life's story onto simple pages in a book.And what a story. Orphaned at a young age, she struggled with her incredible shyness throughout her childhood until she found solitude and happiness on the stage and in front of the camera. America and David O. Selznick wooed her over the Atlantic after a blossoming film career in Sweden, when several American reviewers poked humourous fun at the fact that Swedish movies of that time were rapidly becoming far superior to their American counterparts, thanks to the acting skills of one fair lady. Of course, the world knows about her now infamous illicit affair with Roberto Rossilini when she reigned in American movies with Selznick (she was comdemned on the Senate floor afterward for being so unwholesome in her choice), but her story doesn't revolve around excusing what she did. She explains the simple facts of the matter, with a bit of why, and she moves on, just as the American people did when they welcomed her back after a 7-year exile in Europe in her Oscar-winning performance as Anastasia. I don't even know how they resisted her that long, really.But her life is an incredibly invoking read, with her ability to place herself within the pages as well as her fascinating history interweaving to form an unforgettable tale. This is one book that I can assure will not be forgotten easily. As she herself said \\"I went from saint to [...] and back again, all in one lifetime.\\" Not many can say that, and not many can tell it with such grace. Truly a remarkable woman."},{"Title":"Ingrid Bergman: My Story","review":"What shall I say about this book? I always enjoy autobiographies about people I like, and although I didn't know too much about Ingrid Bergman prior to reading this book, my interest in her life became stronger after finishing it. I made a list of all her movies and have been seeing them as I can get hold of them.Profound statement: Ingrid tells about her life in this book. (duh)She does a very good, coherent job, and moves along steadily. There is humour as well as sadness. I liked the part when she told David O Selznick at their first meeting that she would not wear makeup and would not change anything about her appearance, and if he didn't like it she would go back to Sweden on the next train.

Al In &quot;My Story,&quot; Bergman describes not only her working life, but the men she fell in love with and married (three wildly different men!), her four children, her ambitions (&quot;Joan of Arc&quot; was something she wanted to make for years), the scandals and the love that filled her career, and the cancer that ultimately ended her life.Bergman's story has a candid quality that not many star autobiographies have. She had almost universal sympathy for others, such as her more difficult diectors and costars, or her ex-husbands. One moving passage has her describing how she wept at Rossellini's death, and was happy that third ex-husband Lars had become a father. Her writing isn't very detailed; at times, it's downright stilted. But it's pleasant enough to read, with elements of humor, of romance, of joy and sadness.Between Bergman's anecdotes and stories, Burgess explains Bergman's life further, with &quot;Ingrid got this part&quot; or &quot;Ingrid went here&quot; or &quot;this person said this thing about Ingrid.&quot; He quotes her frequently, along with letters, costars, and plenty of other information that Bergman might not have remembered or known about. He fills in the gaps, so to speak.Bergman's bright personality and Burgess's tight journalism make this a unique book, describing the life of a unique woman. &quot;My Story&quot; is definitely worth telling."},{"Title":"Ingrid Bergman: My Story","review":"This book answers some of the questions lingering onpeople's minds about Ingrid Bergman's personal life onher point of view, in her own words.

She uses excellent sense ofhumor and makes the reading fun.From this book we can get more information aboutthe people she were related to.. some personal thoughtsthat are funny, sometimes sad.She HAD caused a major scandal once, and peoplehave doubts about her but once you read this book,you can't NOT like her~!

Her story is a troubling tribute to the egocentric, narcissistic, opulent, and self-destructive life-style.Born, in 1916, an only child who by her teens had lost her parents, Bergman was passed across Europe to be raised among distant family. Identity confusion, suspicion for authority, disrespect for religion, and feelings of inadequacy were to permeate her life from those early days. Frequently, Berman claims that motion pictures and the theater saved her from personal disaster and death.Suggesting early on (the first page) that she wrote this book to voice her side in the media driven scandals of her life, this text clears the air about what happened with Bergman. Block buster movie parts, three marriages, four kids, three Oscars, multiple six and seven digit salaries, celebrity friendships, and her personal attitudes are all considered in this life story. Readers hear about her love for champagne, cravings for tobacco, love of ice cream, aptitude for languages (she was fluent in at least five), weakness for domineering men, financial ineptitude, and continual pursuit of the best part. Her first love was always acting.Much of Bergman's life played like one of her movies. The pretty girl gets all the kudos, excitement, money, and fame until they run their course into a tragic ending leaving her holding the bag. Often Ingrid finds herself stuck in a far-away country with few resources and even fewer options. (It is informative to realize that many, if not most, of Berman's roles, from the beginning with \\"Intermezzo\\" in 1939, featured marital infidelity.) But in the end a movie mogul rose up to save her with a brilliant part, such as \\"Casablanca\\", \\"Joan of Arc\\", \\"Anastasia\\", \\"Indiscreet\\", \\"Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\", or \\"A Woman Called Golda\\". Maybe moviedom saved her, after all.The sheer length of this book keeps it from earning additional stars. It takes a time commitment with nearly 500 pages. Of particular interest are Bergman's personal reflections and stories. We hear that Gary Cooper and Cary Grant were her favorite male stars, that Bogart was unapproachable, that Spencer Tracy liked to give flowers to his leading ladies, that mentor and producer David Selznick always paid himself first, and that Hemmingway considered himself her surrogate father. Howard Hughes, she suggests, offered her RKO studios (perhaps out of romantic feelings for Bergman). Ingrid also had her enemies starting with fellow Swede Greta Garbo and ending with her second husband (of six years) the Italian director Rossellini. The book was published in 1980 (two years before her death at the young age of 66).Bergman also tells the gripping stories of her flight from Europe on the verge of World War II (with a harrowing tour through Nazi Germany on the eve of Britain's declaration of war) and her return to the continent in a performing company to the recently victorious American GIs in 1945. Her eye witness account of Europe's war time destruction alone justifies the costs of this memoir. This book is recommended to all with an interest in Ingrid Berman, the motion picture industry of the 1930s-1970s, and celebrity tell-alls."},{"Title":"Ingrid Bergman: My Story","review":"In the book &quot;My Story,&quot; Ingrid Bergman chronicles her fascinating life with good detail.

They all cover it, but usually in ways I couldn't easily figure out from the text. Finally I stumbled on this fabulous book by James Williams of MIT. I immediately purchased my own copy and have been happily referring to it often.Prof. Williams really takes pains to explain every step. It is obviously the result of many years of teaching, because he really knows how to convey the material to those who have not yet mastered it. (It seems to me math & physics texts are often written with maximum brevity to impress colleagues who already understand it all!). There are many examples, all worked out in detail. And many additional problems for practice.There is also an interesting section on the history of science at the start -- some may find this out of place, but I think its great.One more note I found interesting and unusual about this book. On page 179 Prof. Williams introduces the \\"indirect\\" methods of analyzing dynamics: the Lagrangian & Hamiltonian approaches. He writes \\"We shall take Hamilton's principle as the fundamental law for deriving the equations of motion of dynamic systems... While this perspecitve is not unique, it is unconventional, since many writers designate Newton's laws as the fundamental principles of mechanical dynamics... Indeed, many writers begin with Newton's laws and then proceed to 'derive' Hamilton's principle, a process we feel is philosophically and technically inappropriate.\\" In other words, he doesn't try to justify the Hamiltonian methods, he just takes them as facts of nature as fundamental as F = m a. I admire this approach, but at the same time I crave some additional insight into why these methods work so well -- it is astonishing magic to see the answers pop out. Perhaps those insights are in the text -- I've yet to read it all.(...)"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics","review":"This applied dynamics book is the most well-written dynamics text book I've ever read. In addition to explaining ALL the steps that are normally left to the reader to supply, it gives credit to the originators of all major concepts. Dr. Williams explains why there are direct and indirect methods for calculating the equations of motions. Most people I polled had never seen it as well explained. (It seems rather simple now, and we wonder why no one else has taken the time to really get down on the student's thinking level.) I collect physics/math books. This is the best I've seen."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics","review":"I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M; University, College Station. To keep my knowledge and concepts of dynamics up to date, I have been referring to this book and I find it is one of the most well-written textbook, with thoroughly worked out examples and clear explanations. I have enjoyed reading this book. The way in which author has clarified and applied the Indirect Approach(Lagrangian/Hamilton Formulations) for the equations of motion formulation is very illustrative and clear of all ambiguities. This is a great favour of author since this approach is particularly powerful and extremely important for complicated electro-mechanical systems in particular and all dynamical systems in general.Finally, I respectfully disagree with Mr.Daine (from Boston, MA) to have made such ignorant and un-educated remarks about such a brilliant piece of work. I believe Mr.Daine has been looking for some short-cut type, particular problem solving textbook that will never lay the foundations but solve some limited problems of immediate interest, never illustrating the complete framework. In other words, telling the truth, but not the whole truth. That is how any subject, with dynamics no exception, becomes obscure and horrible to students. But this book is all about laying the foundations and making you enjoy the process of learning, while never straying away from the main objective of all engineering analysis: Design. Hence it is a great book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics","review":"Although Dr. Williams is an engineering genius, he has trouble laying out a clear and concise solution. I just took my first undergraduate dynamics class, and found it easier to teach myself the material rather than try and sift through all the confusing prose that Dr. Williams considers educational text.A good textbook contains the background (perhaps theory), procedure, and solved examples of problems to teach a student a particular technique of solving a problem. I found this book contains far too much background and theory and far too little of the straightforward solved examples.Although this may be a wonderfully written book for a graduate student or professor to \\"brush-up\\" on their knowledge, it lacks in its ability to start from scratch and actually lay out the fundamental technique. Dr. Williams has written this book with the MIT graduate student as his ideal reader."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics","review":"The Author's clear lucid descriptions enables you easily grasp some difficult concepts.A didactic gem!!!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics","review":"I used this text for an undergraduate dynamics class.

Well, we'd expect a book on the subject to try to avoid making arbitrary changes that would do harm. That is, it might make sense to some people to tear down the Dome of the Rock and put a third Jewish Temple in its place, but that would violate this principle. And this book does, in fact, not recommend doing that! So far, so good!For many centuries in ancient times, the Old City was Jewish. More recently, the nineteenth century saw the Jews become first a plurality and then a clear majority in the Old City. The Old City was captured by Arabs in 1948, and the Jews were expelled, but it was liberated in 1967. Jews were allowed to return to the Old City and Arabs were allowed to be there as well. And Jerusalem was reunified. I think it makes sense to call the Old City, \\"the traditionally Jewish Old City.\\" It is very misleading to strongly imply, as this book does, that the place is traditionally Arab and is being counterproductively Judaized in the twentieth century. After all, as even the author admits, the Jewish majority in the Old City of a century ago has been replaced by an Old City today that is about ten percent Jewish.There is a mention of Muslim archaeology in the Old City. But there is no indication of what a hot topic it is, given many complaints by Jews that Muslims are digging up and removing vast amounts of material, including plenty of Jewish artifacts, from the Temple Mount. I think a reasonable recommendation would be to have such work done only by teams that include trustworthy Muslims, Jews, and others.The book discusses the Christians of the Old City. Church leadership there has sided with the antizionists, and that has not helped relations with Israeli authorities.There is a discussion of peace proposals that involve the Old City. Here, the author spends quite a bit of time on statistics about tourism. That is a good point!The author explains that his preferred solution would be to give the Old City of Jerusalem to the Arabs (which to me sounds exactly as smart as tearing down the Dome of the Rock and replacing it with a new Jewish Temple). But he admits that this solution is not realistic and would not create a harmonious environment.What the author wants now is for Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel and the capital of an Arab state. I think this is a very poor idea which would damage the city. And I think it is equivalent in wisdom to demanding that the Israelis build a new Jewish Temple right between the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa. Let's do better than this! Let us try a little harder to avoid arbitrary changes that will merely cause trouble."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"The reviewers below give a misleading description of this book. At last there is someone who takes on the dark side of the master thinkers celebrated all over the western universities. For 20 years I've read all of the thinkers Wolin discusses - from Jung to Derrida - and I have come to very similar conclusions with some minor differences. That's why I was delighted to read this book, I see it as a brave attempt to reveal and discuss many uncomfortable circumstances that the advocates of these thinkers have always avoided.Yes, Jung did try to explain nazism in negative terms - after the war. What he did under nazism - an ambiguous matter - is another thing.And Wolin is no advocate of US imperalism or capitalism, these are not the theme of this book; besides Wolin is clearly in favor of democratic left.This book is an analysis of the inconsistencies in thinkers like Bataille, Gadamer and Derrida, also of the wily or fierce assaults on democracy in some their texts. It is not very kind to these thinkers, but it doesn't have to be, since there are even more aggressive tones to be find e.g. in Bataille or Derrida.(And yes, I have read many books of Derrida).Reason can be a monster too, but in humanities there have been too little of it lately."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"Richard Wolin is Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York and his THE SEDUCTION OF UNREASON is a captivating read. Against a historical background, he posits two modern interludes; one on the German New Right and one on its French counterpart. Putting things in perspective, Wolin reflects on the roots of contemporary postmodern, and sometimes reactionary, thinking. In the 1930's the Left began to adopt some of the ideas traditionally associated with the Right. The expression \\"les extrmes se touchent\\" gained credibility, giving room to the oxymoronic terming of Bataille's \\"Left Fascism.\\" After World War II Nietzsche and Heidegger, with their critique of reason and democracy, became the intellectual idols of the French Left. Wolin dubs this counterintuitive phenomenon \\"left Heideggerianism.\\" With the collapse of state socialism and the coming down of the Berlin Wall in 1989, yet again voices from the left began to coincide with traditionally reactionary appeals to Nation, \\"Volk\\" and Identity. The Enlightenment twin-concept of reason and progress became the punchbag of the day. This book is largely about this \\"problematic right-left synthesis.\\"In a critical review, the late Richard Rorty argued that Wolin, although his heart is in the right place, has a hard time separating a philosopher's moral character from his teachings; any thinker who has displayed either hypocrisy or self-deception is unlikely to have any ideas worth adopting. Although Wolin \\"protests that his book is not an exercise in guilt-by-association\\", this is according to Rorty actually pretty close to the mark (The Nation 2004). This is, however, not fair. Firstly, what Wolin says appears on p.301 and is a reference to Heidegger's catchphrase \\"reason is the most stiff-necked adversary of thought\\" as being a philosophical inspiration for a postmodern worldview. Even if this can lead to conceptual confusion and postmodernists can assume a variety of political hues, \\"they are hardly \`fascists'.\\" Secondly, on page 62 Wolin states that \\"Nietzsche's status as a prophet of the twentieth century should neither be exaggerated nor sidestepped\\", and \\"one can be both a towering writer and thinker a n d a fascist - or, in Nietzsche's case, a protofascist. This lesson challenges our customary notions of intellectual greatness which makes it all the more worth contemplating.\\" Furthermore, in the first sentence of his preface to \\"The Heidegger Controversy\\" from 1991, Wolin characterizes Heidegger as \\"probably the century's greatest philosopher.\\" This conundrum has puzzled philosophers and laypersons alike: how can otherwise brilliant minds be seduced by crude politics?Rather than \\"digging up the dirt\\" on famous European thinkers, Richard Wolin critically addresses the philosophical underpinnings of political thought. As a book reflecting on the political inclinations of a range of thinkers, including Jung, Freud, Schmitt, Blanchot, Derrida, and Habermas, it serves its objective admirably. Written in an engaging style THE SEDUCTION OF UNREASON is a probing foray into a historical landscape which appears to be as yet not fully explored. It depicts with vivacity a division of thought, the repercussions of which are still with us today."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"The Irish TimesNovember 6, 2004 Weekend; Book Reviews; Pg. 13Absolutely entrancingJohn BanvillePolitical philosophy: An attack on European right-wing and 'left fascist' thinkers and their American followers is a kind of philosophical Nuremberg trials.In Thomas Mann's novel Doctor Faustus there is a character called Breisacher, a Jew, whom Mann describes as a private scholar and polyhistor and \\"a racial and intellectual type in high, one might almost say reckless development\\". Although Nietzsche's name is not mentioned - the life and personality of the novel's protagonist, the composer Adrian Leverkuhn, are in large part based on those of the philosopher - Breisacher is the quintessential Nietzschean. His specialty is the philosophy of culture, \\"but his views were anti-cultural, in so far as he gave out to see in the whole history of culture nothing but a process of decline\\". He sets J.S. Bach as the central figure in the \\"progressivist barbarism\\" that caused the deterioration of music from \\"the great and only true art of counterpoint\\" into the \\"effeminizing and falsification\\" of the \\"harmonic romanticism of modulation\\", a process in which even Palestrina had already played a \\"shameful part\\".When he turns to the Bible and the history of his own race, Breisacher is even more extreme, seeing King David and his successor Solomon - \\"an aesthete unnerved by erotic excesses\\" - and \\"the prophets drivelling about dear God in heaven\\" as \\"the already debased representatives of an exploded late theology, which no longer had any idea of the old and genuine Hebraic actuality of Jahve, the Elohim of the people\\".For Breisacher, the history of the modern world, and by \\"modern\\" he means the period from the pre-Socratics onward, is the history of an inevitable degeneration from the true and authentic primitive into weakness, softness and falsity.Breisacher is a member of the circle surrounding the creepy Sextus Kridwiss, a collector of primitive art; other savants attending the Kridwiss evenings are Dr Egon Unruhe, a \\"philosophic palaeozoologist\\" who works on verifying the essential truths of the ancient Germanic sagas, in which \\"a sophisticated humanity had long since ceased to believe\\"; Professor Georg Vogler, a literary historian who has written a much-admired history of German literature from the point of view of racial origins; and the poet Daniel zur Hohe - Mann is always wickedly witty in the matter of names - a high-strung young man whose \\"dreams dealt with a world subjected by sanguinary campaigns to the pure spirit\\" and whose only published poetic work, The Proclamations, ends with the line: \\"Soldiers! I deliver to you to plunder - the World!\\"Mann knew his proto-fascists from the inside, having been one himself, as he showed in his anti-democratic, anti-modern Meditations of an Unpolitical Man (1918).When the phenomenon of Hitler and Nazism demonstrated to him in no uncertain terms how wrong-headed he had been, and how, as Richard Wolin puts it, \\"the flip side of apoliticism is a potentially lethal dearth of Zivilcourage\\", he abandoned his homeland for democratic America and dedicated himself to the anti-Nazi cause. The Hohes, the Voglers, the Unruhes, even, to their great cost, some of the Breisachers, remained behind to support the new regime, mostly, as did the real-life philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer, by keeping silent and going into \\"inner emigration\\", but in some cases, such as that of Heidegger, by a total and extremely noisy identification with the Volk, the Reich, and the Fuhrer.This trahison des clercs on the part of a considerable number of European philosophers, scholars and academics did not end with the defeat of Nazism, according to Wolin, whose book, the subtitle of which is \\"The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism\\", is a vigorous, full-frontal attack on European right-wing and \\"left fascist\\" thinkers and theorists and their contemporary followers in American intellectual life, among the latter of whom The Seduction of Unreason has already raised many a hackle.For its literary and philosophical sympathisers - he lists W.B. Yeats in their number - fascism, Wolin writes, \\"reintroduces an aesthetic politics\\" and \\"allows for the reprise of an ecstatic politics amid the forlorn and disenchanted landscape of political modernity\\". The European counter-revolutionaries, such as Joseph de Maistre and Arthur de Gobineauknew what they wanted as a replacement for liberal democracy: the \\"contrary of revolutions\\", the restoration of the old regime. Their German heirs - Nietzsche, Spengler, Carl Schmitt, and Heidegger - disillusioned denizens of modern society, knew that one could no longer turn back the clock. Instead, they decided to seize the bull by the horns. They embraced industrial society but only under the proviso that it be governed by a totalitarian dictatorship. Dictatorship was the most efficacious means with which to vanquish the debilities of political liberalism and reestablish the sublimity of \\"Great Politics\\" (Nietzsche).Wolin sees this drive towards dictatorship and the aestheticisation of politics as a process that continues to this day, not only in the demagoguery of the likes of Jean-Marie Le Pen and Jorg Haider, but in the writings of such latter-day thinkers as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. Indeed, The Seduction of Unreason may be taken overall as a tocsin sounded to rally the forces of reaction against European anti-democratic cultural theory in general, and postmodernism in particular. The latter is Wolin's bete noir; he considers it not a philosophical movement at all but a form of frivolous despair encompassing a broad assault on the \\"epistemological and historiographical presuppositions of modernity: objective truth and historical progress\\". He cites Jean Baudrillard's definition of the postmodern universe as one in which \\"there are no definitions possible . . . It has all been done . . . It has destroyed itself. It has deconstructed its entire universe. So all that are left are the pieces. Playing with the pieces - that is postmodern\\". The postmodernists and their shock-troops the deconstructionists, Wolin writes, \\"seek refuge in myth, magic, madness, illusion, or intoxication - all seem preferable to what 'civilization' has to offer\\". They are the direct heirs of Mann's Kridwiss circle who \\"could scarcely contain their mirth at the desperate campaign waged by reason and criticism against wholly untouchable, wholly invulnerable belief\\" - irrational belief, that is.Wolin insists that the postmodernists are now in retreat. What he sees as \\"the current disaffection with postmodernism\\" is, he writes,in no small measure attributable to recent political circumstances. Humanism's return spells postmodernism's demise. Totalitarianism was the twentieth century's defining political experience. Its aftermath has left us with a new categorical imperative: no more Auschwitzes or Gulags. We now know that an ineffaceable difference separates democratic and totalitarian regimes. Despite their manifest empirical failings, democratic polities possess a capacity for internal political change that totalitarian societies do not. A discourse such as postmodernism that celebrates the virtues of cultural relativism and that remains ambivalent, at best, vis-a-vis democratic norms is inadequate to the moral and political demands of the contemporary hour.To some, perhaps many, readers this will sound suspiciously like a whistle in the dark. Curiously, too, in its rhetorical vigour the passage and others like it echo the pronouncements of the so-called \\"neo-cons\\" now running the show in the White House and the Pentagon. Wolin, a tough, old-style liberal democrat, would no doubt be appalled at such a comparison, but then, in a phrase he is fond of using, often in the nexus of politics, philosophy and literature \\"les extremes se touchent\\".The Seduction of Unreason is a kind of philosophical Nuremberg Trials. Wolin puts in the dock not only the obvious miscreants such as Heidegger and Nietzsche -\\"was it really so far-fetched that such a thinker would become the Nazis' court philosopher?\\" - but other, less obvious fascist fellow-travellers. He is particularly acute in the cases of Jung - \\"There are more polite ways of putting it, but Jung was a fraud\\" - and Gadamer. The latter was a pillar of post-war German philosophy, but Wolin is relentless in following him into his lair to root out the weasel words by which, according to Wolin, he accommodated himself to Hitler's regime; Gadamer in his counter-Enlightenment worldview, Wolin writes, holds that \\"since human insight is intrinsically untrustworthy, the best course is to limit its use as much as possible. Should a confrontation between authority and reason arise, it is always safer to err on the side of authority\\".In a brilliant chapter, 'Maurice Blanchot: The Use and Abuse of Silence', Wolin tackles one of the shadowiest yet also one of the most influential French intellectuals of the 20th century. There is no doubt that Blanchot is a very great thinker in the realm of aesthetics, and a strong influence in the work of Barthes, Foucault, Derrida and others, those who engaged and engage in \\"a generalized assault against the idea of 'representation' - the notion that mind is capable of portraying reality truthfully and objectively\\". Blanchot, who holds that art is important chiefly as a creator and preserver of silence - in a brief biographical epigraph to The Book to Come he describes his life as \\"wholly devoted to literature and to the silence unique to it\\" - is discovered by Wolin writing before the war for \\"a dizzying array of far-right journals\\", and calling for a revolution that will be \\"a series of bloody shocks, a storm that will overwhelm - and thus awaken\\" the French nation.Like Paul de Man, who wrote anti-Semitic articles for collaborationist Belgian newspapers and after the war developed an extreme form of deconstructionist criticism which was seen by some - simplistically, surely - as an attempt covertly and symbolically to wipe out his own past, Blanchot in his emphasis on silence and impenetrability might be thought of by those same accusers as seeking quietly to erase past sins. \\"My supposition,\\" Wolin writes, \\"is that underlying the theoretical antipathy to 'representation' as a figure for knowledge and truth is a subconscious 'will to nonknowledge': a desire to keep at bay an awareness of unsettling historical complicities, facts, and events.\\"Is Wolin correct in his views, justified in his judgments? The Seduction of Unreason is a wide-ranging yet subtle consideration of the intellectual's abiding fascination with absolutism, and as such it is a perceptive, compelling and invaluable document. His indignation at the folly and perversity of so many major European thinkers is wholly justified and peculiarly invigorating, and most of his charges against those thinkers seem unanswerable. Yet in his almost triumphalist assertions of \\"humanism's return\\" he will seem foolishly overconfident to some, and plain mistaken to others. The opposition to humanism, as contemporary philosophers such as John Gray have shown, is not necessarily a new barbarism, but a new honesty and, dare one say it, a new humility. The Enlightenment brought much darkness; it is possible to see Hitler and Stalin and Mao, with their millennial insistence on human progress and the need for a supra-rational organisation of society, as true sons of le Siecle des Lumieres. On the other hand, it is hard to deny Wolin's contention that \\"with a self-defeating Nietzschean glibness, postmodernism has burned its bridges to a traditional rhetoric of moral evaluation\\". But is a \\"traditional rhetoric\\" really what we need?"},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"Wolin's ambitious and provocative book is a masterly overview of \\"unreason\\" in Western thought. However, it suffers from an oversimplification of those who advocated \\"reason\\" and those who did not. To begin, the term \\"reason,\\" and those who are \\"reasonable\\" in this text can easily be substituted for liberal democracy or those who support liberal democracy, while \\"unreason\\" is fascism plain and simple. What Wolin neglects, in his glossed-over history of French intellectuals in the thirties, is an account of just how untenable parliamentary politics had become. It was not merely the \\"lunatic fringe\\" who questioned liberal values, but in fact a great many \\"reasonable\\" people, whom, for historical reasons ( the rise of sociology and mass psychology, a genuine interest in learning from \\"primitive\\" culture, -- all, might I add, contributions made by \\"liberal\\" social scientists working with purely reason-based and positivist/ empirical methods) sought alternatives to the ineffective and hypocritically unreasonable democratic order that was beset with serious deficiencies. I name here a quick succession of multiple premiers, monetary inflation and other social and religious ills. Indeed, the situation was dire enough that it would have been unreasonable to actually believe that such a system could persist, hence the attraction of so many of the most brilliant interwar intellectuals to thought that was not propagated by 18th century encylo-pedants.Georges Bataille, whose story makes up a central component of Wolin's argument, was just one of these intellectuals. But Wolin, repeating the same argument that Habermas made, calls Bataille a fascist, proof of which he finds in Boris Souverain's testimony, and the oftheard accusation, stemming from fractitious Surrealists like Breton, of \\"sur-fascism.\\" But we must take pause here, for the term \\"fascism\\" was hardly the word it is now, and that lefties of all stripes often conjured it when the accused was touting an ideology that did not match the increasingly tyrannical party lines of the extreme left and the PCF. It was, sadly a time of paranoia. Though it sounds blithe to say so today, the moniker, when located historically, must thus be taken with a grain of salt.If Wolin had attempted a more indepth assessment of Bataille, there is no way he would have rested on these cliches of the writer. For example, despite the fact Bataille's \\"The Psychological Structure of Fascism\\" is Bataille's brave and thought- provoking critique of the fascist state, Wolin reads this text as if it were Bataille's endorsement! While there are some slightly later passages in Bataille's notebooks that suggest he was deeply attracted to a certain kind of fascism, \\"The Psychological Structure,\\" is not one of them, and given that it was written for an audience on the Left, Bataille would have been wiser than to merely endorse the political system he saw forming in Germany and Italy.Once we overcome Wolin's oversimplified dichotomy ( anti-parliamentarian/anti-rationalist= fascist) we can come to understand Bataille as deeply anti-parliamentary and anti-fascist at once; anti-authoritarian in short. This view is clearest in what is his least rational project, the anarchic and spiritual community and religion, Ac&eacute;phale created in desperation during a political crisis. Rather than a fascist \\"third way\\" as Wolin claims Bataille's neither-left-nor-right path to be, Ac&eacute;phale was in fact a fourth way, an irrational (yes) attempt to find an alternative to Stalinist communism, fascism and liberal democracy. The Ac&eacute;phale journal itself displays Bataille's acute awareness of the Nazi's \\"mis-use\\" of Nietzsche and Bataille takes great care in describing to his readers how Elisabeth-Foerster and other German vulgarisers twisted Nietzsche's vague and provocative words to suit their purposes.Wolin's project is admirable. By digging at the root of post-structuralist and post-modern theory, he reveals the dangers upon which it is based. NonethelessWolin proves his argument by creating an ahistorical division between 20th century intellectuals who chose reason and those who reject it. While the tactic helps Wolin by allowing him to expend with details that would hinder his argument, the result is a history of 20th century thought that is grossly oversimplified, and as a result, underestimates the nuanced history of ideas at play here."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"I cannot recommend this book too highly.

I especially found the sections about Bataille and Mussolini fascinating."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"Strictly speaking Richard Wolin is not really a philosopher, he is a historian. This partly explains the way he places selective emphasis on key philosophical points from a historical point of view rather than a philosophical one. Simply bringing up a group of philosophers that do not conform to your views and then blaming them for the ills of society is an exercise that quickly becomes boring for the reader. When one reads philosophy one should be inspired by the words that fill the pages. It should represent the writers creative ability to invite the reader to a different way of doing philosophy. Richard Wolin's task seems merely to discredit his opponent and, as such, does not really contribute much to the key questions philosphy has grappled with since the ancient Greeks to today. His manner of scholarship shuts the subjects of his book out of philosophical dialogue rather than draw them in to expand on his ideas, or lack thereof. As an example, to say that Gadamer prefers surrendering to authority instead of trusting in Reason is a gross misunderstanding of his intentions and shows a lack of reading of his texts and work as a whole. This is because Wolin makes no attempt to pick up on the themes of these philosphers and run with them in order to come up with a new philosophical perspective pf his own. In this respect, the book feels dated, it is an anti-anti-reaction to a philosophical fad that never was and, correspondingly, turns philosophy into a mere culture war with opposed sides, both of whom think the other has something to hide. Philosophy should be more enlightening than this. Also, Deleuze is a thinker that I think Wolin has simply lumped in there with all the others for no apparent reason. Read his later work and you will find he was quite fond of American literature, especially Whitman and Melville. His philosophy drove him there. In any case, do not fear these German/French philosophers because of writers like Wolin. Read their work, discuss and revitalise their ideas. You might find that it is not as simple as you first thought, and that neither perspective has authority over the domain of philosophy. If one wants to read a philosopher with similar but better argued ideas, they could do worse than Habermas."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"Wolin's masterly monograph \\"The Seduction of Unreason\\" constitutes a major contribution to contemporary intellectual history. Wolin's study dissects various political implications and current repercussions of the ideas and modes of thinking of Joseph de Maistre, Johann Gottfried Herder, Arthur de Gobineau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt, Carl Gustav Jung, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Georges Bataille, Maurice Blanchot, Jaques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Jean Baudrillard. In two \\"political excursuses,\\" he indicates how the ideas of these and other - partly, highly respected - thinkers who, in one way or another attacked some basic Western values like rationalism and human rights, have via the \\"Conservative Revolution,\\" and German and French so-called \\"New Right\\" gained influence on extremely right-wing parties as well as on mainstream politics. Wolin's usage of the term \\"fascism\\" in the book's title, to be sure, could be seen as misleading in so far as only some of the protagonists of his fascinating story were full-blown fascists. Still, his study is a valuable addition not only to the history of ideas, but also to comparative fascist studies in that it presents many illuminating cases illustrating why and how ideas have consequences, in general, and in which way anti-rational and anti-democratic thought can be utilized by fascist movements to justify dictatorship, ethnic cleansing and violence, in particular. The book is thus a valuable addition not only within the fields of cultural studies and history of science, but could also be of use in seminars on extremist politics. It forcefully debunks the idea that the ideational sources of ultra-nationalism and fundamentalism in both the inter- and post-war Europe are solely to be found among marginal scholars and publicists. Wolin's study is eye-opening in that illustrates how some major trends in 20th century mainstream humanities have played the role of, and are, partly, still functioning as, catalysts for the spread and acceptance of radically ascriptive views of human beings, and extremely right-wing ideologies."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"Wolin presents a clear view of the political impliations of postmodernism's program."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"This is a wonderful book. Anyone appalled by the trendy popularity of postmodernism for a decade or more, and the devastating impact its preposterous claims for difference, identity, etc., has had on social justice movements for equality, liberty, and solidarity, should go right out and get it--whether or not you're suffering in a university or on a department full of left-over postmodernists driving BMWs and wearing Gucci while proudly using unintelligible jibberish to impress undergrads and intimidate grad students, perhaps in order to lure them to the boudoir as is so often the case. Wolin does a systematic job walking through the thick forest of postmodernism, taking it right to its personifications, takes them up philosophically and historically, and tracks the cat right back to fascist theory and practice.With this firmly supportive evaluation as background, I must say it is a shame Wolin rejects Marx in favor of a slippery case for \\"democracy,\\" a term losing its meaning as fast as postmodernism is losing its panache. Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan, the Ukraine, Russia, and of course the US Supreme Court decision in 2000, the emergence of popular fascism around the world puts a problem in the face of those who abstract democracy and treat it as standing above exploitation.However, other moderate scholars have taken on postmoderism and people need to know about them. Breisach in \\"The Future of History,\\" is one, doing an autopsy on postmodernism with great care. Sivanandan, from the left, attacks cultural politics as a mask to reestablish the rule of capital and racism on new grounds.Wolin's great contribution, read critically, is to bring the critique of irationalism up to date, to disarm the postmodernists of today and expose their fascist underpinnings. This work, however, has been done before, long before. Cornforth, in \\"Marxism and the Linguistic Philosophy,\\" predicted postmodernism, and ripped it up from an unfortunately mechanical stance on Marx.Better, the great Hungarian philosopher's brilliant, but ponderous and hard to find, \\"The Destruction of Reason,\\" (which Wolin references)lay the ground for understanding postmodernism before it existed, tied it to the rise of fascism, and summed up with this: \\"Now irrationalism always begins with this (necessary, irrevocable, but always relative) discrepancy between the intellectual reflection and the objective original. The source of the discrepancy lies in the fact that the tasks directly presented to thought in a given instance, as long as they are still tasks, still unresolved problems, appear in a form which at first gives the impression that thought, the forming of concepts, breaks down in the face of reality, that the reality confronting thought represents and area beyond reason (the rationality of the category system of the conceptual method used so far). Hegel...analyzed a..real road to a resolution of these difficulties... \\"..What if (however) a virtue is made of ...the inability to comprehend the world intellectually? That if a virtue is made of this necessity and the inability to comprehend the world intellectually is presented as a 'higher perception as faith, intuition, and so on? Clearly this problem will crop up at every stage of knowledge and social development, ie., each time that social evolution and hence science and philosophy are forced to make a leap forward in order to answer the real questions arising. ..It is notchiefly intellectual and philosophical considerations which decide a thinker's choice between the old and the new, but class allegiance...(which is often) halted at the threshold of knowledge and turned round and fled in the opposite direction\\".Georg Lukacs (1952) Destruction of Reason, Humanities Press, New Jersey p100.Postmodernism is religion in disguise and its hustlers are the priests and cardinals. At base, one cannot grasp how things change in the real world, or why things are as they are, without a study of dialectics and materialism.

This book is full of erratic observations, not least the notion that Jung was a fellow traveler with the Nazis. Anyone who has read Jung at all well, would know that he devoted considerable energy to the task of trying to understand the 'unreason' which seized hold of the German spirit (Jung actually regarded it as a kind of collective 'posession' by the spirit of Wotan). Unlike Heidegger (and Nietzsche), Jung remained grounded in the positive values of Western civilisation - including democracy. He did not turn his back on 2,500 years of Graeco-Roman/Judeo-Christian culture. To allege that he did is sheer nonsense and exceedingly poor scholarship.Unfortunately, Wolin seems utterly unable to see that there are paradoxes in life - and human reason. In his assessment, America comes out as the exemplary source of 'rational' culture - as against a quirky Europe, prone to unreason and crippling scepticism. But, in its present mode -dominated by Neo-con philosophy, advocating 'full spectrum dominance' ('Amerika uber alles,' we might say) - some scepticism seems needed right now. There is a new 'Macarthyism' at work in the USA - and it is driven by hubris and UNREASON. 'Star wars'is hardly the attribute of a 'rational' culture. America has few friends in the world today - and why? Because its current administration has abdicated from the principles ostensibly lauded in Wolin's book. Quite rightly, that worries many Americans - and platitudes like those served up by Wolin will not make the problem go away.The zenophobia in Wolin's book is part of the problem - not part of the solution. For Wolin, even Europe is 'alien' - so, how much more so is he likely to find problems relating to other, non-caucasian cultures? In this sense - a fatal flaw runs through Wolin's book. He fears fascism - but advocates an agenda whereby one culture stands in judgement of every other, ready to use force - if needs be, in any corner of the world - to protect and assert its alleged superiority - and that, by definition - is fascism. Paranoia and reason don't make good partners."},{"Title":"The Seduction of Unreason: The Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism","review":"In this book New York University Professor Richard Wolin digs up postmodernism in order to kill it yet again. Nicholas Fox demolished it in 1993, Paul Gross and Norman Levitt in 1994, and John O'Neill in 1995.Now Wolin reprises that postmodernism reprised the counter-Enlightenment, concluding banally, \\"Postmodernism's hostility towards 'reason' and 'truth' is intellectually untenable and politically debilitating.\\"Postmodernism was just a version of the ancient idealist claim that objective knowledge is impossible. Idealism is a dangerous, reactionary philosophy, whether religious or post-whateverist, because it denies knowledge, reason and truth, and denigrates science, industry, technology, democracy and socialism. It prefers metaphor, myth and magic.Wolin reminds us that Friedrich Nietzsche was a leading counter-Enlightenment writer, who preached, \\"The annihilation of the decaying races ... Dominion over the earth as a means of producing a higher type.\\" Naturally, Nietzsche adored the Roman Empire, Alexander the Slayer and Cesare Borgia.Later, Third Way theorists in the 1930s flirted with fascism. Martin Heidegger was an outright Nazi, and Carl Jung was a Nazi fellow-traveller. After the war, post-structuralists, like Jacques Derrida, Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault, and postmodernists like Chantal Mouffe were briefly famous. All worshipped Nietzsche.But why does Wolin bother with these discredited poseurs? They have no influence now - who reads Heidegger? Who, apart from his publisher Verso, has ever heard of Mouffe?Wolin's attacks on German and French philosophy chime in with the US state's attacks on 'old Europe'. So Wolin plays up the German and French New Rights, just as Labour plays up the BNP. He obediently links Al Qa'ida with Iraq, and sneers at national liberation struggles, absurdly lumping Fidel Castro with Idi Amin, Mobutu and Duvalier.Wolin reveals his hostility to democracy when he writes of \\"the regressive social psychological tendencies displayed by the masses.\\" Finally, he praises the USA's \\"breathtaking social mobility ... in striking contrast with Derrida's tradition-bound, native Europe.\\"Recent research has proved that the USA has even less social mobility than Europe's nations, but Wolin, in a postmodernist kind of way, doesn't let mere facts get in the way of capitalist dogma!"},{"Title":"The presence of Siva (Mythos)","review":"This book is an absolute treasure trove of oral stories, written lore, poems, historical locations, temples, and writings on the 5000 year old God, Shiva, Lord of Destruction (obstacles).

However, I very much enjoy the atmosphere and the diverse and interesting characters.My issues with this and the first book are the horrible formatting for Kindle. The spacing is way off, with mostly double spacing, sometimes random bigger spaces and single sentences looking like paragraphs, and other times having paragraphs run together, switching points of view with no space at all, just one big run-on glob of prose. Often you have to stop to think and realize that the story is about someone else now, not the person who's been the center of attention for the last five pages. There are hyphens in the middle of longer words in the middle of sentences (on the Kindle) that I assume are leftover from the print version where a word didn't fit on a line and was carried onto the next. I also found a few outright spelling errors or use of the wrong form of a word both in this and the first book in the series. This is extremely distracting at least to me, pulling me out of the story time and again. If I had actually purchased this book rather than borrowing from the library, I would have been complaining very loudly and asking for a refund.

I really appreciated his first Hal Challis novel entitled \\"Dragon Man\\" and launched into this, his second Challis novel, with the hope that Disher hadn't gotten an attack of sophomore slump. He did not. He built nicely on that first novel without using it as a crutch, and expanded and enriched our familiarity with the sounds and surrounds of peninsular Victoria province Australia. The only problem is that he built too much. This is a good book with too many story lines and it took a lot of work to read it. Which doesn't mean that I didn't like the book.

It was a good, effective way to reestablish them. And even as I type this, I realize that this book is all about these people and the crimes they investigate are secondary to their own lives and interactions. And that's just fine.

From the quiet hills of New England to the marbled halls of the Capitol and dusty battlefields of the Civil War, their thoughts, prayers and fears come alive as can only happen in private letters.Anderson has done a wonderful job of weaving delightful anecdotes and insightful facts into the narrative, blending them naturally with the Cilley letters themselves. As a result the lives of the characters flow seamlessly with the events of the time, an era in American history that is little studied and only vaguely understood today. It was a time of tremendous turmoil and remarkable change, and it all comes to life through the words of a Jacksonian Congressman, his pious wife, and their sons, officers in the Union Army and Navy during the Civil War.The letters are transcribed exactly as they were written, complete with spelling and grammatical errors, by the members of this singular family. They speak of a time when death was as common as life, when children were lost with frightening regularity, when the horrors of war were secondary to its glory, and when the survival of the nation was all but certain. This is a book of history, authentic to the last detail, but beyond that it is a fascinating story."},{"Title":"A Breach of Privilege: Cilley Family Letters, 1820-1867","review":"This is a wonderful book. A great read for anyone even if they aren't related to this historic family. The letters bring to life the people and life in the early 1800's. They did a wonderful job transcribing the letters and the Author has done a great job with explainations on how life was then."},{"Title":"A Breach of Privilege: Cilley Family Letters, 1820-1867","review":"Via the medium of personal letters written between 1820 and 1867, the author has succesfully brought to life an era in the history of our early republic. She has defly connected them into a cohesive narrative. Her historical insights enhance the story. What I liked best was that it is a good read for the general public."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"A brief synopsis: Rose Larabee is a single mother, who's husband has died not too long ago. She's also still recovering from a heart transplant and is working part-time in a small bookshop. She receives a valentine in the mail, and although this shouldn't seem weird, it isn't addressed, and this bothers Rose. Little things start to happen and while Rose is suspicious, she thinks that she's just overreacting. Over the next couple of weeks, Rose finds herself the object of someone's mad obsession.I went into this book expecting the typical &quot;whodunit&quot; mystery, but I came out of this pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a fast-paced thriller (in my opinion). The pace was a sort of saunter, dropping clues here and there while keeping the reader interested. The characters were lovable. I found myself really caring for Rose -- even relating to her in some aspect. Once the story was over, I found myself surprised (as I mentioned before). The &quot;villain&quot; was the last person I suspected.The only thing that irked me about the book was the tense it was written in. I'm not use to reading a story that uses present tense (as opposed to the usual past-present tense that most writers used). I found it hard to get into this story at first, and it distanced me away from the story in certain places. That's only a minor grievance, though. As you continue through the book, it becomes less and less of a problem. I'll have to look into more of Ms. Straub's work."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"It has not been a very good year for Rose Larrabee whose husband was electrocuted fourteen months ago while fixing light bulbs outside their Laurel Bay, Long Island home. Rose had a heart transplant two years ago and the medicine she needs is very expensive as is raising two young children on a bookseller's salary. Her sister-in-law helps her as much as she can but the lonely nights take a toll on Rose.Life gets even worse when she receives a heart in the mail with no return address. Somebody leaves box of chocolates in her car with no card, a gift box mysteriously turns up on her pillow, and inside is a gold heart engraved to Angela. Rose begins to feel like she is being stalked and when her boss is found murdered in front of her house, the police begin to take the threat seriously. However, her stalker manages to find her when she is alone and vulnerable and it will take a miracle to save her now.Wendy Corsi Staub has written an exciting suspense thriller that will keep readers turning the pages until they find out whom the killer is. The various sub-plots seamlessly tie back to the fast-paced and intricately drawn (with subtle gothic elements) prime story line. The heroine is a woman who endears herself to the audience who hopes she will not become the murderers third victim.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"Mary Higgins who??

I will buy more of her books now that I have read this one."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"I am happy to say that I have found a mystery author that is as good as or better than MHC earlier novels. She Loves Me Not was a riveting read and the ending surprised me. I suspected many different people of being the Secret Admirer but I was wrong. Though I do enjoy putting the pieces together to figure out who-dun-it, I still appreciated the surprise. I have read a couple of Ms. Staub's other mysteries and have found them all to be hard to put down reading. They keep you up late at night trying to finish and prove your theory right (or wrong). Overall a great find!"},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I read this book. I could not put it down! Very suspenseful! Well drawn characters; I really felt like I knew them. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"This review is for all of Wendy Corsi Staub's books. The first book I read by this author was Lullaby and Goodnight, which was maybe a year ago. I loved it so much that I went and bought all of her books and read them all in a month. I just finished her newest one \\"The Final Victim\\" and even though it is a long book (474 pages) once I was done with it I was left wanting more. I know she is working on her next novel, but I just wish that she would write faster:) Anyways go, buy and read any of her mystery (except Dearly Beloved). I guarantee you will fall in love with her style and you'll be left wanting more. Just for a reference, I like mystery books where cops and detectives are not involved a lot. My favorite authors are, of course, Wendy Corsi Staub; Mary Higgins Clark, Patricia MacDonald, Carlene Thomson and Sidney Sheldon. Good luck."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"Like all of your reading in the present tense (she is seeing this; she is now tasting that; he is feeling such-and-such)? If so, this is your book. If not, stay away. I suppose the current present-tense-vogue adopted by otherwise excellent writers is designed to lend a sense of action and immediacy. To me, not having anything appear in the past, nothing in the future, is so artificial that it destroys the value of the book."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"There was a children's game I remember seemed puzzling, pulling the pedals off a white daisy saying \\"He loves me, he loves me now.\\" If the pedals are uneven, you have a happy feeling of being loved. If they are even, you feel let down because \\"he loves me not.\\" No matter how many daises you demean, the result is not always the same. What's puzzling about that quandry? Who is he?! A child is too young to feel romantic or sexual love. Wendy uses this little rhyme to make some sense out of the valentines Rose finds in her mailbox that year.These are not bought cards, candy in heart-shaped boxes (though a stranger handed me one in Walgreen's one year, one in many he was buying for all the women in his life); the crudely-made \\"paper hearts with no verse or signature, were not the gift of a 'secret admirer.'\\" He was a stalker -- watching Rose at her 48 Shorewood Lane address. That Valentine's Day was snowy, and he left footprints outside her windows. I remember one February the snow weas so deep in middle Tennessee (close to Alabama), and the roads icy. It seemed to take forever to walk in a roundabout way in the middle of the pavement to mail Valentine cards to my sons. It took so long to ge to the post office and back home I ended up with a very bad cold. Rose's stalker is a twisted killer with Tourette Syndrome and used violence against the three young women like that monster assassin did to the young professional woman in the movie, 'Red Eye.'Liza receoved a business proposition: \\"Dear Ms. Danning: As you may or may not be aware, I am the author of several best-selling spy novels over the past ten years. Since my editor retired last month, I have been searching for a new home for my novels. Would you be interested in meeting me to discuss this possibility? Enclosed is a round-trip train ticket to Westwood, Rhode Island, for the second week of February. You will stay at the Bramble Rose Inn. It is imperative that you keep this metting confidential. Sincerely, David Micahel Yates.\\" Liza wondered, \\"How on earth did he decide on me of all people?\\" He is an eccentric recluse whose face is unknown as he will not allow his photo to be on his books. It is rumored that his face is deformed, shot up in Vietnam; or the fact that he may be a woman. She'd read in an article that he was about to depart for Europe to research his newest novel and was seeking a new publisher.Jennie received a letter also: \\"Dear Ms. Towne: It is our pleasure to inform you that you have won the grand prize and hereby entitled to an all-expenses-paid weekend in February at the Bramble Rose Inn. Sincerely, Jasper Hammel, Innkeeper.\\" She was to get rount-trip transportation on the Crosswinds Bay ferry. He lures the three women, Rose, Liza, Jennie (posing as Laura) to a magical weekend. This is the culmination of much planning, as he has been watching them for so long now. It is predicted to be a 'stormy' weekend in February.Wendy Corsi Staub has also written ALL THE WAY HOME, FADE TO BLACK, and DEARLY BELOVED. This is a nice little thriller in the guise of a romance gone bad. Nothing and no one will ever be the same after this Valentine's Day."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"Wendy Corsi Staub is definitely the new Queen of Suspense! She Loves Me Not grabs you from the very first page and does not let you go. This is a fast paced, brilliantly plotted suspense/thriller that is absolutely impossible to put down. I couldn't wait for my copy to arrive in the mail and it was well worth the wait! Wendy has so much talent as an author that I would love to see her books come out in hardcover. She keeps you guessing until the very end and her writing style is a gift. Anyone out there who is a fan of mystery/suspense must read this book. The setting is perfect, a little Long Island town in the middle of winter. The characters are wonderfully developed and it is filled with nail-biting suspense.

She has plenty of reason for concern - widowed at a very early age and facing a serious heart condition, Rose treasures each joy that comes her way, including a mysterious Valentine she receives in the mail.The Valentine appears to be the first clue in a series of mysteries that follow her. Small items begin to vanish around the home. At first, she suspects Leo who has a habit of picking things up innocently because they caught his interest. In time, she began to fear there was something sinister about the Valentine and wonders if there is a connection between it and the items that are supposedly misplaced in the home.A long list of suspects begins to emerge. A neighbor, distraught over her crumbling marriage and desire for a child appears to have an agenda. A co-worker in the Long Island bookstore where Rose works might have some insight into the bizarre mail and missing items. Two other women, one who had been given the gift of sight through an organ donor and another woman whose life improved after an organ transplant are murdered. Neither woman lives near the other and none of the women knew each other. The mysteries interlock and deepen - is Rose somehow connected with the two murdered women? And what could possibly be the link that binds them all?This is an intensely riveting book that I really enjoyed. It is brilliantly written and will keep readers eager to find out more about each of the well developed characters. This is a high caliber mystery."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"I have read all of Wendy Corsi Staub's novels (excluding her latest-&quot;Dearly Beloved&quot;) and have enjoyed all of them. This one seemed to start a little slow, but it could have been just the fact that with a 9 mo. old I have little time to read, so it took me a while to get into it. Once I did though, it was a very good read. Every time something happens to Rose, Staub sets it up where it could be anyone in the book who is responsible, she makes sure that each character is &quot;busy&quot; or &quot;missing&quot; during the acts. She &quot;tricks&quot; you with each set-up and keeps you guessing. You do not know who it is until the end.

It's the first one I've read by this author, but it won't be the last. I picked it up on a whim because the cover copy made reference to Mary Higgins Clark. I enjoyed this book more than hers.

I recommend this book to all who enjoy a great suspense story."},{"Title":"She Loves Me Not","review":"I gave this a five star although my rating would be more like a 4 1/2. I really like Staub's writing, but sometimes the main character can be a little whiney for me and goes on and on about their drama.

It moves at the speed of a turtle in molasses, and though, at the time of writing I have not completed reading the book, the identity of the killer seems obvious (as it did from from the beginning). This is always a bit disappointing; one prefers to be surprised in the end. I feel that her story must have been fairly thin, so she felt the need to fill it up with pointless fillabuster-like dialogue and internal monologue. I would recommend one of her earlier, faster-paced novels instead of this one."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"This book by Agatha Christie was ok. It started out real slow and ended real slow. It didn't really get to the exciting parts of the book and made me fall asleep. THis is by far the worst Agatha Christie book i have ever read"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I read this book about 20 pages at a time every Sunday. Sunday's aren't exactly my cup of tea. It's the day after the weekend when I'm tired and sleep most of the day. What I read of the book I didn't really enjoy at all. British literature dosn't exactly make much sense to me. I don't understand some of it. Other parts are just so boring that I couldn't even tell you what I was reading. Perfect example: \\"I am quite sure\\" said Hercule Poirot\\". \\"When a thing arranges itself so, one realizes that it must be so, one only looks for reasons why it should be so. If one does not find the reasons why it should not be so, then one is strengthened in one's opinion.\\" This didn't make a bit of sense to me, and most of the book was like that."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Agatha Christie does it again.

I would recommend this book to any body who loves a good old fashioned murder mystery"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I expected paperback. The book was hardbound, but that's fine. The book arrived on time and it's in good shape. It didn't have a paper book jacket, but that's not important to me. I'd order a used book again."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I enjoyed this story. Agatha Christie wrote this tale of a child's murder at a Halloween Party in 1969 when she was almost 80. It was the next to last Poirot novel she wrote (excepting, of course, \\"Curtain\\" which she wrote during WWII.) It is an entertaining tale but the plot lacks some of the sophisticated craftsmanship of her earlier work. She takes time to digress and complain a bit about the decline of moral values and public safety she sees around her in the late 60's, particularly the supposed increase in the number of people who should be safely locked up in mental institutions. These asides force her uncharacteristically to rush her plot to a conclusion using a series of plot devices that are not earlier prefigured. At least Poirot is now old enough to admit that his tight patent leather shoes are very uncomfortable for walking in the English countryside!This Kindle edition is well done and remarkably free of the careless typos of other Kindle publications and worth the price. Several French phrases and a verse from a French song are rendered correctly with accent marks. The edition contains several extras including a short biography and a bibliography of Agatha Christie, synopses of all Poirot mysteries, and an essay by Poirot expert Charles Osborne. Chapters are accessible by number with the 5-way toggle."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"\\"Halloween Party\\" is one of the later Agatha Christie mysteries, first published in 1969, and is perhaps (to my reckoning at least) one of the last great mysteries that she wrote before time began to take its toll. Although there are a few cracks in the plot, \\"Halloween Party\\" is still a riveting murder mystery, with all the false leads, red herrings, plot twists and all-important \\"psychology\\" that are the hallmarks of a Poirot mystery.Ariadne Oliver - a reoccurring character who closely resembles Christie herself - is reluctantly helping out at a children's Halloween party. Ariadne is the center of attention on this particular night considering her career as a writer of murder mysteries, and halfway through the festivities a young girl pipes up with an extraordinary statement: that she once witnessed a murder, though it wasn't until years later that she realized it *was* a murder. Since the girl is a renowned storyteller, the rest of the party dismisses her claims.But by the end of the night, Joyce Reynolds has been drowned in the bobbing-for-apples bucket. A near-hysterical Ariadne calls up Hercule Poirot for help, and our favorite Belgian detective soon finds himself embroiled in another mystery. Poirot decides to take Joyce's claim that she once witnessed a murder seriously, and so asks his police contacts to dredge up any unsolved murder cases in the area that Joyce may have seen. There are four possible murders that Joyce might have witnessed, but as Poirot digs deeper into each one, he finds that things are more complex than he could have ever imagined.What's striking about \\"Halloween Party\\" is its eerie, spooky atmosphere. Though it's set in the typical English village, there is a fairytale quality about it, particularly when Poirot explores a sunken garden in an old quarry that puts him in mind of Eden even as it puts him instinctively on edge. Frequented by a strange, unworldly little girl and rumored to be the site of a hidden well, Poirot can't help but feel that it holds the key to the most recent murder.The suspects are more lightly sketched than usual (and the discerning reader will notice that Christie calls attention to the killers by exploring them in more detail), which means that there is less human interest than in her very best work, but \\"Halloween Party\\" still manages to impress with its winding plot and creepy ambiance. Because of the age of the murder victims, there is a genuinely chilling air to the story, and I was on tenterhooks waiting for the killer to be revealed before another innocent life was lost.Also telling is the time period in which this was written. In many of her later books Christie expresses her bafflement with the youth culture of the 1960s, with a definite air of \\"back in my day...\\" griping. In this case she casts a stern glance on parenting standards, police procedure, fashion styles, and long hair. I actually blinked when the word \\"lesbian\\" came up. Suffice to say, Christie's later publications have lost a little bit of their charm, being written too recently for most readers to enjoy the nostalgic quality that was apparent in those set further back in the 1920s - 1940s.But Poirot is in good form here and Ariadne is a hoot, particularly since her partiality for apples is severely put to the test. I'm far from completing Christie's entire canon of novels, but I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Halloween Party\\" ends up being in my top ten favorites."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Agatha Crhistie's HALLOWE'EN PARTY has her alter ego Adriane Oliver helping a friend stage a Halloween party for a group of pre-teens.Apples are a favorite snack for Adriane and she helps Joyce set up a barrel for bobbing in the library. Joyce is rather a show off and to impress Mrs. Oliver she brags to Adriane that she witnessed a murder two years ago.Joyce is found sunk in the barrel at the end of the party. Adriane enlists her friend Hercule Poirot to investigate the murder. When a second murder occurs Poirot must employ all of his little gray cells to bring a killer to justice.A later Christie when she had all the techniques down to their polished best.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Anyone who enjoys modern philosophy will get a kick out of the heroine of HALLOWEEN PARTY, the incredibly gorgeous \\"Undine\\"-esque blonde, Judith Butler, who shares a strange, prophetic resemblance to the present day theorist and author of GENDER TROUBLE--also called Judith Butler. I wonder if Ms. Butler has read this book but I imagine she has, she's an omnivorous reader with high levels of intellectual curiosity, and she would find so much about \\"performing gender\\" here she could write another sequel to her own famous work.One of the better late Christie novels for sure, HALLOWEEN PARTY takes it time getting started but winds up genuinely involving. I wanted to find out who dun it and I didn't like being interrupted in my reading of the final chapters. But that's not to say it doesn't have its problems!The central mysteries that Poirot must solve are, what if anything did little Joyce Reynolds see--she claimed to have witnessed a murder and someone shuts her up by drowning her in a tub bobbing with apples! And also what did Rowena Drake see when she dropped an entire glass vase of autumn perennials down a flight of stairs? I have read this book a few times now and always get caught up in figuring out these two mysteries. For Christie lovers, this plot has comforting echoes of previous books, for example the mysterious gaze on Marina Gregg's face in THE MIRROR CRACK'D FROM SIDE TO SIDE with Miss Marple. I found the central situation of the landscape architect, beautiful Michael Garfield, a little bit like ENDLESS NIGHT and strangely reminiscent of Christie's beautiful short story, \\"In the Cool of the Evening\\" published in STAR OVER BETHLEHEM.I also enjoyed having the two teenage boys of the novel step up in their hippie outfits, rose colored vests and fawn trousers, and turn into Poirot's two Baker Street Irregular boys. Wish we had seen more of them in other novels by Christie, for I was getting pretty tired of Ariadne Oliver by this juncture! What about that Halloween party with the \\"snapdragon\\" game and that strange one where the girls gather in a dark room and look into a mirror to see the faces of the men they will marry? Christie utterly fails to spell out the mechanics of this one in a way that anyone could understand, and what a shame, for I am having an upcoming party and would love to have a hand mirror in which my guests both male and female would gaze and instead of seeing their own faces, they'd see some spectral ghost faces of like, Brad Pitt or no, I know, the late Brad Renfro (RIP)!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Christie still has it, the ability to bewilder and amaze, at age 79! She shows herself capable of making poignant and truthful observations, throughout the book, about youth, the changing state of society, and of course, the mind of those capable of crime and murder. I am always facinated by the amount of quotable quotes in any Christie novel.It is true that some later Christie novels are not quite as palatable as her earlier work, but this is simply not one of them. As fresh as her first works, with a believable ending and a incredible and intriguing motive for one of her characters, I'm wondering how anyone could read this and not see the value. Christie shines when she takes out Poirot, and the duo of Oliver and Poirot is a treat.The only flaw I see here is Christie's inability to see 'lower class' servants as capable of being worth as much as the upper classes, but she was a Victorian, and raised with prejudice. Still, the continual references in her books to servants who morbidly get excited about death, who are stupidly superstitious, who cannot make inferences, or in short behave like common sheep get to be wearing. Christie is also racist; Frenchwomen, Englishwomen, Americanwomen, and those from the 'colonies' are highly bred and of good bearing, but those from Spain, Italy, and other 'ethnic' countries are too often dismissed in a single sentence and described as having 'a simple good nature and flashing teeth'. Ouch. I won't even go into how she describes Arabics.So long as you can view her work for what it is, a excellently crafted, yet lighthearted murder mystery, written by an Englishwoman born to priviledge, who lived in somewhat of an ivory tower, you will be able to enjoy."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"This is one of Christie's easier mysteries to figure out but the murders are just nasty enough to be almost comical. The drowning of children shouldn't be funny but here, I think Agatha was in a dark, black comedy mood. Besides, the 2 victims are rather obnoxious... so it makes it more humorous. While you'll guess the whodunit right away (how can you not?), she does throw in a few twists at the end that only Poirot could have unravelled. Not a great book, but not bad either. After all, Christie did write it and she seldom wrote a bad story in her career. Good stuff, as one reader mentioned, to curl up with in autumn weather."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The lovable mystery writer, Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, is visiting a friend in a London suburb called Woodleigh Common and helping host a party for the community's teenagers. There are costumes, pumpkins, games, and...oh, yes...a murder, of course. The young girl who earlier in the evening had bragged that she had once witnessed a murder is found dead in the tub used to bob for apples. Mrs. Oliver hurries to London to locate her friend Hercule Poirot and ask for his assistance. Poirot would not think of turning down his old friend and immediately sets about learning all he can regarding the residents of Woodleigh Common. An au pair girl who has mysteriously vanished and a landscape architect who loves his work are just two of the interesting characters Poirot will deal with before his little grey cells put the pieces of the puzzle together in time to prevent another murder."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"One would think that by 1969, Hercule Poirot (created by Agatha Christie in 1920!) would have lost most of his trademark charm, but such is not the case. HALLOWE'EN PARTY (one of my favorite Christie mysteries of all) has an ingenious solution, the requisite \\"explanation scene\\" - and an elegiac quality which puts it in a class virtually by itself: this is fine literature as well as fine suspense. After nearly fifty years, Poirot and his creator are as brilliant as ever."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"When I read the publisher's summary of Hallowe'en Party, I immediately expected it to become my favourite Agatha Christie novel. After all, it had everything that I look for in a good mystery: an interesting murder victim, a haunting setting, and complex cast of characters. My expectations, however, were not met in the least.The story started off well-enough; a young girl is found drowned in an apple-bobbing bucket after she boasts about having witnessed a murder. As usual, Poirot is called onto the case and the simple murder turns into a complex web of lies and forgeries.Unfortunately, from this point on, Hallowe'en Party began to lose a lot of its steam. One of my biggest problems with this book is the sheer amount of soap boxing that Agatha Christie decided to engage in. When I started reading this story, I had no clue when it was published. However, it was easy to tell that it was one of her later stories as she goes off on tangents about children becoming too independent, parents letting children go off on their own, pop stars, genetics etc. Instead of focusing on the mystery aspect or the psychology of the murderer, most of the characters seemed concerned with the societal influences leading up to the girl's murder. My other problem with Hallowe'en Party was the character development. Usually when I read one of Agatha Christie's novels, I find myself becoming attached to some of the characters and thinking \\"Oh! I hope s/he's not the murderer!\\" However, that didn't happen with this book. Most of the critical characters only appeared for a few pages. As a result, it was difficult to become attached to any of them. I also find that the best Poirot books have little interactions occurring between the murder suspects (which Poirot occasionally manipulates to produce friendships or romances). This was completely absent here.The last quarter of the novel regained some its momentum. However, the resolution of the murder was downright strange. I don't mind this. It's fun to see Agatha Christie take her 'solutions' into different directions. This was certainly different.All in all, Hallowe'en party is an interesting story. However, it lacks a lot of the action and excitement that are found in earlier Poirot mysteries. I found myself not particularly caring for any of the cast, and downright annoyed by Christie's tangents and societal observations (which did not contribute to the psychology of the story at all). If you've read most of the Poirot mysteries, then by all means, read this one as well. But, if you're a newcomer to Agatha Christie, I'd recommend starting with one of her earlier novels (i.e. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder in Mesopotamia, Death on the Nile, etc)."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I feel this is one of Christie's very best, with both Hercule Poirot and Christie's mystery writer Ariadne Oliver adrift in a bizarre, unearthly setting. A perfect book to read as Halloween approaches, it has a truly bewitching feel to it, with a mysterious hanging garden constructed in a quarry as backdrop to the strange goings on. The characters, ranging from slightly odd children to menacing adults, add to the haunted feel of the book. In the midst of it all, Poirot's offended and suspicious air, and Oliver's battiness are quite amusing. Well worth the read. Come September, get yourself a copy of this, and of Tom Tryon's Harvest Home, and have a truly spooky, atmospheric autumn!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Good story -though not my favorite Poirot - because toward second half the investigation tends to drag on a bit (but again this is only very mild criticism). Interesting in the book Agatha's description of teenagers of the time and how they celebrated Halloween back then. I was surprised that the same teens issues (ie drugs, doing silly things, etc.) were similar as of today : )"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"In Hallowe'en Party we see Agatha Christie at the top of her form. As usual, this is a fairly \\"closed-room\\" mystery, with Hercule Poirot summoned to solve a murder that took place at a large estate in a small English town. Although Christie always throws out plenty of red herrings, in this book it was more subtly done than usual, so that the identity of the murderer wasn't quite so obvious. Also, the fact that the victim was a child lent a more somber, even sinister tone to the story. The character of Ariadne Oliver was well done, not at all as ridiculous as she is in some of Christie's other books.The whole motive behind the murder was, when revealed, somewhat convoluted, but that is typical of Christie. In Hallowe'en Party it wasn't so far-fetched as to be unbelievable, as is the case with some of her other stories.As with most of the Agatha Christie books produced by Chivers Audio, the narrator did an excellent job."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Plot:A girl says during a Halloween party that she saw a murder and then later in the evening is found dead.

She and some other children overhear a 12 year old, Joyce bragabout how she saw a murder once. Naturally the other children andadults thought she was lying as she was often found doing aboutalmost everything. She kept insisting she had seen a murder. Atthe end of the halloween fete, Joyce was found with her head inthe apple barrel where the kids had been dunking for apples. Someonehad kept pushing Joyce,s head in, murdering her. Mrs. Oliver got tothinking about what Joyce said about witnessing a murder anddecided to consult her friend, our favorite detective with thelittle grey cells, M. Poirot. People kept insisting Joyce had beenlying about seeing a murder and it had nothing to do with hermurder but after all it seemed a rare coincidence. There are alotof twists and turns but somehow Christie gets bogged down inconversations with potential suspects. I just didnt enjoy this oneas I have many others. Although I stll say Christie was far superiorto any mysteries written in present day."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver was visting a friend and agreed to help her organize a Halloween party for the village teenagers. The party was a great success despite Ms. Oliver's assistance until a rather overbearing young girl was found drowned in the apple bobbing bucket.Ariadne turned to her friend, Hercule Poirot, for help in solving this crime. Together the two work to discover just who could have wanted the 13 year old dead and why. Along the way scandals from the past are uncovered, another murder committed and unsupected ones found. Apparently the peaceful village had been hiding blackmail, forgery, multiple murders, greed and madness for years.The only things that were stumbling blocks to my enjoyment of the story were the lack of explanation of various terms like 'eleven plus' and references to the English school system - grammar school vs secondary modern and A-levels. I found these references distracting from the main story. The other thing I found annoying was a bit where a mother, who had been described at length as a loving, caring, responsible and intelligent parent wants to leave her child behind while she goes away for a few days. Not only does she want to leave the child behind but proposes to leave her behind with a family that had already had two family members murdered in the past two weeks. I found that very unrealistic and a very uncharacteristic 'blooper' on the part of Christie.Still this 1969 novel has held up well, the action could take place today just as easily as 40 plus years ago. I highly recommend this mystery, particularly for fans of the scatty Ariadne Oliver."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"This was a good book to read, unfortunatly the author seemed to stray a bit from the main topic. Both the beginning and the ending were excellant but the middle 150 pages were rather dull. It basically repeated itselve over and over again, constantly saying the same clues. The beginning starts off with a Hallowe'en Party held in the home of Mrs. Rowena Drake. A young girl, Joyce Reynolds, was known as a potentail lier. She tried to impress Mrs. Oliver,(a mystery author) by saying that she had once witnessed a murder. Later on that evening while everyone else was enjoying watching the snapdragon Joyce was found laying dead with her head in a bucketful of water used for bobbing apples in. She obviously been murdered. Mrs. Oliver called in her good friend Hercule Poirot to crack the case. Towards the middle of the book it seemed to get rather bland. For the next 3/4's of the book Poirot travels around the town questioning everyone. All the people say pretty much the same thing, they're just presented in slightly different ways. A lot of other mysteries get tied into it. In the end the final solution is presented in a rather confusing way. This is a good book to read once, and only once. Written By: LFC"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Mrs. Ariadne Oliver, a mystery writer, was staying with her friend, Judith Butler, at Woodleigh Common. Mrs. Oliver and Ms. Butler went to Mrs. Rowena Drake's house to help prepare for a Hallowe'en Party with other people. The Hallowe'en Party was for children. During the preparations, a young girl, Joyce Reynolds, spoke of witnessing a murder a couple years ago. Joyce Reynolds was known for making up bizarre stories. Someone that was helping out with the preparations heard what Joyce said and didn't take any chances. Joyce was murdered. She drowned in a pale of water used to bob for apples in the library during the party later that night. Mrs. Oliver wasted no time. She quickly went to her former policeman friend, Hercule Poirot, and asked for his help with finding Joyce's murderer. Mr. Poirot immediately began interrogating people that were preparing for the party. He made little progress. Mr. Poirot then went to his old police-force colleague, Superintendent Spence, who lived in Woodleigh Common. Mr. Poirot asked Mr. Spence for a list of murder cases dating back a couple years. One case was about a Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe. Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe was an old, rich widow, who lived in a great house surrounded by beautiful gardens. She had many assistants that helped her out with all her work in the gardens. Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe had always had a will giving the majority of her money to her nephew and his wife. Suddenly, she died, and her will left the majority of her money to an au pair girl. The will said she was giving her money to the au pair girl because she helped out much when she was sick. Lawyers saw that Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe's signature on the will was forged. All of a sudden, the au pair girl disappeared. This case made Mr. Poirot curious. Mr. Poirot began questioning everyone who was preparing for the party again. He asked them if they knew anything about the Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe case. He learned that Michael Garfield created the beautiful gardens for Mrs. Llewellyn-Smythe. He asked him some questions. He learned that Michael wanted money to buy a Greece Island and make it a beautiful garden. Mr. Poirot also learned about Miranda Butler, Judith Butler's daughter, and that her best friend was Joyce Reynolds. Miranda loves nature and is always outside enjoying it. Miranda was looking for an old wishing well that was covered by plants, while Mr. Poirot was talking to Michael. Michael claimed he knew where the well was, but he wouldn't tell Miranda. One of the people who were at the party was Miss Whittaker. She told Mr. Poirot that she saw Mrs. Drake coming down the stairs during the party holding a vase filled with water. She said she saw her look in the direction of the library and then suddenly dropped the vase. Mrs. Whittaker concluded that Mrs. Drake saw something that startled her, maybe the murderer. Mr. Poirot went to see Mrs. Drake. Mrs. Drake said she didn't see anything, although Mr. Poirot did learn that Mrs. Drake's husband was dead. A little while later, after Mrs. Drake said she didn't see anything, Leopold Reynolds, Joyce's younger brother, was murdered. Mrs. Drake then admitted that she saw Leopold come out of the library and that was what startled her. She said she thought Leopold killed his sister, and she didn't want to blame a child. Mr. Poirot then understands everything that has happened and why. He solves the crime. I think this book was very exciting and suspenseful. In the beginning of the story, when Joyce Reynolds claims she witnessed a murder, I didn't believe her. I thought she was making everything up. My initial guess as to who murdered Joyce was Ms. Butler. I thought it was logical that it was she. When Mr. Poirot learned about the Mrs. Llewellyn-Smithe case, I immediately thought that case had to do with the murder of Joyce Reynolds. At that point in the book, I was really into the story. When Mr. Poirot met Michael Garfield, I began to think he was the murderer, or had something to do with the crime. As soon as Mrs. Drake said she saw Leopold Reynolds come out of the library, I was totally confused as to whom the murderer was. I love the challenge of solving murder cases like this. When Mr. Poirot explained everything at the end, everything made sense. I realized that the plot was very well organized, and it flowed perfectly. I think Agatha Christie is a fantastic author, and I am looking forward to reading another one of her books. Ariadne Oliver is introduced as a mystery writer. She is very famous, and everyone seems to know her. We learn that she loves apples. They are her favorite things to eat. However, when Joyce is murdered in a pale full of apples and water, Mrs. Oliver can no longer eat apples. She says she will never eat another apple again. Mrs. Oliver began eating dates instead. Mrs. Oliver beginning to eat dates was very important in the story. It gave Mr. Poirot a clue to help himself solve the crime. Mrs. Oliver is a very generous, friendly lady. She willingly helped protect Ms. Butler and Miranda, and she was determined to find Joyce's murderer. Agatha Christie described Mrs. Ariadne Oliver through a process known as indirect characterization. Mrs. Oliver is a flat, dynamic character."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I think to the reader of Mansion Mysteries this is one of the top novels. It uses a quick wit and an excellent cunning of a killer who kills creatively. Christie is at her best, however, his town visit is long and should be read with some Coke or Barqs Root Beer on a cold winter night. Do Not Read On Halloween, you will miss her point. If you read some reviews, you know what I mean."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"This book was great. The people who thought the end was confusing just aren't very smart. The characters were interesting and the ending was lovely!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I've read about 7 or 8 Poirot mysteries and this one just didn't impress me much. Character developlement was weak, plot was muddled, and the story lacked the intensity that I have seen in many of her other books. I found myself missing the excellent quality of her 20's and 30's mysteries. If your a big fan, you might as well read it but don't expect anything like The ABC Murders or The Mysterious Affair at Styles."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"One of Agatha Christie's worst. Painfully obvious who the killers were, and the middle was repetitive and not very interesting. It beats some other books, though."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I certainly haven't read many of Christie's books (only about ten), and although I consider myself a lover of detective stories, I can never figure out who she will choose to be her killer. Every one of her books has stumped me. Except this one.It is so clear who the killer is in this book that, at the critical clue, I actually stopped reading and said to myself, &quot;Is she serious?&quot; I couldn't believe that Dame Agatha had created such a careless mystery. The necessary clues make themselves plainly obvious. Of course I couldn't figure out the whole picture before it was revealed (can anyone?), but I was absolutely certain about whodunnit.Even the character development in this is weak. Usually, she'll give us a couple of really interesting characters to enjoy and take in, but you'll be hard pressed to enjoy anyone other than Poirot and Oliver. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The description clearly states this is hardcover. But the book that arrived is paperback. I'm disappointed as I would have preferred hardcover and thought that's what I was ordering."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Even though \\"Hallowe'en Party\\" was written later in Agatha Christie's career, and some might believe it to be somewhat of a letdown from earlier works, it retains all the trademarks of what make Christie's intricately woven, delightfully detected mysteries so endearing and timeless. With Hercule Poirot serving as the sleuth who steps in to solve the murder, \\"Hallowe'en Party\\" is quick-paced and filled with a cast of characters who seemingly all have something to gain, or hide.When a young teen is found murdered at a Halloween party, Hercule Poirot is called in by a visiting mystery writer. She is troubled by something that the girl had said during preparations for the party. The young victim claims to have seen a murder committed, and Poirot is quick to believe that she was murdered in order for that murder to remain unknown. He soon sets himself to the task of interviewing a wide cast of the town's inhabitants, raising questions about not only present events, but those in the past that just might be connected to the tragedy. When another murder hits too close to home, Poirot knows that he must convince the lawmen in charge that he has fitted the puzzle together correctly.\\"Hallowe'en Party\\" is plotted out to perfection; the solution, and the requisite explanatory chapter in which Poirot explains how he solved the crime at hand, is as ingenious as it is 'right before your eyes' if the reader is paying close attention to the clues. As always, Agatha Christie has fashioned a delectable mystery that has remained timeless in its plot (even if some of the language, and fashions mentioned for that matter, are a bit dated)."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The story begins innocently enough - a children's Hallowe'en party. One of the adult guests is Ariadne Oliver, the famous crime novelist. One of the children at the party, in order to impress Mrs. Oliver claims to have seen a murder committed. No one takes any notice, dismissing her story, until the girl turns up dead at the end of the party. Horrified by the tragedy, Mrs. Oliver turns to her old friend Hercule Poirot for help, despite her belief that women should be running Scotland Yard! Poirot begins investigating and realizes that the child was killed in order to prevent discovery of another, much older crime. But raking up the past is dangerous as it can cause a killer to strike again...very chilling mystery, notable for its air of subtle menace and cruelty. Although the identity of the killer was fairly obvious midway through the book, I think Christie afficionadoes will like the psychological analysis of the motives for the crime, as well as of the criminal. Another good Poirot mystery."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Agatha Christie was a true mistress at presenting unique mystery plots and shocking conclusions! Although Miss Jane Marple is my favorite of her series detectives, Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is just as engaging and worth getting to know. His gentle arrogance and wit alone are well worth taking the time to try one of the instalments in this particular series, not to mention his brilliant deductive powers. \\"Halloween Party\\" is one of Christie's Hercule Poirot works, ranking up there with \\"Death On the Nile,\\" \\"Murder On the Orient Express,\\" and \\"The ABC Murders.\\" The only minor complaint for me is that Captain Arthur Hastings does not appear in this book.This particular instalment involves Poirot's friend, mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, who is helping a friend prepare a halloween party for preteens of the country village. The party is a huge success until one of the girls, who has a habit of revealing more information than she should, is found drowned in the apple bobbing tub. She had told people earlier in the day that she had seen a murder being committed a year or two earlier. Could someone at the party have heard her and decided to silence the girl before she revealed what she knew? Ariadne Oliver enlists the help of Hercule Poirot, and his brilliant \\"Little Grey Cells\\" begin their work. This mystery has a chilling undercurrent, because Christie uses the horrific occurrence of a child being murdered, and Poirot must confront a truly sociopathic killer who will stop at nothing to remain in the dark.The audio verssion of this book is superb, and features John Moffat as narrator. He originally played Poirot on several BBC radio productions of the series, and does well portraying different characters. I thoroughly recommend the book on a long car ride or while working around the house. It will make the time go much faster.Agatha Christie presents readers with another gem! As with mostly all of her books, this one certainly does not disappoint. Please give it a chance. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"One of the later Hercule Poirot novels, this book is deftly written and keeps you guessing until the end. Everytime I thought I had it figured out something popped up that made me question my conclusions.This book has all of Agatha Christie's usual flair for plotting out a plausible solution to a seemingly unsolvable crime. In a few places the narrative seemed a little drawn out, but this was more than made up for by an exciting ending and Christie's excellently descriptive writting.Highly recommended for fans of Agatha Chritie and mystery novels in general."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Hallowe'en Party was published in 1969. It mentions drugs; teenage sex and the decline in morals reflective of the liberated 1960s atmosphere. This is one of the last cases handled with superbly facile genius by the inimitable Hercule Poirot the great Belgian detective created by Dame Agatha.The Plot: Mrs. Ariande Oliver (a crime writer who reminds the reader of Agatha Christie!) attends a Halloween Party. During the party a nosy and habitual lier by the name of Joyce Reynolds is murdered. Joyce is only 13 years old! Joyce is drowned by the murderer as she was in the act of bobbing for apples1 Ariande, a lover of apples, calls in her old pal Poirot to help solve the case. As with all Christie novels the guilty person (s) is not easy to discover until Poirot uses his little gray cells to wrap up a fascinating case.The denoument of the case results in witchcraft, child sacrifice and the dredging up of previous crimes in the town of Woodleigh Common. The plot is tangled but all the loose ends of the nettlesome case are well tied by Poirot.This novel shows Dame Agatha still had her chops at telling a good murder story as she neared the end of her long and illustrious career. No one does an English murder mystery better than the Queen of Crime!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The choice of murder victim in this book is a little different than most Christie victims. The scene is an English village and the murder occurs at a Hallowe'en party for pre-teens. The murder victim was a 13 year old girl, who was known for talking too much, and for making up untrue stories. Aridane Oliver is at the party and when the young girl is found dead, she calls her old friend Poirot to come to solve it. Poirot discovers a killer who is totally without normal human feelings, and more people die or are found dead before he unmasks the true villain. This is late-Christie type fair, but the plot line is tight and there are a number of red herrings to keep the reader guessing. It's interesting to read Christie's take on young people of the late 60's too."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The manner in which Halloween is celebrated in England, with its games, masks, and its emphasis on the macabre, disgusts Poirot. The name Halloween means the Eve of Saints (Day). All Saints Day occurs on November 1. It is a solemn day designed in the Roman Catholic tradition to remember all of the saints. Halloween occurs on the prior eve, on October 31. Perverting this holy day with macabre frivolity can only lead to trouble. And it did. A young girl is murdered and Poirot is called in to investigate and identify the murderer in this well-told, interesting, and sometimes humorous tale.The young girl had blurted out during a Halloween party, surrounded by many children and some adults, that she saw a murder committed some years back. They all laugh at her because she had lied in the past. But shortly thereafter, during the party, she is found dead, drowned in the apple dunking bowl. Poirot discovers that there had been three deaths in the village in the past three years and one disappearance. The first to die was a very old rich woman who did not leave her fortune to her relatives, but to her au pair. The will giving the estate to her relatives had been superseded by a codicil, which was soon shown to be a clumsy forgery. This au pair soon disappeared. A man with a criminal past was stabbed in the back. A school teacher drowned. Are all four incidents related, just some of them, or none? What did the child see? Was she telling the truth? Can Poirot unravel the mystery?"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I love reading mysteries because they really made my brain tick. They deliver more than a mindless hobby, which reading can sometimes be and really gear me up and make me alert for clues, suspects and provide with great satisfaction when I find myself on the right track. Having said that, Agatha Christie and her charming books fit that hunger to a tee, I find their slightly old fashioned approach so charming and alluring that I always finding myself craving them. She is still my favorite mystery author even though I have hundreds of other books, mostly those leisurely silly cozy mysteries that are cute but nowhere near as intricate as a Hercule Poirot mystery.This tale was different than most Hercule Poirot books I read. For starters the story begins with a death of a child, not something I am accustomed to reading, and creepy, depressing as it may be it was a hooking point for the real mystery that seemed to have spanned years back. When a children's Halloween party is disturbed by Joyce, who was found drowned in a tub full of water and apples that were there for apple bobbing, everyone dismisses her previous claims of witnessing a murder as another one of her lies. The trouble was that the girl was known for making things up but did she lie this time or was there truth to what she said? Her corpse was proving one point while logic and clues around it were not making any sense. Poirot decides to investigate any unusual incidents that happened approximately at the time of Joyce's story and tries to connect the past with the present making for a very interesting read.I liked the story but it was hard to follow a few times, the past was far behind yet it was being dug up and spat back at me. So I advise the reader to follow right along, pay attention and when the ending comes together to go over the whole thing in their mind, it will make sense! Overall this was a great read but it made me think more that other Poirot books, of course the answers were right there but I was often mislead by Christie's many red herrings. The murderer was evasive and I was surprised to discover who it was but it made for a great read.- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Readers can always count on Agatha Christie for a fun and interesting whodunit.

Her books are fast, smart and well thought out. The atmosphere is great in this book and she gives you something you rarely see in mysteries or thrillers: children in REAL mortal danger. Adults who would murder children is not a pretty sight and one not easily and only rarely touched on by other authors. Christie hits is straight on here.(SPOILER ALERT)As well thought through as Christie's books usually are, it shocked me that there were two MAJOR problems that made this mystery completely foolish and without sense. It could have been great. The great thing is that in order to solve the central murder...the reader has to go back and find the killer of a murder that happened years before. It's like trying to solve a puzzle within a puzzle. As is that isn't clever enough...the previous murder \\"could\\" have been any one of three separate murders. This set up really keeps the plot twisting back in on itself.That said....it makes no sense that:1.) Miranda would have such a strong friendship with Michael...especially since she'd seen him and Rowen commit a murder!!! HOW on earth would she feel safe and secure around him. Her \\"wanting to be a sacrifice\\" at the end was dumb. It made NO sense. It would have been better if Miranda had only seen Rowena dispose of the body. That would have made her growing friendship with Michael even more dangerous and creepier....because he'd KNOW she knew about the murder....but NOT that he was involved. This would have added credibility to his ability to manipulate her.2.) Michael murdered Olga, who was already beneficiary to the will in question. If he wanted money...why didn't he just marry her? That's what Olga wanted? Why murder her? The excuse for this in the book is LAME. Maybe if he'd had a passionate love affair with Rowena, who convinced him to marry Olga and THEN murder her shortly after so they could be together...THAT would have made sense.3.) The fact that Michael was Miranda's father felt tacked on for extra drama but just turned out to be a \\"groaner\\". Ridiculous. If Miranda's mother KNEW Michael was her father and felt there was something \\"evil\\" about him....it made NO sense that she would let her daughter play alone with him in the woods. Dumb.This book is the classic Christie \\"slow build\\". In fact, the last four chapters are page-turners. Still....when you get to the Big Reveal....it's a let down. I love the set up, atmosphere, kids in danger...etc. It just fell apart for me at the end. This book could easily be revised to make it terrific. As is....it's just all right."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"What \\"improvements\\" have been made for the Berkley edition? There are already major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There are further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further differences still in the Signet, Bantam, and Black Dog & Leventhal editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"This is one of Agatha Christie's most visual mystery. At a party, a girl was drowned in the apple-bobbing tub shortly after boasting she witnessed a murder. The fact that she admitted she didn't know it was a murder at that time did not make her, a habitual liar, believable - but somebody apparently felt threatened enough.Mrs Ariadne Oliver who was present at the party was very upset at the death, especially since it was to her, a famous mystery writer, that the dead girl Joyce was boasting to. She enlisted the help of Hercule Poirot immediately.The setting of this mystery was at a English suburb. Agatha Christie tried to give vivid description of the place and the people, which would be the key to solving the mystery. A beautiful garden, an elfin wisp of a girl, a small community where most people know what happened - including three mysteries from the past. Unfortunately, she could not carry out a perfect job, and had to resort to some rather outright adjectives.This was especially jarring for a murder mystery. The challenge to the readers was not who was the culprit, but rather could Hercule Poirot unravel the thread to bring in the evidence, the motivation and bring a proper conclusion to the mystery.The key would be found in the visual description - I am sure it was very clear in Agatha Christie's mind the picture she wanted to convey, but alas, her words failed to adequately expressed her ideas. Properly done, this would have been a fantastic movie, if the producers could find the right locations."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"I thought that Halloween Party was a very good book. Unfortunately, it started of slow, but it picked up the pace as I started to get to the end of the book. One reason why Agatha Christie is a famous author is because she has great character development in her books, and she expressed her strength in this novel. My favorite detective in Christie's stories' is a man named Hercule Poirot, who was the detective of this story. Christie makes Poirot so good that no real life detective can be anywhere close to as good as Poirot. I found it ironic that there was a character in the story who was also a detective fiction writer, like Christie. The kids try to give the author some ideas for another story. I recommend this book to you if you are a detective fiction fan."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"The copyright for Hallowe'en Party is 1969, when Christie's writing skills were clearly in decline. That's not to say that this book doesn't have some enjoyable bits; it does. One of Christie's great skills is to come up with an intriguing, or at least an interesting, premise. In this book she still manages to do this. A child during the preparation for a Hallowe'en party boasts of having seen a murder when she was \\"very young\\" without having realized that it was a murder; the child is murdered later that evening, during the party itself. And this sets the book into action.Although the premise is interesting - and although the occasional lovely scene does still occur - the book is inadequate. The psychology that is so tight and so convincing in so many other of her books (Five Little Pigs or Cards on the Table) is simply not here. And the tightness of the plotting is absent as well. In fact, after reading it carefully - going back and looking again - I could not understand why the child was killed at all. Given what all the characters said, it did not quite hang together - although I admit that the motivation behind the murder was interesting.Still, if you want to spend some time with Ariadne Oliver (who in this book loses her taste for apples) and Hercule Poirot (who insists in walking around the country in patent leather shoes, no matter how much his feet hurt) this book is harmless."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Of course it's not between the best of Agatha, but all books that have a &quot;Ariadne Oliver the famous crime novelist&quot; are specials to me. My Grandmother, a lady with a great resemblence to Agatha was a fan of Ariadna and so do I. Perharps basically I like the mix of emotions that Agatha put in Ariadne, letting her character transmit her real ideas about her famous detective:&quot;But you've written lots of books&quot; said Joyce; &quot;you make a lot of money out of them, don't you?&quot;&quot;In a way,&quot; said Mrs. Oliver, her thougths flying to the Inland Revenue.&quot;And you've got a detective who's a Finn.&quot;Mrs. Oliver admitted the fact. A small stolid boy not yet, Mrs. Oliver would have thought, arrived at seniority of the eleven-plus, said sternly, &quot;Why a Finn?&quot;&quot;I've often wondered, &quot; said Mrs. Oliver Truthfully.Certainly is a deligth to hear Ariadne/Agatha talk through this book. If this book is a little slow in the begginning you have a good &quot;finale&quot; and I can bet that you are not going to find the murder until the end."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"At the age of 79, when this book was published, Agatha Christie was not capable of producing the tighly-plotted, ingenious puzzle fiction that poured from her pen when she was 39. When one is the world's most published author of all time, however, and when one is still able to hold a pen, the pressure to keep producing yet another 'Christie for Christmas' cannot be discounted. It was to be several years before Agatha Christie's daughter said, 'Now, that is enough, Mum'. This is clearly an elderly author at work here, cunningly presenting characters who are mainly elderly themselves, who can get away lines like, 'You know what young people are like nowadays,' and who tend to end sentences with 'and that sort of thing'. Nevertheless, she provides much of the fun and challenge that you expect in her mystery novels, whatever their date of publication.Her popular creations Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver get yet another airing here, as they investigate the drowning in an apple-bobbing tub of a thirteen-year-old girl at a children's Hallowe'en party, a girl who not long before had boasted that she had once witnessed a murder. Exploring the possibility that the girl were telling the truth, Poirot probes several local deaths and disappearances. Amongst vague and gossipy eldery characters, and unbelievably articulate and poetic adolescents, Poirot makes his way with waxed moustache and patent leather shoes to a solution to the mystery.Agatha Christie repeats many of the tricks she tried in her earlier books. You will find echoes of children's nursery rhymes here and a crime that occurs in a familiar domestic setting. You'll also find an especially lyrical few pages in praise of gardens, mid-way through the novel. Agatha Christie, a garden enthusiast herself, never wrote anything better than these few pages.So expect late vintage Christie here. You may not like the attempt at a nail-biting finish, but you can still respect the author's way of setting up a baffling mystery."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Hercule poirot never dissapoints with his wit and charm.A nice diversion to see him hanging out with ladies and i love when he teams up with Ms. Oliver!"},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"Hallowe'en Party wasn't the best Agatha Christie novel, but it was far from the worst. Ariadne Oliver teams up with Hercule Poirot when a murder or possibly two, has been committed. While I loved the back and forth between Ariadne and Poirot and I love anything to do with Halloween, the mystery left something to be desired. Hallowe'en Party cast suspicion on the killer too obviously and too early. You didn't get to experience the usual surprising Poirot reveals the killer moment. A decent but ultimately unremarkable Christie novel."},{"Title":"Hallowe'en Party","review":"During preparations for a Halloween party a girl announces she had seen a murder several years earlier. At the time nobody believes her, but when she is murdered that evening, some people begin to suspect she was telling the truth. Enter Hercule Poirot. Let the detection begin!Poirot is in top form: listening to everyone, asking what seem to be totally irrevelevant questions, and slowly putting all the pieces of the puzzle together -- classical Agatha Christie.The plot is very good; the characters excellent; atmosphere great; the humor is present but toned down which seems fitting for a story about a murdered child. As always, Miss Christie provides enough clues for the reader to solve the mystery; so this is definitely a 'fair play' book.On the negative side: the pace is overly slow, the writing not as sharp as Christie at her best, and the motive for the crimes not very satisfactory."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I love Fall Guy, but I still miss her boyfriend and his wonderful German shepherd. Wish they'd get back together. The books had more sparkle and Rachel was less depressed."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"Susan Conant and Carol Lea Benjamin have created strong female detectives who use dog training to solve mysteries. But the resemblance ends there. Rachel Alexander is a tough New York licensed PI, not an amateur. She lives alone, without a steady boyfriend, and has a loving but realistic relationship with her dog, a pit bull named Dashiell.Conant's Holly Winter is warm and fuzzy; Benjamin's Rachel Alexander is street-smart and tough. And while Holly Winter is unabashedly a dog fanatic, Rachel Alexander doesn't go into rhapsodies over Dashiell. He's a good dog. She's a good trainer. What else would you expect? Or put another way, you don't have to like dogs to enjoy this mystery, while enjoyment Susan Conant's books will be deepened by dog ownership. I learned that first-hand!And as a result, Benjamin's plots tend to be edgier. Here Rachel discovers she has been named executor of a will for Timothy O'Fallon, a man she met briefly in a pet-therapy group. She agrees, suspecting that the dead man had a reason for asking her to do the job. And of course she's getting paid the customary executor's fee.Rachel learns Tim was a cop from a family with tragedies to rival the more famous Irish family, the Kennedys. She also begins to wonder if his death really was a suicide, especially since she discovers a note from a family member, \\"I saw what you did.\\" A tragic event from Tim's childhood seems to be haunting him today.Up to the very last chapter, I was riveted by the characters, writing and plot. I loved Rachel's discussion of therapy dogs. I enjoyed her interactions with the off-beat Village people. Her encounter with Detective Michael Brody seems headed for a longer romance.Experienced mystery readers will look for villains close to home. Trying not to spoil the plot, I'd have to say that Benjamin doesn't play by the usual detective rules of when to introduce the villain. The climactic scene -- de rigeur for modern mysteries -- seems a little forced.If you like to go back and say, \\"Ah, I see where I could have guessed the ending,\\" you'll be disappointed. But if you want a fast-paced absorbing read, and a chance to spend time in the Village with some interesting people and a delightful dog, this novel is for you. I awarded five stars because I wish I'd had this book on my last airplane ride!"},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"Ms. Benjamin is a gifted writer and this book is up to her always high standards. In addition to being a well written mystery, this book is the most touching account I've read about the impact of September 11th. While never overt, the devastation wrought that day, the pain and loss and change to us all are there in the background, part of the characters just as they are part of the reader. I can't recommend this book highly enough, even if mysteries are not your standard fare I urge you to make an exception for this truly exceptional work."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"This is a terrific book. The characters are compelling, the plot complex, the pace swift. Rachel's evident professionalism is in evidence throughout, while her dog, Dash, adds another dimension to her activities. Beware, though, if you're expecting Dash to solve the crime. Fall Guy is surpringly Hard-boiled, a lot closer to Sue Grafton, then to Lillian Jackson Braun. I heartily recommend it."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I have read most of Ms. Benjamin books and I have to say this was one of the best. It was not the normal who-done-it. Bringing all the pieces of the puzzle together at the end in an unexpected twist.

Being a dog lover myself, I always enjoy the unique manner that \\"Dash\\" is worked into the storyline."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"This is an excellent mystery by Carol Lea Benjamin. I had read some of her earlier books, but this is her best to date. She weaves an interesting mystery -- it's not cookie-cutter like so many of them out there.PI Rachel Alexander is chosen by an NYPD detective as the executor for his estate who tragically dies in a fatal gun-cleaning \\"accident.\\" Rachel barely knew the cop, which adds to the overall mystery as to why he chose her.I found that they mystery became more and more intriguing and the ending was quite a surprise. A good read!"},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"Rachel Alexander barely knew Timothy O'Fallon and certainly has no idea why a man she briefly counseled after 9/11 would name her as executor of his will. But now O'Fallon is dead--another cop suicide by all appearances--and Rachel attempts to understand what could have happened, what it means, and why O'Fallon might ask a private investigator he hardly knew to take this job when he had the entire police department available to him.Rachel finally decides that O'Fallon wanted her to investigate something, but what? She starts with O'Fallon's roommate, a young man O'Fallon had offered a home to after catching him shoplifting. Parker is a piece of work--always chasing an angle, wanting something more from the world, but just how evil is he? For many readers, certainly including myself, Rachel's ongoing training of her pit bull, Dashiell, to be a cadaver dog adds interest to the story.Author Carol Lea Benjamin starts this story slowly. Rachel remains an enigma with no clear motivation other than a compulsive need to live up to O'Fallon's unclear desires for the first half of the book. But as evidence about O'Fallon's death mounts, and as Rachel learns more about Parker and O'Fallon's disfunctional family, I found myself pulled more and more into the story. Benjamin's writing is smooth and kept me involved even in the slow-going early section.Give the book a chance--the payoff is certainly worth it."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I love this aouthor and will be reading her books in the future and I hope she writes many more.Subjects, plots, people and just good solid thought go into these books."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I found the first half of this book a bit slow but interesting. The interesting characters, particularly Brody, the investigating policeman, Irving, O'Connor's neighbor upstairs, and Dashiell, Rachael's dog, kept me going.

At the end, I did quite enjoy it, but more for the characters than the plot."},{"Title":"Fall Guy: A Rachel Alexander Mystery (Rachel Alexander & Dash Mysteries)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. I like to guess who did it from the get go when I read a mystery but this one kept me guessing. I think that Ms. Benjamin did a fantastic job and I highly recommend the book.

By the time she meets with Detective Brody, she remembers that Timothy attended a post-traumatic stress group. She and her therapy dog Dashiell provided assistance to the attendees. What puzzles Rachel is that he only spoke one sentence to her and she never thought Timothy was the type who would have committed suicide.Brody warns her that Parker Bowling, a man Timothy took into his home to help him out and make a new start in life will contact her to get his things out of the sealed apartment. He's a liar, a con man and a thief according to Brody so Rachael should watch him at all times. When they finally meet, he tells Rachel he is staying at his aunt's house, the same relative the police later find floating in the river. When Rachel and Dashiell pass a dumpster, the dog's training kicks in and Rachel knows she's going to find a dead baby in it. She's right; the dead person is one of Timothy's siblings. Rachel now believes Timothy was murdered by a ruthless person who set Parker up to be the fall guy.It's been a long time since a Rachel Alexander mystery was published but she's back and better than ever. The heroine never understands why she was made the executor of Timothy's will but she's glad he did it to because she was able to prove he didn't commit suicide. FALL GUY is a well written cerebral mystery where characterization is more important than the action scenes of this complex and multi-layered crime thriller.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Prophet Operating at a Loss","review":"No one in the world knows Zane better than I do.He wrote a good book that runs the gambit of his experiences.Mania or depression are hollow words that bounce off my heart and simply encourage my love for him.I see a man wrapped-up in his work, as a Coin Dealer and a Writer.

While not getting bogged down in minutia that are endlessly fascinating to physicists, but demoralizing to many physicians, they haven't avoided the concepts which form the basis of MRI such as, K-space, Fourier transform and pulse sequences.

Always consult a more technical book (for example, Liang and Lauterbur) when in doubt."},{"Title":"MRI: The Basics","review":"The book gives a nice summary of everything involved in MRI without being too brief or too in depth."},{"Title":"MRI: The Basics","review":"This is what I would call \\"conceptual MRI,\\" clearly aimed at people who don't need much depth in understanding MRI. I don't hold that against the authors, because the title is \\"MRI: The Basics.\\" It's delivering what it promises.I do hold against the authors the abundance of errors and the lack of brevity in the book. By dumbing down the topic to make the concepts understandable, the authors often got the concepts somewhat wrong. For example, they claim that MRI is achieved by reflection of fields off of nuclei. That's not really accurate, although most readers would probably take it at face value. The book is full of these inaccuracies and sloppy math (e.g., equations in which the dimensions on each side are not equivalent). Regarding brevity, I often find the same statements repeated over and over for several pages. With every new paragraph the authors must start their explanation back at the very beginning, so it takes many words to explain very little.On the plus side, there are very good figures in the book which aid in understanding. If things were explained more concisely, I would want to keep this book around as a reference. But the information is so diffuse that I would have to read a lot to find what I am looking for.If someone has just one opportunity to learn about MRI or just needs to be able to run a scanner, then I would recommend this book. But for anyone who plans to go on and study it in any depth, you would be better off saving your money and buying a more advanced book, as you will outgrow this one quickly.I gave it 2 stars, but that might be too harsh and I can't change it now. Pretend that I gave it 3."},{"Title":"The Town Traveller","review":"This is a late and relatively short Gissing novel, available only in obscure editions. The man was in an unusually light mood for his standards. One might not recognize it as a Gissing novel at all were the name not on the cover.What is not there: the ponderous main character who leads us through his life's troubles or few triumphs. There is no pondering here. Central character is a highly unusual man for Gissing: an optimist. Gammon is by nature a pleasure seeker and he is disposed to be easily pleased. He lives in a boarding house and works mostly as a sales rep in thriving London near the end of the 19th century. He seeks a 'permanency' and a pretty young wife and wouldn't mind being rich. He is quite a busybody, always getting involved in other people's affairs.Quote: 'He set off about his business with all the zest of a healthy boy. If he had any wisdom at all, it consisted in the lack of self-consciousness, the animal acceptance of whatever good the hour might bring.'Gammon has an interest in genealogy and in family secrets. A friend of his theorizes that every family must have an unknown rich relative somewhere. That is the starting premise for some entertaining confusion in the Victorian style.This novel has not made Gissing immortal. Rightly so. It is quite flat. Some action, of a rather frivolous kind, but no real subject, no conflict, no dilemma.Also, I dislike the condescending tone that Gissing uses here more than in his other works. He looks down on his creatures."},{"Title":"African Art in Needlework: Motifs Inspired by African Culture","review":"Includes 22 full-color illustrations and 166 line drawings and graphs.The first 40 pages or so are dedicated to teaching basic stitches needed to completer the projects that start on page 44.

Who, what, where, when and why, \\"show don't tell\\", hooking the reader with a good lead and other writing conventions are covered with great care in this book.Even though it's called \\"Teach yourself Travel Writing\\" don't expect writing exercises to be part of the format. It turns out that \\"Teach Yourself\\" is simply the series name of the publisher. But the author does cover photography basics, article types, research, travel protocol and more besides the general journalistic practices. There is even a chapter on guidebooks.Although I bought a copy only a short time ago (11/2007) some of the material seems to date back to the 1990s. When was the last time you used a dot matrix printer? Laptops and pdas are not mentioned and digital cameras are hardly mentioned. However when it comes to basic writing techniques and standards and how to do research, this book is very good. A glossary of terms at the back is quite helpful.p.s. I now realize that the reason there was obsolete material is because the book I bought (which is exactly the book shown in the picture with the same cover and same price) is actually the first edition, copyright 2001, 2003. If there is a 2nd edition (2006)Amazon is obviously not selling it!

I have never got around to reading any of Mr. Ludlum's books, so this novel was a first for me. I enjoyed the book and I found it to be a very entertaining read. I always appreciate a bit of humor in stories and this book had a number of humorous moments. I laughed at some of the scenes and kept reading and laughed at the characters.I understand that there is a sequel to the book so I'll probably ask my friend if she has it. Assuming she can remember the title. In my opinion, \\"The Road to Gandolfo\\" is a great read and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This book, while entertaining, was not up to par with most of the other books that I have read by this author."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This was the first Ludlum book I read.

I enjoyed the plot,espically about how all the wives wanted to...well if I tell you that you wont want to read the book. It goes, but slowly."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"After reading the reviews on how funny this book is, I could'nt wait to pick it up....what a let down.

One of the few books I did'nt bother to finish."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"I bought this book a few months back thinking I was in for a good read...I have to say that I am very disappointed. I guess my expectations were a fast paced read like the Bourne series and this is nothing like that style of book or writing. The other side of this is that I really don't even think it is all that funny. I don't want to finish it but I have a few more chapters to go...I can't wait to start another book and put this one down."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This is Ludlums attempt at writing a comedy. It isn't very funny or entertaining. These two characters go through a series of adventures that aren't interesting. The big running joke is that one character can never get anything to eat. How funny is that? There is also an embarrassing, juvenile storyline about one of the characters prowess with women and his beautiful wives. It is like a low class Matt Helm story (which is already at rock bottom). Ludlum is good at creating a superspy and writing action sequences. That could easily be twisted in a funny, entertaining way. But Ludlum does not leverage his strenghts here."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"If you don't have a sense of humor, don't enjoy satire, or can't bear the thought of Ludlum, as a &quot;serious&quot; writer, having some fun with his readers, do not read this book. In &quot;The Road To Gandolfo&quot;, Ludlum takes on the military, the U.S. government, the legal profession, and organized religion, and spears them with irreverent, acid-tipped satire that at times reaches levels of pure hilarity. But he's also, quietly and subtly, satirizing himself and the genre of fiction he made his name in: espionage thrillers. Many Ludlum fans probably won't be amused: it's a different Robert Ludlum who's mugging and cavorting behind these scenes.When General Mackenzie Hawkins, a Pattonesque commander of the old-school variety, is summarily drummed out of the military by the mealy-mouthed, politically motivated bureaucrats who have wormed their way to the slimy top of the Pentagon-Washington heap, he embarks upon a personal mission of vengeance, and plots out an intricate military-style &quot;black-op&quot; plan of his own: kidnap the Pope, and demand a ransom of one American dollar for every Catholic in the world.The setup for this caper will be expensive, and there are lengthy side-operations along the way, involving the extortion of money -- LOTS of money -- from various \\"investors\\" (i.e., shady characters Hawkins has been able to get the goods on through his military intelligence background). And as a patsy front-man, whom he can manipulate from behind the scenes via his four very mammalian ex-wives, Hawkins selects Sam Devereaux, a lawyer who merely wants to count down his remaining days in the Army and return to private practice.The resulting story, unfolded in fine Ludlum style from the viewpoint of Sam-the-Patsy, is blazingly fast-paced, unpredictable, intricately woven, and, well, downright funny. The satire is broad, but sharp, and the plot line, in proper intrigue-novel fashion, is doled out carefully, one piece at a time, always keeping you interested in what will happen in the next chapter.Readers looking for, and expecting, a standard Ludlum novel might well be disappointed or critical (&quot;What the heck is THIS?&quot;), but if you're looking for a witty, intelligent, satirical, fun, page-turner of an adventure, this is it."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This book is one of my favorite depression relievers and a laugh riot from start to finish. For all Ludlum fans, if you are hooked on his customary fare of high voltage suspense and international shenanigans, with events moving at blinding speed, then this book may not be for you. The Road to Gandolfo was written by him before his thrillers became a class of their own and is as different from them as apples from oranges. Yes, there are international goings-on and plenty of war-gaming, strategy and tactics in pursuit of an incredible objective - the kidnapping of the Pope himself!. Yet this is no espionage thriller; rather this book is a terrific parody of the genre. From the fast paced beginning to the charming almost pastoral close, Ludlum spares nobody: the Army, the bureaucrats, the Mafia, the corporate world, lawyers, terrorists, all feel the bite of his wit. The characters too are well drawn: the autocratic Hawk, his four incredible wives, the bumbling Sam Deveraux and a wonderfully human Pope reminiscent of John XXIII all come to full life. A great fun read for the vacations or whenever you want to relax with a light read. A most enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This book was a very pleasant surprise. It's not the usual Robert Ludlum but instead a light entertaining read. The characters are funny but lean towards unrealistic. It is very difficult to believe that the characters can maintain the same forceful personalities throughout the entire book throughout all circumstances. It ended nicely without a rushed feeling and also avoiding seeming like all the ends got tied up in the last chapter. A very readable book even though it lacked the fast pace and did not have the level of suspense of other Ludlum books."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"This book was a pleasant diversion for a quiet weekend. Completely entertaining and completely different from the other Robert Ludlum books I've read."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"Robert Ludlum takes a stab at comedy and comes away successful. The Hawk is a wildly entertaining character. This is a quick and quality read. The ending is a little lame, but most Ludlum endings are far fetched, so this is par for the course."},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"Robert Ludlum may be known for hard-hitting espionage and national-security thrillers, but when he hit The Road to Gandolfo, something must have tickled his funny bone. Honestly, this is one of the best books I've ever read. And the scary thing is, if things had been tweaked the other way, this would have been a classic Ludlum thriller. A tight plot, wonderfully developed characters--especially Hawkins' Harem--and raw unpredictability will make you ask &quot;who is this guy and what did he do with Robert Ludlum?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Road to Gandolfo","review":"In his writing of \\"The Road to Galdolfo\\" we meet a Ludlum who is entirely different from the Ludlum whom we have come to know and respect for his numerous thrillers, which have a tendency to keep one on the edge of their seat. Here we have a humorous Ludlum who does a fantastic job in an entirely different spectrum. His character development, like his plot, leaves very little to wish for, it's all there...from a drummed out Army General, (Hawkins) to the Pope to a lawyer who wishes nothing more than to retire from the service and re-enter the legal world where he was so content and happy.What a plot line...kidnap the Pope and as ransom demand one dollar for every Catholic in the world. In this endevour Hawkins takes on organized religion, the Army, the Mafia, the corporate world, the legal profession, and all the remaining bureacrats...he spares no one. From Sam Deveraux to Hawkins' four wives we are treated to a scintillating and absorbing tale told by a master story teller working in a milieu where we do not expect to find him. You won't get many belly laughs, but you will get some great chuckles.E.J.

I won't say any more . . . Anyway, he sets up a business and hatches an audacious plan to kidnap the Pope and hold him to ransom - for a dollar from every Catholic in the world! Not only that, his adversary Sam Devereaux is on his tail - and the Hawk's ex-wives are after Sam across Europe, America and Africa! And when the kidnap goes wrong, the results are hilarious.

It's a great (there's that word again) resource that serves not only to remind us of why we find comets visually compelling, but how important they are in helping astronomers understand the evolution of the solar system and the role they may have played in Earth's life origins. It also features some great (oops!) beautiful comet photos. An excellent reference, too, on upcoming comet missions. Bravo!"},{"Title":"American Government: Readings from Across Society","review":"America has been described historically as a melting-pot nation, but in fact as we look around, even beyond the red state/blue state division, there are far more divisions than a melting pot would permit. One political scientist described America as more of a stew - we all live together in a common society, but stay in our 'chunks' as communities, interest groups, etc.Quentin Kidd's book illustrates that well. In this reader, Kidd has drawn together readings that illustrate the similarities and the differences in the American political structure, both at national/regional levels as well as more local levels; Kidd also incorporates theoretical/philosophical discussions as well as practical aspects.There are four main parts broken into eight sections. The four primary parts are Foundations, Institutions/Structure of Government, Political Behaviour, and Public Policy. This book as a reader is meant to parallel or supplement any number of introductory political science/American politics texts that might be used for beginning college classes.Selections are drawn from a wide variety of sources and writers. Each section begins with Head Notes and Section Questions that look to make connections and encourage critical thinking. Each article is preceded by a synopsis or summary, and concludes with key questions for consideration. Each article also includes website suggestions for further research and clarification.The writing is also politically balanced - while individual writers of articles will naturally tend in one direction or the other, the overall sense of the book is a balanced presentation. 'By focusing on government and politics across society, this reader does not promote government or defend it; nor does it necessarily praise or disparage government and politics.' One organising principle is at work here - love it or hate it, government and politics are an essential part of current society.For timeliness, there is an article on the Hispanic Bar Association's efforts to encourage the appointment of an Hispanic Supreme Court Justice (a conversation happening in the media right now). There are articles on lobbyists, voting day tendencies, immigration, equal rights, and more. Some may have provocative ideas - what would happen if the presidency, a job considered by some to have grown too large for one person, were to be broken up into several positions? Does the separation of powers continue to work as it should?Kidd talked of people in his introductory classes who had problems relating to Federalist papers and the like, which, while historically important and having continuing influence in politics, still fail to have impact on the non-political science major the way more recent and current events have. The articles here are timely, which is to say, some are beginning to be a bit dated. This book was published in 2001, so there are no articles dealing with issues in the current Bush Administration timeframe. One hopes for a revised edition at some point that will incorporate a few articles from the most recent past, to keep with the idea of connecting political science and philosophy with current situations."},{"Title":"American Government: Readings from Across Society","review":"This book was recommended to me as an informatavie introduction to American politics.I was delighted by the level of detail and the way it was put together.

Would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"\\"Lest we forget\\": Is dedicated to the history of Mid-Michigan--1800-1983","review":"This book is interesting to anyone from central Michigan or who is interested in the early days of this area. Many humorous stories and a good account of the hardships of the pioneers to mid Michigan."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Study Guide for the Registry Examination in Radiography: Key Review Questions and Answers (Topics: Radiation Protection, Equipment Operation & Quality Control) Volume 1","review":"The questions in this book are very good for registry exam prep. Chapters include all the major tested areas and then some. Yes, I'd rather have more than less of something. This book is certainly quite good for giving a good clue on how and what you'll be tested on. Volume 2 and 3 of this series were also excellent study guides. I liked volume 3 since it had so much on anatomy, physiology and positioning, which is tested plentiful on this exam."},{"Title":"Invitation to the Waltz","review":"This book is elegantly written. Olivia has just celebrated her 17th birthday and is invited to Marigold's coming out party. Set in the 1920s. Ms. Lehman has a very beautiful way to describe people and emotions. You aren't beaten over the head with lenghty descriptions she just speaks beautifully.Invitation to the Waltz was meant as the prequel to Weather in the Streets. It certainly can stand very nicely on its own. The book will take you from Olivia's birthday through her preparations for the dance, to the dance and back home again. There isn't a real sense of climax but the story is very well plotted and it makes for a very good read as you journey with Olivia through her awkwardness, the manners of the dance, her fears to be in her elder sister's shadow, afraid to be left alone all night holding up the walls."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"All of Thirkell's novels are funny, but the Leslie family may be the funniest of all. One of the best things about them is that they think they are funny, too. It would be difficult to imagine anyone reading this book who has any vestiges of a sense of humor who could not feel happier after reading a few pages. Yet they all have some depth. There has been sadness in their lives and they deeply care about each other, but mostly they live so in the moment that life itself doesn't intrude upon them easily. Thirkell didn't get on the best 100 of the century, but she might be entitled to the first 20 or so. Read all her books and see which 10 or 12 you would omit!"},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"Angela Thirkell is a novelist after the fashion of Jane Austen. She use wit, charm, and style to uncover and skewer some of the foibles, follies, and eccentricities of her characters. Unlike some others, she always does so lovingly and with great regard for the human person. This story centers around a few young people and the romantic entanglements they experience throughout a summer in rural Barsetshire. The plot of the story might well have given rise to the movie &quot;Sabrina.&quot; There are no wild twists or sudden curves; however, they are not needed because the beauty of the prose and the careful observation of each person allows this novel to open up into an entire world of exploration. Once you have read it, you will want to return to it again and again to enjoy the characters, the settings, and the sumptuous prose. While this is a superb read, it is, remarkably, not the very best of Thirkell. The reader who is just starting has some real treats ahead for them"},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"I really don't understand why the publishers had to ruin some of the lines and mess up the chapters so that one gets distracted by what is obviously bad editing (or no editing) and rotten typing. It's like no one proofread anything and it makes it harder to enjoy what ought to be an excellent example of English humour."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"Of the many charming characters that people Thirkell's Barsetshire, the Leslies are the most delightful. Meet them in this book and then enjoy them again in later Thirkell novels (notably Marling Hall).Thirkell doesn't provide suspense or surprises, but is perfect light enjoyment for those who appreciate light English wit, sillier than Austen but not as silly as Wodehouse (both of whom are authors I love)."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"This is a wonderful book by a wonderful author with the worst formatting and copy editing I have ever seen in a commercially published volume. It reads as if it was scanned in from an old pre computer version, cursorily spell checked and grammar checked, which made things worse, and then formatted following some arcane principle that made it almost impossible to follow the turns of speech. Thirkell's work is sufficiently robust that to have this version is better than nothing, but it is really somewhatdisrespectful to her heritage."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"This was the second of Thirkell's Barsetshire stories I've read. Normally, I'm a great fan of farce, silliness and all-around hijinks, but this one left me confused often enough to subtract a star. Moreover, unlike \\"The Brandons\\" this story was so self-contained among the family that it gave almost no local impressions.I give the header on this review to warn readers of a very, very politically incorrect incident, standing apart from the tone of the novel and lasting a page or so. Those with heightened sensibilities will toss the book across the room - pronto! Fans of Comedy Central's \\"Strangers With Candy\\" will adore it. The author does address the issue of homosexuality among the English Upper Class (don't all gasp at once!) in a rather forthright manner for 1934. However, I didn't for a minute believe that Uncle David was a bachelor because the \\"right woman\\" hadn't come along."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"The typesetting is just dreadful. However, the wonderful gentle Thirkell storylines and characters are as charming as ever. Some lines are just nonsense because of the typesetting, so that is sad."},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"I love Angela Thirkell's Barsetshire novels and am reading them as I can find them, so was thrilled to see them being reprinted. I agree with other reviewers here that the rather slapdash editing and printing in some of the books is frustrating, but for me nothing can spoil the pleasure of another visit with Thirkell's wonderful characters.Here we visit Rushwater House and meet the Leslie family which includes three of my new favorite characters: Lady Emily Leslie, her long-suffering husband Henry, and their daughter Agnes. She, like her mother Lady Emily, is totally enthralled with her children and their well-being, and extends this loving (yet hilariously obtuse and therefore maddening!) attention to all in their charge - house guests, friends, servants - you name it, no detail is too small, no hurt feeling too insignificant to escape discussion and dissection by these two well-meaning matrons. Mr. Leslie tries to avoid the entanglements and complications caused by his beloved wife's good intentions, but that's impossible, of course, and leads to some of the funniest dialogue.There are other wonderful characters only Thirkell could create: sweet, innocent Mary Preston, visiting for the summer and becoming instantly invaluable to Lady Emily as she runs interference with the servants, smooths feathers and charms everyone with her calm good sense - sense that deserts her as she falls prey to Lady Emily's son David's facile charm and casual selfishness (of course the reader would cheerfully strangle him!) You know, of course, that Mary should be with elder brother John - mature, responsible, and a widower - but will Mary realize it? Will high-spirited grandson Martin's big birthday bash come off without a hitch? Will the snarky, snobbish and dreadfully odious Mr. Holt manage to worm yet another invitation out of Lady Emily? Thirkell may not have been quite the Jane Austen of her day, but for me she always creates a charming, funny, witty English Country-house world that is a pleasure to visit again and again - delightful!"},{"Title":"Wild strawberries","review":"I really liked this book, I would describe it as a fizzy screwball comedy. And I mean that in the best way, just like the great 30's comedys this book bounces along with charm. I have always loved the british comedy of manners books and I really like this and will try other novels in the series."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"My first copy of God Calling was used. Since it arrived, this simple devotional book has become a vital part of my daily spiritual readings. I was looking for a used copy in good condition to give as a gift when I saw this 'enhanced' version and I ordered it on a whim. I'm so glad that I did. This version is almost as beautiful on the outside as the inspirational messages contained within! Although it is so beautifully crafted, it feels like treating yourself to 'sinfully delicious chocolate', I've decided that I'll keep this version and make a gift of my plain version."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"The book arrived punctually, and it's one that I'll continue to keep on hand for years to come. The entrys are written from the perspective of God, making them very personal."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have given out mamy copies of God Calling over the years. Everyone that has received a copy of the book calls it life changing. I came across this devotional journal last year and love it. The same sayings are repeated in the journal, but it allows you to write a reflection daily. It as been wonderful to compare last year's writings to this year. I am able to see how I saw the devotional different acorrding to my perception at the time."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In God Calling, editor A.J. Russell presents the wisdom of Christianity through the voices of \\"Two Listeners,\\" to show more clearly what Jesus Christ may become to those who seek to know Him and live with Him.

It is well worth the small cost. Actually it is a bargain at any price to know the Lord beter."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Someone gave me a gift of this old book and I have since given copies to several friends and family members, and without exception they all love it. It reaches right into your heart. What I didn't know until recently is that is the foundation of the A.A. book entitled 24 Hours a Day. I can see why. It's both a guide and a consolation. And a great relief. An inspirational classic."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"LOVE the book; wish I could have purchased a new copy, however, the old has a certain charm."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"My 82 yr old cousin was reading this book when I visited her this spring. She read an entry every day & had for years. When I got home, I ordered a copy & I am so in love w/it. I just open it randomly & the treasures I find are such a blessing. What I find is \\"what Jesus would say\\" if he could just pull up a chair & talk w/me. This is a very blessed book. I have so much respect & gratitude for the people who brought it into being. They really did the job Jesus asked them to do."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"All women would be blessed to read this book. The daily readings are full of wisdom and insight.

I have turned to this devotional book constantly for more than 22 years! I have given copies to my sister and to my mother, when they were facing difficulties in their lives. Whenever the need to hear God's voice arises, I say a prayer and open this book. I often feel that God is talking directly to me through the words that I find in &quot;God Calling&quot;. The encouragement and assurance offered in this book has carried me through many ups and downs. I will continue to share &quot;God Calling&quot; with anyone whom I feel is in a &quot;place&quot; in their lives to accept God into their hearts. If you wish to hear God's voice, you will find it within this book."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have read 'God Calling' every day for years -- it is one of my favorite daily devotional books. I have an old, old paperback edition and I have highlighted, underlined, marked all my favorites -- they are really ALL my favorites!! I treated myself to this new expanded book and I love it!! It is so beautiful -- visually and to the touch! I highly recommend it!! The words, of course, are as wonderful as in my old book but there are additions of Scripture and each day has it's own page -- it gives me even more joy just to open it and see those cherished words of 'God Calling' displayed so beautifully."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I initially bought this journal for two prayer partners for a Christmas gift. Upon browsing through it, I discovered it to be not just a journal and immediately returned to the store in search of another. It is the best thing I have ever bought. The entries by the two listeners line up with the word of God. This journal is truly annointed and could not be understood by the spiritually dead. It speaks to you in ways only God could...it speaks to the heart."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Excellent little daily readings to go along with daily Bible readings. No one could have made this up -- the truths are just too awesome. These words make you think and want to follow Jesus' way of life for us."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I had no experience with \\"God Calling\\" until I read this, the expanded edition. The only devotional that I could commit myself to in the past was \\"My Utmost\\" by Oswald Chambers. But this devotional is honest and easy to find myself lost in.The book is written from the perspective of God talking to His children. I've read another book recently that was written in the same way, and felt disappointed by the misuse of scripture in that one. THIS BOOK, however does not misuse scripture, but opens your heart so that God can speak right to it.I enjoyed the added scripture references, and sometimes the poetry/song lyrics were dead on. Other times, I could have done without them.Even though the devotionals are short, they are to the point and dive down deep into your soul. I am so happy that I chose this book to give a chance. I recieved this book for free from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"God Calling seems to speak directly to the reader about Jesus's love and faithfulness to us.

I kept asking her where could I find one. She thought it was out of print. I took the information from the book and tried to order it for myself.

Nothing held meaning for me. The Bible seemed too harsh and I had a hard time relating to it. Then a friend gave me a copy of this book, and it has completely turned my life around.

My readings are my daily gift to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I received this book about 15 or so years ago from a dear friend. I was going through a rough patch and this book really provided me with comfort and strength to face the day. The book is set up as a daily devotional, a short brief meditation for the day. My copy is falling apart and one day I will have to replace it. This book has deep sentimental value to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Although this precious book was written almost 75 years ago, the texts are as meaningful and real as when they were first put to paper. Simple, prayerfully inspired words of wisdom that truly are a gift to this generation from our Lord. My copy is on our kitchen table and we read it each night before dinner. My husband loved it so much he wanted his own copy. (We have found that we both write notes from our own meditations in our books.)I have ordered additional copies to give as gifts. This small treasure of love, trust, and faith should be a part of every believer's arsenal."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I was surprised the book was dated (daily passages) but read in the foreward one could read any passage and get meaning.

I keep ordering copies for my family and friends and there has not been one person who does not like it.It takes 'organized religion' out of the picture, which is necessary for me.

I was led to this book by the Lord January 8th of this year. It has literally been my personal letter from Him every day so far since, speaking so personally to me. He really was calling me when he led me to this book, especially when I dropped it in the book store, and picked it up by the side to see my last name on the side of it \\"Russell.\\" He will speak to you clearly too through these heartfelt words. I wish I could personally thank the two women who He spoke through or A.J. Russell for compiling this book. But since I can not, Thank you Lord!!!!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In my search for an inspirational book, I came across this one. In its pages I find His message to the world in today's language. His message was delivered to 2 women that chose to remain anonymous but to share the love that our Savior has for us. When I am down or not feeling any hope, I thumb through the pages and where I stop I find the words I need to hear. The same thing happens when I am feeling great, I find a message that brightens my day even more. His messages to us are all about His love for us and this book puts them into words that I can hear. They say if you speak from the heart, you will touch a heart. This has come from the heart of our Savior."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is a very special daily reflection book.Most days reflection is a couple of paragraphs, but thought provoking.Highly recomend."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is a great journal.

I currently use the journal version of this book, being careful to put the year on any comments I may have concerning my reaction to each selection.

I began to keep a journal and the Lord spoke to me. I was so encouraged by what the Lord said to me. Just like the two ladies in the book. Their true story is set in the second world war they would get together daily and listen for the Lord to talk to them, and write it down. It is a lovely book.

Since then I have been benefited from this book.Later when I understood that a journal edition was available, I bought one without hestitation so that I could write down my reflections from the relevant passages in God Calling and my daily Bible reading.When I read my previous reflections, I can see my spiritual growth and setback and thanks God for caring and keeping me.Of course no devotions can replace the Bible and God Calling is no exception. However, when I am confused, down, struggling, etc, God Calling gives me encouragement, guidance and reminder.Indeed, when you read God Calling in conjunction with the Bible in every morning (though this is not really easy to achieve), it gives you momentum to practise God's Words in your daily life.The only complaint I would make is that the English in this book is too old. I will hestitate in recommending it to my friends who may need encouragement but who are not very good in English.I really hope that it will be rewritten in contemporary English so that those who need this book but speak English as the second language will understand it and find it helpful and inspiring."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I was pleased with the accurate information about the book's condition, the prompt mailing, and the cost!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If you read the two prefaces carefully, you will note that the second one refers to the &quot;two listeners&quot; receiving physic messages through automatic writing or channeling! This is cleverly hidden in one sentence. Therefore, the &quot;sweet&quot; messages one may receive from this book may NOT be from our Lord, but the angel of light. Why? Because there is little substance to the book itself. It keeps one from reading what the Christian ought to: the Bible! Dear Christians, use your discernment. Don't waste your time on this book when the source is so questionable!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"According to the Power, will and revelation of Lord God Almighty; in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ is this gift of true divine sustenance. In words that illuminates the fine line between the enigmatic to the ethereal and sublime; the Living Christ, on a daily basis reveals Himself to the order of which We have been called. Our efforts to serve, heal, and love is enriched by the glorious presence of His Spirit; which is a truly comforting thought in itself. With such profound intimacy from the Groom most high; He nurtures His bride through the joy and peace of humble servitue to the Holy One. Though He will touch us all at varying Spiritual levels; He reminds us, His Church that He indeed is with us always. Never fear. Joy, Love &amp; Laughter. Grace &amp; Peace to you all."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Disappointing. I bought this as a gift for someone because the book itself is great. I was very frustrated to find that the classy leather-bound cover had a tacky paper barcode & price stuck on the back cover which, when pulled off, ripped, leaving bits of paper & glue which I then had to scratch off. It still has a sticky patch which I've now got to remove with a product that I hope won't leave a mark. Not happy."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I was given this book by and friend, and I have to say, it may be the best gift I've ever been given.

Plus, it's supple leather cover and convenient size make it something for you to carry with you throughout each day.

The women who originally wrote the messages went through a great deal of suffering, and during that time, sensed God's encouragement and wrote from it. I've bought several of these books to give to friends and people going through hard times."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I chose to buy this product because it was listed as good condition. Not until I had made the purchase and the book was being shipped did the seller inform me that the old copy was fragile and likely to come apart at the binding, and was also badly stained from a liquid spill. I would never have bought a book in this condition. I feel mislead, and I wasted my money."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"God Calling is my favorite devotional book because every time I pick it up it has a word of comfort or challenge for my personal relationship with Christ.

I have turned to this devotional book constantly for more than 22 years! I have given copies to my sister and to my mother, when they were facing difficulties in their lives. Whenever the need to hear God's voice arises, I say a prayer and open this book. I often feel that God is talking directly to me through the words that I find in &quot;God Calling&quot;. The encouragement and assurance offered in this book has carried me through many ups and downs.

I read it every morning-some days it really hits the mark, other days it provides me with a peaceful place to start my daily devotional. A.J. Russell gave the world the gift that God gave the two listeners. Bless him! A must read and a must have!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Why do they keep messing with God Calling??? My old little hard cover (1953)is precious to me; I underline, put in dates relevant to the message and my own Scripture references. This book is meant to put be away with grandma's gilded family Bible. It is a padded hardcover with gold-edged pages; you can't write on the slick pages and if there were any room they fill it with scrolls, curly-q's, added Scripture (don't need that, have my own Bible-several), poetry (??), thoughts to consider (again, I have my own), and then they tell you what to pray. Seriously?? What was simple and sincere, they have made an embellished, pompous and useless book, unless, of course, you want that kind of thing: beauty over function. Certainly not the gift for I intended for a male friend. I don't even want it."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is dangerous in the way that it purports to be channeled revelation from Jesus. Accepting this extreme claim leads people away from studying Scripture and into a search for subjective personal revelation. The book sounds very good in many parts, but a closer reading reveals the shallowness of what is actually taught. For example, March 13 says, \\"Spiritualism is wrong. No man should ever be a medium for any spirit, other than Mine.\\" Yet the \\"Listeners\\" were anonymous mediums, who sat with paper and pen and wrote what \\"came to them!\\" This book gives no credentials as to why we should believe that the \\"spirit\\" they wrote for is the Holy Spirit. Technically, we have no proof that the \\"two women\\" even existed, let alone that they were Christians. We are simply asked to take this on A. J. Russell's word. (He helped found the Oxford Movement, which became the Moral Rearmament Movement, known today as the \\"Initiatives for Change.\\" This quasi-religious international group pursues world transformation through steps like: \\"A daily time of silence where we listen to our conscience or 'inner voice'- for people of faith, the leading of God - for direction and correction.\\" Not exactly Jesus' mission program, is it?)March 16 says \\"Do you realize that I am telling you truths, revealing them, not repeating oft-told facts? . . . All down the ages, men have been too eager to say what they thought about My truth, and so doing, they have grievously erred . . My words need none of man's explanation. I can explain to each heart . . .\\" This directly contradicts the Bible, which says that God gave pastors and teachers to the church to help equip the saints for the work of the ministry. We're supposed to take the edited words of two unknown women as perfectly from Christ and avoid \\"man's explanation?\\" Sounds like an open door to any number of cults to me. Another line from March 16 - \\"To lead a soul to Me is one thing, to seek to stay with it to interpret, mars the first great act.\\" This is contrary to Biblical commands to \\"make disciples\\" by \\"teaching,\\" \\"doctrine,\\" \\"reproof,\\" and \\"exhortation.\\" The New Testament is filled with commands to teach new believers to study the Bible and interpret it.Another point - the \\"Jesus\\" of this book doesn't have the facts about His own birth right. December 24 says that the Magi visited Christ in \\"the Bethlehem Stable.\\" Funny - \\"Jesus\\" should have known that the Magi visited the Child in a \\"house,\\" according to Matthew!I agree with Steven Tsoukalas, who says of \\"God's Calling,\\" - \\"The popularity of this book is a symptom of what ails the Church today-virtually no discernment, no deep biblical knowledge, a sugar-coated view of God, and a desire for the what-can-I-get-out-of-God rather than a desire to know God more deeply through the study of His Word.\\"Don't wander after shortcuts.

Enjoy!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Many Christians have felt blessed by \\"God Calling\\", so we must treat this matter in Truth out of love for them, for my opinion does not matter, but only God's truth revealed in the Bible. \\"God Calling\\" is filled with encouragements that seem \\"godly\\" and well-meaning, but we need to understand the controversy that arises when the two \\"listeners\\" claim these messages were given to them by Jesus Himself. When a Christian writes a book they would never claim their writings to be a direct revelation from God. If they did then their revelation would have to be viewed as Scripture [inerrant and infallible]. This is what Joseph Smith claimed about the extra biblical Book of Mormon.Dear reader, please pray for wisdom before reading further. [James 1:5]\\"But with my friend a very wonderful thing happened. From the first, beautiful messages were given to her FROM THE LORD HIMSELF, and every day from then these messages have never failed us. We felt all unworthy and overwhelmed my the wonder of it,and could hardly realize that we were being taught, trained and encouraged day by day BY HIM PERSONALLY,when millions of souls who are far worthier, had to be content with guidance from the Bible, sermons, their Churches, books and other sources.\\" \\"God Calling\\" Page 11-12THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CLAIM. She's claiming that her friend penned the very words of Christ through her. This means that the book \\"God Calling\\" would have equal authority with the Bible. Do we believe this? Or is the listener unaware that she is channeling a message from a seducing spirit via automatic writing? Does the message line up with Scripture?Ther is an unorthodox use of \\"Power\\" that is more consistent with the Occult than Christianity. In fact, the writer capitalizes \\"P\\" in power. We will copy the entire paragraph so the message will not be taken out of context:\\"Discipline and perfect yourselves at all costs. Do this for soon every fleeting thought will be answered, every wish gratified, every deed used. It is a fearful Power, almighty Power. Oh! Be careful that you ask nothing amiss-nothing that is not according to My Spirit. All thoughts harmful must be turned out. Miracle-working power can become WITCHERY in the wrong hands. See how necessary I have made the purity and goodness of your own lives to you. This is why. Soon, very soon, you shall ask and at once it will come. Welcome the training, Without it I dare not give you this Power. IT WOULD DO HARM.\\" January 6THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE STATEMENT. That any \\"Power\\" supposedly derived from the Holy, Pure and Sinless Lord could DO HARM OR BE WITCHERY? If this ONE statement is flawed and untrue the entire idea of the book being written or inspired by the true Jesus must be thrown out. And further begs the question, just what spirit whispered in the silence?"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"A friend gave this book to my sister during a trying time in her life.

To them I say \\"have you ever quoted Prov 3:5? Even read it?\\"Then have you ever done it? You decide it does not agree? But you did not first acknowledge the Lord and then wait for him to answer. You decided based on your own knowledge you decided based on your traditions. If we are naked poor and blind what makes you think you can see on your own? A blind man knows he is blind and humbly accepts assistance from others. A spiritually blind man thinks he is self sufficient and eats and devours anyone who attempts to love him - even the Lord himself (he then rationalizes it was not the Lord - that that man was not sent of the Lord and thus he too kills the prophets).Is this not what they tried to say of Jesus? He came against their traditional interpretations - so they sought to kill him!I had issues with things in this book. I have also had issues with things the still small voice of God has said to me. Some of them punched me in the gut - it was a surgery to remove a tradition of men - a stronghold. I said \\"Lord I need chapter and verse. Lord this looks like a contradiction.\\" Sometimes he said \\"do you trust me?\\" Then a day, a week, a month or many months even many years later he gave me chapter and verse.I tell you a mystery there is not one contradiction to scripture in this book. No I am not saying this is new revelation. No I am not saying this should be made to be part of a cannon. But as scripture says \\"you may all prophecy\\".But what comes first - stepping out of the boat? Or walking on water? Understanding that you can walk on water? Or walking and then understanding?When a child learns to walk he knows by knowledge - he has seen with his physical eyes that humans can walk. But he does not know he can walk. For he has not experienced it. He has to try.And so he tries and immediately he stumbles.And then YOU are there - you are ready to discourage him - you jump all over his stumbling as your PROOF!!! That walking is not possible for him you say \\"how dare you arrogant child even try to walk!!!\\"Miserable comforters - I rejoice that you don't baby sit my children.You are .... well I will just let scripture say it 2 Tim 2:26God seeks to lift them up but you - you kick them while they are down.Who then is the occultic one?Before you again judge from the outward appearance (deciding I am the one deceived) I will give you a proof of auto writing I will have you read my review to the book written by a devil.

The 'two listeners' seem to tune in to God's wavelength and offer Him an instrument for His divine compassion. They channel the Trinity - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - with encouragements, blessings, and Bible verses that are simple to appreciate yet profoundly deep in meaning. That our Lord and Master should speak through the 'two listeners' and that those conversations should be recorded in an easy-to-read, 193-page book suggests His presence can manifest in any form.God's love is unmistakable in this version edited by A.J. Russell. Available after many printings dating to 1932 and written as a daily devotional, God Calling offers companionship and succor to the troubled and the downtrodden, the meek and the forlorn, and the hopeless and the desperate. We are quite simply uplifted by these timeless and beautiful words of hope and inspiration. They calm us and pacify us. They leave us breathless and craving more. They are food for our souls and seemingly float on cottony white clouds in the ever darkening sky of our sometimes lives.Keep listening for the \\"still small voice\\"If you are weary on life's road;The Lord will make your heart rejoiceIf you will let Him take your load.--HessGod Calling, for me, amplifies that \\"still small voice.\\"This book is heaven-sent insight and worth reading over and over until one has internalized His enduring empathy. These words are a source of great strength that restores our faith and renews our serenity. They are intended to not just be consumed but to be lived and turned toward others.God calls us to serve. God Calling inspires us to serve with a smile on our faces.And as Christ taught us through His sterling example, we release our own burdens by relieving others of theirs.Ethereal and uplifting!

Each letter has a way of encouraging your heart and helping you fall more deeply in love with the Lord.I recommend God Calling to anyone who wants to hear God's Word directed to them personally. Each daily devotion consists of scripture, exhortations, and encouraging words of promise. This book is a daily faith builder. After all, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.Stacy Padula, Author ofMontgomery Lake High #1: The Right Person"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"An awesome book, that takes more than one reading in order to begin to understand the depth of what is being said each day! It is source for reflection and hope in our struggling world."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have purchased several copies of this book (from various places) Keep a copy with you and read in it daily. It brings me peace and assurance daily and has helped get me through some trying times. Great gift for anyone - also seeGod Calling Music"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I ordered three of the books God Calling. They all arrived promptly and I was impressed by the service provided by Amazon as this was my first purchase with them. I gave one copy to my Minister to read and approve. When he said it was inspiring I then gave the other two copies to ladies in the Church who were going through bad experiences. This book is truly inspirational."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This set of daily messages received from two people who prayed together is quite inspiring. Each day seems to bring a message that one needs to hear. Sometimes it's about having faith, other times about not being afraid, others about healing and what it takes, drawing closer to the Lord, how his mercy is so abundant and so much more. This is my second book because the first one is getting worn out from daily use for the past 3 years. It never grows old and each time I read a daily message, I get something new out of it. I would recommend it for your first read in the morning or your last read at night. Nice short little paragraphs give one the uplift necessary to carry on with life."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"A great daily devotional book, will bring you to your knees every morning as you reflect on God's messages."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"For me, and for many others I've spoken with about his this little book and its companion book God At Eventide, reading them is like hearing Jesus speak to you personally. Each day is just what you need for that day. It will give you peace, guidance and Love. It will make you a better person, calm you when you are anxious and lift you up when you are depressed.

What a great way to keep God at your side 24-7. I carry the book in my purse whereever I go. I can read for a few minutes or several minutes.

What a great inspirational collection of \\"words\\" from God."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Through the years I have given the \\"God Calling\\" boook to friends and family who are looking to increase their spiritual life.

Everytime I read a passage I find that God is talking directly to me. When I'm discourages, this book lifts me up, when I'm scared and distressed, this book tells me not to despair and when I'm feeling alone this book reminds me that we can't be alone if God is with us.I truly hope this books fills your emptiness as it did for me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"Many of us question our religions and faith as we get older. Life events make us jaded and force us to question God and certain aspects of our religion. God calling brings us back to the most important part of our faith and that is our personal relationship with God. God calling will reaffirm your relationship with God and leave you optimistic about the future."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"No matter how many years I have had this devotional...no matter how many times I've read each daily devotional, it's like reading it for the first time...each time. It really feels as if the Lord is speaking directly to me each day. I highly recommend this book to anyone who desires to personally receive a word from the Lord each day. The journal portion just adds to the spiritual flavor of this devotional. This is a MUST READ!!!!!!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This devotional is wonderful. I purchased some for some friends and all were very excited. However, one of them was misprinted and the entiremonth of March was missing, which was disturbing."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"It is my belief that every human being who is seeking a closer relationship with God will benefit from this book. It is a daily reminder that God's intention is to inspire and guide us in a very loving and personal way. The first person delivery of the message in \\"God Calling\\" lets each reader know that God, or in this Christian presentation, Jesus Christ, is a wise friend who cares very deeply for each of His children. It is a message we all need, but few are open enough to receive.On a personal level, I wondered if the message conveyed through the \\"Two Listerners\\" in \\"God Calling\\" could be received by me. I began to practice daily guidance and found that it worked. The message, although written down in language I typically use, is nonetheless as pure and loving as that which came through the \\"Two Listeners.\\" As a result, my relationship with God has soared to a new level of intimacy and understanding. If you are willing, I urge you to read this daily meditation book and then try receiving your own message.

It is thought inspirationsonal, sometimes if I did it at night I really had to re read in the am or several times to make sure what I was getting out of it, was what I thought at first. I bless these two women that made this together, as I am sure the Lord had made them an equality that shares in voices. The scriptures and most of all the space to enter notes, were just fantastic. I have so many devotionals but kept coming back to this one, as it does have the journal part. You can enter either what you thought or processed this or you could just enter what was going on in your life that day, and then sometimes I correlated the two. I think that it made it an extraordinary devotional journal as I did not ever just put it down. IT was a well traveled book and so helpful in all areas of my life. I knew that I could continue to just keep it and go over it day after day this year, but wanted a fresh one to start over. It was not easy to find, therefore I came to Amazon and here it was. I bought at Sam's last year with the intention of giving it away, but found myself using it. I could not find it at Sam's this year. Thank you Amazon.

I answered \\"No,\\" and she left it with me. On returning home, I bought a copy for myself. I was curiously affected by the book and felt that I wanted all my friends to read it immediately, and actually made out a list of over a hundred people to whom I should have liked to have sent it. Not being rich, this desire had to be content with two copies, which I lent to various people, on whom it seemed to make little effect. A few months later I read it again. It was then that there came a persistent desire to try to see whether I could get guidance such as A. J. Russell reported, through sharing a quiet time with the friend with whom I was then living. She was a deeply spiritual woman with unwavering faith in the goodness of God and a devout believer in prayer, although her life had not been an easy one.I was rather skeptical, but, as she agreed, we sat down, pencils and paper in hand and waiting. This was in December 1932. My results were entirely negative. Portions of texts came and went, then my mind wandered to ordinary topics. I brought it back again and again, but with no success. To this day, I cannot get guidance in this way alone.But with my friend a very wonderful thing happened. From the first, beautiful messages were given to her by our Lord Himself, and every day from then these messages have never failed us....... So I've been told, this is considered an occultic practice of \\"journaling\\" or \\"channeling\\" and is what many New Age teachers use and recommend. They sit and write down or journal the thoughts that come into their heads. That's the technique New Age leader Neale Donald Walsh used to write the entire \\"Conversations with God\\" series. This is NOT Christian. To me, this also sounds similar to the occultic Seth books from wikipedia: \\"In late 1963, Roberts and her husband, Robert F. Butts, experimented with a Ouija board as part of Roberts' research for a book on extra-sensory perception. According to Roberts and Butts, on December 2, 1963 they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality who eventually identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages in her head. She began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board, and she eventually abandoned the board.\\"One BIG clue that this book is communicating with a spirit being is that they do not use the normal Christian terms. If you are at all familiar with New Age, occult or Word Faith, they like to change the names. They speak of \\"the power\\" \\"the force\\" and in this book \\"the Great Friend\\" and \\"The Master\\" and \\"The Great Companion and Guide.\\" Yes, a spirit guide. Not Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1982, my freshman college roommate saw that I was going through a rough time, and bought a copy of &quot;God Calling&quot; for me (I had been reading hers).

The closest one can get to listening to God and hearing His encouragement and reminders of His love for each of us. A true daily walk with Him."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1932, life was harsh and difficult for two anonymous women, so much so that one considered suicide. But as they prayed together, they were comforted with simple, yet heart warming, insights and inspirations. God undoubtedly spoke to these women, as He speaks to anyone who takes the time to listen. But as all of us often do, they filtered out what they didn't want to hear. The Word of God is like a sword with two edges. One edge is receiving comfort and healing for oneself. \\"Come unto Me, and I will give you rest\\" (Matt. 11:28). The other is giving comfort and healing to others. \\"Take my yoke upon you\\" (Matt. 11:29). The \\"Listeners\\" enthusiastically embraced the first edge, but only superficially acknowledged the second. They couldn't understand why their Savior would ask them, already crushed by their own burdens, to take on a spiritual burden for somebody else. They didn't see that Jesus powerfully transforms us and our circumstances when we take our eyes off ourselves, even if only for a moment, and look to help somebody else who is hurting even more than we are. I recommend this book. It genuinely reflects the Father's warmth and tenderness. But be careful! In isolation, it can lead to spirituality that is outwardly blissful and euphoric, but inwardly selfish and self-centered. For a balanced spiritual diet, read \\"God Calling\\" along side other books that teach how to \\"be there\\" for others, through intercessory prayer, Christian community and the Spirit's gifts for ministry."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If you could read only one book in your entire life, this should be the one.

Yet, in its pages you will find a tenderness, love, and support that will move you to tears.

The author and the women considered them to be direct revelations from God, so the passages are made to sound like they are authoritative as if from scripture.

The walking in the way may not be always carried out, but the guiding is always so sure.\\"This book is the height of presumption- as if these words are God's words. Typical of most mass media protestants, he says things that sound good at first pass if you are predisposed to like it; but if you reflect on what he says it often doesn't mean anything and when it does, it's not very deep or thought provoking.The author and the receivers of these revelations needed a dose of humility."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This is such a wonderful and heartfelt book that touches your spirit...when you need words of encouragement/comfort.

After owning this book for 4 years and reading it daily, I now know that it was no accident that the only copy left at the bookstore was meant for me. Buy this book....I doubt you will ever regret it."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I just submitted a review and I should have read the &quot;example customer reviews&quot; before writing my first one. To anyone who would question the motive of the &quot;two listeners&quot; or A.J. Russell, I would encourage you to get a copy of the journal edition that includes at least one scripture related to each day's devotion. It is inferred in the book's introduction that it was through the studying of the Word of God on a daily basis that these two women grasped the insight found in God Calling. It is a supernatural event when our limited human minds take hold of divine truth, when we are given &quot;revelations&quot; concerning that which we formerly did not understand, that which we have not been formally educated concerning. This is not cultish or pagan mysticism at work. This is the grace of God to us who believe. If it was evil, it seems to me that another &quot;fruit&quot; of that evil would be for worldly fame and recognition for such profound writing. Instead, all we know is that 2 women faithfully and humbly took God at His Word that He would guide them into all truth and teach them all things and that a publisher, who loves God, decided to let the world enjoy the fruit of these women's faith. I thank God for all three of these people and I am challenged to read the Word of God for myself DAILY that I, too, may know God more fully and intimately. I applaud the attempt at warning all of us against being led astray by mystic sentiment but this book does nothing but support the foundation of solid, Biblical principals. If it repeatedly celebrates and admonishes fruits of the Spirit- LOVE, JOY, PEACE, PATIENCE, KINDNESS, GOODNESS, FAITHFULNESS, GENTLENESS, SELF-CONTROL- reason tells me that it is indeed, FRUIT of the Spirit of God Himself. Remember, even Jesus said, &quot;for the tree is known by it's fruit&quot; (Matt. 12:33)when He was accused of being in league with satan. This book edifies God, encourages further study of the Word of God, and had the potential to transform my mind and heart to more closely resemble that of God the Father, Jesus the Son &amp; Savior, and of the Spirit, Who is our Guide into all truth.(John 14:26) God bless all of you who are earnestly seeking Him!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have read this devotional every day for the past seven years. I have found this book to be inspirational and helpful in keeping me focused on my daily walk with Christ. This book comes to us from two &quot;Listeners&quot;. It occurred to me that it doesn't really matter how these God-inspired messages came about, it only matters that these messages lead others to God's love. A truly comforting and uplifting source of peace."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"In 1935, two women who remain anonymous and wanted to be known simply as \\"Two Listeners\\", have been given these messages from the living Christ. These messages give hope, comfort, wisdom, challenges and most of all love to it's readers. In the midst of poverty and disillusionment these two women were able to find comfort from words spoken in the depths of their hearts. We too can find wisdom if we listen with an open mind and heart, Christ will speak to us and lead us on our way to becoming our other self, with hearts renewed by Christ himself. God Calling and God at Eventide are daily meditations that can be read each day. I also like to read excerpts fromThrough Seasons of the Heartby John Powell and GraceGrace in Every Season: Through the Year With Catherine De Hueck Doherty"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I read this little book for the first time in 1978 when it was presented to me by a friend. It then remained tucked away and forgotten until recently when I began searching for spiritual comfort, growth, and guidance. How powerful it still is! I didn't just find it something to soothe my hurts. I found it to be challenging and downright confrontational on occasion. I needed that!The &quot;two listeners&quot; are not psychics, but two women wished to share with others some of the lessons God taught them in their journey together with Him.As a means of deepening my daily devotionals, I have chosen to use a concordance and my Bible to locate the scriptures which deal with the daily topics. The &quot;Two Listeners&quot; CAN be validated by scripture. I would challenge their skeptics to use God's Word for proof."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I too have been reading this for about 20 years and it's been a lifesaver for me. I've purchased and given so many away that I really couldn't say how many over the years.Before this book, I had so many pre-conceived ideas about who Jesus was by all the things I had learned as a child. This book has allowed me to know Him in such an intimate way. I was so wrong about EVERYTHING! Matter of fact, I've discovered that most of the things I learned about him were 'exactly' the opposite of who He really is. Every day I learn something new about Him or myself or others I'm dealing with, by reading that days message. Even though I've been through the book so many times, I find I understand things I didn't in the years before. I attribute that to spiritual grown and understanding.It doesn't get old. You just find out more and more about who you are and who He is. To me that is the key to life.I've taught those who have received this from me not to look ahead because it could discourage you thinking 'Next Tuesday looks scary as He's talking about the hardship you are going through.' Yikes!!I've discovered from this book that when you listen to the birds song, it actually imprints Joy on your soul. A bank if you will to be used during times of sorrow or heartache. What a gift huh? I learned that when you look at a flower, it's beauty is imprinted on your soul and comes back into the world as a smile or a cheer for others. What a guy to think of all these ways to concur evil.I recomend this book to all who question the reality of God or His Son. See if you can find all of the times He says \\"FEAR NOT\\" in this book. It's amazing that it's probably the most used word He spoke and yet we that proclaim to have Faith, never heard it or don't believe it.This book has been the lifeline to overcoming hardships, finding Hope when I thought all Hope was lost, hanging on in His Strength when I couldn't hang on another minute, but most of all, this book has introduced me to the guy I've always been looking for. A very human Jesus."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I've always wondered why many Christians seem so stressed and burdened that all the JOY seems sapped from their lives, like the saving work of Grace was all up to THEM and the effort required just tired all the joy right out of them. Well, this powerful little book reverberates with the truth of Jesus' redemptive works: \\"Not I, but the Father who dwelleth in Me doeth the work.\\" The desire to know and live in harmony with the Will of God is kindled in the reader and the resultant JOY is restored directly to the believing heart. It doesn't matter what you are going through, whether times of joy or times of trial: \\"Your faith and MY Power - the only two essentials. Nothing else is needed.\\" (Feb.3 - If Men Oppose). Stop eating spiritual \\"crumbs\\" and begin feasting on the spiritual banquet testified to within the pages of this powerful, life-changing book. It will satisfy your soul."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"i would just like to say, the lord jesus christ has blessed me so much with this book,it is a pricless blessing of my life,the lord knows i was going through a very hard and difficult time in me life,and he knew what i needed most the lord is my shepard i shall not want,there was alot of things in the bible i did not understand,in his word he said when he was alone with his disciples he explained to them,and that it what i feel he has done with me in this book and more,the lord jesus is so good!!i cant even explain all that it has helped me,it even helped me to read the bible more,well because the lord nows what i go through oh he has really helped me so much,to wonderful to even explain,i did pray to the lord about this book,because the lord knows i only want his truth,and he has confirmed to me time and time again that this is from him,its just so amazing and exciting.so yes to be skeptical is okcause the lord wants us to be diserning,he also wants us to have a chid like faith,and trust him,simple trust he wont fail us,and he will lead us in all truth its a promise he will never leave us or forsake us is a promise!i would recomend this book {blessing} to everyone!!!!i also think its neat that the two listeners wanted to be anomenus,cause they were not looking for praise for thierselves and they could have,cause in john chap.7 verse18 the lord showed me it says,thosewho present thier own ideas are looking for praise for themselves,but those who seek to honer the one who sent them are good and genuine i believe we should never limit his word,where he says where two or more are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them, thy word is a lamp unto my feet,and a light unto my path.\\"and the word was made flesh and dwelt amoung us.and jesus is the same yesterday,today and forever.if he did it for his disciples he will truley do it for us,i just want to say jesus is awsome and his name alone is excellent!!!!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This version of &#34;God Calling&#34; - the expanded version - is a treat. The quality of the actual materials used to make the pages, the cover and binding... along with the scripture and additional notes are well-worth the cost. Partly because of this detail, the book has become a morning favorite of mine. I can't say enough about the book, the authors, the publisher...and of course, the words of encouragement that flow from it on a daily basis. I do not see ever throwing this book away - and it's designed for several generations to use without falling apart."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"The spiritual guidance to be found in this little book has been some of the best I have ever encountered. Both my husband and myself have found this book a source of great strength in difficult times. What isso absolutely amazing about it is that we have found time and again that the problem we have been wrestling with is answered the very next morning in the daily meditation. We have given God Calling to many people for whom it has also been a book in a class of its own. The fact that it was written by two ordinary, poverty-stricken elderly women, one of whom endured continuous ill-health, makes it even more valuable. One recognizes the spirit of God speaking from these pages and can only be grateful that the perserverance of these two believers have so enriched the lives of countless others."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"way nicer than I expected beautiful design very manly too.Would recomend this purchase to other women who might want a nice gift for their man."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have purchased them for family and friends... they make them for kids, teens, et al.

It's amazing."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"This book is like no other. I purchase paper-book copies and give them away. I leave them in hotel rooms, hospitals, doctors office, prisons, etc. You may scoff, but I do believe this book to be divinely inspired. I came across this book about 20 years ago. It was not written by Mr. Russell, he is only the editor. Be sure to read the introduction. The authors or receivers of the messages wished to remain anonymous, and no doubt are no longer living since the messages came around 1930 I believe. Read \\"Savanah\\"s comments. I agree with her 100 % for I have found everything she said to be true for me also. I have probably bought over 100 copies and am now ordering 10 more as I am out of stock. I always order at least enough to qualify for the free shipping which is nice. Other \\"inspirational\\" books pale next to this. As for myself, I cant believe these two women made this up, there is too much truth and beauty in the \\"messages\\".

It is always with me and any time that I have a spare moment I go to God Calling for inspiration....so uplifting - always puts a smile on my face and in my heart.This is a perfect gift for anyone that you care about!"},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I have been using this devotional ever since my Godmother gave it to me 25 or 30 years ago. I never travel without it. So often it has reassured me of God's love, reminded me of his promises, or renewed in me a sense of His deep power and infinite grace in the exact way and with the exact words I needed at that time.I have given it as a gift to many people, especially when they are either renewing their faith or struggling with maintaining their hope in times of distress. The book offers words of comfort, hope, and assurance. It speaks of God's infinite love, His unimaginable power, His unending grace and kindness to us.I love that it is written in \\"first person,\\" as if directly from God. I believe in the faith of The Two Listeners, and so I do believe these words were directly inspired by God.But just as importantly, this book reminds me that I need to be a Listener, too. It reminds me that it is not enough to be a petitioner in my prayers -- that listening for God's voice is just as important -- if not more important -- when praying.Sometimes, I will use other devotionals -- My Utmost for His Highest is another favorite -- but in times of distress and great need, this is the devotional I keep coming back to. It is one of my most treasured possession, and it is one of my greatest weapons against fear, anger, and despair. I can not recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend and became very concerned about the content of the book when I read the statements in the preface by one of the &quot;two listeners&quot;. The statements were as follows, &quot;We were being taught, trained and encouraged day by day by HIM personally, when millions of souls, far worthier, had to be content with guidance from the Bible, sermons, their churches, books and other sources.&quot; &quot;So to us this book, which we believe has been guided by our Lord Himself, is no ordinary book.&quot; I read a review of God Calling from the Christian Research Journal, Summer 1998, that said, &quot;If you accept these statements as true, the implications are immense. That would be saying that personal guidance is better than the Bible and that God Calling has more actual words of Christ than the Bible. There is no denying that many statements in the book are inspiring. Scripture is often quoted in God Calling. But cultic literature often quotes Scripture. Reading Scripture wherever it may be found and being blessed by it does not automatically legitimize the publication in which it is included.&quot; There is much more information in this review by the Christian Research Journal that I think any discerning Christian should read before they decide to use this book or recommend it to their friends and family."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"My mother gave me my first copy of \\"God Calling\\" over 30 years ago. I passed my treasured copy on to an old friend and bought a new one, which is now falling apart. It puts life simply in perspective and is such a blessing. There is a short reading for each day. I find it goes along well with what Holy Scripture says. It is a compliation of what Jesus had to say to two women each day who were seeking him. I start at the beginning January 1 each year and it continues to minister to me."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"I heard of this book from my mother originally. It was gifted to me by someone I briefly met in a prayer group. Since then I have found that none of the entries conflict with Scriptures, nor with my personal religious faith, Catholicism. I am a minister to children at a local Juvenile Hall. And I have found that these young men and women have been drawn very deeply to the words of comfort and peace in this book. It speaks of patience, diligence, rest, strength, joy and doing little tasks for Christ. All of us have our own prisons, and we all need this book as part of our daily spiritual exercises."},{"Title":"God calling","review":"If this is not a life-changing book for you then I doubt there is any book that could be.

The book writes as if it is God's perspective and words, when it is really two listeners receiving messages. I found that kind of disturbing when I was reading and constantly had to remind myself that these are not God's words. I would recommend it to read because it is inspirational, but use your judgement, and know that these words are not from God but are from two ordinary people.

So far, it has some useful examples and the text seems clear enough. I will not know for sure until I work some tasks on my mainframe."},{"Title":"Rexx Programmer's Reference (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I should state up front that my prior experience with REXX was in the version specific to the late, lamented, Amiga systems -- in which the AmigaOS \\"message port\\" interprocess communication system was a natural fit to the REXX \\"ADDRESS &lt;application>\\" capability.This book covers the REXX language as defined by the second edition of Cowlishaw's \\"The REXX Language\\" and by the subsequent ANSI standard. It also introduces the Object Oriented version(s) (Open Object REXX, nee IBM Object REXX), and the Java Virtual Machine compatible NetREXX.First, the most blatant, though not a true typo, I've encountered so far, would be on page 214:\\"Otherwise Rexx interprets the carrot (>) as its 'greater than' symbol.\\"Okay, since one is explaining that Rexx treats the \\">\\" as a \\"greater than\\" symbol, I can understand one wouldn't call it a \\"greater than\\"... But 1) the word is CARET, not CARROT, and 2) the caret is \\"^\\", not \\">\\"... If one does not want to call \\">\\" a greater than, at least call it descriptively rather than by the name of a different character! Call it a \\"right angle bracket\\" and be done with it.As for the sloppy code... The author's sample code is RELYING on an artifact of REXX, namely that variables that have not been assigned a value return their own name, in all capitals, as a value. He uses, unsafely, uninitialized variables in REXX statements that should be using quoted string literals. On the same referenced page is the code snippet:'dir > diroutput.txt'do while lines(diroutput.txt) > 0... assorted statements not needed for my argumentThe first line, being quoted, is a literal string whose value is:dir > diroutput.txtAs \\"dir\\" is not a valid REXX statement, the entire string is automatically passed to the system command interpreter for execution (This a feature of REXX, any statement that is not a valid REXX statement is passed along to the current command interpreter; if the current command interpreter is a text editor, for example, the string becomes an editing command).This command runs the system \\"dir\\" command, routing the output to a file named \\"diroutput.txt\\".The second line of the snippet starts a while loop as long as \\"lines(diroutput.txt)\\" is non-zero. That is, the intent is to loop while the data file still has unprocessed lines. However, note that the file name is not quoted. This means REXX looks for a stem variable (any variable with \\".\\" is a \\"stem\\", a keyed/array structure variable) named DIROUTPUT., into which it will attempt to key by the value of a variable called \\"TXT\\". Since, in the snippet, TXT does not contain a value, it returns the uppercase TXT... There is no DIROUTPUT.TXT variable, so the value is the string \\"DIROUTPUT.TXT\\".On Windows, \\"diroutput.txt\\" and \\"DIROUTPUT.TXT\\" are the same file, but on other operating systems that are case sensitive, these would reference two distinct files.Furthermore, if the code, at some place prior to the while loop, contained an assignment such as:txt = \\"This is a long nonsense string\\"Then, while the quoted \\"dir\\" command using the file name \\"diroutput.txt\\", the unquoted lines() function will produce:\\"DIROUTPUT.This is a long nonsense string\\" as the file name.The author litters the chapter on \\"arrays\\" (stem variables) with similar insecure code. An example on page 62 assigning area codes to an \\"array\\" of cities shows:area.Chicago = 312 ; area.Wrigleyville = 773area.Homewood = 708 ; area.Geneva = 630Again, this is relying upon all the city names being treated as uninitialized variables, and hence becoming the uppercase only string version of the city name.If one were to use some user input of city name, and did not ensure it was converted to uppercase...myCity = \\"Chicago\\"myArea = area.myCitywill FAIL as area.\\"Chicago\\" is not equal to area.\\"CHICAGO\\".Furthermore, if someone (maliciously?) were to insert a line reading:Chicago = Genevawhere Geneva is still an uninitialized variable returning the string \\"GENEVA\\", and later in the code attempted to retrieve the area code of Chicago using:ChiArea = area.Chicagothey will not get 312, but 630... Since Chicago (CHICAGO) now has a value of \\"GENEVA\\", area.Chicago is really the equivalent of area.\\"GENEVA\\".Philosophically, I also take exception to the author's categorization of \\"leave\\" and \\"iterate\\" as \\"unstructured\\" control statements. Whereas REXX's \\"signal\\" is just a fancy name for an unstructured \\"goto\\" control statement, capable of creating spaghetti code, \\"leave\\" and \\"iterate\\" only apply within a loop statement: \\"leave\\" moves one to the bottom of the loop, and thence to the normal loop exit; \\"iterate\\" moves one to the beginning of the next loop iteration. The loop, overall, still follows the structured concept of \\"one entry, one exit\\".Which seems clearer?i = 0do while i &lt; 10say \\"Guess?\\"pull guessif guess == mynumber thenleavei = i + 1endordone = 0i = 0do while i &lt; 10if done == 0 thendosay \\"Guess?\\"pull guessif guess == mynumber thendomyI = idone = 1endi = i + 1end"},{"Title":"Rexx Programmer's Reference (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"As the author, I'd like to respond to the review entitled \\"Sloppy code, typo's -- unsafe for beginners\\" that appears below. The reviewer criticizes the book based on only a partial reading of it. As he states, his review is based on what \\"...I've encountered so far,\\" to page 214. Reading the entire 700 page book yields a different perspective.As the book explains, its first eight chapters are a simple tutorial on Rexx. Example scripts are designed to be short, clear, simple, and readable. They rely on common Rexx conventions and defaults. They generally exclude variable declarations, error and return code checking, exception routines, and other coding features present in industrial-strength programs. In a tutorial these would needlessly complicate the code and confuse the beginner.The reviewer appears not to have understood this. The chapters following the tutorial present the advanced features and techniques of Rexx coding that are used in writing the industrial-strength code the reviewer wants to see.For example, chapter 8 discusses variable scoping and analyzes ways to safely interface routines. Chapter 9 covers how to develop bug-proof code using the debugging and the trace facility, while chapter 10 details how to trap and manage errors with exception routines. Chapter 14 illustrates how to analyze feedback from external commands to develop fail-safe scripts.To specifically address the reviewer's complaints: chapter 12 discusses the need to initialize all variables in production programs. It also discusses the differing approaches to quoting he raises in his example. (Chapter 12 presents many other \\"best practices\\" for writing reliable programs, including a section on common coding errors and how to avoid them.)The book discusses the reviewer's concern about case-sensitivity in file naming conventions at many points (pages 186, 214, 436 and 519). The reviewer has mis-read the example he cites as incorrect on page 214. The explanation following that code specifically states \\"This filename may or may not need to be coded in quotation marks depending on which operating system the script runs under. Unix-derived systems like Linux use case-sensitive filenames, so you will typically encode filenames in quotation marks. Windows and related systems do not require quoting filenames; they are not case-sensitive.\\"Concerning the reviewer's argument on the Leave and Iterate instructions: the book follows expert opinion in referring to these as \\"unstructured constructs.\\" For accurate, authoritative definition of structured programming, refer to the classic works of Ed Yourdon, Edsger Dijkstra, or Ole Johan Dahl.What's the bottom line? Is this book worthwhile? During its development the book was reviewed by about a dozen Rexx developers in its entirety, and about three dozen experts - including nearly all the luminaries in the Rexx community - provided feedback on parts of it. While there is plenty of room for differences of professional opinion and coding style, the reviewer errored in not reading the entire book before publishing his emotional, negative review."},{"Title":"Rexx Programmer's Reference (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I have used REXX extensively on mainframe and PCs.

Ms. Wolfe has always been a favourite author of mine, but The Road to Avalon is hands down her best ever.All the magic, pagentry, and bru-ha-ha traditionally associated with the Authurian Legends are out the window, with real people left in their place. And yet, still there is that feeling of magic and love underlying it all, enough to keep a sense of wonder long after the first, second, third reading.My copy is dog-eared, torn, and generally just worn out...I hope I can find another copy here. If you find one yourself, get it! It's beyond worth it."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"The Road to Avalon is the story of King Arthur written as pure historical fiction with very elements of fantasy. This makes it quite a different story from the one that is normally told. There is no magic, no dragons, no quest for the Holy Grail and such things as are normally incorporated into the story.Uther Pendragon and Igrane married and three months later had a son. Because Igrane was married to another man when the son was conceived (though it was Uther's child) they thought it best that the child not be Uther's heir. So he was sent away to be raised with peasants. Fast forward nine years and Igrane has had no other living children, so Uther sends his father in law, Merlin, to fetch young Arthur and raise him to be a king. Only when Merlin finds him he discovers the boy has endured years of abuse. He takes him home to his villa, Avalon, and raises him along side his eight year old daughter Morgan. But he never tells Arthur who he is.Morgan and Arthur grow up together and are in love. But Arthur is reveled to be the next High King when he is 16 and he learns Morgan is his half-aunt and he can never marry her. They end their relationship. Arthur doesn't want to live without Morgan but she knows the country needs him and sends him away.You can guess the rest. This is a lovely version of the classic Camelot tale and is very romantic and sweet. My only complaint is that Morgan doesn't have much of a personality-she's basically a reflection of Arthur, who is a lovely portrayal of a tortured soul who only exists because of love. And the choice she made about not marrying Arthur because they couldn't have children after her son Mordred was born seems stupid. I don't think that she did it purely so Mordred could have a happy childhood-she could have made him happy with her and Arthur. But other than that she's a great charecter. And it is nice how no one is really evil in this book or wholly unlikable-everyone is portrayed very fairly.Anyway, good book. Four point five stars."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"I discovered this novel roughly ten years ago in a used bookstore and foreshame to the publisher that's no longer printing it. Seven years later, I included it in my graduate thesis on fairytale motifs in romance novels. But this book is so much more than a formula romance.

This book alone turned me into a great Joan Wolf fan, who is a consummate story teller."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this wonderful book. It is just too bad that it is out of print. I sincerely hope that some publisher would re-release this jewel of a book to the public again.Out of all of the King Arthur stories that I have read, this is the one that really gets me emotionally involved with the characters. This is no usual Arthurian where there is magic and the battle between the good and evil. It is so much more realistic and the scenes are so vivid that you really feel that this could have happened in history.Not only are the war scenes and the relationships between the characters memoreable- the love story between Morgan and Arthur is heart wrenching.I really hope that somehow this story gets more attention. It truely deserves it."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"A highly interesting and surprising reimagining of the Arthurian legend, almost the exact opposite of Marion Zimmer Bradley's &quot;The Mists of Avalon.&quot; In this version, there is no magic, and many of the characters are related to each other in unexpected ways (for example, Merlin is Igraine's father, while Morgan is Igraine's younger sister, instead of daughter. As a result, Morgan is Arthur's aunt, rather than half-sister.) The main focus here is on Morgan and Arthur's love for each other, which greatly alters the famous love triangle with Arthur, Gwenhyfar and Bedwyr (Lancelot.) Also, Mordred is no longer the evil usurper who plots to overthrow Arthur; here he is a basically goodhearted boy who lacks his father's kingly ambition and skills, and who is easily manipulated by his cruel brother Agravaine, with tragic consequences.As a result of all this, &quot;The Road to Avalon&quot; always took me by surprise because so many aspects of the legend that I took for granted had been altered. I found it to be a refreshing and moving version, especially the love story between Morgan and Arthur, which is every bit as heartbreaking as the traditional Arthur-Gwenhyfar one is. While &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; remains the ultimate Arthurian novel for me, this one is not far behind it. As Publisher's Weekly says, &quot;Joan Wolf is a master storyteller...portraying characters with crisp and memorable originality...capturing--and enriching--the tragic sweep of romance and idealism inherent in the Arthurian Tale.&quot; Read it"},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"If you want an original historical Arthurian novel full of romance and good plot lines, I would recommend this one. Joan Wolf has done her historical research --- her Arthur is the Riothamus \\"King of the Britons\\" recorded in reliable continental sources. And there is no magic or fantasy here (apart from the special connection between Arthur and Morgan, which I didn't think was necessary for the plot.)But many aspects don't add up historically, which is why I only give it 4 stars. For example, the opulence of Camelot, and Arthur minting coins are highly unlikely. The authentic British kings Wolf names, such as Maelgwn and Urien, are from a century or so after this novel is set. The topography is sometimes made up to suit the story. Most puzzlingly, Wolf seems to imply that Riothamus' actual, well recorded, battle against the Visigoths in Gaul was a story invented by Agravaine!"},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"The hallmark of a great romance for me is one which makes me fall in love with the lovers. In Road to Avalon, I not only love Arthur and Morgan, I also fell in love with Gwenhyfar and Bedwyr. I like the twist of the traditional love triangle becoming a quadrangle.Towards the end of the book, I found myself reading more and more slowly because I knew what was coming and did not want it to end."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"This is just as engrossing as Mary Stewart's Merlin series...and that is saying a lot!! The problem with Arthurian stories is that most angles of the classic story have been done, in books and in movies. Stewart's series takes the point of view of Merlin, and develops his character in a way that has not been done before. Joan Wolf's book concentrates on Arthur as king, and the history of Britain in the 6th and 7th centuries. It imparts both a great deal of history (Saxon threat, for example) and it is probably the most romantic Arthurian telling yet. The fun part, is that though the character names are all there, you will not expect the way the events unfold.Merlin is no magician, he's a Roman general. Mordred is responsible for Arthur's death..but this is a new take. No Lancelot, but there is Bedwyr, Arthur's right hand in battle, close friend, and yes he's Guenevier's lover. Morgan, Merlin's daughter, is the love of Arthur's life, for his entire life. This all made for a fantastic read, one that kept me up past my bedtime numerous times. The book is part of a trilogy focusing on this early British history, the final book being the story of Arthur the Great. The only down side to these books is that they are out of print. They are not hard to find used, but unfortunately they were printed at a time when Harlequin Romance covers were all the rage..it's rather embarrassing to read in public! I don't understand why such covers ended up on these books, they have some romance, but they are by no means romance novels."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"A new view at the Camelot story, but I couldn't put it down!

Arthur and Morgan's touching love was so heartbreaking. You realize just how easy it is to screw up your life. Also, I was pleased to find a romance of Arthur and Morgan because always felt they were the ones who should be together. I never liked Gwenhwyfar. I loved Arthur and Morgan!"},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"Stop the presses! I've finally found an Arthurian novel in which Morgan, Gwenhwyfar, and Morgause are all sympathetic! Not to mention one with no religious bickering! (At one point in the book, a pagan knight criticizes a grouchy monk. Arthur responds, \\"If we judged all religions by their human representatives, they would all be found lacking.\\" That's the extent of religious debate in this book, and if someone had said it in _Mists of Avalon_, maybe everyone would have wised up a little.)Arthur, hidden away in an obscure village, falls into the hands of an abusive farmer. One day, his life changes when Merlin, a Roman-type noble of the old school, comes to carry him off to the villa of Avalon, to be raised and taught by Merlin and Ector--and to be trained as the prince he never knew he was. Though his life is more comfortable now, he is still scarred and withdrawn. Only Merlin's daughter Morgan, sweet and shy but with remarkable intelligence and emotional courage, can break through his shell and become his friend. And when they grow up, he falls in love with her, never knowing she is his aunt. Arthur ascends the throne, planning to make Morgan his queen, but Merlin forbids the match and tells him why. Arthur is heartbroken. He wants to defy Merlin, or failing that, to kill himself, but Morgan convinces him to be strong for his kingdom.(Big Snip for Spoilers.)There is something comfortable and comforting about this retelling of the legend. Why? I think it's because it never makes you take sides. It doesn't feel the need to make one of the women sympathetic and the others evil. It doesn't preach any creed or bash any philosophy. It's just a love story about real people, with good and bad qualities, all of whom we can understand. This may not be my favorite Arthurian novel in terms of prose style, but I recommend it. It is beautiful in a simple way, like Morgan in her garden."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"An incredible version of King Arthur sans Lancelot. This is the story of Arthur, and his more than humble beginnings, until Merlin tells him years after he \\"adopted\\" him that he is the heir to the British throne after Uther. He is Uther and Igraine's legitimate son. While Merlin is preparing him to be a leader whilst living in Avalon with his daughter Morgan, the two children develop a lasting friendship that turns into love. He doesn't know for years that Uther is his father, Igraine his mother, Merlin his grandfather and Morgan his aunt until he is to be king. By then it is too late to stop the love between Morgan and Arthur.He becomes king but he still wants to marry Morgan. Merlin & Morgan warn him that the threat of incest will impede his reign and tell him it's impossible to marry her. He does eventually marry Gwenhwyfar in a loveless marriage to produce an heir while continuing his relationship with Morgan. Meanwhile, Gwenhwyfar finds comfort with Bedwyr with Arthur's knowledge and unspoken permission. Morgan has been keeping a secret from Arthur for 15 years that also comes out.Read this book! It's a refreshing storyline that I haven't encountered before. Bedwyr is Gwenhwyfar's lover and there is no Lancelot to fuddle things up as usual. Mordred is portrayed as a very unwordly teen and unsure of himself and others. Agravaine is as obnoxious and cunning as he usually is in other novels. Gwenhwyfar is in love with two men. Finally, the relationship between Arthur and Morgan is not a simple one but a lasting one."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"I just happened to glance at this book at a used book store and it looked as if it could be pretty good. I love the Arthurian legend and read anything I can about it. Not since Mists of Avalon have I been so blown away by an Arthurian novel. Joan Wolf takes the traditional story and changes it ever so slightly here and there to make this almost all-too-familiar story fresh and new. I developed a new feeling for this tragic story that has become so familiar to me. It's been a while since a book has left me feeling so completely drained of emotion afterwards. I thank the gods that I was at home when I finished it and not at work or on the bus. I broke down in almost gut-wrenching sobs. I didn't realize this book was out of print until I came to write this review. I'm extremely happy that I found it and hope many other people have the same fortune I did. Mists of Avalon will remain my favorite, but this one is a very close second."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"The Road to Avalon shows us a non fantasy version of the life of Arthur, showing us a more realistic portrayal of this mythical king.

It gives us a completely different portrayal of Morgan and Mordred, and shows Arthur's unending love towards his friends. A great read! I fully recommend it. :-)"},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"This is the first book I've read about King Arthur. So, I didn't have any strong feelings about how or what should happen. I'm not a student of European History so I have no idea about the history at all.This is the second novel I've read by Joan Wolf. The first was 'No Dark Place' which I did not enjoy at all. 'The Road to Avalon' however I enjoyed very much.I enjoyed the story, the characters and their relationships. The story is somewhat simple but very emotional with complicated relationships of forbidden and unrequited love, betrayal, deception, jealousy and deep admiration.I enjoyed the description of the landscape, the architecture and the horsemanship, which reminded me of seeing the Lipizzaner Stallions perform. I really liked the complexities that Wolf ascribes to these characters.I enjoyed the love story between Arthur and Morgan and while there was a thread of fantasy woven through their relationship that I would have liked better without I still enjoyed their story very much.I thought the contemporary dialogue gave the story a less authentic feel but it also makes this novel much more assessable for a greater audience. The history wasn't so dense that it overwhelmed the reader but I would have liked a map.I found this to be the perfect introduction to King Arthur and I think fans of historical romance would eat this up."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"If you have read any number of books, you would realize that no two are alike. The novel ROAD TO AVALON by Joan Wolf is an incrediable story that made me laugh out loud, care for the characters more than I thought I would, or could, and actually cry! I had tears streaming down my face as I closed the cover of this heart-felt tale. I have never had the pleasure of crying over a book, and I wish I could convince as many people as possible of its quality so they may experience these feelings as well. The one true way to rate any piece of literature, is whether or not it can move you and your emotions with the author's imagination and the way they express it to the readers. In other words, &quot;was it believable, and more importantly, enjoyable?&quot; it most certainly was and I can't wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"I have been reading Arthurian books for years, and when i found this book &quot;years ago&quot; i loved it above all others.

The scene where Arthur comes face to face with the son he didn't know he had is gut wrenching.I highly recommend this book, as well as the other two that follow in this trilogy,Born of the SunandThe Edge of Light. I wish the author would return to this style and quality of writing as opposed to the light fluffy regencies she is currently writing."},{"Title":"The Road to Avalon","review":"I am a lover of Arthurian legend; a fierce lover. I find it dissapointing that most books on this subject are never about Arthur. It's always Lancelot, Guenevere, or any other character authors create. Then came Joan Wolf, daring to write a book of Arthur about Arthur. And not just the stupid, unimaginate character depicted by many writers, but a man among men, not only with a dream, but with the brilliance to carry it through. An Arthur who is more than Guenevere's lap dog. Hurray for Ms. Wolf!You find all the elements that make a book outstanding here: chivalry, adventure, battles, blood, love, friendship . . . and that beautiful love story between Arthur and Morgan.This book is a must for every Arthurian lover.

There are so many wonderful books written now for this age group. However, I had some serious issues about this book.While the storyline was fair, the whole premise of the book was kind of scary. If I had found my teenage daughter reading this, I would have been upset.The basic storyline of three girls looking for love is not new. However, what is new is that they are 15 and 16 years old and while they are not portrayed as delinquents, the author gives them no life at all except when it comes to parties, booze and sex.These girl spend the entire book drinking beer (when did this become ok at 15?) they keep trying to make out with older guys (I thought this was illegal) and through all of this, while there is mention of parents, NONE of them are even remotely important to the plot. These issues seem to be treated as a mere means to a result (to get the guy to like them).I am not that old that I don't know what is going on with the teens today, however, do I want to hand them over books that promote this kind of behaviour. NOPE.There are many, many teen books out there that explore these very same subject matters in a much more enlightened way. Buy those and skip this one."},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","review":"This book's a fine book to read, for fun, but I wouldn't go as far to say it was great. To me, it felt like the author had very little sense of how teenage girls would talk, feel, or what they would do. Some ideas seemed obviously horrible, and when the girls went ahead and did them, they were humiliated and teased, which didn't seem to matter anyway because they showed no emotional reaction.BAD IDEAS INCLUDE:- trying to have sex with someone just so you can have'experience'- writing a poem that says you love a teacher, then handing itto him specifically- Answering quizzes jokingly and then, in an attempt tobefriend and popular girl, emailing it to herAlthough the book describes more mature topics such as drinking, smoking, and sex, the writing never seems to rise above the level of a sixth grader. Perhaps it was chic lit for a younger era. Being in highschool, I didn't appreciate it.Overall I felt this book tried to be like GOSSIP GIRL, but didn't approach it correctly. It is, by no means, a horrible book, I just felt it seemed a little too young for highschoolers"},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","review":"The Dating Game-The book the dating game by Natalie Standford was a very interesting book. The main points never rush into love. I think that a girl would want to read this and not a guy. The reason why is that it talks about things about girls and not as much as to guys. But that is my own opinion. The characters are well explained. They have minds of there own. The book is based on the teens and not the adults and teachers but only one guy teacher Dan. Every girl has a crush on him.The three main characters are Holly, Mads, and Lina. They are best friends. This book kind of relates to me but not as much. It really didn't interest me, it wasn't a pull me in kind of book. But that is what I think. It might be different for other girls. So I wouldn't read it again. Other girls who love reading \\"Love\\" books would want to read this"},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","review":"The Dating Game by Natalie Standiford rides the wave of alternative writing styles in young adult literature. Each chapter in this book opens with a whimsical horoscope followed by a mix of dialog, emails, instant message text, and quizzes that will appeal to teenage girls.The story is set in a California high school for gifted students. Sophomores Madison, Holly and Lina need a project for their Interpersonal Human Development (IHD) class. They conceive the idea of creating and managing an on-line quiz for their fellow students hoping to prove their theory that boys are more obsessed with sexual thoughts than girls. The quiz is also designed as a matchmaking service to help the three girls meet their dream dates.No complex issues are addressed in this story. Each girl works through a problem with little resolution in the end. Lina has a crush on the IHD teacher that blinds her to a senior boy who is pursuing her. Madison feels she is the last 15 year old virgin in California and sets out to change her image. Holly is the subject of rumors that depict her as a sex crazed wild woman and finds it almost impossible to get her classmates to believe her side of the story.The characters are two dimensional but the high school setting and the weekend parties are believable. Although the writing style has high appeal for young adult readers I don't recommend this book because of the causal attitude toward teenage drinking and sexual behavior."},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. I found that it did talk about the tough issues of teenage life, like having the hots for a teacher or being called a slut. And overall I found this book to be a promising new series for teen girls. But there were also some things that I didn't really like.There was a bit in this book about smoking pot, and beer, and even sex, so I wouldn't encourage anyone who is not a teenager yet to read this book. It's not to be considered a children's book and should be found in the YA or TEEN section of bookstores and libraries.Anyway, this book is about three girls who are having to do a project for their sex ed class. So, they decide to set up a blog that they can post quizzes on to answer the question: Are boys more obsessed with sex? They soon find themselves learning that the answer may not be as obvious as it seems.Overall, I enjoyed this book and didn't want to put it down, so that I could see what would happen to the characters next. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone under my age, but for anyone who is a fan of Gossip Girl or A List, this is a must.

A red sticker on the cover announced that it was \\"ONLY $1.\\" It looked like a light, fun teen romantic comedy. I thought, Why not?\\"The Dating Game\\" is the story of three high school sophomores and their often-tumultuous search for love. Madison \\"Mads\\" Markowitz is cute, but almost completely inexperienced with boys; unfortunately, she's got her sight set on Sean, a senior who dates sophisticated college women. Holly Anderson is a busty blonde who's fooled around with a few guys and even lost her virginity, but when a joke gets out of hand, she finds herself with a totally undeserved reputation as the class slut. Lina Ozu, my favorite character (perhaps because she was the only one I could relate to personally), has a passionate crush on a teacher and hangs on his every word, picking apart everything he says for some hint that he likes her too.When the three friends team up for a class project, they come up with what seems a brilliant idea: to create a matchmaking website for their classmates, with questionnaires and quizzes. Ultimately, they hope to collect evidence that boys are more obsessed with sex than girls. Of course, they use the opportunity to set up \\"blind\\" dates for themselves as well - with mixed results.It's a shallow, predictable story with superficial characters, but it works very well as guilty-pleasure reading. The format is winsome, with the straightforward flow of the narrative punctuated by the girls' quizzes, e-mails, and IMs. Each chapter opens with a horoscope for one of the girls, which hints humorously at the events ahead. It's a quick read with plenty of funny moments, the literary equivalent of some chick flick starring a recent graduate from the Disney Channel.Where I have some trouble with this book is when I think of it in the hands of its intended audience. I'm not a prude when it comes to literature for children and young adults. I don't believe there's anything to be gained by sheltering young people from reality. They are far more capable than most adults believe they are - or actually WANT them to be - of handling what we think of as \\"mature\\" themes. I love gritty, realistic fiction that opens young people to new experiences and ways of being, allowing them to explore complex social and moral questions from a place of safety. I don't expect good fiction to see the world in black and white or provide pat answers to serious issues.That doesn't mean that anything goes. There's a fine line between depicting the world the way it really is and condoning it unchallenged, and parts of \\"The Dating Game\\" fall on the wrong side of that line. For the most part, high school students don't read novels about high school students. Middle school students read novels about high school students. Readers of \\"The Dating Game\\" are likely to be several years younger than Holly, Lina, and Mads. Natalie Standiford depicts high school life as awash in sex, with no sense of consequences or discretion. I can't think of even one character in this novel who views sex as something powerful and lovely to be saved for a committed, caring relationship, rather than something to experience as soon as possible in order to fit in with the crowd. Ultimately, Standiford makes the case that not everyone is actually \\"doing it,\\" or at least doing as much of it as they'd like everyone else to think they are - but she doesn't really question the idea of sex as a recreational sport or virginity as nothing more than an obstacle to social success. It's hard to OVERstate the importance of sexuality to most adolescents, but somehow Standiford has managed - her characters think and talk about nothing else. She also portrays the use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana as inevitable, with no consequences more serious than temporary social disgrace (which is, granted, no small matter to most teens). Preteens enjoy reading about teenagers as a glimpse into their own near-futures, and to give them a sense of what will be expected of them. I can't help feeling that novels like this leave middle-school readers with a sense that sex and drugs are not just issues they are likely to face in their high school years, but parts of high school life they can't possibly be \\"normal\\" if they don't get involved in."},{"Title":"The Dating Game #1 (No. 1)","review":"When three best friends, Mads, Lina, and Holly, are given a project in their sex-ed class, they decide to start a school-sponsored web-site called The Dating Game, where teens can fill out profiles for themselves, vote on polls, fill out questionnaires, and much more.

Unfortunately, the project has them stumped. Until inspiration strikes, and they decide to set up a blog specifically for RSAGE students, filled with quizzes, and questionnaires, that will help the three girls prove their point: that guys think about sex way more than girls do. The blog becomes a hit, and soon Mads, Lina and Holly have created a matchmaking service, which even they have tried out - not to great results, however. Soon the three girls are the hottest thing in school, but maybe that's not the greatest thing, for Holly is quickly labeled as a tramp, Mads is labeled as a little kid with no-experience, and Lina is madly in love with her IHD teacher, Dan Shulman. Obviously, the dating game is much more complicated than anyone truly anticipated.I have read many teen lit novels, but I rarely enjoy them as much as I enjoyed Natalie Standiford's effort THE DATING GAME. The premise of the novel, and now, series, was wonderful, and really brings a lot of questions to the minds of teen readers - especially females - such as: what do guys really expect from girls and vice versa? The characters - Mads, Holly and Lina - were entertaining, and all bring their own quirks to the novel, promising for much more fun and excitement in the sequel BREAKING UP IS REALLY, REALLY HARD TO DO.

They figured they can set up a website with some questions for all the kids in their school to answer, and that would prove it. Maybe they could even match up people who had similar interests! What they find though, is that even in an anonymous questionnaire their classmates lie and exaggerate their experience. It's not all bad though, the girls figure they can set themselves up with their crushes through the guise of having it be part of the matchmaking service they are offering. Unfortunately, trying to guess who someone is when they don't tell the truth can be...tricky. The girls have lots of ups and downs with their dating game and discover the truth about which gender thinks about sex more.This was a fun read. It was light and interesting. The three main characters were only mildly self-obsessed, but at least I found their flaws entertaining. I liked the whole concept behind this story. The girls have to do a class project for sex ed and decide to make a website poll sort of thing after they took a \\"What Color is Your Love Aura\\" quiz. It was a new idea and I enjoyed it and the format that it took within the novel. It broke up the prose in a nice way, along with the IMs.Most of the secondary characters blend together. There were a couple that stood out, because their was something unique about them. Dan was a young teacher that many of the girls had crushes on. There was a geek that Madison was consistently mean to. Things like that are what made the characters stand out. I'm hoping that there is more development as the series goes along. This book only took place in a month or so.I'm very interested to see what happens in the next novel, because their were a couple characters in this one that I want to see how their situations pan out.This was a very light, pretty fun read.

All of the quiz takers are students, which allows the girls --- Holly, Mads and Lina --- to get an insider's view of what their fellow students are thinking and feeling when it comes to dating and sex.The story focuses on the search for the right person to date, the urge to be popular, the feeling of being alone and isolated, and the potential hurt caused by nasty rumors. The situations presented here are ones faced by most high school students, and the girls' reactions to them are quite realistic.Readers will care very much about the main characters. Holly, Mads and Lina are close friends and do not compete with one another. They have their own strengths and weaknesses, and are honest about them. All three have romantic designs on boys who are unattainable for different reasons and for different lengths of time.The supporting characters are decently developed: Dan, the young teacher, seems charming and the potential boyfriends are interesting. Holly's boyfriend begins dating her because the other boys talked about how friendly she is. He ends up genuinely caring for Holly, but they need to work through some issues before they can have a healthy relationship. The parents are a bit underdeveloped and seem more like caricatures than characters, but I think this was a deliberate choice on the author's part. THE DATING GAME is not about the parents; it revolves around the teenage protagonists.Probably the best-developed supporting character is Ramona, the gothic student who is in love with Dan. She is an interesting foil for all three main characters and injects a lot of humor into the story.Every chapter begins with a rotating horoscope of one of the main characters, a catchy twist and an interesting lead-in to the happenings in each chapter.

Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes.

I liked his \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" and, I've a fine appreciation for the man's sheer wit. \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" is the best short story I had to read in High School. \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is an overblown rant against religion dressed in the trappings of novelization.I found the plot absurd. Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

However, after a while this book sort of lags along. Twain's tale of his post-civil war trip down the river is not interesting enough to take up the space and detail that he devotes to it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, I thought it was one of Twain's worst, and that comes from someone who loves many of Twain's other works. In fact for my essay I compared this work to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Twain uses the dialect of the people in King Arthur's time, and sometimes it can get very confusing. I skipped over several paragraphs just because I couldn't make any sense of it. As long as Twain isn't using the dialect of that time the story line is very good. I found it annoying how Twain over played the stupidity of people of King Arthur's time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this book, expecting it to be similar to Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. However, I struggled through the old English monologues of some of the characters. While this is an amusing tale of a 19th century American attempting to modernize 6th century Britain, I wish I had applied my recreational reading time elsewhere.This paperback printing is difficult to read, too. The words run too close to the spine, requiring me to hold the book flat to read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee Takes A blast from the past. Yea right! this book is extremely long and rarely has any action to keep you awake if I were a book rater I would give this book a two out of ten thumps up . this story takes place in the 6th century and the only good part was when they were going to burn Hank Morgan and to top it off they didn't even burn him because brought his knowledge from current time and fooled King Author by saying if they don't let him go he will shut down the moon but it was acuity a solar eclipse so the moon slowly faded away so they let him free. Honestly I think this book is not for kids our age it's more for adults. Because I couldn't even stay focus it was so boring I started reading other books.

Hank Morgan ,the main character, gets cracked on the head with a crowbar while working in his colt-factory in Hartford, Connecticut. He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars.

It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, originally published in 1883, is part memoir, part paean to the Mississippi River and its culture, and part compilation of whatever miscellaneous anecdotes Twain thought were worth relating.Twain begins with a history of the Mississippi since it was discovered by de Soto in 1541.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home. Quite accurate!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain, a conecticut from the 19th centuries brings modernization into the 5-6th century and seems to change the world at that time.

Yet, Hank( the connecticut's real name) is not a real magician.

In the end, all of britain goes against him and 53 other people, but he prevails using his knowledge and cunning. He sleeps for 16 centuries until the time comes for him to wake up and be in his own time again."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's time-machine drops the main character in this book in the 6th century of King Arthur's Great-Britain.What he sees is a nation of slaves under the heel of king, Church and noble ('a privileged class is but a band of slaveholders'): 'sweat blood for them, starve that they might be fed, work that they might play, go naked that they might wear silk and jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them.'But the slaves were so poor-spirited that they took the thanks (cuffs and contempt) and the attention they got as an honor. They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life.

I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small.

Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"When Hank Morgan, the head superintendent of the great arms factory, receives a smack on the head given by a friend nicknamed Hercules, he wakes up under an oak tree. A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency...

Our protagonist revolutionizes their society be introducing them to the printing press, the bicycle, and socialism, among other things. The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts.

Hank, the main character, manages to go back in time to the year 513. Hank then goes about the business of trying to modernize a soceity that seem to want to resist any improvement. Although the main objective of the story is Hank's attempt to modernize Britian, he has some pretty wacky adventures along the way. From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature. The book is a joy to read of a distant day when the steamboat was king of the river!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I thought this was agreat book because it has time travel and all the stuff about King Arthur and Merlin. It was kind of cool because he tried to change how it was in midieval times by adding all this electric stuff like phones and lights and other modern stuff from his time, into the past. He tried to change them entirely to a new government and basically a new place. The ending was different from normal books because it didn't end well. It had a twist to the ending."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A fan of Mark Twain and a fond reader of Prince and the Pauper, I recommend this read for children's classics series. Though not for a supplement read in the classroom, undoubtedly the book is a great read as you meet the characters:Hank Morgan, the Connecticut YankeeClarence, a page who become Hank's right hand manMerlin, the King's magicianKing Arthur, King of EnglandKnights of the Round Table - Sir Launcelet, etc.King's wife, an evil queen Fay, an old abbot, etc.Having spent his boy hood in a town in Mississippi, Mark Twain is one of the America's greatest and most beloved writers. In this book, Hank Morgan wakes to find himself in King Arthur's England. The Yankee uses all his scientific knowledge to be a Chief Minister in the King's Court. He outwits the magician Merlin and gracefully win the kingdom. There are exciting chapters like the Ogre's Castle, The Yankee and the King sold as Slaves, Yankees fight with the knives, in merlin's cave. Was it a dream and did he get back to Connecticut - You got to read the book. Seriously, if there were no video games or the television shows, kids would have loved to read these classics or rathar listen to the adventure tales like these. A good read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised!

Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life.

Not any more. And doesn't a pilot stand at the wheel and gently guides his craft down and back. Ha. Twain's description of the Mississippi River is a voluptuous exploration of his lifetime love, and of American history as well, and the complexity of it is astounding. There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him. There are scores of scenes like this that make you bust out laughing, and scores more where you choke up at the majesty and tragedy of it all. Magnificent book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The story is classic. In the chapter regarding the burial of a freeman there is a remarkable defense of the Terror during the French Revolution. Worth reading and perhaps even including as a source should you ever chance to write a paper on the beheading of poor king Louis."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I wanted to like this book. I expected to like it. It's got many of my favorite ingredients - time travel, satire, Britain, but I kept finding it falling flat.Part of the reason is that there is no clear setting. I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us? Twain implies not, but I don't know if I'd agree or if I'd attach a greater failing to the man than the idea.(less)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The Twain tale that pleases me most.

It's true, some pieces of this are dated and, frankly, the facts regarding populations and cargo tonnage and numbers of schools in various towns is not very interesting, but there is only so much of that to put up with. Most of the rest is just pure fun to read. Some of it, laugh-out-loud fun to read.

As it says in the introduction, this is a great 'hodgepodge' of a book,being statistical journelese one moment,then pure Twain the next,and its this pure Twain that keeps you on board reading even the appendices at the end!Its obvious Twain couldn't stand the twee 'Merry England' novels of Sir Walter Scott,which no doubt he deplored as a boy,but I think he's dragging us into one of his famous exagerations when he blames Scott, not only for the outdated chivelry nonsense that plagued the Southern sensibilities of his day,but also for being the fundamental cause of the civil war!! As I say, pure Twain!I guess if we went back to the days of 'sexist' literature-'Boy's' books and 'Girl's' books-'Life on...' would be a boys book,but it is also a fascinating piece of historical reading; Twain looking back on a bygone era whilst we today read his 130 year old account of things.And when looking back on historical times,who better to read than someone who was there? Who better to read than Mark Twain?"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

This novel is no exception as Twain strikes the balance between the two again here. The premise for this novel is perhaps Twain's most original idea (when did Tom Sawyer ever time travel?) and the story and characters satisify at every turn. While this isn't Twain's best work, I think that some of his funniest moments are in this novel. I recommend Tom Sawyer as the place to begin reading Twain, but if you are already a fan then this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I remember I loved reading Tom Sawyer when I was a kid and I continued reading him in college. So when I started reading this, I had high expectations - not disappointed. This story is waaaaay ahead of its time in terms of morality and the social order. There's also a subdued hilarity that sometimes isn't so subdued as the main character will voice criticism or state his views on a wide variety of subjects. Twain wrote this in 1899 but it sounds like something you would hear from someone a 100 years later. It could just be timeless. Do yourself a favor and read this book because its highly entertaining, very humorous, and definitely an excellent read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, is one of my all time choices, an incredible tale full of imagination , funny situations , magic and amazing adventures, is funny how our hero brings to King Arthur court all the inventions , ocupations, and culture from XX century and how all the knigths and the population in a very entertaining way for the reader, assume the whole way of life supposed to be achieved in our culture centuries ahead and all that with a hilarious normality. you can find also very interesting situations in wich King Arthur is involved because of his relation with the main character, definitelly you have to read this book , this is the kind of ligth literature we all should be used entertaining with , all parets must show their kids what is good and bad literature and recommend masterpieces like this"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book, \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court\\" by Mark Twain was very intriguing to read. The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot. I thought that this novel was wonderfully put together. The way Hank instituted 19th century ideals into the 6th century was a perfect way to add pizazz to the novel. Although there were some parts in the novel that were slow and undeveloped, the best parts and the main parts over-shadow those. This novel is one you MUST-READ!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this book, a man named Hank Morgan is transported from the 19th century to the Dark Ages. He lives there for about a decade living a full and exciting life. He gets by using his wits, courage, common sense and 19th century knowledge to survive. A war takes place, and England is left in ruins. Hank sees this as his oppurtunity to proclaim a republic and destroy feudalism once and for all, but he has some opposition...I really liked this book. It was very exciting and the characters were hilarious; there's King Arthur, who can't swallow his pride and will fight on suicidely. There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things! The only downside id the difficult vocabulary and the occasional archaic expressions. Words like &quot;obstetatiously&quot; and &quot;obstenuating&quot; or &quot;hence&quot; and &quot;smote&quot;. Besides that, this is a great book that you can really get into whether you're 12 or 65."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A brilliant novel. Twain's best, if you ask me. This is abook that has a lot to say, and unlike many books with a lot to say,it says them all without becoming dry or straying from the story. If you don't like this book I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read the book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time. After King Arthur dies, Hank must help the empire live on.I recommend this to people who are 13 or older and enjoy long, very detailed books. There are also some great pictures included in the book, from portraits of Mark Twain to pictures of King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Language difficult for my 13 year old."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I thought this novel was a good book and anyone that has read about King Arthur and liked it would like this book. It is a totally new idea and novelty counts. It was exiting because you read about his advancements and achievements in the Yankee's own writing.

Still it is worthwhile reading for any Twain fan."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I thought that the book, if taken at face value, was just another so-so medieval tale. I may have thought that Twain was simply trying to relate the way people were in medieval times to the typical 19th &quot;centurian.&quot; However, I realize that Twain must have been well studied in Medieval philosphy and life. He illustrates it in a rather humorous yet still educational way and quite frankly...I loved it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book is truly a classic.

Outstanding!!!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This action adventure drama is a Mark Twain tale of a troubled man redirecting his life the fit the sixth century lifestyle. Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"&quot;A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court&quot; is about Hank Morgan, a man who goes back in time to Camelot, and takes over using his knowledge of the future, and science. I did not like this book at all. It had no description, and I could hardly understand it. It had no description at all. At one point, Hank-the main character-complains that no one ever uses any description. Here is a passage from the book. &quot;Sir Gewaine went a-journeying, and fell upon Sir Kay. He smote Sir Kay down, off his horse. He went farthe and fell upon Sir Galahad. Sir Galahad smote Sir Gewaine with his sword. Then Sir Galahad went further down the road and smote down Sir James.&quot; Everyone in the book talked in either Old English, using words like prithee, thoust, and other confusing words, or they talked in 1800's Yokel Tawk.

Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others. Another thing that made it boring was that they used old English. It baffled me when they would say &quot;thou are pithy&quot;.

He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hi everyone!

It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier.

The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me.

He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them.

Almost like a movie script.I remember enjoying it a lot more when I was twelve."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain takes forever to get out what he wants to say, but he was just true to his period's style. He's long winded but tells great stories."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Classic Mark Twain, this is another of his books I have had on my reading list for a long time. It is a great read, quite hysterical and yet poignant too. If you like Twain and have not read this one.......put it on you list."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur. It had a realistic beginning. The part where he &quot;cloaks the sun&quot; to get out of being executed was done nicely also."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I'm only 14 years old, but I finished reading this book for my 8th grade English class about a week ago. The edition I have is 575 pages, but I went through it in about three weeks. It is an excellent, entertaining, very funny and thought-provoking book. I enjoyed it very much. If I had read the Canterbury Tales or some other book relating to the Middle Ages, it may have been pretty boring, but this, my first Mark Twain book and the longest I've ever read, was first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you are unacquainted with Twain's work, this is the ideal starting point. So much of his life was spent by and on the River that it has saturated into many of his greatest works such as Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America. No one has the wit, charm and command of language of Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this wonderful book, Mark Twain blends humor and suspense wonderfully. The main character, Hank Morgan, is knocked over the head with a crowbar and is somehow transported back to the sixth century during King Arthur's reign. Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end. To help create this wonderful work of literature, Twain gives the characters a definite personality to help describe them. The suspense certainly adds to the reader's interest. This is a book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the fictional journal of a man who somehow got transported into the time of King Arthur. It is told from an interesting point of view because in the beginning of the story the man supposedly wanders into the house of the writer and gives the writer this journal of the events of his life in the 500s. The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back. They of course believe him and he comes to be known as the \\"Boss\\" because he is basically the boss of the king. He marries, has children, and then.... The story is captivating and realistic (except, of course, for how he got there), punctuated by witty humor and hilarious circumstances. A must-read classic for everyone!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Wow! What a book. I myself have only read one other book by Mark Twain and that was Tom Sawyer and I really didn't like it. But my compliments to Mr.Twain on this one. This is a book that I had a hard time putting down. The adventure, humor, and excitement came with every turn of the page. The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528). The Boss, as he is later known, saves himself from being executed by predicting a solar eclipse. He is made Arthur's minister and becomes an enemy of Merlin. He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.)

The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse.

A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard.

I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else? The ending is not particularly uplifting, which is too bad...I like my books to end on a happy note. On balance, though, it's pretty good entertainment.'"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Three books in one. 1) Mississippi River history and geography, 2) My life as a riverboater, 3) Return to the steamboats, a miscellany.

I highly recommend it to all fans of Twain."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book--at times disjointed, rambling, self-referential, and irreverent--is decades ahead of its time. It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"When you do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing, you'll read \\"This view is of the Mass Market Paperback edition (1983) from Bantam Classics.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it.

If you are inclined to be romantic about the Arturian period definitly do not read this story.

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Here is my review.You would have to be mentally ill to pay $12.00 for a book you can download for free.This book would have to be capable of doing my taxes for the asking price."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain, like Will Rogers is an American icon.

After he gains the respect of the kink and the people, he becomes known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He goes on several adventures which result in a comical, exiting atmosphere for the book to take place in. I didn't particularly like this book for a couple of reasons. First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't.

The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all. I usually get involved in books, but for this book I was utterly oblivious."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Hank Morgan is hit in the head with a crowbar in the 19th century and wakes up int he Middle Ages.

The book is boring because in the middle of the book fo about 50 pages they are riding on horses to get to this place to save some princesses that have been turned into pigs. Also the book goes on and on about boring sujects, and the few interesting subjects are over in a few pages. This book is too gory, and there is too much killing.

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey. Well before the reader finishes \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" they will know why Mark Twain is often spoken of as the \\"Voice of America itself\\" and considered among the very greatest storytellers in all of History.

It gave interesting ideas and showed the foolishness of the knights in the famed 'Camelot.' I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period.

I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again. Mark Twain is a master story teller. I enjoyed it again,40 years later."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I found this book to be an excellent work.

The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into. Mark Twain shows that in the Yankee, as he gets more involved in the community as the novel goes on. The book starts in an upbeat comical mood. Jokes are being thrown, and people are having fun times. Thenn the mood of the book starts to get darker. The flaws of Camelot and the King start to come out. Twain does a great job using detail in the story, setting, and characters. He must have done some research while writing. The beginning of the book will hook you in to keep reading. I couldn't wait for the next adventure or squabble to pop up."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The main character, Hank Morgan, gets hit on the head in the 19th century and goes back in time to the year 528 in King Arthur's court. Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly. If you like fantasy and/or myths, you will definitely love A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is a mature, insightful book. Twain maintains his reputation as a master storyteller with this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A very amusing, political satire. Many interesting points were brought up and even when Twain addressed serious issues of class and self and society, his humor shined thru. It is nineteenth century technological reliances meeting sixth century codes of chivalry. Of course it is all very anachronistic, but instead of hurting the work it helps Twain prove his points. I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I hear the word boring used quite often these days. We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used the overused word."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain's satiric fantasy &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot; sets up the premise of a 19th Century American being transported (via the application of a crowbar to his skull) to the legendary Camelot, where he initially suffers culture shock in the extreme. The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010. It did not disappoint. There was all of Twain's wit, great storytelling, and wonderful descriptions of the River that served as a wonderful campanion for our family's trip."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although it seemed a bit strange to me that Mark Twain detoured away from his usual straight works of fiction to something that is obviously based on fantasy, I am from Connecticut, so I embraced this novel with open arms. What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I've seen all of the one-star reviews of this book and they all seemed to be done by fourteen year olds with no imagination, and no understanding that bad grammar is to be left at AIM. Well, I am twelve, and I thought this book was wonderful. This was my first truly \\"grown up\\" book I've read, mostly sticking to my age level before, but I really liked it. If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it makes the book doubly interesting, because you can see how a person from the 1800's parodied medieval times versus a person from the 1960's. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because sometimes Twain did go on a little too long with the details.I really think you should read this book if you haven't had your mind melted by video games and graphic novels. (nothing wrong with those of course, but there is too much of a good thing...)"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I would probably scream and faint.Regardless, one makes do with what one has readily available.I found the story thought provoking on many levels. In particular, my first thought upon opening the book was as noted above. I fancied myself the sovereign of knowledge, a throne which holds much promise and much responsibility as Twain demonstrates throughout the book. This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause. Gradually with education, toil, leadership and a bit of luck he finds himself at the helm of new political and economic system buttressed by a technological revolution.A lesson here perhaps for our \\"modern\\" leaders?A great bedtime story for your children as well as a disguised critique on monarchy and theocracy."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I've been reading a lot of classic literature recently, and I also recently saw the Mississippi River for the first time...so this book seemed liked the perfect one for me to read right now.This is a \\"non-fictional\\" book by Mark Twain. (I guess that means based on some truth but embelished in various ways?) In it he recalls the years he spent during his youth as a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River. Then he suddenly jumps forward many years in the book to when he is an older man. As an older man, he decides to go back and travel on the Mississippi River again. He finds the river much changed. The course of time (the Civil War has come and gone, the expansion of the railroad, and the forces of nature) have greatly changed life on the river. The once thriving steamboat trade has almost disapeared.Besides his personal recollections, he also includes other interesting stories,history,folklore, talltales, and such. It is written in typical Mark Twain style - his dry sense of humor will bring a smile to your face. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book was at first a huge disappointment. I went into to it expecting a humorous, light-hearted Mark Twain book. However, this was far from what I got. The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought. The Yankee observed some very dark and distrubing facts about people. The book was not the most entertaining book, but the insight to humanity makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"A classic read, a man from the modern age is displaced in time winding up in Camelot.Mark Twain makes plenty of fun of chivalry and middle-age wizardry.The book first appeared in 1889, but it's an entertaining read today. The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility. He also points out how the tyranny of England in Arthur's time continued on 1300 years later. The book will make you laugh and will also make you examine the myths that people take as fact today"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Every time I look at a river, I think of Mark Twain and his adventures on the Mississippi. His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title. Great book.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Life on the Mississippi","review":"With so many versions of this novel to choose from, it's tough to pick the right one off the shelf.

The question this book seeks to address is what should be done with sites where hundreds of thousands of people were mutilated and murdered, abused and disposed of? Marcuse traces the history of Davhaufrom the beginning of the twentieth century through its time as the Nazis' 'flagship' concentration camp, to its current state as museum and memorial site. At pains to keep this history within the broader confines of German history, he goes to great lengths to make clear the relationship between historical events, individual memory and political culture. As he painstakingly documents the difference in post-war treatment of Nazi perpetrators and the survivors of the camp, it is clear that the questions of morality which first fuelled his interest (in West Germany's relationship with its Nazi past) have yet to be fully answered to his personal satisfaction. The early post-war 'we didn't know' became 'we don't want to know' and a collective amnesia materialised allowing the camp to be erased both physically and psychically. Apartments and stores were built, most notoriously a restaurant called AT THE CREMATORIUM, before being razed to the ground in preparation for a permanent memorial. In the meantime, there was plenty of bickering over who would manage the site and, by the way, have those pesky Bavarian survivors been repatriated yet?! The underlying dynamic of German memory regarding responsibility - read of the debates, the 1968 rebellion,the first Holocaust docu-drama in the 70s, Bitburg in the 80s and the memorial controversies of the 90s - is meticulously laid bare. It is not remotely enjoyable reading (this weighty, hefty tome) but it is necessary. Fortunatelu it's accessible history and historiography. The notes seem inexhaustible but are concise and user friendly, as is the index. Some of the post-war posters and postcards are bleakly amusing, others are graphic and unflinching in their apportionment of responsibility and all are compelling. I believe this is the first lomg-term aassessment of Dachau and the ways it has been made to serve the present. Perhaps a long time coming but certainly worth the wait."},{"Title":"Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001","review":"Focusing on the response of the German people to the atrocities of Nazi war crimes, Marcuse uses Dachau as a case study to show how memory, myth and memorial have changed in Germany over time. Marcuse briefly looks at life in Dachau and the Dachau concentration camp from the camp's beginning in 1933 through the end of the war in 1945. Then the bulk of the book deals with changes in the physical sight itself as well as changes in attitude from various political, civil and religious groups. The conclusions revolve around our natural tendencies to present ourselves in the best light possible. Looking through the lens of time, it is hard to believe that Germans would allow this type of inhumanity to exist, but the message is clear that any society can fall prey to faulty thinking if the circumstances are right. Marcus, an American Jew, often looses his objectivity, playing down the danger and economic turmoil Germans faced before and during the Nazi regime. His view of justice is described as \\"True moral acceptance would entail a clear recognition of restitution and compensation obligations, without regard to financial consequences\\", and a list of positive, appropriate actions from some Germans gets only a brief mention in the last 40 pages of the text. If you can weed out the bias, this well documented study will give you great insight into the aftermath of this most terrible time of history."},{"Title":"Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001","review":"Auschwitz, Belsen, Dachau. Generations later, these names still evoke the horrors of Nazi Germany around the world. What should be done with the sites where hundreds of thousands of people were murdered and cremated? Punish Nazis? Tear down the buildings and plant trees? Build stores and apartments? Educate teenagers? All of these things happened at former concentration camps after 1945. Historian Harold Marcuse takes one of these sites, Dachau, and traces its history from the beginning of the twentieth century, through its twelve years as Nazi Germany's premier concentration camp, to the camp's postwar use as a prison, residential neighborhood, and, finally, museum and memorial site.From the outset, the Dachau concentration camp occupied an especially prominent place in the Nazi concentration camp system. It was the first camp to be set up in 1933, and it was the first to be under the direct supervision of Heinrich Himmler, who later controlled the entire concentration and extermination camp network. The Dachau system became a model for all other Nazi concentration camps. It also served as a \\"school of violence\\" for concentration camp leaders including Adolf Eichmann, the bureacrat who masterminded the industrially organized extermination of the Jews, and Rudolf H&ouml;ss, the infamous commandant of Auschwitz. Dachau was also the camp where the Nazi's regime most prominent prisoners, including chancellors and cabinet ministers from occupied countries, as well as high-ranking religious leaders, were incarcerated. Dachau served as a concentration camp until it was liberated by American troops on April 29, 1945. Since that time, more than 21 million people have visited the site, 19 million of them, 90 percent, since the camp was designated as a memorial in 1965. Few of them know how the site was used in the twenty years before it was turned into a memorial, nor are they aware of the many choices that were made in the creation and modification of the present memorial site. How did the Dachau memorial come to be? What lessons does it teach us? How are the site's messages received by visitors, and what short and long-term effects does a visit have upon them? Marcuse attempts to provide answers to those questions.The book is divided into four parts. The first recounts the history of Dachau from its beginnings as a market town and dynastic residence centuries ago through its repressive and genocidal phase, from 1933 to 1945. Three phases of the camp's history after 1945 are examined in the following three parts. Part II focuses on the decade from 1945 to 1955. It begins with a portrayal of three primary responses to the crimes symbolized by Dachau: the myth that the German people had been victimized by the Nazis, the myth that most Germans had been ignorant of the crimes their neighbors, friends, and relatives were committing, and the myth that most Germans had been upright citizens who resisted Nazism as much as possible without taking inordinate risks. From the early 1950s those myths of victimization, ignorance, and resistance were expressed by three inversions of historical fact. Those inversions are the subject of the three chapters in part II, which show the development and effects of the conception that Nazis had been \\"good,\\" the consequences of the feeling that concentration camp survivors had been and still were \\"bad,\\" and the transformation of Dachau and other former concentration camps into \\"clean\\" camps. Because these three historical myths and the resulting mythic inversions played an important role in the establishment of the West German state and the peculiar nature of its politics from the late 1940s until the turn of the millennium, they are referred to as the three founding myths.Part III traces the images of Dachau embraced and propagated by the groups most involved in shaping its postwar history. It focuses on the period from 1955-1970, although it begins with a survey of the first impulses to memorialize the Dachau camp after the war. Subsequent chapters examine how the camp survivors, German Catholics, Jews, and Protestants, worked to represent their own present conception of the meaning of the concentration camp's past. The final chapter of part III introduces a theory of generational cohorts to demonstrate how, at the end of the 1960s, a generation of Germans born between roughly 1937 and 1953 began openly to challenge the veracity of the three founding myths. However, those children of the \\"generation of perpetrators\\" were themselves enmeshed in the distortion of their parents' myths. While they denied their parents' claim of victimization, they saw themselves as victims. While they rejected their elders' profession of ignorance and sought knowledge about the Nazi past, their own understanding remained abstract, intangible, and unconnected to real life. While they scoffed at claims of resistance during the Nazi years, their own resistance against present injustices was at times motivated more by a desire to compensate for past injustices than justified by the consistent application of moral principles.Part IV outlines the process of overcoming, since 1970, the mythically distorted collective images of the Nazi era. It examines how the perpetrator and the first postwar generations' legacies of victim identification, historical ignorance, and overblown resistance have been challenged and even overcome by members of younger age cohorts. Taken together, the three founding myths had served to establish Germans' innocence of Nazi crimes. Overcoming them entailed recognizing guilt and accepting responsibility for those crimes, as well as correcting the inversions that emerged from the three founding myths during the 1950s. At the close of the twentieth century, Nazi-era Germans are once again becoming \\"bad,\\" Hitler's victims are regaining their \\"good\\" standing (additional groups are being compensated for their losses and persecution), and the former concentration camps are losing their \\"cleanliness\\" as recent historiography and renovations seek to recreate long-destroyed or ignored aspects of the past.Finally, the book concludes with an examination of the renovation of Dachau originally slated for completion in 2001. It explores in detail some of the questions of commemoration, pedagogy, and meaning raised in previous chapters. Specifically, it looks at ways in which the founding myths and their legacies have found expression in the current redesign plans, and suggests ways in which uses by a post-millennial generation might be considered, in order to avoid the distortion of past abuses.Marcuse's insightful narrative combines meticulous archival research with an encyclopedic knowledge of the extensive literatures on Germany, the Holocaust, and historical memory. \\"Legacies of Dachau\\" unravels the intriguing relationship between historical events, individual memory, and political culture, enabling it to offer an unifying interpretation of their interaction over the entire sweep of German history from the Nazi era into the twenty-first century."},{"Title":"Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001","review":"In January 2003, the Conference Group for Central European History explained its selection:To stand out among 49 submissions, the award-winning book had to be challenging and ambitious, theoretically informed, solidly researched, wellwritten, and nicely produced. The winner of this year's Hans Rosenberg Book Prize is Legacies of Dachau.- The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001 by Harold Marcuse, published in 2001 by Cambridge University Press. The title suggests only part of the sweep of this well-illustrated book. Marcuse traces the multiple transformations of the camp in Dachau from a concentration camp to a camp for displaced persons to an internment camp for Nazis to a heavily-visited memorial and museum site, but he also includes the adjacent site that housed first an SS garrison, then a US army unit, and then part of the Bavarian state police. These multiple uses, as Marcuse shows, point to the difficulty in fixing the memory of Dachau in both the professional and public understanding of the history of not just this site but also the broader histories of Nazism, the Holocaust, the postwar occupation, and the Federal Republic. The uses and abuses of Dachau illuminate how different age cohorts of postwar Germans selectively remembered and forgot parts of their history and how they created and challenged what Marcuse calls the founding myths of victimization by, ignorance of, and resistance to Nazism. Because these cohorts confronted each other as they evolved, Legacies of Dachau is a story of the intellectual growth of postwar Germany. Just as Dachau Concentration Camp is itself a site for education, reflection, and memorialization, this book will help readers better understand the events that transpired there and the complex, contested ways in which Germans have come to grips with those events."},{"Title":"Legacies of Dachau: The Uses and Abuses of a Concentration Camp, 1933-2001","review":"A well planned and researched history of the constant presence of a killing site.

Dr. Zeiders avoids the typical anti-intelllectual platitudes of the Christian right and the New Age movement. Instead, he presents spiritually reasoned arguements supported by his case studies and his own careful and extensive study of the psychology of forgiveness.Although written primarily for Christian psychotherapists, this is a book that will benefit clinicians from many diffrent practices.This collection of essays marks the debut of a significant Christian thinker. Although Dr. Zeiders dispalys a mastery of psychological theory and psychotherapeutic technique, he is a much deeper thinker- one of those rare writers whose work influences many kinds of thinkers, writers, and poets.In the future, this book will be mined by novelists, philosophers, theologians, criminologists, artists, poets and human beings suffering through the vicissitudes of everyday life for its spiritual insights into the human heart.Dr. Zeiders will inevitably be compared with psychologists like M. Scott Peck, but he has more intellectual heft and literary flair- imagine a psychologist with the literary and spiritual depth of C.S. Lewis or G.K. Chesterton. He offers hope by the simple (though not easy) act of forgiveness for human beings who have sunk to spiritual and psychological dregs.\\"The Clinical Christ\\" is a manifesto for Christian therapists seeking a complex, intellectual, and deeply spiritual framework for transfroming human pain to human hope."},{"Title":"The Clinical Christ, Scientific and Spiritual Reflections on the Transformative Psychology Called Christian Holism","review":"The author deftly synthesises what most in his profession sadly view as competing systems.

Not since reading Thomas Merton have I encountered a Christian author so clear and objective in his thought, tolerant in his views, powerful and poetic in his expression, and so firmly rooted in his faith. Dr. Zeiders' Christian orientation is undeniable, yet he speaks with a voice of reason that transcends religious and scholarly differences. I highly recommend this work to anyone, Christian or no, seeking to unite rationality and spirit in their personal or professional work. Here you'll find inspiring case studies, thought-provoking discourse, and practical counsel."},{"Title":"Complete \\"Beatles\\" Recording Sessions: The Official Story of the Abbey Road Years","review":"For at least 4 years, this book has been out of print (it was originally published in 1988). The Beatles Anthology CD releases probably had something to do with this. Nevertheless, if you're interested in the complete recording sessions, this is the book to read. It begins with their 1st EMI session in June 1962 (back when Pete Best was still the Beatles' drummer, before Ringo Starr replaced him) and ends in 1970 with the remixing of the Let It Be sessions with Phil Spector. The only thing that's dated is the often repeated phrase \\"This remains unreleased to this day\\" in reference to songs \\"Leave My Kitten Alone,\\" \\"Not Guilty\\" (the Beatles' version), \\"One After 909\\" (the 1963 version), \\"12 Bar Original,\\" \\"That Means a Lot,\\" \\"What's the New Mary Jane\\" and \\"How Do You Do It.\\" This book features anecdotes about what went on during the studio sessions (some the Anthology listeners and viewers already know about and more), photographs, interviews and insights by producer George Martin, Norman Smith, engineer Geoff Emerick, session drummer Andy White (who took Ringo's place on the single version of \\"Love Me Do\\") and an insightful interview with Paul McCartney. Yes, Mark Lewishon has done his homework here with research and hours upon hours of listening to the Beatles' session tapes. In a perfect world, many of these still unreleased sessions would be available for listening, legally (of course, there would be some tracks which would leave the listener thinking \\"Ok, now I know why they didn't release this\\"). I'd like to see an updated version of this book (many of Mark's comments concerning the songs and other additional tracks mentioned above will have to be replaced with \\"Until the release of The Beatles Anthology 1 [or 2 or 3], this take/track remained unreleased\\"). He'd have to include a section for the Beatles Anthology CD's and DVD collection (\\"You can hear part of this take on Part 1 [or Part 3 or Part 8] of The Beatles Anthology\\")."},{"Title":"Complete \\"Beatles\\" Recording Sessions: The Official Story of the Abbey Road Years","review":"It's truly rare that a book on The Beatles manages to satisfy such a divergent set of fans as this one does.

This fascinating book, compiled by Lewisohn with the help of intimate observers of the Fab Four's eight years at Abbey Road, takes you on an almost day-by-day, song -by-song account of their recordings. Through the blitzkreig tours of Beatlemania, the op-art trendiness of Carnaby Street, the Summer of Love, the squabbles and the break-up, it's easy to forget that from 1962 to 1970 the Beatles produced their masterpieces in the unassuming townhouse that was (and is) EMI Abbey Road studios. With infinite detail, the author describes everything from the primitive days of \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"With the Beatles\\", to the masterful conjuring of \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", to the final notes of \\"Abbey Road\\" (the group's last album and a fitting tribute to their recording home). The book is full of anecdotes on recording tricks and techniques, photographs and trivia. Best of all is the presence of George Martin, the Beatles' producer; his contributions are forever bound up with the history of Abbey Road.

Makedde is back in Vacouver, BC and a year has passed since the tramautic events in Australia - she is trying to put them behind her, but she continues to have nightmares, and is suffering from insomnia. Being a student of forensic psychology and with plans to work with law enforcement officers with help them with PTSD, among other things, does she seek professional help herself? Nope - she denies she even has a problem to everyone. *rolling eyes* This is pretty much what bugged me about this book - her self-denial of the problem and reluctance to seek assistance for her issues after what happened to her in the previous book. Not only that, but her attitude toward Andy really bothered me - but that is just me. To reduce my rating by a full star because the attitude of the main character bothered me is strange, I know, but it did reduce the enjoyment of the book for me.However, the story is good - a serial killer is stalking the college campus; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police discover shallow graves containing three bodies, all shot through the back of the head. It doesn't seem to be quite execution style - one officer suggests that it almost seems like hunting. The action heats up when Andy arrives with his mentor from Quantico to attend a panel about psychopaths and they are asked to assist.I hope that this series is continued. I think that there is a lot of promise here."},{"Title":"Split","review":"I'll start with the good: the plot was reasonably interesting, and it certainly held my attention at times. Some of the characters were unusual and quirky, which was nice. Throughout most of the book I wanted to keep reading and find out what happened next.However, Split broke down in a lot of ways. The characterization was inconsistent; sometimes I had trouble believing someone was the same person from scene to scene. The internal monologues were overlong and tedious, drawing out the various characters' moping and wallowing until I just wanted to tell them to get over it and move the hell on.There was a distinct lack of chemistry between characters who needed it. I had difficulty believing that Mak and Andy were so irresistibly drawn to each other (not helped by the fact that Andy was a very one-dimensional character), and had almost as much difficulty believing that Mak and her new boyfriend were getting on so well. Side characters came and went with little reason. Mak's lesbian friend appeared partway through the book (after enough time had passed, frankly, that by the time she showed up I was shocked to find out Mak had any friends) and only stayed long enough to serve as the requisite shocking, funny, sex-crazed gay friend.The interminable interior monologues marred the book in other ways as well. For one, they hid the fact that when you strip them away, there really isn't a huge amount of plot to this book and very little mystery either. For another, they derailed the pacing at ever opportunity, even during the climax of the book. Yes, the climax of this thriller/mystery got derailed by interior monologue. That's about the worst thing you can do to a book of this genre; after all, you can commit many other sins, but you'll be forgiven if you have a gripping climax. If not... Well.This isn't a horrid book, certainly not one of the worst I've read, but I don't particularly recommend it either. Nothing about it is particularly interesting or gripping, and parts of it are downright boring--one of the last things you want to hear about a \`thriller.'"},{"Title":"Split","review":"She appears to have gotten her life together, working as a model to pay for her Masters in Forensic Psychology at the University of Vancouver, but Makedde Vanderwall has never gotten over being kidnapped by the Stiletto Slasher in Australia.

There is a second volume which then covers heavier topics (so to speak) such as gravity and quantum field theory. The comments here apply ONLY to the first volume.For the regular-Joe physicist (such as myself) who actually use path integrals in the \\"real world\\", there exists a perpetual inferiority complex about just how much of what we do (and that applies to almost all of mathematical physics) is \\"rigorously justified\\". At the same time, all the humdrum axioms and lemmas and proofs and gobbledygook notation is bearable to this group for maybe..what... two-three minutes, maybe?So, when I first learned that these authors were going to treat this topic with an audience from earth in mind, I was pretty excited.I was also very interested in the fact that they actually devote the first half of the presentation to the application of path-integrals to the topics of random movement which is of interest to (myself and) most applications outside of the academia. The second half of the book is devoted to the applications to non-relativistic quantum mechanics.Having frustratedly given up on a multitude of articles on the topic of mathematical aspects of path integration after the first few paragraphs, I, nonetheless, had the nagging feeling about just how deep can they go and still keep the presentation interesting to a physicist? The larger question is: just who the intended audience is? After all, the snobby \\"rigor\\" types won't even consider a tutorial format as legitimate, and those who just don't care about the rigor of the underlying mathematics, well, just don't care.In addition to those like myself who are anxious to know just enough about the rigor, it turns out, there is a fourth group: those who have sadly never heard about path integrals and want to learn just enough for intelligent conversation. I now believe that this book is (or at least, should be) intended for the latter group. Indeed, the preface itself says (p. ix par.5) \\"The book is intended for those who are familiar with the basic facts from classical and quantum mechanics\\". Alas it does not say exactly what these audience should expect to get out of this presentation. The preface does say (ibid. par.2) \\"This book expounds the fundamentals of path integrals...and their numerous applications in... physics\\". At that early juncture, one would wonder, just how do they intend to deliver on such a ambitious claim in only 320 pages; and it turns out that they don't.I skimmed the first half with excitement, since the treatment of the stochastic movement by path integrals, is never properly collected in any one place that I've seen (with the qualified exception of a small book by Wiegel-1986). The coverage is fairly broad but never deep. Each short section touches on the main ideas and outlines the computation. This is not necessarily a bad thing in order to inexorably cover maximum ground. What I especially liked were all the worked example problems which would serve the basis for some form of deeper understanding. If it weren't for these, methinks, the novice reader would hardly retain any of the material presented in (what is, at best) an outline fashion.The biggest disappointment in the section on stochastic movement was the implicit assumption of movement in dense media (hence the ubiquitous Wiener measure) in _all_ computations. I would have liked to see a mention of the fact that it is NOT always true that the variance of displacement is proportional to the first power of time-interval. This misconception is one that has misled the financial industry for nearly a century. I would have liked to see Feynman's approach to stochastic movement (a la Ch.12 Feynman&Hibbs;) which elegantly shows a case where the variance goes like the cube of time-interval. Even in cases where the variance is linear in time, it only becomes thus, for times much longer than the interval between scatterings. Even in section 1.2.9 where the calculation starts free of the Wiener measure, the authors are anxious to go the large N regime where the path-integral once-again contains the Wiener measure.Back to general observations on the book: I found the presentation felt much like the samples of music tracks for CD's for sale on Amazon: a few bars and just as it is getting enticing, it's off to another topic. That's not so bad per se; what makes it frustrating is that the authors do not say where to get the full version. This, despite the fact that the sections seem like they have been cut and pasted (and often abridged) from other sources. Indeed that jibes with the fact that these pages were once the authors' lecture notes. I too would prepare lecture just that way, but there is a long way from printing lecture notes to writing a book, much less a treatise as claimed in par.2 of the preface. If it is true that the sections were paraphrased or lifted from various sources, why not just give those sources and let the reader pursue the topic further? That alone would have made this book worthwhile as a compilation. For this shortcoming I fault the editor at IOP as much as the authors; It is the editor's responsibility to ensure that a book is more than just a fancy print-out of notes by the typical physics-types who by far don't know clear writing from a brick. But I'm really sorry to say that it gets worse.The business of the missing citations started out as merely annoying. Until I noticed that certain cut-and-pastes are literal lifting of material from one of the sources on the topic I am familiar with. The book by Kleinert contains nearly everything any physicist needs to know about path integrals. It seems that these authors agree, alas, a little too well!!For example start with the _close_ similarity of equations 2.268, 2.269, and 2.270 (p.165) compared to those of 2.153, 2.154, and 2.155 of Kleinert (3rd ed. section 2.3.2. as of Apr-28-06). While the sequence is only \\"nearly\\" identical and the text is paraphrased, the \\"auxiliary frequency\\" trick introduced immediately following these equations (unnumbered on top of p. 166 vs. 2.156 Kleinert Apr-28-06 p.113) is identical even in the text preceding it. Since this trick is not found anywhere else in the literature (that I've seen), it stands to good reason for the authors to cite Kleinert. The near identical sequence of calculations continues through 2.2.74 completing the cloning of the section from Kleinert.There are more examples: pages 168 and 169 of the book seem copied of Kleinert section 2.4 and 2.4.1 on the Gelfand-Yaglom method, without proper citation.Then there is the nearly identical sequence, in the book's section 2.4.1 starting with eqn 2.4.15 compared to Kleinert's section 6.3 eqn 6.51, and the figure 2.3 compared to Kleinert Fig 6.3.Conversely, on pg 269 in the discussion on the Coulomb potential in 3D, the authors choose not to follow Kleinert, and to solve the path-integral using a \\"midpoint prescription\\". But then it begs the question: why not use some other choice: a post-point or pre-point. The best advice would have been to follow Kleinert's (ch.13) non-holonomic mapping technique. But that's just my preference.I imagine that similar \\"issues\\" relative to other published sources (with which I'm not familiar ) may well exit, as I had first surmised any lecture notes would contain. The problem is that proper citations are missing particularly in cases where novel methods or results have been copied or paraphrased, firstly as proper practice of publication, and secondly, for the sake of the reader should s/he wish to pursue the topic in more detail.The second half (as in the first half) proceeds in the same outline-esque, fast pace through major topics. As already alluded, this style's merits depend subjectively on the needs and the tastes of the reader.The first half of the book, being devoted to random movement (Wiener's idea) contains good tutorials on how to move between the path integral approach and the traditional differential-eqn approach to stochastic movement. I can't help but think that the students and applicators of path integral never seem to get quite past the psychological need to show that what they are doing is legit, and really the same as the more traditional differential-eqn approach. The first half of the book serves this particular need well, at least in the cases of the problems typically discussed in standard texts such as the diffusion equation and slightly more complex variations thereof.Let me cut to the chase here. To learn about path-integrals (for a physicist's purposes) one need only to own two books, the original lecture notes by Feynman (as written and edited by Hibbs) and the Kleinert's 3rd edition, as follow-on. Alas, the former is now out of print (a crime if you ask me), but I have been badgering Dover's editors to reprint it. It also contains many errors and typos; you can get a list of the corrections from me by email (write mathematicus at yahu). Kleinert's book is continually being expanded and corrected by him. He's been known to share individual chapters with other physicists in electronic format, look for him in Berlin.Finally, when deciding to write a book on a topic where so many distinguished texts exist, the new author should ask himself what is it that I am going to say, or what new point of view am I going to present that is new or different from the existing body of literature. It seems plain that neither the authors nor the editor asked this question before generating the book in its present form. At the present price I am hard pressed to recommend it."},{"Title":"Path Integrals in Physics: Volume I Stochastic Processes and Quantum Mechanics","review":"This two-volume set on path integration contains a multitude of topics neatly organized in chapters and sections with helpfully descriptive titles (even sometimes paraphrasing the punchline of a given section). A previous reviewer notes that there should be more references, in particular to Kleinert's book and in the section on path integrals for Brownian motion, and while I am not very familiar with Kleinert's book, it is true that some sections of Chaichian/Demichev also bear a little too close a resemblance to Barry Simon's Functional Integration and Quantum Physics. Chaichian/Demichev's main merit is that it collects in one place many topics which can be hard to find outside primary sources, like path integration on a curved background, Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky procedure for path integration of systems with constraints, and the correspondence between operator ordering rules and phase space path integral skeletonizations. The treatment of each topic is indeed compact, but arguments which are merely sketched in the text often appear as exercises with hints, and in the introductory comments which open major sections, several references to other books or to papers are usually given. I agree, though, that the authors should have been more careful to avoid lifting sentences from other sources when they compiled their lecture notes into a text. I gave it 5 stars before noticing this issue. Having noticed, I would subtract a star."},{"Title":"The Federal Reserve System: A History","review":"I initially checked out this book from my local public library because I was reluctant to buy it for $30. After reading the book, I decided that it would be well worth the $30 price just to have it readily available for reference. I am a financial planner trying to put recent historical events into better perspective and have read a number of books and articles on the history of banking. Much of the literature seems to be either too radical or too conservative, and fraught with biased commentary intended to support ultra-liberal or ultra-conservative views ranging from conspiracy theories to institutionalized mediocrity. I found this book to present a very fair and balanced view well supported by reliable facts that speak for themselves. It goes into sufficient depth without becoming burdensome to read. It is also very well organized: by tracing the history of the Federal Reserve, it is so much easier to put current conditions into a very meaningful perspective. In fact, I have created an outline of the book which allows me to more readily identify significant events and trends whose importance becomes more apparent as events unfold before us today in ways that few would have thought possible just a few years ago. I found the early chapters covering the period between the origination of the Federal Reserve in 1913/14 and the stock market crash to be the most revealing -- particularly the metamorphosis of the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort that could respond to fluctuations in market demand for money to a much less market-oriented institution that now attempts to \\"proactively influence the behavior of banks\\" (manipulate markets). This critical period in the history of the Federal Reserve caused me to question policies that I had previously taken for granted, as do most people including many who consider themselves to be very sophisticated financial professionals. It now seems almost absurd that we consider the US economy to be a free-market economy, when market forces now have so little to do with interest rates and the money supply, which are at the heart of so many financial decisions made by all the \\"free market\\" participants further down the food chain. Banking is so obviously one of those industries that Daniel Yergin, in his book \\"The Commanding Heights,\\" would describe as being at the Commanding Heights of an economy in which free markets are allowed to prevail only to the point that true power by centralized decision-makers is not threatened. I thought this was a concept unique to the Soviet Union decades ago when capitalism and communism were still battling for acceptance as the superior economic structure, and that capitalism had long since proven itself to be more viable. But, here we are today witnessing similar \\"Commanding Heights\\" policies being implemented in supposedly free market economies. It is still hard to believe that developments over the past 50 years have been reversed so quickly, renewing debates that can only be understood if they are viewed within the historical context that a book like this provides -- along with \\"Commanding Heights\\" and Friedrich Hayek's book \\"The Road to Serfdom.\\""},{"Title":"The Federal Reserve System: A History","review":"The Federal Reserve banking system was created in 1913 to stabilize banking practices: while it's often in the news today, few Americans actually know the background of its creation and its effects on American lives.

Coming from Washington Heights in New York where he lived wiht his grandparents, to become a power proker of the \\"first Order,\\" he excelled in how to manage money and control economic crises. He was pivotal in America's economic expansion. Now, that he is retiring, the United States of Europe are taking over as the superpower of the wealthy.Author Justin Martin detaials Greenspan's training as an economist. Using the opinions and knowledge of his peers, Henry Kissinger, Milton Friedman and former U. S. Predsident Gerald Ford, who appointed him to the Federal Reserve. He served under five presidents on the Federal Reserve Board and Chairman. In the photo section, he is shown with former presidents Gore, Clinton, Reagan, Nixon, and Bush, Sr.Before that heady position, he excelled in academics and music at George Washington High School; in the '43 yearbook, he was listed as taking part in orchestra, dance band, was class president, and labeled as \\"smart as a whip and talented.\\" He was a musician at Julliard, and played clarinet and saxophone as he toured with Henry Jerome's jazz band and in a trio. Learning the strict precision of playing instruments aided him in making complicated decisions as Chief Justice of this august group.He hobnobbed with the wealthy at the O'Conner parties, including Allen Blumenthal in the mid '50s. Nothing keep him from marrying two beautiful women. Like Prince Charles of England, he had two women in his first marriage, a young beauty and Ann Rand who played a big role in his life. She was his Camilla. An old man never learns, even a smart one -- he married again in 1997 to a 'dead ringer' of his first wife. This time he married up into society.Just as another super hero of an earlier era, Nathan Bedford Forrest, the greatest Civil War General (according to Robert E. Lee), he was the target of cartoonists (not comics!). In one, he is one of the five \\"enduring national monuments\\" in Washington, D.C. In another, the favorite of Justin Martin's aunt (her contribution to the book), he's shown being \\"tempted\\" by dancing naked women whose large proportions had prominent n....s. holding banners for the dot com groups.As a teenager with rolled up jeans, he is talller than his mom, Rose Goldsmith, who held the Bible when he was sworn in as Chairman of Council of Economic Advisers in 1974. He's shown in the Oval office under the portrait of George Washington (what's more appropriate?) with Bush, Sr. and cronies.To end with a riddle: How many bankers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

Richard Hall now fills this lacuna with his excellent account of the &quot;Colony of Maryland in Africa,&quot; later the &quot;State of Maryland in Africa,&quot; which was the home some of the oldest educational institutions in the West African nation and which held a disportionate influence on its subsequent development.

They are shocked when they unearth a dead body-that of Ansel's colleague, Nick Capos. Ansel tries to do damage control for the Society. A $300,000 memorial gift is just about to be transferred to the Society for the construction of the Preston Opel Paleohistory Center in a dual partnership with the Montana Musuems Association and now the MMA is making noise about the bad publicity resulting from Nick's murder. The Society's constantly bickering membership does not help Ansel's quest. And the publicity gets worse when another Society member is murdered in the same fashion as Nick. In the meanwhile, Ansel gets permission from Nick's widow to appraise his fossil collection. But the fossil collection is missing from his apartment. Even more puzzling, Nick had developed a sudden interest in Baltic amber and had been working on a secret after-hours project at the Roosevelt Museum. Attacked in her own home by a masked man who insists she knows more than she actually does, Ansel starts looking for answers without the blessing of Lieutenant Reid Dorbandt, assigned to the murder cases. Mesozoic Murder is essentially a decent mystery with a mediocre ending. The murderer's motives seems weak and the murderer isn't hard to guess by process of elimination. Ansel makes an interesting protagonist but her constant charge of bigotry to everyone and sundry may get tiresome & it makes her sound like an ornery child that needs to grow up.

Dramatic works. 1873. p. 345-428)","review":"I look unfavorably upon books and screenplays rushed to the market to capitalize on recent sensational jury trials, confessions of serial murderers, and distasteful behavior by politicians and other celebrities. I would consider it unlikely that I would appreciate a play rapidly assembled by three playwrights on the recent execution of a notorious old woman condemned for practicing witchcraft. Surprisingly, I did enjoy such a play.Admittedly, a few centuries have elapsed since Thomas Dekker and John Ford and William Rowley collaborated on The Witch of Edmonton. The Mother Sawyer subplot is apparently faithful to the actual event; Sawyer was hanged on April 19, 1621. Within days the chaplain of Newgate Gaol published a pamphlet titled The Wonderful Discoverie of Elizabeth Sawyer a Witch, late of Edmonton, her Conviction and Condemnation and Death. This document served as the primary source for Dekker, Ford, and Rowley. The first known performance was December 29, 1621 at the Court of King James, but earlier public performances are likely to have occurred.Many books, plays, (and now screenplays) on topical events are quickly forgotten. Fortunately, after several centuries of neglect, The Witch of Edmonton was republished in the late 1800s, most importantly in the influential Mermaid Series. More recently several major production companies, including the Royal Shakespeare Company, have staged The Witch of Edmonton.The short prologue to this play ends with the sentence: 'Here is mirth and matter.' However, most readers will agree that The Witch of Edmonton has only a few elements of comedy and that matter clearly overwhelms mirth.The plot involves two intertwined themes, both stories of betrayal and deceit and misplaced loyalty: 1) To gain a dowry, the young Frank Thorney deceives all that trust him, commits bigamy, and even murder. 'Tis done, and I am in. Once past our height, we scorn the deepest abyss' 2) Living in isolation, feared and abused by her neighbors, Mother Sawyer pleads for help. 'Would some power, good or bad, instruct me which way I might be revenged.' The devil in the guise of a dog obliges Mother Sawyer in return for her soul.The Witch of Edmonton is interesting, entertaining drama. The characters do not have the psychological depth found in Shakespeare's tragedies, but this play warrants reading by anyone that enjoys Elizabethan and Jacobean drama.I highly recommend the Methuen Student Edition. The extensive commentary, plot analysis, and character reviews are excellent."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Political Economy","review":"Nowadays, a vast amount of complex information is offered to us. With the advent of the Internet and other forms of immediate communications so much information and perspectives are available. Unfortunately, new forms of knowledge replace old forms quite rapidly, and it's getting harder to find out which particular theory or idea is \\"truth\\" and which isn't. Therefore, as knowledge complexity and knowledge obsolescence rises, it's becoming increasingly difficult for human beings to understand the world we live in and solve the concoction of problems we face. But, there are bits of knowledge out there that seldom go out of date and stand the test of time; and it's sitting right here on my bookshelf, the Encyclopedia of Political Economy. To me, the Encyclopedia of Political Economy (EPE for short) is the best source of reference for political economy to date. It has been an invaluable authoritative reference source in my later undergraduate and postgraduate college studies of political economy. The EPE is an important landmark in scholarly development in political economy. My preference is the paperback edition as it is easy to flip through and has an attractive colorful front cover!The EPE is an easy to use 2 volume set which is suitable as an introduction for concerned students and activists whom are interested in the social and political effects of economic policy. You should find the entries uncomplicated to understand, and after reading several of them you'll get use to the consistent format and feel that each one has. Any political economic issue you want to gain knowledge on is readily accessible. Various links on closely associated topics and further suggested readings are provided for all entries. For instance, throughout the text in the entry \\"environmental and ecological political economy: major contemporary themes\\", there are virtual hyperlinks to other areas of special interest: e.g. entropy; sustainable development; natural capital; or Ecological Economics. Plus, at the end of each section, related topics are provided to further direct the reader onto related areas of interest. For example, under the \\"gross domestic product and net social welfare\\" entry, some of the related topics such as \\"household production and national income\\" and \\"quality of life\\" have their own entry in the EPE. With over 450 essays on most aspects of political economy written by experts in the field, you would be sure to find what you are looking for.In summary, we are faced with a large amount of choice in the information we accept as true. In the process we are forced to limit our choices of knowledge and select only the most relevant to what we value and believe. One of those things I value is a greater social welfare for all living creatures; the EPE contributors embrace this too. I personally give the EPE 5-stars. But you don't have to take my good word for it; here are some extracts from several reviews of the EPE, including one from the very prestigious Economic Journal.* Journal of Economic Issues (vol 37, no 4, December 2003, pp. 1186-1188): \\"The publication of this encyclopedia underscores the extent to which political economy has come of age. ... This encyclopedia compares very favorably to the New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics (1987). ... When compared with The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics ..., this encyclopedia has more depth and a greater appreciation of the range of topics relevant to economics. ... This is an excellent reference source, well suited for the non-specialist seeking to understand political economy. It should be available in all university libraries and departments of economics or political economy\\" (Mayo Toruno, California State University - San Bernadino).* Economic Journal (vol 110, no 467, November 2000, pp. F765-766): \\"These [issues] collectively constitute the life-blood of contemporary economic concerns and it is extremely useful to find within a single book a discussion of the major points that define these issues. ... [W]here the Encyclopedia of Political Economy comes into its own is in an institutionally richer treatment of topics ... To the growing number of persons who are interested in the broader context of economics, these volumes are to be highly recommended\\" (p. F767, vol 110, no 467, Nov 2000).* Journal of Australian Political Economy, (no 43, 2000, pp. 148-149): \\"This handsome two-volume encyclopedia is an impressive stocktaking of the main concerns of political economy ... Certainly, the publication of this encyclopedia is a major landmark in the long march to develop an influential alternative to orthodox neoclassical economics\\" (no 43, 2000).* History of Economics Review (no 37, Winter 2003, pp. 159-162): \\"It is a tribute to [O'Hara's] energy that the work was initially planned and organised by him ... There are indeed a number of useful and interesting articles. ... [T]his is a useful collection which will feature on the reading lists of many political economy courses and, hopefully as well, on the shelves of many research libraries in universities around the world\\" (Peter Groenewegan, University of Sydney, Australia).* New Political Economy (vol 7, no 2, 2002, pp. 299-307 \\"Review Article\\"): \\"[This] encyclopedia tells an interesting story about [its] purported discipline's past, its current status and, more ambitiously, its future trajectory. ... The result is a well-demarcated intellectual legacy for political economy to draw upon in its efforts to reclaim a disciplinary mantle. ... [T]ese volumes provide ... the A-Z of our discipline, nicely condensed and sitting right there on our shelf. This is quite an achievement\\" (Randall D. Germain, University of Wales, UK)* The European Journal of the History of Economic Thought (vol 7, no 3, 2000): \\"The Encyclopedia ... is ...a forum for innovative work. [M]ost of the essays ... seem to be thoughtfully and richly informed. [P]articularly the entries on money, credit and finance are worth reading. There are undoubtedly important points being made in these essays. Even the specialist in monetary theory will benefit from reading various portions\\" (Thomas Huth, Fachhochschulke Luneburg, Germany).* Eastern Economic Journal (vol 29, no 4, Fall 2003, pp. 629-630): \\"All entries are organised in the same way. There is thus much formal unity and ... impressive editorial work has been done to this end. The entries are well written. ... I find this encyclopedia definitely original and interesting. It is also stimulating\\" (Michel De Vroey, Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium)."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Political Economy","review":"This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0&lt;=w&lt;=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if\\"We simply do not know!\\"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach."},{"Title":"Worship as Meaning: A Liturgical Theology for Late Modernity (Cambridge Studies in Christian Doctrine)","review":"Graham Hughes has written a marvellous book on the signing of worship. He utilizes modern semiotic theory and makes it accessible to the non-technical reader. He then synthesises this largely continental contribution with the work of Charles Sanders Peirce in order to deleop a structure of meaning through the signs of the action of worship. He writes with limpid clarity even though his language is often highly technical. He has a nicely self-deprecating style that allows him to develop his own argument strongly while giving his readers space to make their own responses. This is important because he has sharply pertinent things to say about the current religious scene. Hughes has just retired after twenty years of distinguished teaching in Australia in biblical studies, hermeneutics and litiurics. He is himself a fine liturgist who celebrates with grace and sensitivity. This is evident in his writing. He is concerned that the God we worship is the mysterious Other who is approached in the signs we use in worship. Hughes has written a valuable and exciting book that contributes richly to our understanding of worship."},{"Title":"Emotional Branding : How Successful Brands Gain the Irrational Edge","review":"Travis explains how \\"how successful brands gain the irrational edge.\\" His material is carefully organized within nine Parts, with the last providing a \\"Summary\\" of his key ideas and final thoughts.Feelings, Brands...and ProfitsWhat Brands Are and Why They MatterBrand Building: FoundationsBuilding Brands with MeaningBrand Building in the Digital EraBrand Building: Key ElementsManaging Your BrandBranding Beyond the ObviousMy own opinion is that his excellent discussion of \\"Key Elements\\" should have been placed earlier in the book. In this chapter, he focuses on the power of the name, logos and other elements of style, advertising (\\"Telling the Brand story to Customers\\"), telling the brand story to other stakeholders, and integrated marketing (\\"There's No Better Time to Meet the Future than Now\\"). Throughout the book, Travis provides numerous insights which I found thought-provoking. For example:* \\"A brand is more than a symbol. A brand, hopefully your brand, behaves like a guarantee.\\"* \\"Being a great listener who can hear between the lines is the secret to finding the great little sweet spots in customer wants and needs.\\"* \\"Businesses that fail to engage the eyes, ears, minds, and emotions of every individual will find themselves overrun by obsolescence or crushed by competition.\\"NOTE: I highly recommend three other books which provide invaluable insights directly relevant to the previous comment. They are Schmitt's Experiential Marketing, Pine &amp; Gilmore's The Experience Economy, and Wolf's The Entertainment Economy.* \\"A brand that wants to be a little of everything will eventually amount to a lot of nothing.\\"* \\"The fact is that as a leader, you don't have to have all the answers.

For whether we want to or not, we carry our own brand, good or bad.The book is witty, sagacious and some times irreverent in the spirit of that rou&eacute; Harry. Fun to read yet thought provoking.We learn that it is what we evoke, not what we promote that brands us. Learn how you can improve your brand, it is bound to pay-off.Louis H. Lafontaine, Eng. Independent Business Owner"},{"Title":"Emotional Branding : How Successful Brands Gain the Irrational Edge","review":"For today's manager, there seems to be no end to the learning curve in the new economy. We immerse ourselves in CRM, we model our companies and our web sites on being customer-led, we embrace the market segment of one and we look for ways in which to reach new prospects through interactive dialogue.The customer is at the centre of every corporate universe. Relationships take on new meaning when the customer can talk back. We understand the idea of share-of-customer replacing share-of-market. But we are left with a feeling that there needs to be a glue somehow that can cement all these new wisdoms into a logical and totally comprehensible whole. &quot;Emotional Branding&quot; brings a refreshing and yet totally down to earth perspective to this world of new business.Written in a narrative and light-hearted style, the book is full of anecdotes and illustrations from real life that emphasize the importance of branding in today's world.But by far the greatest significance of this book is how it demonstrates the human side of branding as a competitive tool. It reveals that the real significance of web-enabled dialogue with our customers is that we can now start to understand and respond to them on an emotional (right brain) basis rather on a purely logical (or left brain) platform that characterized the old world of one-way communications.The book's basic premise is that it is no good having a product or service unless your customers can relate to it. By describing the processes of how a brand is born, nurtured, communicated and fulfills its promise, \\"Emotional Branding\\" leads us on a voyage of delightfully written discovery into the hearts as well as the minds of our customers. The book makes its point that customers need to feel something, not just about a name but about the company behind it. These feelings are real and important. They are the key to what really motivates customer choice and customer loyalty.The book quotes freely from a broad cross section of the most erudite business authors in the technologies, marketing and branding fields. A character in the book called Harry provides personality profiles of experience from the real world in an engaging way that makes you want to meet this man of insights. The author's own experience with major corporations and organizations ensures that this is a practical guide rather than an academic treatise.It is tempting to fill a review of \\"Emotional Branding\\" with quote after quote to illustrate the practical perspective this book brings to an often confusing and contradictory subject. Let me use just one:\\"Building a brand in the mass-marketing age was about building an image. Building a brand in the mass-customization age is about building a reputation\\".A reputation starts deep within a company and real customer focus becomes all about creating a reputation that starts from within. A reputation is as much about feeling as fact. Learning how to turn simple truths like this into supreme competitive advantage is where the real return on investment in the new economy will be realized.\\"Emotional Branding\\" is a \`must read'. It covers all we need to know about designing, building and nurturing a brand for continued relevance. The internet has made companies transparent and has given the consumer the power of a very loud voice. \\"Emotional Branding\\" describes in human and practical terms how to harness that power and make it your ally."},{"Title":"Emotional Branding : How Successful Brands Gain the Irrational Edge","review":"In my business as a veterinarian, emotions strongly influence the behavior of my clients but this often seems overlooked in business literature. Emotional Branding is the first management book I've seen which tackles this critical issue to any business today... how your customers FEEL about your business.This book helped me see how everything my clinic says and does influences by brand promise. I've shared the book with my staff and it has sparked us to make many simple changes to enhance our brand (and to stop doing some of the little things that were not true to our brand promise). We've already seen great results.If you are looking for another typical college 101 academic text filled with positioning maps, SWOT diagrams and simplistic charts-then this book is NOT for you.

Many of them offer quantifiable analysis which although helpful, still leaves a void.It might be tempting to dismiss Emotional Branding as much fluff but a closer look would reveal considerable substance.Written in a light hearted prose it delivers the central question: How does it make you feel? This at once causes the reader to ponder the effect of all of our suppositions and disarm many of them.This part of the equation needs to be addressed more extensively by Internet marketers.If brand building on the Internet is truly about creating lasting,long-term relationships, then appealing to the emotional side is essential for our messages to be heard in the transparent world of cyberspace."},{"Title":"Emotional Branding : How Successful Brands Gain the Irrational Edge","review":"Emotional Branding is many things, but it's not everything. It's not boring. It's not without insight. It's not heavy (weight-wise, that is). It doesn't even give you the impression that you're trudging through another business book. It's definitely not disappointing.Daryl Travis spins his anecdotes about successful - and not so successful - brands and his encounters with Harry into a web of inspiring lessons that teaches you how to win and keep customers. He shows you how brand promises can soar as high as a hot-air balloon, or sit idle on the tarmac like a broke-down plane. If you're a marketing professional, picking up and sharing any number of Travis's examples with your clients will strengthen your pitch and make you look smart. And if looking smart and being successful are important to you, you really ought to read Emotional Branding.Emotional Branding is exciting. It's insightful. It's practical. It's deep in a fun way.

She has alot of character and looks at the world the same way an intelligent 16 year old does (trust me I know this since I too am 16). She reminded me of myself in a way.

The story'snarration from a 16 year old girl named Sib, helps to capture first hand experience of a mission to find truthin a life that broke very early on while sharing it with her father. Sarcasm, music and adventure mix tocreate an experience and story for any daddy's girl. Recommended age 16 and up due to mature themes andunderstanding.This is not a very difficult read. The story does, however, require a good understanding of personality inorder to pick up on the true essence of Sib and her sarcastic nature. Brooks' writing is very comical andinteresting, making sure for there to be an entertaining story or reference every chance possible. Throughoutthe story, the reader gets an inside look into a music prodigy's life and her family life. The first 50 pages tellof Sib's life as a teenager and the trials and tribulations that she's beginning to realize, only wanting to addone more in meeting her mother. After page 50, the trip to San Francisco begins. Taxi, Sib's father, beginsto slowly discuss her mother and the life that she lead previously. Continuing to use a first person point ofview, Brooks develops the story using imagery and reflection on a life that Sib never knew. With thedevelopment of character throughout the story, the reader begins to be able to understand the situation andSib. At the beginning of the story, Sib is very laid back and focused on her musical ambitions. Toward theend of the novel music is still a main concentration, yet family and the interest within begin to eat away andcreep into Sib's curiosities. Taxi, in an interesting parallel, is very easy going and easy to talk to, reflectedin Sib and the way that her attitude is. The road trip discussions and ease of conversation between the twocharacters rolls throughout the trip, showing signs of connection through music and family bonds. Thisdialogue between the characters gives a more emotional element to the story.

In an alternate universe, the English Plymouth colony failed and the Dutch dominated Columbia. Austro-Hungary has conquered most of Europe and the French exiles under DeGaulle rule in Mexico. In this timeline, ghosts are much more visible, powerful, and responsive to technical devices.Doktor Johan Eschbach is a former Subminister for Environment in the Natural Resources Ministry of the Columbian government. Prior to his term as a high level government official, Johan had been a flying officer in the Republic Air Corps and then an agent in the Spazi, the Sedition Prevention and Security Service. When Speaker Hartpence's Reformed Tories party won the election, they cleaned house in the Natural Resources Ministry and Johan retired to his family's old summer home in Vanderbraak Centre, accepting a position in the Natural Resources Department of the local college, Vanderbraak State University.In this novel, Johan has a close relationship to Doktor Llysette duBoise, a concert quality soprano who also teaches at the college and who is a refugee from the conquest of France. Llysette has a concert one evening and Johan drives her to the music center to prepare for the performance, then goes to his office. Later, as he locks up to leave for the concert, Johan feels a drop in temperature. Then he hears someone sobbing and shortly thereafter he sees the ghost of Miranda Miller, a piano instructor in the Music department. Apparent Miranda has just been murdered. He starts to report the incident to Campus Security, but realizes that such a report would position him as a prime suspect. Instead, he walks to the Music department to attend Llysette's concert.During the next few days, Johan discovers that the Spazi are interested in Miranda's murder, indicating that the homicide has more that local interest. Moreover, he starts to receive newspaper clippings from an anonymous source, which he knows must be associated with the Spazi. It would seem that he is being maneuvered into investigating the case.This novel presents some interesting notions about the creation and persistence of ghosts and the technical manipulation of such spirits. Moreover, it speculates about the relationship of the mind to the brain and the consequences of separating them.As is usual with Modesitt, the plot moves rather slowly as the reader views and reviews the life of the protagonist and the characteristics of his society. If the reader can tolerate the slow pace, however, the story will unfold before your eyes as if you were living it. Maybe Modesitt is an acquired taste, but so is Faulkner, and I find there is much that is common between the two. Faulkner, however, never had to create a whole timeline.Highly recommended for Modesitt fans and anyone else who enjoys tales filled with philosophical notions, technical speculations and international intrigue.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"I've always been a complete fan of Modesitt's SciFi works, so I decided to pick up this book. Boy, was I ever pleased. Not only does the author manage to weave a completely believable alternate history in which the North American political landscape is totally differnt (though historiclaly plausible) from today, but he manages to insert the idea of ghosts into the stiory - in a highly believable manner.Within this complex reality Modesitt tells a great tale of political intrigue.

This world is slower-pacedthan ours, and Modesitt's prose has something of the heavy Dutchfeel of well-fed burghers, shining-clean windows, tidy lives. Veryhuman. If slow bothers you -- skim.Modesitt still hasn't smoothed out his jarring expositionof the differences between his alternate world and ours, hereusually dumped as interior monologues. Show, don't tell, please!Llysette sings at a Presidential Arts Awards dinner and isinvited to perform at the prestigious Salt Palace in Deseret --after fleeing the fall of France and an Austrian political prison.Johan comes to the uncomfortable conclusion that he's about to beeclipsed in fame and fortune by his glamorous wife........but maybe Deseret is after more than just a performance by thenew prima diva. And what about Austria-Hungary? And NewFrance? And the shadowy \\"Revealed Twelve\\"?Minister Eschbach resolves the ensuing international crisis withverve, skill, and a couple of twists that would be unfair to reveal.Suffice it to say that the ending is most satisfactory, and leavesplenty of room for future Eschbach/Du Boise adventures.Both books are reasonably self-contained, but if you read one andlike it, you'll want to read the other, so it makes sense to start with #1.Doktor Eschbach and the \\"Ghosts\\" books have parallels to MrModesitt's real life: the author was a naval aviator, spent twentyyears in our \\"Federal District\\" as a political aide, EPA staffer, andcollege teacher. He's married to a lyric soprano (sorceress?, whoteaches at Southern Utah University). He and his family movedfrom DC to New Hampshire (\\"New Bruges\\") and then to Utah:these are the settings for the \\"Ghosts\\" books. \\"Write what youknow,\\" the old adage goes -- it certainly works for Modesitt.

Parker's Spenser and John Le Carre's Smiley books. Everything in this alternate world seems to move a little more deliberately, and its inhabitants don't really know any more than the reader does. This lack of awareness is a little off-putting, but once the characters are firmly established, the story itself is excellent.Quite a change of pace from Modessit's other works. My advantage was that I came to this book having read the sequel first. The sequel is more of an adventure story in the Doyle/Buchan mode, and quite enjoyable. This book is altogether darker and moodier. Worth the effort."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"This book is set in an alternate present. Ghosts are real, the computers are like something out of the movie &quot;Brazil&quot;, and politically, well, all the major powers are portrayed as a bunch of nazis.

The politics, the economics, the architectural details, the *cooking* -- they all have a hyper-real garishness to them that I find very appealing. It's similar to the author's cultural development in his novel &quot;The Parafaith War&quot;: bold, colorful literary brushwork, although probably offensive to some. The description of the trucker's meal reminds me *so* much of a, ah, dining experience I once had in North Carolina...

I look forward to it."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost Trilogy)The, three so far,\\"Ghost\\" books by L. E. Modesitt Jr. were an early introduction to the \\"Steam\\" genre. They present a well thought out alternate world, one in which the population must deal with and live with the repercussions of deaths by violence and war. Ghosts are real and persistent, reliving their deaths, making it difficult for those that are alive to ignore them. Some are seen by the political community as merely a nuisance, like the Buddhist protestors, that daily engage in self immolation, keeping their faiths burning passions indelibly etched in the minds of those that see it. Some are lonely and neglected and fade away.Battles, especially those on land, tend to create many more inconvenient ghosts. After all, who would want to live in a house or town or anywhere that was infested by one or more ghosts whose very essence permeates the fabric of reality, sending waves of pain and suffering. It could really upset the daily routines.Now imagine whole blocks, cities, countries devastated by War and its Weapons of MASS Destruction. Such technologies as our Nuclear bombs would be unthinkable. Not only could the victor not occupy the area due to Nuclear Radiation, no one could stay in their right minds and fast the Ghostly Radiation. Ghosts are not mere superstition but have a literal physical reality. In a world where your crimes can haunt you, and the ghosts of your crimes are visible to others.The main character is Dr. Johan Eschbach, a one time spy in the employ of the Dutch run Columbia, now a small northeastern provincial professor tries to teach his students to see beyond the veil of the printed facts, to think and respond, to look for the reasons and the consequences of actions, not to merely read and regurgitate.There is much to admire and like about this world. Much as Eschbach encourages his students, I too encourage you to go beyond the veil of this review and view his world with your own eyes."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The premise (ghosts staying around) and the consequences of that were very interesting. The action was understated, almost matter of fact, which I liked.Weird pricing on the Kindle edition - normally a publisher will set the first book in a set lower to get people to try out the series then keep the others higher/normal. They appear to have done the opposite here (10 for 1st book and 7 for 2nd/3rd books as I am writing this) for some reason. Of course you can get both the first and second books combined inGhosts of Columbiafor the same price as just the first one too, so who knows what they are thinking."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"Just a technical note about the kindle version.It has a nice readable bold font. It is different from the normal kindle text.However, one artifact of the new font is that small blemishes and ink spots are also rendered."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"In a steampunk-esque alternate history where ghosts are a fact of everyday life and the Dutch rather than the British took control of the American colonies, Johan Eschbach is drawn away from his position as college professor in a sleepy little town when a colleague is mysteriously murdered, setting off a series of events that has Eschbach using all his skills from his former job as a governmental intelligence agent to avoid the many, many people who suddenly think he'd be a lot more useful dead.That summary makes the book sound straightforward, but honestly, it took until about halfway through the book until I pieced the basic premise together. The narrative just dumps you down into the middle of the universe and doesn't bother to explain the basics; the ghost part is fairly obvious, but it took me entirely too long to get any sort of coherent picture of the political and cultural structure of the world. Given that this is something of a political espionage thriller, that's a bit of a problem. The pacing and narration are also a problem for a thriller; Eschbach spends vast portions of the book going on about grading papers, going on dates with his lover, and describing nearly every meal he eats. Modesitt is also entirely too enamoured of Eschbach; nearly everyone the man encounters tells him that he is a beacon of honesty in a corrupt world and how sorry they are about his Tragic Past. He also makes Eschbach far too smart; the character is always two steps ahead of the reader (in actual knowledge of the world and its history, not in subjective areas like deduction), so he does things that appear to have no logical basis until he deigns to let the reader in on his reasoning.For all that, though, I actually rather enjoyed the book. The universe Modesitt has created may be confusing, but it's quite involved and impressive; it's fascinating to see all the differences that have sprung simply from adding ghosts to the equation. The \\"cozy\\" atmosphere is strange at first, given the subject matter, but honestly, I'm not a fan of thrillers, so after a while I grew to like the laid-back feel. I doubt I'd recommend this to anyone, but I think I'll pick up the second book in the trilogy for myself."},{"Title":"Of Tangible Ghosts (Ghost trilogy)","review":"Sort of like a John Le Carre novel set in an alternate reality where ghosts exist.

Hang in there through at least the first couple of chapters, and if you have any taste you'll love it. :)Wish Modesitt would write more books like this. I personally don't find his Tolkienesque works all that appealing but this book, well, it's one of my favorites.

The alternate history dimension is the setting in an alternate world where North America is split among Quebec, New France (Mexico in our timeline) and Dutch-founded equivalent of the USA, and Europe is dominated by a ruthless Austro-Hungarian Empire. The fantasy dimension is that ghosts exist, a reality something like the Eqyptian Ka, and can be manipulated by electromagnetic fields. The existence of ghosts is responsible largely for the historical divergences between this history and ours. The suspense thriller aspect is the plot. Unfortunately, while the basic idea is clever, this book is disappointing reading.

Do we know that a 1% price improvement could boost net income by over 25%? How much thought do we put into setting our prices? What tools do we use when we set prices? For most of us, the answers are &quot;too little and too few&quot;.If you're responsible for pricing strategy in a mid-size company but don't consider yourself a pricing specialist, you'll find Power Pricing useful. It covers a lot of ground in a nontrivial way.Power Pricing starts where it should with an economic analysis of price, costs, and profits. I hesitate to use the word &quot;economic&quot; because it too often means &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;incomprehensible&quot;, or both. The book is neither, and the economics of pricing is half of what you need to know in order to be a smart pricer.The other half is understanding how customers respond to prices. The book covers several methods of determining price sensitivity, including conjoint analysis, a technique used by sophisticated companies but rarely understood by those of us who are not technical experts. The book's brief overview is understandable even if you have no technical background.The first part of the book ends with an interesting chapter on pricing and competitive strategy. It's full of examples which clearly illustrate pricing principles.The second part of the book introduces specific pricing concepts and techniques. Most of the concepts will be familiar, but the book covers some of them at a higher level of sophistication than most of us are accustomed to using. For example, the chapter on price customization breaks the concept into four methods: sorting by product line, by buyer characteristics, by transaction characteristics, and by distribution channel.We all know about quantity discounts (called &quot;nonlinear pricing&quot;), but do we think in terms of two-part tariffs or two-block tariffs? The book analyzes both, as well as other techniques for giving quantity discounts.The chapter on product-line pricing is particularly interesting. Are you willing to sacrifice profit on one item in order to make more profit on another How do you determine which products should be considered together when you set prices? How do you know how much a price change in one product affects the sales of another product? Are base products and their add-ons equally sensitive to price changes?Another interesting pricing decision involves price bundling. How do you put together successful product and price packages? Although this is one of Power Pricing's weaker chapters, you may find some of the tips useful.The book's chapter covering time customization of prices is more detailed and interesting. Time customization involves duration of price promotions. If you are trying to get loyal users of a competitive product to try your product, is there a best time to do a price promotion and a best length of time over which to run it?Power Pricing is an interesting and useful book. It explains some fairly technical, sophisticated material in a manner that is understandable, whether or not you have quantitative training. It generally is easy to read, subject to over-use of the ten-n &quot;power pricer&quot; and phrases in German (one of the authors is German).R.M.

This is a branch of microeconomics called price discrimination. Price discrimination questions are among the most directly observable ones for students, particulary those who are unlikley to study more economics or business. I therefore focus on these questions in teaching managerial economics in an organizational management graduate program.Dolan's and Simon's book is therefore of some interest to me. These two management consultants have written an extremely practical and non-academic book which explores the actual practice of business pricing with greater sophistication than found in most standard applied micreconomics texts or many business marketing texts. The main markets for this book, I suspect, are students, having graduated but still disatisifed with the overly theoretical approach in their microeconomics classes, and business managers, especially in medium to large companies, for whom pricing is a very dynamic and strategic issue.I doubt this book is used as a main teaching text, nor would I recommend it. Its basic concepts are hardly novel and are found in any microeconomics or marketing text.The presentation of the basic concept of price elasticity is somewhat long and tedious (it is usually done in less than a page in a standard microeconomics text). However, the application of this concept -and illustrations of how businesses can use it practically - makes for a very rich discussion.What is useful in their book is the variety of examples of actual business settings where practical pricing decisions have to be made which can apply several different concepts. How globalization affects pricing decisions is given considerable attention in this book. I did not find the final section on implementation of priing strategy in organizations as insightful as the middle chapter which is more analytical.For teaching and learning purposes, this could be a useful back-up resource, if used judiciously with a more standard text."},{"Title":"Power Pricing: How Managing Price Transforms the Bottom Line","review":"I work in the small appliance business.

I just have to mention the differing prices of MC Donalds throughout the world, and you know this quote is really worthless. Of course the quote has some meaning for high priced goods, but for almost all fast moving consumer goods this quote is rubbish. I think it would be useful to add to a future version of this book that this remark is more valid for high priced goods.Second point that I want to make is that the author thinks all producers have factory outlet stores or that distributors don't have a supplier. But this is probably my business administration background asking for a real perspective on prices, instead of just one isolated part. Mr. Dolan please read some distribution channel management literature!

It is obvious that the author tries to build himself up by using terminology and discussing techniques that he knows little about.The author also rewrites real business events in order to fit his examples. Often he dwells too long on these examples instead of getting to the point.While the author is a marketing professor, I don't think that he chose a target market. The content is no better than the information that a marketing student will get from an introductory accounting course. In addition, the terminologies that the author kicks around will likely scare marketing managers who lack a marketing education. Postgraduates will likely consider this book a waste of time and money. I have read other books that cover pricing just as well, get to the point quicker, and aren't as full of bull."},{"Title":"Power Pricing: How Managing Price Transforms the Bottom Line","review":"As a pricing expert and author ofStrategic Pricing for Medical Technologies: A Practical Guide to Pricing Medical Devices & Diagnostics, I found many parts of this book helpful, but it is incomplete if you are looking for a business-to-business (B2B) pricing book. First the good parts:Chapter 6 - International Pricing is a helpful guide that discusses the issues, implications, and fixes for dealing with international pricing. With globalization, the internet, and price transparency, firms of all types have to be careful about how pricing is managed around the world. This chapter provide a nice overview that is not found in many other pricing books.Chapter 12 - Organizing for Power Pricing provides some good concepts and an overview for organizing the company for becoming better at pricing. When I first started out in pricing in a large company years ago, I found this to be a useful reference.Chapter 13 Becoming a Power Pricing is a helpful reference for thinking about the various organization elements that need to be addressed to improve pricing. These include the company mindset, processes, and the scope of understanding. It also includes a simple diagnostic.The other parts of the book around price customization and product-line pricing are interesting. They are heavily B2C oriented.Now the areas for improvement:From a B2B pricing perspective, the book really doesn't address a number of critical issues such as:(1) Quantifying customer value: the book discusses market research and other techniques for estimating customer perceived value, but does not address how to actually estimate the real economic value of a product or solution.(2) Value communication: The book doesn't address how to use value communications to influence and shape customer value perceptions, particularly in a B2B selling environment.(3) Offering strategy: chapter 8 on product line pricing is interesting, but doesn't address the issues B2B companies face in needing to adapt their product line strategy to target and serve different buyer types(4) Rise of the economic buyer: the past decade has brought on the rise of the economic buyer in many B2B purchases. There is little in the book to help with this.I went back and forth on how many stars to give it. In the end, I gave the book 4-stars. It's a worthwhile purchase and read, but wouldn't be the first pricing book I would buy."},{"Title":"Power Pricing: How Managing Price Transforms the Bottom Line","review":"This book is like a classic car.

Not only do they apparently presume to speak for all women, as perhaps subconsciously does Ms. Nead, but they frequently take a platform that is both dour and too stringent. Her contentions here in The Female Nude are extreme. She is all-but critical of sexuality itself, all but denies that there is any non-sexual beauty in the human body, chides lust as an institution (no, I could not type that with a straight face) and contrary to her goals of championing women she in fact attacks women much more ardently than most any man ever would. Really this is not an overview of western female nudity in art and photography at all. There's little to be learned here, and the overall tone to this message leaves you feeling like you've just sat thru a sermon, or at best one of those college lectures where the professor was a bit too dogmatic in her approach to conveying the subject matter. Heck, even the photographs in here were bad choices. Nead won't be able to market this to either voyeurs or the intellectually curious. This book seems intent upon punishing its reader and is yet another \\"get the message in first\\" example of attacking rather than studying; of overtly delivering a message instead of neutrally expounding upon what could have been an engaging topic."},{"Title":"The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality","review":"This book reviews previous scholar's understanding of the nude, including an extremely insightful look at Kenneth Clark's The Nude and Berger's work on the nude, illuminating many areas where their theories revealed disturbing social views.... it also incorporates philosophy from a wide range of areas, providing the reader with a comprehensive look at why and how we respond to the female nude while exploring a wide range of explanations. it becomes an extremely valuable lesson on what makes us comfortable and the social implications of all the things we naturally find disgusting. By trying to strike at the core of some of the attitudes towards the female body, she also critiques many current feminist trends that she feels perpetuates the problem and directs us to a clearer understanding of what is needed to view the female body with somewhere near equal respect to the way we view the male body. Before reading this book I honestly thought feminism was silly and that in modern society men and women were close to equal. This book opened my eyes.....wide.... not only about women's studies but also about many of the tendencies of the human mind and i have continued to reference at least one of the ideas it introduced me to in most papers i have written since reading it."},{"Title":"The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality","review":"Nead's book examines the male gaze throughout history in the canon of visual art.

This massive book, over 1100 pages in length, contains the entire transcript of that testimony, taken from over seventy witnesses, most of them survivors of the disaster. The hearings began only a few days after the sinking, when memories were still fresh. All the surviving ship's officers and White Star Line director Bruce Ismay testified, along with numerous passengers and crew members. Reading what they had to say is about as close to actually being present at the sinking as we can hope to get. No other book contains so much first-hand information about what happened on that April night in the North Atlantic."},{"Title":"\\"Titanic\\" Disaster-Hardback","review":"If you are fascinated with the Titanic disaster, this book is a must have.

So much has been written based on interpretations of what they said. Here is the chance to read their original accounts first hand.Despite the fact that the transcripts of the Senate Hearings are now available on the web (as are the transcripts from the British Enquiry), there is just no substitute for having the originals on paper."},{"Title":"The Ex","review":"John Lutz didn't do a very good job on this one. The story is atypical and jumps over many holes in the plot. Lutz starts out with Deidre, a beautiful pyscho, escaping from a mental institution. She immediately heads to New York to try and rendezvous with her ex-husband David after several years. David has already re-married though and has a son. No problem for Deidre. Immediately Deidre begins to work herself back into David's life. David's wife Molly is immediately suspicious of Deidre. But David defends his ex-wife and Molly quiets her suspicions. Before long, Deidre has seduced David into having sex with her again. At the same time Deidre is stalking Molly and beginning to convince her she's going insane. Fairly soon, Deidre has schemed her way into their apartment building. A little after that she murders their babysitter and uses David to convince Molly to let Deidre babysit their son, Michael. After this the novel grows repetitive. The only breaks are the steamy sex scenes where Deidre repeatedly shows how much control she has over her ex-husband.(at one time she handcuffs him in a funeral parlor and forces him to have sex.) David meanwhile seems to give himself up to Deidre in exchange for sex while he begins to neglect his own wife. Deidre also is busy harassing Molly. Molly becomes a basket case as whenever she goes jogging Deidre dons a disguise and follows her, repeatedly threatening her. Deidre even begins to wear Molly's clothes. Soon David is sending Molly to a physciatrist while Deidre repeatedly forces him to have sex. She has begun videotaping him and her making love and using it as blackmail. Meanwhile she has been making friends with Michael. During one scene Deidre has sex with David and then leaves the apartment and attempts to kill Molly. David, ever the loving husband, tells Molly that she was simply imagining Deirdre trying to kill her. Anyways it begins to shift. Deirdre calls the apartment and leaves a message for Molly that says she's sleeping with David. Then she heads down to their apartment and erases it since there not home. While there she pleasures herself on Molly's side of the bed and leaves the mess for Molly to see. David finds it first and cleans it and then makes an excuse to leave the apartment and heads to Deirdre. Once he's up there he doesn't chew her out but merely has sex with her in a shower. After this Deirdre(who seemed to be on the verge of victory) blows it by kidnapping Michael. David fesses up to Molly about the affair. Molly and David rush to save Michael and it all ends with a climactic showdown between Deirdre and Molly. Ultimately, David kills Molly to keep having sex with Deirdre. No. Seriously if you want to know the end(like you don't already) you ought to read this book. Overall, the book was very predictable. It gets mired down in useless sub-plots. About the only good parts are the explicit sex scenes between Deirdre and David and when we get to read how Deirdre sees the whole situation. So basically if you're looking for a guilty pleasures book, read this one."},{"Title":"The Ex","review":"It's hard to believe that _The Ex_ was written by the same author who gave us the excellent Fred Carver detective series. Those books had memorable characters (who can ever forget the corrupt cop, McGregor?), compelling plots, a keen sense of place, and an anti-hero protagonist we could care about. The same can be said for his Alo Nudger series.This book has none of that. It's like a script from a bad TV movie. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the plot is utterly predictable. The final scene is completely illogical. The prose style is prosaic and simplistic--very much unlike the wry, terse style in the Carver books. It wouldn't surprise me if this one was ghost-written.Lutz has won many awards for his earlier detective novels. I suppose he's moved into mass-market commercialism so he can bank some money. Can't blame him--but too bad for his long-time fans."},{"Title":"The Ex","review":"First I want to start by saying as an author, John Lutz has very VERY good storytelling skills. He's very descriptive. I almost felt like I was there. I was drawn into the lives of these characters...so much so that I found when i wasn't reading the book, I kept talking about how dumb David was. I repeated that throughout the book, right to the end. With that being said, I felt this book was kind of a let down...no, it WAS a let down. Deidre was nuttier than the professor. Ok, I get that. I also get that her sexuality sugar coated her \\"crazy cake\\". Ok, men usually think with one head and its not always the one on their shoulders...I get that too. However, I got really confused about some of her rationale. Now the author could say \\"There is no method to her madness-hello, she's crazy!\\" I don't buy that. First, I was perplexed by the first death...like who is this chick and why was she killed? At first I thought it was just to steal her identity (which would have been understandable). We don't find out later who she is...i mean much later...i forgot who she was. Then the story moves along at a good pace...David gets dumber by the day and poor Molly is just...so plain and boring. In the mean time Deidre just gets crazier and homicidal. One thing I didn't get-who was Darlene? Was she real? The author made it seem as if she was a ghost, but how can she call people on the phone if she was a ghost? If Darlene was Deidre's sister, then how is it that she just met her in NY? That's the kind of thing that bothered me about this book. Also, I'd like to think that even after Deidre did what she did to him and his wife, the last thing he would do is sleep with her...but I've never been a divorced man who's ex wife was crazy and hot so maybe that's the norm. The final fight scene-which I had been looking forward to-was brief and unappealing. I figured at some point the only person that was going to be able to stop the EX was Molly and I was right. I was ok with being right about that, but I was not ok with the brevity of the scene. I thought it needed to be longer and i thought that Molly really should have beat her down...but that's just me. All in all, it was a good read, it had its moments (the sex scenes, and the scene when Molly finds the cat Muffin were pretty good). I think it could have ended better though and that's why I said I could have had a V8.

The haiku are refreshing, often whimsical with a light touch of humor. A few thematize Zen (\\"Emptiness, no holiness, Bodhidharma's statue: Daffodils in the water\\" p. 107), some thematize Buddhism more generally (\\"Buddha Nature, if compared, Must be this White bell-flower\\" p.96), but most, while good, do kind of leave you wondering what is specifically \\"Zen\\" about them, but no matter. A real surprise though were the examples of Soseki's paintings and calligraphy; I knew he dabbled with watercolor painting but had little idea he was this accomplished in traditional East Asian art forms in this manner. These add a real nice touch to an artistically arranged book that can still fit in your pocket and travel along wherever you happen to go."},{"Title":"Thirteen and a Day: The Bar and Bat Mitzvah Across America","review":"This wonderful book charts a double journey. It is a journalist's voyage through Jewish America, with Oppenheimer serving as a kind of traveling anthropologist who is examining an important religious ritual in its various manifestations. But it is also an autobiography, a coming-to-grips with roots, with the possibilities for religious belief, and a quasi-Oedipal rebellion against the author's frankly secular, modern, atheistic, non-observant, left-wing Jewish parents, who came of age in the 60s. Young Oppenheimer, a product of the 90s, came to look at the Jewish religion first in an academic way, and then was gradually drawn in to the mysteries and the doctrines of his people. By looking at the practice of the Bar and Bat Mitzvah in expected places (New York City) as well as unexpected ones (Alaska, Arkansas), Oppenheimer presents a full and generous (as well as a funny and informative) account of why people worship and believe as they do. The book makes sense for anyone involved in a similar personal quest, or for anyone interested in fine writing."},{"Title":"Thirteen and a Day: The Bar and Bat Mitzvah Across America","review":"This is a first-rate survey of an established custom. The book goes through many varieties of bar and bat mitzvat, demonstrating that they are not all alike. It focuses on values and choices, so that a person planning a bar or bat mitzvah can reflect on the values that he or she wishes to convey to the bar or bat mitzvah and to the congregation at large. While it is highly readable -- and not at all boring -- it has a significant depth that educates and challenges preconceived notions. It should be read by all parents who contemplate a bar or bat mitzvah for their child. I have otdered additiional copies for other family members for this reason."},{"Title":"Thirteen and a Day: The Bar and Bat Mitzvah Across America","review":"Even though it's nominally about bar mitzvah celebrations, this book really uses them as a taking-off point to look at the state of Judaism in America today, from Temple Emanu-El to the Lubavitchers, with numerous stops in between. I had actually expected (with a mixture of anticipation and dread) that the book would be mostly about the over-the-top parties of the type we see in the recent movie Keeping Up With The Steins. Oppenheimer does discuss these affairs, but most of the book is about the personal Jewish experience in a variety of places around the country: I found the most interesting part to be the study of a tiny congregation in St. Charles, Louisiana. Highly readable, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Thirteen and a Day: The Bar and Bat Mitzvah Across America","review":"Although it drags in places, especially the over-coverage of obscenely expensive keep-up-with-the-Cohens parties, it's mostly well written, interesting and thought provoking. One under-reported aspect, in my experience, is the role played by b'nai mitzvah in bringing together and maintaining the bonds of far-flung families. With 'living together' as common as marriage, and with low key ceremonies and elopements the frequent follow-through to 'living together', family get-togethers could be decades apart without the b'nai mitzvah events."},{"Title":"Thirteen and a Day: The Bar and Bat Mitzvah Across America","review":"As a Jew who did not celebrate his Bar Mitzvah, I learned a vast amount from this visit to 10 Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrants, their families, friends and neighbors.

This volume reminded me of another recently published totally absorbing memoir (Shanda, the Making and Breaking of a Self-loathing Jew) by Neal Karlen; both authors tell of belatedly embracing their Jewish roots and finding inestimable rewards in Jewish culture and in devotion to religious observance.

The author's anecdotal style of writing does not do justice to what is a very interesting and challenging subject. Not recommended for serious industry professionals."},{"Title":"Professional Electronic Trading","review":"The book is for general information.

Shackles is by far the best! As this story begins, &quot;Nameless&quot; is kidnapped by a masked man and taken to the Lake Tahoe area where he is shackled to the wall of a small cabin and left, not to die, but to contemplate his death over an agonizingly long period of time. The kidnapper has left him the essentials of life: food, water, books, heat, and a radio. It is only through strength of will and determination that &quot;Nameless&quot; not only survives this one but prevails. This is an intense personal drama that reaches to the soul of this unusual detective to let the reader know just exactly what makes this man tick. The way he plans his daily routine is fascinating. He never lets his predicament overwhelm him. His only question is, &quot;Will he escape before his supplies run out?&quot;. My only question is, &quot;Why is this wonderful novel out of print?&quot; Every reader of the Pronzini series should have access to this one."},{"Title":"Shackles: A \\"Nameless Detective\\" Mystery","review":"There are not many books I reread but this is absolutely one of them. The plot is tight, dialogue crisp and sense of place makes you reach for a blanket. Written in first person, you experience the thoughts and emotions of \`Nameless.' Although out of print and somewhat difficult to find-I recommend used.addall.com-it is worth every effort. It is truly haunting and well deserving of the ranking of Excellent."},{"Title":"Shackles: A \\"Nameless Detective\\" Mystery","review":"In the prior 16 novels in this more than 25 novel series, Nameless is one type of character. In the middle of Shackles, Nameless becomes someone else . . . someone he doesn't like as much, but who will be with him for years to come. Anyone who has enjoyed the novels since 1988 will want to be sure to read this book to understand how the current Nameless character was formed by the events in Shackles.Most of us live constrained by the \\"mind-forged manacles I hear\\" as William Blake put it. In Shackles, Nameless finds out what it is like to live constrained by a shackle on his leg that keeps him in an isolated mountain cabin for months while he carefully husbands a dwindling supply of food, beverages, heat and batteries. Nameless finds himself in this situation after being kidnapped in San Francisco. His unnamed abductor obviously hates Nameless very much, but Nameless cannot place him. The period of captivity reminded me of tales from the Gulag. Day by day, Nameless deals with his predicament and his need to retain his sanity. The story builds on a complex foundation of Nameless's reactions to the adversity.One thing keeps him alive -- the desire to locate his captor and bring him to justice.Shackles is at once a great story of psychological and physical duress, and a great adventure tale. There certainly is some detection in the story, but the psychological development and physical action are the real reasons to read and enjoy Shackles. At its best, Shackles will remind you of the haunting Jack London story, \\"To Build a Fire.\\"When you find out who abducted Nameless and what the source of the abductor's grudge was, you will probably enjoy many of the ironies that Mr. Pronzini built into the ending.As I read Shackles, I was reminded of the Biblical story of Joseph when he faced his brothers who had sold him into slavery in Egypt. How would you react to such an abductor?"},{"Title":"Means Illustrated Construction Dictionary, Includes CD-ROM! (RSMeans)","review":"This book is amazing. Still being in school, it has helped me in my internships. There is only so much you learn in school and this book has everything else. I would recommend it to anyone.

The illustrations are rudimentary and the definitions are shallow. Most of the illustrations have to do with obvious or outdated construction items. This may be a useful manual for people who are starting out in the industry (or history buffs), but definitely not for the seasoned professionals. One more book to gather dust on the shelve..."},{"Title":"Means Illustrated Construction Dictionary, Includes CD-ROM! (RSMeans)","review":"I wish I had this book when I first started working after school. You will probably never part with it as it is a very good and handy reference book. Sometimes it's very difficult to imagine some new word that's defined with some small definition but at least some words have pictures to aid in the description. Overall still very good."},{"Title":"Means Illustrated Construction Dictionary, Includes CD-ROM!

I love all the details that the author puts into his books. It makes you feel that you are there."},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"I love historical novels, especially the novels of C.S. Forester, Patrick O'Brien and Bernard Cornwell. Add Samuel Shellabarger and Kenneth Roberts to the list. I'm always looking for new authors, but Donachie won't be going on the list. I made it through the first 94 pages of \\"By the Mast Divided.\\" There was a lot of yada yada, but only one incident that really moved the story forward. The author also introduced 20+ characters, gave each a backstory and started several possible plot lines, but not much else happened. It felt like the author was trying to set the stage for a whole series of novels. Meanwhile the first book went nowhere. If you make it through this novel you're more determined than this reader."},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"David Donachie has begun a new series with this book. It continues with #2 \\"A Shot Rolling Ship\\" and #3 \\"An Awkward Commission\\" with possibly others to follow. \\"By the Mast Divided\\" sets up the characters and begins dual story lines following the lives of John Pearce and Ralph Barclay (Pearce's enemy). This book and the second end in cliff-hangers, so be prepared to read further. Once the series begins, the action is fast and well paced. Donachie has written other Age of Sail series that I enjoyed, notably the Privateerman Mystery (Harry Ludlow) series of 6 books and the fictional history of Lord Nelson and Emma Hamilton. Worth a read."},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"I enjoyed Donachie's \\"Privateersman\\" series, and the new \\"John Pearce\\" series does not dissapoint. There are a lot of characters and backstories, amd the books tend to end with cliffhangers, but the story is interesting and different enough from many of the other nautical fiction books I have read. A good start to a new series."},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"At first I only ordered volume one of this series,to test the \\"waters\\" so to speak, but about a third of the way through the first story I ordered the remaining books. The author is adept at story telling and can make you believe you are in the same time era and situations as the main characters. I only hope there are more stories yet to come, I am hooked !"},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"Though this book seems to be slow of pace the rich detail makes it very interesting. I look forward to reading more books by this author. The characters are fascinating!"},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"Young Pierce is on a secret mission for his ailing father to London when he is pressed into the navy along with several locals. Pierce, soon singled out by the captain as a troublemaker, finds himself attracted to the Captain's young wife Emily and eventually becomes the default leader of his motley band. Will Pierce escape the navy and save his father or will he be just another sailor lost at sea?I really enjoyed this novel. Although at times a bit of a Mary Sue, Pierce was an entertaining character and one I could easily identify with. The narrator does an excellent job with accents, making each character distinctive and fun.If you like O'brian's work, you will like this. It was a fun and enjoyable nautical adventure."},{"Title":"By the Mast Divided","review":"I have read several of the John Pearce series and I need to warn you: Whoever is responsible for editing the manuscript leaves GLARING misspellings and poorly worded phrases. It is as if the author did a draft and the draft went straight to publishing. I don't denigrate Donachie's writing; merely that whoever edits the text is awful and the book printer does not do a good job of correcting misspellings. Specifically, you can always count on \\"where\\" being spelled as \\"were\\". It's rather awful. Donachie is guilty of NOT using commas correctly and some of his sentences, which can get as long as Dickens, suffer from a lack of appropriate pauses.The tale is a good one and the above comments aside, Donachie is a good writer and plotter. Sometimes one has the feeling that one could read TWO battle scenes in another Fighting Sail authors work in the time it takes Donachie to scribble a single encounter but that too is a matter of taste. I enjoy his take on the same war and years so many other authors from Forester to O'Brien to Pope to Lambdin have explored. HOWEVER, again a caveat. His main character is a bit too forthright in his disrespect to be believable at times. More, the main premise of all these books is to have Pearce one day succeed in freeing his three (or possibly four) friends, known as The Pelicans, from their impressed status in the Royal Navy. By book six, this overriding premise grows a bit old and tiresome. It is time for Donachie to introduce some other theme besides vengeance upon evil Ralph Barclay and freeing his Pelicans.That aside, I still think you will find Donachie a good read and a fine \\"filler\\" while awaiting the latest releases from Dewey Lambdin and Julian Stockwin."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],q={key:0},L={key:1};function G(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(C,[["render",G],["__scopeId","data-v-d4b365ef"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/18.md","filePath":"glossary/18.md"}'),W={name:"glossary/18.md"},E=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,E as default};
