Because it is a collection of unrelated stories of survival, this is the sort of book that lends itself to bedside reading or as a book that you read intermittently over several months while giving other books more devoted attention. It not a textbook on how to survive. The author does not extract lessons from these stories, and he does not highlight survival methods that worked well or failed.

It failed to capture my imagination."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"This is a gripping account of how castaways and survivors struggle with nature and, sometimes, man. It is a huge book and I agree that the author could have eliminated the last section of the book. Actually, he should have written two books, one of them on the detailed survival of people like Alexander Selkirk and Herman Melville and the other book a short one on modern survivalists.This is because the last section of the book is a different format than the first much larger section. On the last section, the author provides only brief synopsis of events and facts and most of them are WWII related nature-related survivals. I would have suggested that he expand one of two of the stories and save the others for another book.However, what I enjoyed most about this book is the author's writing. He often used a turn of phrase that was unique, humorous and subtle. Don't get me wrong - the book is not humorous but the author has inserted a comment or phrase periodically that summed up someone's plight or segued into their next calamity. I found it very enjoyable and would mark the pages because I enjoyed that writing so much.I enjoy this genre and know that well written books in this genre are a rarity so I gave this book 5 stars. Whether you like this genre or not, you will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"This book is a compilation (accounts and stories, some related in great detail) of the ordeals of survivors of shipwrecks, plane crashes, exploring expeditions, etc. The accounts are fascinating (who couldn't find survival stories like these fascinating: just wondering how each of us would fare in similar circumstances is compelling enough). That's not to say that they don't become somewhat repetitive after a while, which they do. Seagrave has a main hypothesis he tries to prove along with the intriguing stories: those who survived had the will to survive, and special knowledge might help, but plays second fiddle to the will. Interesting."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"Leslie functions through a method of story telling where he gives away his powerful punch-line, each time, right up front.

These are not simple situations either, they are life and death episodes where it is certain that the smartest, fittest and luckiest come out alive.The book is a rich resource of stories going back to the 1500's to the present. Some of the earlier accounts were more difficult to assimilate due to the language dialect. Each of them portray significant human courage and vulnerability. For personal reasons, the reader may be more drawn to one that another. It is certain that a significant effort was made to render the historic presentation accurate. Some of the more astounding survival encounters are revealed generating the awesomeness of what the human being will go through to hold on to the fragile life line of their tomorrows."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"I read this back in the 80's, quite an antidote and/or complement to depression and/or rainy days. Not your typical summertime beach read. Gives one a feel for what extreme conditions many of our human ancestors have had to handle during our million plus years of evolution.

It is a touchstone for me. I re-read it once in a while to remind myself of the strength of the human spirit, the determination of character and the resourcefulness of our species. It also gives you something to think about when you think YOU are having problems! I appreciate that Mr. Leslie never assigns any of the successful survivals to the intervention of a devine being. To the contrary, scoundrals seem to fair better at the survival game than those who believe they have somewhere better to go. Certainly a keen interest in your own best interests and a refusal to give up on yourself is a factor in most of these stories. In short, this book is a guide book on survival for anyone who is mortal. Add to all this the fact that Mr. Leslie is a very talented writer and researcher, and you have a book that is a great read and refreshing to your soul. Thanks, Mr. Leslie."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"A very good book.

The blackout happened while we were in the air, and noone told us anything was wrong until we landed and had to ask why the monitors were blank. Cell and pay phones worked sporadically if at all, and there was no power, but thankfully there was water. The upshot was that I never got farther than the connecting airport (La Guardia) and after spending a night on the cold hard floor, pooled with 5 other people and hired a $800+ limo to drive us the 250 miles home. The limo broke down in the Poconos, but we managed to rent cars in Scranton. As of this writing there are apparently STILL people stranded at that airport, waiting to get out.I'd forgotten all about the book until I arrived home, tired, sore, and sad about my misadventure. I rediscovered it sitting where I'd left it, and was immediately re-immersed into stories of truly dire straits. While some reviewers have said they consider the book dry, I really enjoyed the historical context of the stories, and thorough treatment of the epilogues. The author has uncanny insight into what might have really happened, based on what was said and NOT SAID by the survivors, and delves into the individual personalities involved. It is fascinating to learn what happened to these people after they were rescued; how society reacted to them, how they reacted back. I found it very hard to put down.It sure put my own recent experience into perspective! At least noone had to resort to eating anyone else. \\"Abandonded Journeys, Desperate Souls\\" would have been a great title for it. ;-)"},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"I quite enjoyed \\"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls\\". Leslie obviously did extensive research on his subject, and his thoroughness pays off. Many of the stories are at least vaguely familiar to most, like the real Robinson Crusoe named Alexander Selkirk, and a host of others who shipwrecked, crashed, exiled or simply became lost. Amongst my favorites was the story of Hugh Glass who was vicously mauled by a Grizzly on the American Plains in 1823 and left to die by members of his expedition. Facing incredible odds, not only of surviving the wounds, but also battling starvation, the elements and furocious Indians over huge expenses of land and time to face again those who abandoned him.The only minor criticism I have is that it tends to be too thorough,and after a few dozen early shipwreck stories you feel relieved when a modern airplane crash changes the pace. All in all, a well written and interesting book."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"This book was obviously exhaustively researched, as it spares no details in the dozens of true and horrifying accounts of people throughout the ages who were trapped in hopeless survival situations. Many lived, many did not... The only flaw in this teriffic book is that it may be a bit long and seems to lose momentum before the end. It could have been a third shorter and still been as powerful and just as fascinating. I was a little disappointed that the author did not cover the Raft of the Medusa or the Donner Party, as they would fit perfectly into this book. Perhaps he thought they've already been studies more thoroughly by other reasearchers. But it was still very much worth reading and never got boring. I was surprised at how many instances of civilized cannibalism have occured throughout history! I would recommend this book to anyone interested in survival or human psychology."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"&quot;True stories of Castaways and Other Survivors&quot;This is a superb mix of 20+ different types of survival stories. From the Poor Englishman who landed on a barren isle that &quot;had neither springs nor streams and was utterly devoid of vegetation: no grass, plants, or trees&quot; and managed to live for a full year and be rescued -to- The Headhunter's Casket, which in part reads, &quot;...two issues should be examined and resolved. The first involves an individual's responsibility or guilt for actions taken to ensure his survival. The second has to do with the lasting effects of ordeals.&quot; It is truely some of the best reading and information, of this type, I've EVER come across."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"With the bestseller lists populated by the likes of such adventure stories as Into Thin Air and other contrived adventures of the bored rich, it is refreshing to read about adventure stories that hark back to a time when man was less concerned with adventure and more concerned with science, discovery, or just making a living. Adventure was just something you accidentally stumbled into. The author recounts many lesser known survival stories, and attempts to reconstruct a mental and psychological profile of the victims as well. In an age where we look at adventure and heroism as more important than the preparation and foresight that would make such adventure unnecessary, it is refreshing to read about survival stories where those suffering the hardships simply want to get it over with. The book hums along nicely for about 2/3 of the 500+ pages, but the author seems to run out of steam and stories, and seems to want to read more i nto the adventure experience than is actually there. Many of the survivors seem less than willing to elaborate upon their experiences, or semed less than heroic in their hardships, but this only adds weight to the contrast between explorer/discoverer and the modern adventurer. But those of you with a taste for the bizarre will love this book, it contains enough morbidity,death, cannibalism and suffering to satisfy the most harcore adventure enthusiast. THe chapters on the rampant cannibalism i n the history of the British Navy and in other adventure scenarios are especially gruesome. Bon Appetit! All in all a worthwhile if a bit long of a read."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"This 20+ chapter book is a compilation of accounts of individuals who survived real-life tragedies--everything from shipwrecks back in the days of wooden ships, to modern events such as plane crashes, etc.The one thing each of the stories has in common is that each of the survivors not only had to withstand the tragedy itself, but then they had to fight against nature or the elements to preserve their life.I did enjoy the book, but I can't give it more than 3 stars. I generally judge a book by how difficult it is for me to set it down before it's finished--this one just wasn't that gripping. The stories were interesting, but at times it didn't seem like there was enough continuity.In addition, I think the last chapter could have been eliminated entirely. While the other chapters were generally dedicated to one story per chapter, the last contained a dozen or so stories from the 20th century. As a result, they were much more brief, and left me wondering about the details that were necessarily omited.That said however, the author did a fantastic job of researching the accounts, especially given the number he covered."},{"Title":"Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors","review":"This book is a must for every reader who likes survival stories.Selected here events (on the land and sea) are absolutely astonishing and ranging in time from 16th century to modern times.

This is the perfect book to answer that. Some folks have spiritual revelations, some give up the idea of god altogether, some go crazy. And who survives, and who dies of panic or bad planning? All incredibly interesting. Stories range from pirate mutinies to a woman trapped under her car on a snowy road... oh, and those Japanese soldiers in WWII who didn't know the war ended! What a lot of good stories.After reading this, I had this strange period of looking at the world from the point of view of a castaway... \\"what is useful to me in this situation?

That's not my problem with the book.The problem is that the sounds to play (about 6) that come with this book are in one word: obnoxious. More words? Ok, they're tinny, loud, and extremely annoying.As the mother of a 16 month old, we have many toys that make noises and none sound like this. These noise-making toys are geared towards children so they're not to my taste, but some are even enjoyable to listen to. Not so Jack & Jill's sounds to play.I would give this book one star, but I have to admit my daughter likes the book with the sounds. No, she loves it. Fortunately, a mother's love comes with no strings attached."},{"Title":"An Audience with an Elephant: And Other Encounters on the Eccentric Side","review":"This is just a lovely, lovely book. It is hard to describe it in any other way. It is a series of very short and personal articles collected together which have been written by Rogers. They are part travelogue (and very much about Wales) but mostly very personal stories, nothing about celebrities, and everything about quite everyday sort of people.Rogers style is quite easy and informal which makes these articles immensely readable. They include mostly quite unusual aspects of the usual, so in here are stories about possibly the last tramp/vagabond in Wales. His life, what he ate, how he travelled, the codes used by other vagabonds to indicate information about houses and properties. There is the story of Ali Pasha the last prisoner of War from Turkey following World War 1 (a tortoise in fact.) There are the lost children from Wales late attempt for independence who were locked in bleak monasteries and convents, a teenage elephant, and the largest sturgeon ever caught.These are punchy and readable articles which have been collected together, so you can read them bit by bit, skip back and forth or pick them up and put them down. They are linked generally by their personality and style. They are simple but rich and personal stories about ordinary people and events. Very often those at the end of their era (the last tramp in Wales, a 'Bertie Wooster' style fisherman from the 20's etc.)I would recommend this book to own rather than borrow because it is so nice to dip in and out of, they are really 'heartwarming' in the most cliched but nicest use of the word"},{"Title":"An Audience with an Elephant: And Other Encounters on the Eccentric Side","review":"Reading this collection of stories is rather like travelling Britain via its country lanes. Occasionally you can hear the far-off hum of the motorways, but it never interrupts your enjoyment of Britain's traditionally non-conformist landscape, physical and mental. The word quirky has so often become indistinguishable from twee, but here recaptures its original meaning with this collection of stories and recollections distilled from a lifetime of observation. With all due respect, forget Bill Bryson, this is the authentic voice of a Britain hidden in plain sight."},{"Title":"An Audience with an Elephant: And Other Encounters on the Eccentric Side","review":"Byron Rogers is a highly regarded British Press writer, much like the Human Interest editors of all the major newspapers in the USA. He writes in a succinct, informed, yet chatty way that endears him to British readers and now with the appearance of AN AUDIENCE WITH AN ELEPHANT, a collection of his previously published observations, the American readers can delight in his gifts. This small book is a perfect companion of light reading at the bedside or as an endlessly interesting collection for brightening moments during travels. His topics vary widely - from the tortoise captured at Gallipoli, to a teenage elephant that toured the Bristish Isles as an honored guest at festivities, to the problems with being single and coping with Singles Bars. Though some my see this collection as a variation on Ripley's Believe It Or Not, it is nonetheless continuously humorous and tender. Rogers eccentricites have a way of putting the world in which we struggle into comic relief and allows us to laugh at our own foibles. Good medicine, this!"},{"Title":"An Audience with an Elephant: And Other Encounters on the Eccentric Side","review":"This blends travel and nature in the finest of methods and traditions, probing the variety and comedy of encounters with animals around the world and lending a chatty, adventure-filled tone which should particularly appeal to fans of Eric Newby.

It has also been mine for decades, even though I've since read many fictional histories. Eons ago when I was taking archaeology and Latin, my Latin teacher recommended it and I've reread it so many times that I need to buy a new copy in order to share it with my family. In this book, the Trojan War era comes alive from the fight scenes, strategies and political turmoil to the countrysides of the Mediterranean area, its foods and customs and the inner court of Troy's elite. Seen through the eyes of a fictional Trojan youth, Helios, who winds up on both sides of the war, survives by his wits and the help of his eventual mentor Odysseus, we ride along on this fantastic chariot ride through the entire war, meeting Hector, Priam, Helen, Achilles, and many other 'famous' historical figures.Powell does a masterful job of interpreting the writings and molding a story that is both true to history and imaginative enough to take us into the minds and hearts of the people involved in the horror of the Trojan War.

No other book has ever held this sway over me. Richard Powell was a genius at character development, not just in this book, but in many of his other stories as well (Don Quixote USA!). Its sad that its no longer in print, but if you are lucky enough to find a copy, you will enjoy fictional writing at the top of its form."},{"Title":"Whom the Gods Would Destroy","review":"This tale of the trojan times is absolutely beautiful.

Richard Powell was a genius!"},{"Title":"Whom the Gods Would Destroy","review":"This is the first review I've ever written, and this book is worth commenting on. I would have to say this is my favorite book, too. I discovered the hardcover version in a used bookstore; bought it for about $5. It seems to be worth a lot more than that; I was lucky. Since I re-read it a lot, I bought the softcover version so I wouldn't wear the hardcover. This book, about a boy that lives in Troy during the Trojan War, really seems to put the reader back in time. Good, realistic characters bring the story to life. I tried to find more books by this author, but to no avail. This may have been the only work he did. If you are interested in this time period, I highly recommend it as a way to experience the past, in addition to history books on the subject."},{"Title":"Whom the Gods Would Destroy","review":"This book just happens to be my all time favorite book, and surprisingly enough, I too have been in contact with this fine piece of work by my High School English teacher.It takes place in an ancient war between the Agean, the Trojan War.

Actually all the OBDII info is common place, available many places for free on the internet. The chapters on OBDII concepts is simplistic, generic and again available in more detailed and complete form on the internet.It offers no true diagnostic \\"secrets\\" or even specific diagnostic advice, just an explanation of OBDII diagnostic basics and a compilation of generic and manufacturer specific codes, with only their OBDII names as any clue. For instance P0300 \\"Random Multiple Misfire\\" .... yep, that's exactly what any scanner that reads the code will tell you. Don't need a book to tell you the same thing. I can't imagine who this book would be useful to, a real automotive shop will have professional scanners and diagnostic equipment with all the code definitions in memory, a $100 code scanner will have the same, a person curious about a specific code will get far more information on the internet for free. I guess if the average, non-mechanic, or even non-DIY'er was curious about OBDII for some reason it would provide a good starting point.

You will not be able to fully understand this book until you really understand how a modern engine works. You will need another book for this.I was somewhat disappointed in the book. Since I understand electronics, I wanted more detail about how OBD-II worked. The book was lacking. Of the 250 pages in the book only about 50 had any real \\"meat\\". The rest were tables of DTCs (trouble codes), repeated info, shallow glossaries, blank pages, and pictures that did not really add any important information. Also there is a food recipe and a picture of the author's wife. (Strange???)I feel much more could have been done in a book with a nearly $ price tag. The book is produced very well with glossy pages and a hard cover.

Waugh handles the weighty topic with the same dexterity with which he treats all of his subjects, never bogging down and keeping the reader laughing. The story also provides interesting historical material on both WWII and the disappearance of the English aristocracy. I would recommend reading Men at Arms and Officers &amp; Gentlemen, the first two volumes of the trilogy, to be able to follow the story and the significance of the events."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"The final volume in Evelyn Waugh's \\"Sword Of Honour\\" trilogy brings us to the end of World War II, as Guy Crouchback's quest to find glory on the battlefield has sputtered out. When we meet him in this volume, he is more of a shell than ever, his psyche ripped apart by the terrible fighting he witnessed on Crete. Will he find one last shot at redemption, of ending his own private war in victory rather than defeat?\\"End Of The Battle\\" is the most problematic of Waugh's trilogy. The humor found in the preceding volumes is nearly gone. Key characters are snuffed out without warning. Waugh is bluntly straightforward about what he sees as the chief failing of his own country in war, a failing he saw carried over into the time he wrote this in 1960-61: The lapse of British will in the face of leftist challenge and Soviet domination.There's no way I'd recommend any reader to this book without first getting his or her hands on \\"Men At Arms\\" or \\"Officers And Gentlemen,\\" if not both. \\"End Of The Battle\\" assumes a reader is familiar with the concepts Waugh spent those last two books espousing, the cause of Catholic exceptionalism in the face of mundanity and evil, the slow strangulation of martial spirit by bureaucratic \\"banf,\\" Guy's inability to have children. If you don't care about this stuff going in, Waugh is not going to do much to sell you. He already laid the groundwork in the earlier volumes; \\"End Of The Battle\\" is concerned with resolution.There's many Waugh bete noirs in evidence, some which will no doubt bother many modern readers. Communists and leftists are practically interchangable, and there's a \\"velvet mafia\\" at work, too, homosexuals who toil to undercut democracy and serve Uncle Joe Stalin. Even if this was not at odds with history (the Burgess spy ring members were nearly all gay), Waugh presses his point with unsettling belligerence.What's to be said for a comic novel whose most comic sequence involves a woman's fruitless search for an abortion? Actually, quite a lot. The comedy in \\"End Of The Battle\\" may be largely mirthless, but it is sharp and biting, too. The characterizations of Guy, his father, uncle Peregrine, and Guy's former wife Virginia are layered and involving. Waugh moves his story in unexpected directions, and as he does so, brings the themes and concerns of his trilogy into focus and resolution that, while not always satisfying, have integrity.\\"End Of The Battle\\" reminds me a lot of the Hemingway novel \\"A Farewell To Arms,\\" with the same pathetic tone and the prevailing sense of war's wastefulness even behind the lines. It's a very lived-in book. It also makes for an arresting conclusion to Waugh's last major work of fiction, the \\"Sword Of Honour\\" trilogy, as a kind of existential if not nihilistic book that nevertheless manages to be profoundly spiritual in its focus. At one point, Guy's father explains that winning or losing great conflicts matters less than the salvation of a single soul, and it is this Waugh means for the reader to carry away.Does Waugh do this? A lot depends on your mindset going in, on your ability to go with the often-nasty twists and turns Waugh puts his characters through, and whether you've done your homework reading the previous volumes. Waugh the cynic makes a good case in the end for the presence of grace in this world, but perhaps a better one for how difficult such grace is to achieve."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"The acclaimed Sword of Honor trilogy concludes in this somber, but still hopeful story of the closing days of WWII in Europe. The protagonist, no-longer-youthful British officer Guy Crouchback, is assigned as liaison to a group of Yugoslav partisans, and finds himself involved in the plight of a group of desperate Jewish refugees. On the Home Front, Guy re-unites with his ex-wife Virginia (for whom he still has strong feelings) but can she provide him with a hoped-for heir, or will she die like the character in Ludovic's novel, forcing Guy to seek love and happiness elsewhere?Early in the book, Guy's father admonishes that \\"if only one soul is saved, that is full compensation\\" and this seems to be the real point of the author's story, and ultimately of the entire trilogy: after all the nonsense, the foolishness, the failures, and even the horror, just one single act of mercy can be enough to account for a wasted life. This hope for a final justification lends an optimistic tone to a book that is otherwise filled with the death and destruction of the bombing of London, but it also ties together the various themes that the trilogy has focused on: the senselessness of war, the relevance (or irrelevance) of Catholicism, and the manifest follies and inequities of modern Britain and Western culture generally. If the first two volumes of this series seemed a little too light and pointless, this book is where it all really pays off. A strong statement about how one man makes sense of an increasingly senseless world."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"In the prologue of THE END OF THE BATTLE, protagonist Guy Crouchback receives a letter from his eminently decent father, who expresses concern over Guy's exhilarated reaction to wartime political change in Italy. In his letter, Father Crouchback observes: \\"Quantitative judgments don't apply. If only one soul was saved that is full compensation for any amount of loss of face.\\"Father Crouchback's pronouncement about ego-less behavior strikes a responsive cord in Guy, who subsequently wonders how he can justify his futile soldiering during World War II. Since the \\"just cause of going to war\\" was \\"forfeited by the Russian alliance,\\" Guy now feels that \\"personal honor alone remains.\\" In THE END OF THE BATTLE, the story Waugh explores is: Will Guy find an opportunity to perform a honorable and decent act during the war?When Waugh's focus is on Guy and his dilemma, I found THE END OF THE BATTLE to be a first-rate book. Acting as the perfect context for this dilemma is Guy's military service in Yugoslavia, where the political situation is pernicious and opaque and the Brits and Captain Crouchback are supporting the totalitarian partisans. In this assignment, Guy's efforts to behave decently and aid displaced Jews reveal his full poignant futility and his civilized but inadvertent deadliness. When exploring Guy's limits, Waugh is terrific.Even so, I'd say THE END OF THE BATTLE is a less satisfying book than its predecessors in the SWORD OF HONOR trilogy. IMHO, there are two reasons for this slight decline. First, Waugh writes too much about the English literary scene, which he treats with comic condescension. Second, Waugh is highly sensitive to the presence and effects of left-leaning British intelligence operatives in the war effort. This gives his story a dated cold-war flavor. Anyway, when these are his themes, Waugh seems more fleering and topical than he is literary. This detracts.Final note: THE END OF THE BATTLE overlaps surprisingly with two antic novels set in World War II. At the parachute school, Waugh's character Ludovic shows the same crazy avoidance patterns as Major Major Major Major inCatch-22. And, his Nazi rocket attacks on London and the dirty tricks facility of HOO HQ certainly surfaced my memories ofGravity's Rainbow (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition). Just wasn't ready, I guess, to find affinities between the snobbish and traditional Waugh and the risk-taking Heller and Pynchon."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"THE END OF THE BATTLE is the final novel in Evelyn Waugh's World War II trilogy, \\"The Sword of Honour.\\" It is an excellent novel, and it is a fitting conclusion to an excellent trilogy. Some have lauded the trilogy as the best fiction in English to come out of World War II. As good as it is, I would not so characterize it, in part because there is very little actual combat in the three novels. (In THE END OF THE BATTLE there are three pages of combat.) The subjects, instead, are the ordinariness, pettiness, and inanity that permeates so much of bureaucratic military life; the dislocation (and death) brought about by the war on the home front; and, most memorably, the changes wrought by the war and modern times on English society.The protagonist of the novels is Guy Crouchback (who turns 40 in THE END OF THE BATTLE), a thoroughly decent, admirable, and likeable man -- in fact, off hand I can't think of a more decent and admirable protagonist in modern fiction. Guy, as well as his father Gervase and his uncle Peregrine, are representatives of the old order in Great Britain. They are deeply engrained with family and tradition and, above all, faith and honor. But all three must gradually come to grips with the recognition that in the society at large those values are withering. Waugh leaves it to Peregrine to voice his judgment: Peregrine had never married (because he was a younger son, and younger sons simply did not marry in an old-fashioned family like the Crouchbacks), and he had taken to spending Christmas with distant relatives; as his visit in 1943 came to an end, his host remarked to him, \\"You're really the only link with Christmas as it used to be. It is so sweet of you coming so faithfully. Do you think things will ever be normal again?\\", and Peregrine Crouchback answers, \\"Oh, no. Never again.\\"\\"The End of the Battle\\" is the title given to the novel in the United States. In Britain, and as originally published, it is called \\"Unconditional Surrender.\\" (If anyone knows why it was given a different title in the U.S., I would appreciate learning the reason.) I sense that the original title is more appropriate, because by the end of the novel, and the end of the trilogy, Guy Crouchback seemingly has surrendered, or at least resigned himself, to a new world order.Among the developments of WWII that greatly disturb Guy Crouchback -- as well as, surely, Evelyn Waugh -- is the alliance with the Soviet Union and atheistic communism. In THE END OF THE BATTLE, Guy serves as a military liaison officer with partisan fighters in Croatia, and he is upset that politics influenced, even overrode, military considerations, and that consequently British actions helped pave the way for Tito and the Communists to entrench themselves in Yugoslavia. He also is upset that Britain and the U.S. abandoned so much of eastern Europe to Stalin and the Soviet Union at Tehran and Yalta. On a larger scale, those developments represent a different sort of \\"unconditional surrender.\\"In the face of an overwhelming world war and momentous changes in the principles that govern everyday life at home in Britain, Guy, aided by advice from his father, finds meaning in helping others. \\"[H]ere again, in a world of hate and waste, [Guy] was being offered the chance of doing a single small act to redeem the times,\\" and twice in the novel, in a very touching and honorable way, Guy accepts that offer.As with the two previous volumes of the trilogy -- \\"Men at Arms\\" and \\"Officers and Gentlemen\\" -- the writing is superb. Simply put, Evelyn Waugh was a master of English prose, and the \\"Sword of Honour\\" trilogy probably represents the pinnacle of his craft. He also was a consummate humorist, and that skill also is very much in evidence in THE END OF THE BATTLE, although (except for a few farcical scenes) the humor is drier and more restrained than it was in \\"Officers and Gentlemen.\\" All in all, THE END OF THE BATTLE is closer in tone to the first volume, \\"Men at Arms,\\" and the characters are more fully drawn than they were in \\"Officers and Gentlemen\\" and there is more philosophy or reflection about life. In my judgment, THE END OF THE BATTLE is the best of the three.But to fully appreciate it, one should first read, in order, the two predecessor volumes. And one should read them as they were originally published. In 1965, Waugh revised the three novels and they were published together, under the title \\"The Sword of Honour.\\" I have not read that later edition, but I have read about some of the changes Waugh made in the revision process, and in my opinion they were for the poorer. On the whole, though, the trilogy is one of the best works of fiction to come out of Britain in the last half of the 20th Century, and Guy Crouchback is one of the most honorable fictional characters."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"I am reviewing the three novels in Evelyn Waugh'sSWORD OF HONOURtrilogy separately as I read them; I will also post a review of the series as a whole. I have to express disappointment, though, that this final volume was not published in the USA under its original title,UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER. Perhaps that sounded too negative for a book set in the last years of the Second World War, but despite their superficially happy endings, Waugh's novels do typically have a dying fall. Besides, the original title has many meanings beyond the military one. It might refer to the protagonist Guy Crouchback's acceptance of his situation in the wartime army, seeing many less able men promoted around and above him. It might refer to his ex-wife Virginia's surrender to the Catholic faith, part of a gentle transformation that develops the character far beyond her former role as a femme fatale and plot complication. It might describe the elegiac atmosphere surrounding the funeral of Guy's elderly father, which makes a central set-piece of some seriousness. And it certainly refers to the book's final sections, when Guy is sent to monitor mopping-up operations in Yugoslavia, as bands of partisans fight other bands, with an eye less to the imminent elimination of the Germans, than to positioning themselves in the postwar world, with respect to communism and the underlying ethnic tensions that we have seen flare up in recent years.This is one section of the book that does not seem at all dated. In the earlier parts of the novel, as elsewhere in the trilogy, I sometimes felt I was reading a roman &agrave; clef without the key. One senses that contemporary readers would recognize the peripatetic civilian Sir Ralph Brompton, who manages to have a finger in every pie. They would know the questionable merits of the literary magazine \\"Survival,\\" published with government funds. And when Guy's Corporal-Major Ludovic fromOFFICERS AND GENTLEMENdevotes the last years of his war to producing a mammoth best-selling novel, contemporary readers would have had one or two candidates in mind.Still, these are minor lacunae. What makes the novel work for me are two moral threads running through its episodic structure. One is political and muted: the dilemma of taking as an ally a country (Russia) which, in every respect other than its anti-fascism, seems the moral antithesis of traditional English values. The other is personal and deep-seated. Struck at his father's funeral by a sense of his own uselessness, Guy prays that God will give him \\"the chance to do some small service which only he could perform, for which he had been created.\\" In fact, he gets two such chances: one concerning his ex-wife, and the other working to help a group of Jewish refugees who have been sidelined in the Yugoslavian strife. That neither opportunity has an entirely perfect ending, and that the final pages of this comedy have a distinctly tragic tinge, only adds to the moral weight which ultimately ballasts its often-irritating flippancy."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"I have been reading Evelyn Waugh since high school - too long ago to admit to the year. I enjoy his black humor and his subjects and his writing. Some stories have been better than others but I am glad to have finally found this one as it wraps up some loose ends."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"I have now completed the Evelyn Waugh trilogy of World War II and I must say that \\"Men at Arms\\", \\"Officers and Gentlemen\\", and \\"The End of the Battle\\" were an interesting experience. The books were very good in the same sense that Evelyn Waugh's writing skills are very good. However, the subjest is World War II and, in that context, Evelyn Waugh is no James Jones (which is a statement I'm sure the late James Jones would agree with). I'm not sure I was able to enjoy Waugh's writing quite as much given the subject and his treatment of it. I confess that I did not come to this conclusion until I finished \\"The End of the Battle\\" but I also admit that I was gathering doubts while reading the first two books.What Waugh's trilogy comes across as is a mildly satirical, upper-class, socialistic examination of the effects of a mainland power struggle. In the process, we get an enjoyable spoof of military buearocracy, marvelously eccentric characters that only the English can produce, and a tinge of tragedy through the eyes of a man who timidly stuck his neck out because it was the right thing to do. What we miss is the defining event of the 20th Century.I will agree that Waugh throws some helpful perspectives into focus such as the randomness of death, the quality of courage, and the strange bedfellows that often unite in such global common causes. However, one gets the sense that all this is only as important as being properly dressed for dinner. Is that the satire that I'm too dense to appreciate? If so, let this review be my public self-humiliation. I, for one, prefer, for this subject, the down to earth analysis of the common soldier of WWII as presented in James Jones trilogy \\"From Here to Eternity\\", \\"The Thin Red Line\\" and \\"Whistle\\". Waugh's book made me realize that there was an element in England, as well as other countries at the time, for whom WWII was exercise in power from whatever perspective you saw it. For some it was probably what you deservedly got for failing to support the Republican forces in Spain. Oh well, most of us still can't figure out how England voted Churchill out of office before the war was over.I will continue to read Waugh because he truly is a gifted writer. However, I prefer \\"Scoop\\" and its' fictional African setting to this trilogy and its' trivialization of the defeat of tyranny."},{"Title":"The End of the Battle","review":"Guy Crouchback had sought to find his place during World War II. He was commissioned in the Royal Corps of Halberdiers. By 1941 Guy was returning to his regiment from the commandos. In 1943 he was told he was valuable for training but he wouldn't be going overseas.Matchet, the family estate, had changed. Jumbo Trotter did not mind being left behind, on the shelf. Guy moved to Jumbo's transit camp, London District. Ludovic's last two years had been as uneventful as Guy's. Presently he found excitement in writing. Ludovic's book, PENSEES, is described as if Logan Persall Smith were writing Kafka.Guy learned that he might be posted to Northern Italy, (he speaks Italian). It is to be secret work with the partisans. For Guy's father's funeral, Miss Vavasour, the priest from Matchet, and a headmaster were assembled. Guy's Uncle Peregrine had arranged for a special train. Miss Vavasour said of Guy that he was the fin de ligne. Others noted the death of Mr. Gervase Crouchback and his funeral at Broome. Guy is asked to speak with his father's solicitor after the funeral.Arthur Box-Bender is careful to adhere to the rituals of the Roman Catholic Mass. Having talked with the solicitor, Angela Box-Bender and Guy determine they will continue paying pensions to individuals, a practice initiated by their father. Virginia Troy has turned up and she is pregnant.This is the third book of Waugh's war trilogy. The rest of this book recounts the fates of a number of characters, including those already mentioned together with Kerstie and Ian Kilbannock, Ivor Claire, Ben Ritchie-Hook, Major Marchpole, Everard Spruce, Sir Ralph Brompton, and Major J. Cattermole. The work is humorous, arch. The writing is fabulous in its balance and verve."},{"Title":"WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS FOR SALE: Inside America's Biggest Defense Scandal","review":"The book chronicles the way major weapons procurement was done during the Reagan administration. This was a period of massive military spending. Big defense contractors had to work through lobbyists to get contracts just because that's how the game was played in many instances.Right from the beginning, the story got my attention with an unfortunate human interest story. After that the subject was purely on corruption in federal procurement and how rampant it was at the time. As a taxpayer, it made me angry. I stayed angry for most of the book and wasn't surprised that justice never prevailed."},{"Title":"WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS FOR SALE: Inside America's Biggest Defense Scandal","review":"I read this book when it was first out, and gave away several copies to friends. Although it seems to be a microcosm in time, any acquisition professional can gain insight how the acquisition process is flawed from testing to selection, even though this book is 15+ years old and about a specific systemI remember when Melvyn Paisley was in power and people in Navy R&D; work NO Paisley buttons to work. This was a huge Navy scandal and no one outside the Navy noticed. The acquisition system is even more loosey goosey since 9/11, after you read this, imagine how awful it is now.This should be required reading for DoD acquisition professionals."},{"Title":"WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS FOR SALE: Inside America's Biggest Defense Scandal","review":"For all of you who suspected this was going on - this will verify your suspicions. The bad thing is - while the fines to the businesses involved looked big, in terms of the contracts they got from the government, the fines were just a cost of doing business. Any one in the government today will be able to tell that this is not only still going on, but in terms of what the government is currently contracting out - it has gotten worse by multitudes. This book will educate you on how hard it is to develop a case against this type of &quot;crime&quot; and why it continues. It get's slow at times and some of the terms are used incorrectly, but this is the proverbial look at sausage being made. If you wonder why certain things are going on in government, this will certainly help you understand. A MUST read for all career government managers."},{"Title":"WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS FOR SALE: Inside America's Biggest Defense Scandal","review":"OK, everyone who's heard of Monica Lewinsky raise your hand... Now, everyone who's heard of Melvyn Paisley raise your hand... That's odd, everyone knows who Monica Lewinsky is but no one has ever heard of the central figure in the most costly scandal in U.S. history. I guess if Melvyn had performed a sexual act with a high ranking official instead of screwing the tax payers out of millions of dollars he'd have made the news.How does a scandal like this get swept under the rug? This book chronicles this mess from beginning to end, explaining how we as tax payers actually paid companies to bribe members of our government. (It turns out that many companies included the cost of the bribes in the final tab for the weapons systems they sold us, many of which ranged from severely flaw to totally useless) All of this under the nose of the Gipper, of course. I guess Nancy's astrologer didn't see it coming.A good read that will leave you shaking your head not only at what went on but at the fact that it flashed through our collective consciousness without leaving so much as a ripple."},{"Title":"Amazonian Dark Earths: Origin, Properties, Management","review":"This is an excellent resource if you're actually interested in the study of soils, agriculture, or amazonia as a whole. No, this is not intended as a how-to guide and if that's all you're looking for, I'd go for a basic gardening book and look to this resource only if you're really interested in the science behind the art. THIS IS AN ACADEMIC PIECE OF LITERATURE! And an excellent piece of it at that. Since I had no background in the study of ecology or of agriculture or soils when I read this I had a hard time following it which is why I had to go back and do a lot of background research before digging into it again. It's really not light reading and clearly wasn't meant to be so, but has enough information in it to satisfy a curious mind!"},{"Title":"Amazonian Dark Earths: Origin, Properties, Management","review":"Since the prior reviewers noted that this is a collection of papers presented at the Terra Pret Symposiums--I might recommend you Google Terra Preta and download the simple Powerpoint that exists online.

Save your money!"},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This book definately needed to be written to correct that horrible piece of [...] that aired on Fox network. Blame Matthew Jacobs, Peter V. Ware, Philip David Segal, Alex Beaton, and Jo Wright (for the BBC)on this, thank god Terrance Dicks straighten all out! Hell this would of made a better movie than what Fox did! But hey! There's a new Doctor Who and things are getting better with time...lords!"},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"As a long time fan of Doctor Who, it is with great sorrow that all I can say is what a load of rubbish. The concept of the book is great, Doctor number 8 seeks out his former selves so that he can regain his memories after losing them due to a trap set up by long time foe the Master. As he meets his former selves, Doctor number 8 joins them in adventures while regaining his memories. Unfortunately, to make the new Doctor come across well, the author makes the other Doctors out to be complete losers. For example, a very out of character Doctor #3 threatens to kill his future self if he won't free him from his imprisonment on Earth, the egomaniacal actions of Doctor #4 directly lead to the death of a child, and Doctor #7 just sit around contemplating suicide. The only reason this book pulls in a star at all, is due to the fact that we see the new Doctor go out of his way to stop a small time drug dealer. It was nice to see that the new Doctor will stand up to any wrong doing no matter how great or how small. It's too bad the editor of this book didn't do the same when this manuscript was presented to him."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I really wanted to read this book because of the concept, but it is out of print and there is no way in HELL I'm going to pay over $40 (Used!) for anything written by Terrence Dicks. His stories are like reading Cliffs Notes. If you don't believe me pick up the old paperback of \\"The Five Doctors\\". It's alot like reading a TV Guide (or Radio Times) blurb of the episode."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Remember when Terrance Dicks wrote wonderful stories for the BBC television series &quot;Dr Who&quot;. Good!!! Don't spoil that memory by reading this piece of rubblish. The characters that we fans love so much are depicted with all the depth of a thimble. The meaty descriptions of alien beings and worlds are given just enough substance to fill the bottom of an ash tray, while still not touching the sides. The only justification for this novel, would have to be if poor Terrance was heavily medicated, after a series of severe blows to the head, during the time that he was writing this. Hopefully his prozac perscription will run out before he puts pen to paper again. I know that you will more than likely buy this book too, just based on the fact that it is a multi-Doctor story...but you have been warned."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This book was a great read, I couldn't have been more pleased with such a tribute to the re-revival (that's right, 2 re's-counting Virgin's range) of New Adventures of the legendary programme, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Using Terrance Dicks as the pilot author was a wise choice, due to his relationship to the series in both TV and book form.Although the title clearly bears &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;, the eight incarnations don't join forces together. Don't treat this as a let down; it's interesting to see the 8th Doctor meeting (and coping with!) each of his past selves, one life at a time. I won't tell you why he does this, even though his reasons are clearly explained on the back cover.Despite the luxury of new aged themes, there is a massive intake of information, that I had no trouble dealing with. But the new Whovian wouldn't be able to keep up with elements from every era of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. So I've considered several original titles available on BBC Home Video that you may want to view before taking on &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;: (I'm not trying to make this into a Spoiler!!)&quot;An Unearthly Child&quot; (1963)w/ William Hartnell&quot;The War Games&quot; (1969)w/ Patrick Troughton&quot;The Daemons&quot; (1971)w/ Jon Pertwee&quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972)w/ Jon Pertwee&quot;E-Space Trilogy&quot; (1980)w/ Tom Baker&quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983)w/ Peter Davison&quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; (1986)w/ Colin BakerLastly, I recommend getting a hold of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Telefilm from 1996 (w/ the 8th Doctor, Paul McGann), even though its not on video in America. After watching all this, reading &quot;Eight Doctors&quot; is a great way to get nostalgic and revive old memories all at the same time."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I have read many bad reviews of this book. And given that I couldn't put it down, I feel compelled to share a positive review.First off, I believe a person has unreasonable expectations if they expect a book titled &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot; to have a single, cohesive story where all eight Doctors have something interesting to do. It's difficult, if not impossible, to achieve such a tight-knit story with so many main characters vying for attention. I'm glad that Dicks chose to make the story more of a retrospective, visiting one Past Doctor at a time, and I wasn't expecting the storyline to be any stronger in its cohesion than the &quot;Key to Time&quot; storyline.I enjoyed how the book answered so many unanswered questions, such as: What was the deal with the multiple TARDISes taking off at the end of &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;? Why was the Trial of a Timelord not held on Gallifrey? How did the Master gain all the new abilities that he demonstrated in the Television Movie?I also enjoyed many of the events shown in this book that were previously behind the scenes. Okay, the Fourth and Fifth Doctor bits weren't the most exciting choices I could imagine. (I would have preferred to see bits explaining why Romana chose to regenerate in &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; or why the Doctor left Tegan at Heathrow in &quot;Timeflight&quot;.) But I didn't think they were bad.Finally, I liked the scenes with Sam. I can't defend this beyond personal preference, but I did enjoy them.So, I imagine that the purists who want all eight Doctors joining together to vanquish some &quot;ultimate evil&quot; will be disappointed. Those of us who are content with a retrospective will probably be more likely to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I appreciated how the Doctor in this story came back to visit his former selves at key moments in his personal development. It allows the series to harken back to past triumphs while looking forward to future glory. I hope the character of Sam is further developed, but I'm very happy with the product I have in my hands, and hope to see more of these characters in the future."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"A very good read. It's simple and easy to follow. A trap set by the master gives the Doctor a bit of amnesia. He must go find his other selves to regain his memory and history. I personally liked the explaination on how the master was able to do what he did in the movie, as well as the meeting with the 7th and 8th doctor (although the meetings with his 1st and 4th selves were very well written too). This is a good starting point for anyone just starting the world of Doctor Who and nice stroll down memory lane for us long time fans."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I'd read a lot of reviews dismissing this as a poorly written book that spends all of it's time talking about the previous incarnations of The Doctor. I couldn't disagree more. Terrance Dicks brings his vast knowledge of the history of Who into this story and does a fantastic job of connecting the various Doctor personalities to the Eighth Doctor.Having lost his memories due to a booby trap left behind by the Master, The Eighth Doctor must go on a quest through time and space to meet with his previous selves and telepathically regain his past. Meanwhile, forces in the Gallifreyan High Council are at odds with how to deal with the possible paradoxes created by the Doctor's actions. This story also introduces teenager Sam Jones, the new companion.The only time I had a problem with this book was the Third Doctor meeting. It did seem to take too much space building up where in continuity this meeting was going to take place, however, despite this one slow spot I found this book a great read."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Following on the release of the 1996 TV movie with Paul McGann as the eight Doctor, BBC Books decided to launch a new book series featuring the adventures of the Eighth Doctor. To start if off they brought Long-time Who script editor and writer Terrance Dicks. What Dicks produced is an enjoyable trip through the best moments of the original series.Dicks was script editor of the series during the Jon Pertwee years and was the writer of most of the novelizations published by Target books during the 1970's and 1980's so he was a good choice to start off the adventures of the (then) new Doctor. How better to do that then have the new Doctor go back and meet his past selves?But instead of having it done along the lines of his own story The Five Doctors, Dicks chooses to do a direct continuation of the TV movie. While that idea is a good one, the downside of it is that Dicks does tend to spend a lot of time on some Doctors (especially three and six) while devoting as few pages as possible to others (the seventh is really short changed). It's a good idea with a mixed result.The charm of this novel is that it makes good use of the continuity of the series...for the most part. Dicks uses the concept of the Doctor visiting his past selves to fill in the occasional gap in the series like how the Master escaped after The Sea Devils or the downfall of the government on Gallifrey mentioned in The Trial of a Time Lord. There is also some good use of Sontarans, the Master, and even the return of his own Reston Fighting Robot. That said Dicks also creates a few continuity problems such as setting the seventh Doctor down on Metebelis Three. After doing so well with the continuity of the other Doctors, Dicks goes and messes up big time. I don't mean to sound like a raving fan boy but this was more for the third Doctor not the seventh. Its Dicks one bad use of continuity (if one can call it that) and like the novel's concept proves to be a good idea with a mixed result.Another big problem of the novel is that the addition of introducing a new companion. Samantha Jones, who would go on to become a companion of the eighth Doctor, is given a rather poor introduction in The Eight Doctors. It's not that the character was badly written, but the fact that the introduction seems a bit forced and awkward in the midst of a trip down memory lane (or is Totters Lane?) which doesn't help the novel out at all.While it does have its problems, The Eight Doctors is far from the worse Doctor Who novel. In fact it's one of the better ones I've read. Dicks' novel is not a piece of literature (far from it in fact) it is fast paced, fills in a few plot holes from the series (along with creating a few), and is above all enjoyable. And that's what Doctor Who is first and foremost: enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Just recently, with seeing the new 9th Doctor episodes, I've begun to reread the 8th Doctor's books, starting with this one. That is because this is the logical choice because it is the second and also the first BBC 8th Doctor adventure. I say second and first because there is also a novel of the Paul McGann movie, which is a novel I am thankful to own. I've always enjoyed the Doctor, getting in and out of the \\"interest\\" as time wore on, and I have to say I really loved the Paul McGann movie (and I am now a big fan of the Big Finish 8th Doc. CD dramas). This Doctor, the 8th, has his own personality, yes, but you can also see the shadows of his former selves. The 8th Doctor is a man of action, much like the 3rd, the 8th Doctor is a man of mystery, much like the 7th. If you really want a book that creates a connection between the movie and what went on next in the 8th Doctor's life, this is really where you start...yes it has a bit about Sam, but the main interest was a \\"review\\" a reexamination at what makes the 8th Doctor unique while at the same time bridging the past for new fans who came to the Doctor after the movie.The only problems I have are problems on my part. For one, I wish that this book had a better connection between it and the last two Virgin Doctor Who novels (Lungbarrow and the Dying Days), that's just me, so I wont bring the book down a star because of this. It would have been nice to have a clear \\"from there to here\\" feel for this first novel in the BBC's lineup of the 8th Doctor novels. Secondly, I really really wish they would bring the movie to this side of the world, instead of it only being in Reg. 2 DVD. I really wish that I could have the DVD in my Doc. Who DVD collection. Smaller problems are also just my opinion, some of the books have cursing the Lord's name and some of the books seem to have a humanistic \\"preaching\\" about them. I would also be interested in the idea that Big Finish would connect their stories in some kind of \\"time frame\\" that bonds the audio series with this first book in the 8th Doctor series. Again, these problems are on my part, they're just how I feel and think."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"After a lot of negative feedback I was thinking that this book was going to be bad. But as it's DR WHO I knew I had to read it and must say that i enjoyed it. The idea of the TARDIS taking the now amnesiatic (that a word?) Doctor to meet his other selves was pretty cool. His meetings with the 1st, 3rd and 4th Docs impressing me the most. It got a bit confusing when meeting his 6th self and trying to tie up continuity within this period (which is virtually a nightmare to do) and downright disappointing with his 7th Doc meeting. There's also the introduction of new companion, Sam. Obviously, Terrances purpose was to introduce her but not to develop her character that much. This wouldn't be labled as a 'thinker' or 'groundbreaking' novel like some of the others, but for a no-brainer read, tis good."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I wish to amend my review of last October. When I wrote it I hadn't read any other Doctor Who novels and had only recently reawakened my interest in the setting. On a second read after re-acquainting myself with the backstory, I find this novel sorely lacking. It's disproportionately uneven -- Terrence Dicks obviously is more interested in the third, fourth, and sixth Doctors than any others, and the treatment of the seventh Doctor is badly deficient -- and little is revealed, either about the eighth Doctor or about his companion, Sam, who seems a stock character pulled out of a hat. Later eighth Doctor books have been alternately good and bad, at least as far as I've read, and both characters have been fleshed out, but as an introduction to the characters, this one proves a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This should more properly be called &quot;Eight Doctors, One at a Time&quot; because unlike the televised episodes with the titles &quot;The N Doctors,&quot; the Eighth Doctor spends the book visiting one incarnation at a time in order. I advise anyone trying to start the BBC line of Who books to begin with &quot;Vampire Science.&quot; &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot; is supposed to introduce the companion Sam, but she doesn't do anything related to the story until the very end where she jumps into the TARDIS (of which her casual acceptance is a bit strange to say the least). You get a much better picture of Sam's character in &quot;Vampire Science.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This fast-paced novel is a nice way to tie the 8th Doctor in with the rest of his regenerations.

It started out a little like the latest movie, but immediately got very interesting."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"All the reviews I've seen of this book have been negative, except for the ones here at Amazon.com. I suspect that this means that the average &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan enjoys this type of story, as I do. I also think that the people who gave the book negative reviews elsewhere on the Internet had become so used to the complexity and depth of the novels from Virgin that they found it hard to accept that there was another possible way of writing original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. I found the book vastly enjoyable, although it does have some flaws. It is true, as others have pointed out, that the various segments of the book are not very strongly connected to each other, and Dicks misses some obvious opportunities to remedy this--for example, why couldn't one of the policemen who stopped the Master's hijacked car when he was on his way to Devil's End in the Third Doctor segment have been one of the ones involved in the Eighth Doctor's arrest and interrogation--15 or 25 years later in real time, but earlier in the book? There are also annoying continuity problems--not only with Virgin's novels, but with the television series. I noticed a couple of these that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere else: for instance, the Fifth Doctor refers to Turlough's coin as being from Trion, when I don't think the Doctor knew Turlough was from Trion until his departure story, &quot;Planet of Fire.&quot; Characterization also leaves something to be desired: Dicks can't make the Seventh Doctor sound like himself except by having him repeat a line from one of his televised stories. Worst of all, though, is the scene where the Third Doctor threatens to kill his Eighth self to gain his properly-functioning TARDIS, his own having been disabled by the Time Lords when they exiled him to Earth. While this passage is well-written to a certain extent, it fails to convince the reader that the Third Doctor could ever consider doing something so evil. I also disliked the passages introducing Sam, the new companion; the first two chapters, which featured her, bored me to tears, while the concluding passage in which she joins the Doctor in the TARDIS is so weird that it's easy to see why some of the series' subsequent novelists have suggested that the Doctor was somehow coerced into taking her on board. Nevertheless, any &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan should enjoy this book overall, filled as it is with surprises, humor, suspense, familiar faces and new and fascinating information about the Doctor and his universe."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The Eight Doctors was a great novel for the Eighth Doctor to begin with. It brought back a lot of old characters and story lines and made the reader feel that the new Doctor is part and parcel of the Doctor Who canon."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The Eight Doctors was a cute way of introducing the new Doctor.

Take it, enjoy it, smile with it, move with it. HAVE FUN."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"It is not easy bringing the many voices of a Time Lord, known as THE DOCTOR, together. However, Terrance Dicks is one of the writers in the DOCTOR WHO UNIVERSE that seems up to the task. There are those in DOCTOR WHO FANDOM who feel that multi-DOCTOR stories are trite, and too cute. I believe that if this particular native of Galifrey is to be viewed as a renegade on the run from his own people, then criss-crossing the time-stream and meeting himself seems like a natural occurrence. Dick's story allows one to go into one's own memory matrix and conjure up the prior doctors, while maintaining the EIGHTH's own persona. This is also the first meeting with the EIGHT's newest companion, SAM JONES. It also helps clear up some of the incontinuities of the 1996 tele-film."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"First off, I've got to say this really wasn't as bad as it was made out to be. The drawback is that it could have been a special episode of the original TV series but it never becomes much more. The method with which the Eigth Doctor meets his former selves gives their interactions more depth than previous &quot;reunion&quot; stories. The visits with the first three doctors are the best as they all expeirence some &quot;growth&quot; from their meetings with their future self. Ironically, it is the Doctors whom which the actors are still living and could possibly portray them in a TV special again where the story begins lacking. These encounters vary from simple &quot;team-up adventures&quot; to the re-writing of &quot;what really happened' during the televised &quot;Trial of a Time Lord&quot; story, a story that was already too complex to begin with. Although it was nice to see the plot holes of that TV serial filled, it should have been a book on it's own as this part of the novel doesn't &quot;fit&quot; with the rest. An attempt to fill in readers on what happened to The Master between the final episode of the series and the TV Movie also dosen't fit and seems like an afterthought. The real slight, however, is the Seventh Doctor. This novel ignores the continutity established in previous novels with another publisher. But fortunately, this too is brief and almost a throwaway in the story and can easily be ignored. All in all, THE EIGHT DOCTORS is not bad. Considering we will never get to see anything of it's like on television, it was a nice &quot;fan dream come true&quot; romp. But now that this is out the way, I look forward to the series taking off in new directions and finding it's own voice for this new Doctor for a new era."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This one gets smashed apart quite a bit by many Who fans, but I found it to be a fun read. Don't try too hard to get it to fit in with the past series of books and enjoy it for the nostalgia it is. Sort of like reading a Target novelization of a show that never could be."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This book contradicts itself completely in terms of what it attempts to deliver. Synopsis: The Eighth Doctor, who got short shrift with only one on-screen adventure, visits all his past selves to recover from amnesia, picking up a new (and awesome) companion along the way.The goal seems to have been to introduce Doctor Who for readers who never saw anything outside of the TV movie, aka \\"Doctor Who: The Enemy Within.\\" However, the execution is pure fanfic, and poor quality fanfic, at that. That is to say, rather than providing new Who fans a tour de force of the character's past development, it becomes a long march of \\"What if the Eighth Doctor was in a deleted scene from TV episode X?\\" The answer: the episode concludes as aired with a short conversation or a bit of a side-adventure.Nothing is at stake. There is zero character development. Nothing happens in this novel except at the beginning, and, presumably, the end - the segments where Sam Jones, the new companion, gets introduced. New Whovians will be completely lost by a deluge of glimpses which don't have time to grow on them. Old Whovians will only enjoy the bulk of this book if they crave fluffy past-Doctor worship to the exclusion of all else.I say \\"...and presumably the end\\" because I broke a rule with this book. I refused to finish it. Go read my review of Kursaal to see - I will finish a horrible novel just to give the writer a chance. That rule does not apply to bottom-barrel fanfic. I'm flatly amazed that Terrance Dicks had it within him to write something this unreadable.On the other hand, there's Sam Jones. Sam is a wonderful and unique character in the other Eighth Doctor novels, but here, she's just a human substitute for Susan, with nearly the exact same introduction, in the exact same setting.

Don't worry the original 8 Doctors are involved. In my opinion there are only 8 Doctors -- Paul is the last one. Chronologically, this appears to be set not too long after the 1996 movie. Without giving away too much, the 8th Doctor (Paul McGann) needs to familiarize himself again like in the 1996 movie. The only difference being 8 Doctors are involved this time and it isn't because of his recent regeneration. As Doctor Who fans know some Doctors take longer to get use to their new regeneration than others. It's like as if it's another new beginning for the 8 Doctor. A chance to re-regenerate! The Doctor has been given another chance to live! The first time in the movie and now he has a new chance at things.Terrance Dicks is a great writer, who doesn't have waffle when he writes this book and gets to the point! Great detail, beautifully written. I truly believe Terrance should have won an award for this book -- it's so adventurous, full of detail but yet easy to understand with an added bonus of being so faithful to the original Doctor Who series... If this was how Paul McGann's era was going to be, this would have opened up a new classic era for Doctor Who instead of the new series with David Tennant -- that tragic, politically correct, contemporary one that bears little resemblance to the original..."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"It's funny how the book that I read before this took me two months, while this one took like three hours. Not that it has any bearing on the review, but good to see I didn't really lose my speed. That's comforting. As the 1996 Fox movie of Doctor Who was supposed to come out, featuring the all-new regenerated Eighth Doctor, the BBC took a look at Virgin, who was publishing their New Adventures and said, \\"Hey, we can do this.\\" Thus, they yanked the license back and decided to start their own line of original adventures featuring the Eighth Doctor (a task made easier by the fact that the movie got so-so ratings in America and thus was not picked up for a regular show . . . I've heard the movie wasn't that good so that may be a blessing, since it allowed the series to come back in 2005). This book is the first in that series and for the new fan, frankly, it will probably be an utter nightmare. The plot, as it stands, is the Doctor is hit by a left-behind trap from the Master, which causes him to lose his memory. The only way to get his memory back is to visit each of his seven earlier incarnation and, um, do stuff. And that's pretty much it. After nearly five years of the New Adventures giving us some degree of depth and sophistication, this feels like a step backwards, a very thin TV episode put to paper, where the story becomes just a series of things happening, almost like a checklist. Granted, Dicks was one of the \\"old guard\\", penning many of the Target novelizations that were based on the TV stories and working on the show itself back in the day . . . but he's also written New Adventures as well so this almost feels like a deliberate throwback, a calculated move away from the often dark and gritty New Adventures. Unfortunately, it doesn't exactly work and what we get reads honestly more like fan fiction than anything else. The awesome Eighth Doctor visits each of his incarnations at a certain point in their lives and basically gives them advice, simply because he happens to be awesome. The bits are also random lengths though, lasting only a few pages (the first Doctor) and other times going on for chapters at a time (the Sixth Doctor) without really any rhyme or reason. The Eighth Doctor at this point had only been seen in the movie and by some scant few maybe in the last Virgin novel, so this book really needed to give him a personality . . . but it doesn't happen, he's just there. Dicks gets all the personalities down but there's no magic to the prose or depth to the plotting, it's laid out like a newspaper, interesting in itself but with nothing to really bring you back. There's barely any suspense, by the time you get to the third or fourth Doctor you pretty much know the pattern by then and it's just a matter of flipping pages until you get to the end. Dicks does seem to go out of his way to contradict established continuity, which isn't so terrible since the show itself was often contradictory (as you'd expect with time travellers), but it sure does seem odd that he has both the narration and other characters comment on the Sixth Doctor's (and by extension Colin Baker's) weight . . . I don't remember him being that heavy but it keeps getting pointed out, which just seems petty. The only real saving grace to this is the beginning sequence in nineties London, as the Doctor gets stuck holding a bag of cocaine, and would have been an interesting angle for the whole novel to attempt . . . except he bails soon after to go on his multi-Doctor adventure and we only wrap that plot up at the end, basically just in time for new companion Samantha Jones to literally leap on board. Ms Jones does absolutely nothing to distinguish herself in the first few pages, with some really cringe inducing dialogue, and by some reports she does not get more interesting until much later. It's unfortunate that the BBC stumbled right out of the starting gate on this one, longtime fans will probably be bored as the story breaks no new ground whatsoever, functioning as a nostalgia piece only. And new fans will be utterly confused by the constant references to the show and the multiple Doctors. Not so much a mess as a misfire, I've heard that the BBC range did improve in quality. Whether it was to the high benchmark set by the best of the New Adventures, alas, only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"For the first story that is for the new 8th Doctor it could have been better, but it was a very easy read.

So far I've read up to Placebo Effect."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Terrance Dick's familarity with the Jon Pertwee's Doctor and Tom Baker's Doctor made their apperances in the book gems. The small cameos for the first, second and seventh Doctors dissapointed me. The sixth Doctor, Colin Baker's, relied too heavily on over-the-top slapstick violence and jokes about that Doctor's weight. The story tends to get bogged down in Gallifriean politics. That distracts from the interaction between the Doctors. On the whole, the scene involving the fourth Doctor was uncessarily violent. Still, Dicks pulls of the Doctors' reuinon of all time. A reader can almost hear the voices of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and the lot calling from Saturday evenings past."},{"Title":"The Eight Doctors (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The characters in the story eight doctors are fleshed out very well or very badly. The Doctor is not written very well and the reader will find that his character is not even mature. The reader can see this when he drinks in the Shobogan tavern and when he pleads to Rassilon to release Borusa from imprisonment. Sam Jones is hardly heard from in the story but the side story with her and the drug dealers at school defines what she believes but the reader does not find out what her character is really like until Vampire Science. The Agency is severly underutilized in the story and Terrence Dicks could have written a better storyline regarding them. The link between the Agency and the Doctor's trial was very poorly written. The viewpoint of Eight Doctors is effective especially when the Doctor talks to his previous selves. The Eight Doctors structure does support most of the story. The only part in the story where it failed was when the Doctor left Gallifrey and met his 7th self. The reader will find that this causes a disruption in an otherwise fluid structure. There was enough tension in the beginning of the Eight Doctors to keep the story moving but that tension ended when the Doctor came into contact with his 7th self. From that point onward the tension is hardly existant and can quickly bore the reader. The settings throughout the story were very descriptive, especially Gallifrey. There is no one setting in this story that is permanent but the constant change of scenery and time does add to the Eight Doctors' tension and vivid description. There is no particular theme to Eight Doctors except that he was and is a man in a constant state of change. The style and tone of Eight Doctors is effective and does keep the reader's attention. It is only towards the end that it fails to keep the reader involved. The beginning of the story was very subtle but it does attract the reader's attention even though it is not violent or vulgar. Eight Doctors did have a perfect balance of character dialogue and narration. The Eight Doctors was too dramatic when the Doctor pleaded with Rassilon to let Borusa go and when he was in the police headquarters being questioned. The weak characterization of the Doctor does attribute to the story's poor ending."},{"Title":"Love-Lies-Bleeding: A Play","review":"Having limned \\"the force of history,\\" DeLillo has since turned around and gone in the other direction, into \\"the small anonymous corners of human experience,\\" as he phrased it, with works like The Body Artist and, to some extent, Valparaiso and Cosmopolis.Lies-Lies-Bleeding continues this trend. Consisting of brief, spare scenes, clipped sentences, and unnerving silences, the play focuses on three characters as they deliberate over and eventually carry out the mercy killing of a stroke victim trapped in a persistent vegitative state. Though the characters debate the decision extensively and even fiercely, DeLillo doesn't make the mistake having them just reiterate the arguments of pundits and philosophers. It is the play's genius to push through the cheap, politicized controversy towards the immediacy of the dilemma faced by these characters and the death-haunted atmosphere that pervades their lives.The individual who is the subject of the decision, Alex, appears in three flashbacks, once in robust health and twice while his body is failing, just before the stroke. These appearances, though brief, flare poignantly like the last glimpse of a setting sun.There is also one scene where Alex's widow, Lia, speaks at his memorial service. Her words summarize the themes, mood, and style of the play quite well, and are worth quoting at length:\\"I know people tell stories at these gatherings. I don't want to do that. People tell stories, exchange stories. I don't know any stories. You know things about him that I never knew. This means nothing to me. There are no stories. You're here for the wrong reason. If you're here to honor his memory, it's not his memory, it's your memory, and it's false. There are no stories. There are other things, hard to express, so deep and true that I can't share them, and don't want to. In the end it's not what kind of man he was but simply that he's gone. The stark fact. The thing that turns us into children, alone under the sky. When it stops being unbearable, it becomes something worse. It becomes that air we breathe.\\""},{"Title":"Love-Lies-Bleeding: A Play","review":"Love-Lies-Bleeding is the third play written by novelist Don DeLillo. This drama has Alex, an old man who after several strokes is in a persistent vegetative state, being cared for by his current wife Lia, a previous wife Toinette and his son Sean. Except in flashbacks Alex is silent throughout the play, but the wives and the son discussing his life and arguing about him and themselves. This is a play about the end of a life and the decisions family has to make regarding it.The blurb on the back cover of the book concludes with this description:\\"Luminous, spare, unnervingly comic and always deeply moving, Love-Lies Bleeding explores a number of perilous questions about the value of life and how we measure it.\\"This is a very fine description that gets to the heart of what this play is about, but the key word here is \\"spare\\". Spare writing is a trademark of Don DeLillo and he leaves a lot unsaid in the gaps between words. Another trademark of DeLillo's spare writing is this bit of dialogue: \\"The memory ends here. I draw a total blank. This is the subway. He's reading the sports pages.\\" So many times in DeLillo's writing he will give the reader lines of dialogue which no person would say in life but the dialogue fits in the context of the story he is telling. In Love-Lies-Bleeding the characters are speaking, but they are saying less than usual. The format of a play does not allow DeLillo to truly focus his writing because all of the motion is from the words of the characters rather than description and described action and here DeLillo is less successful. There are questions about the value of life, but I am not sure Don DeLillo addresses those questions.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Love-Lies-Bleeding: A Play","review":"Love-Lies-Bleeding seems like a continuation, or alternate telling of the novel The Body Artist. A (much) younger woman marries an older man who has had a long, eventful life before her, and now he's dying (or in The Body Artist, he's dead) and she sits and thinks and talks and nothing much happens.While DeLillo is clearly a talented writer, I think that his talents don't transfer to novels, and definitely not to plays, as well as other reviewers seem to think they do. Maybe he should write some poems, or some philosophical ponderings. This is the third work of DeLillo's that I've read, and what I've noticed is that there is always a point in the story when you get to a monologue by one character that really captures the meaning of the whole story. I just wish DeLillo would write a bunch of those and put them out together, instead of writing an extra 100 pages to wrap around these little gems.In Love-Lies-Bleeding, an old man (70s) is in a vegetative state after a stroke. His present wife (30s), ex-wife (50s), and son (30s) are all gathered to take care of him and contemplate euthanasia. I simply can't imagine this show actually being performed on a stage and not boring audiences to... well, death. Besides the lack of a real driving force in the plot, there are three acts, and probably around 15 total scenes, maybe more. Each scene is short and stilted, and while reading you can see that time has passed and maybe gather the meaning of the scene... on stage this seems like it would be far too distracting. And I know I wouldn't want to sit there through wooden deliveries of these stylistic lines.Sometimes artistic creative work is really moving. And sometimes it's just self-indulgent and bland. I feel like this play is closer to the latter. There's a line in here where one of the stroke-victim's ex-wives remarks \\"I'm not sure how it works but men who don't know themselves have a power over others, those who try miserably to understand.\\" I think Don DeLillo has a power over others for the same reason."},{"Title":"On the Origin of Objects","review":"Fascinating!, Riveting!, Exquisite!. But. This is not an easy book. This is not an easy reading. From the first page, B. Smith throws at the reader the whole apparatus of the philosophical jargon. And it does not ease up towards the end. So, if you are not a philosopher but merely a computer scientist you could be lost. The difficulty of the topic (more about it later) is magnified by the writing style: Smith's style does not have a clarity of Gallileo letters. Nor does it have the brilliance and illuminating simplicity of Russell's essays. It is more like a style of someone who is struggling with his topic and with the language. You have an impression that the author is trying to shake the shackles of the language to express some deep thoughts that are intuitively understandable but are impossible to express, that those ideas he is trying to tell us about, are beyond the normal grasp of the language, beyond its expressive powers. And he makes us fully participate in this struggle. So what is the topic of the book? Smith attempts to answer the oldest of questions man/woman dared to ask- the question of what is out there. And while the question for a long time remained mainly of interest to philosophers, with the advent of computers and computer models it entered the mainstream of the human thought. Anyone who has been struggling with the computer (or computerized) representations and computer models of any system or any process (in fact of anything), will appreciate Smith's discourse.Smith's thesis is that there is nothing out there such as a box, a house, a river, a cloud, etc.(examples are a bit simplistic and Smith goes beyond them). What is out there is a &quot; constant flux&quot; and we, through our participation in the flux, by our intentional stance &quot;make things&quot; out of it. We segment the reality into what make sense to us because of our intentions (intention in a larger, than everyday, sense) Thus, every struggle to nail down the models of reality using Yes/No abstract logic, will fail because the One reality has multiple realizations, each of them is true and the key to them (and what is missing in our Yes/No models) is the &quot;participation&quot; or the intentional stance. Smith asks questions that strike at the very heart of our understanding of the world and at the very essence of what we think computers are, do, or can do, and how they do. If you are brave enough to probe the same depths of human experience this book is for you."},{"Title":"On the Origin of Objects","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart, and if you believe that reading is an intellectual investment rather than just a casual pastime you will certainly benefit from this book.Once you get past Smith's academic language you realize that he has a very important message - that all computational systems are based upon a fundamental philosophical foundation, or ontology as he puts it. Every computational system we design and use is based upon our perceptions(subject) of objects - and the objects and models that arise from the subject-object no-man's land. There is no true platonic ideal, but rather a fuzzy metaphysical boundarys and objects that kinda work sometimes.If you are looking for a book that makes you take a big step in your day to day thinking and how you apply it, this is the book"},{"Title":"On the Origin of Objects","review":"The argumentation is uneven, but the good stretches containenough new ideas to make it a good read.

Albert Bell has done that. Instead of fictional sleuths, he uses historical characters, Pliny the Younger and the historian Tacitus, in the first of what promises to be a fine series. Bell combines historical knowledge, witty writing, and a plot with just enough complications and suspects to lead to a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. Pliny and Tacitus have to find out who murdered a man travelling with them while also protecting a beautiful young slave girl who may be the killer's next victim. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"High Country Publishers has won another great author from the larger publishing houses. Albert Bell asked an Internet mystery-discussion board for the name of a publisher for his sixth book, a historical mystery set in the Roman Empire of the first century CE [although the tone of this book begs the more traditional AD]. Bell found HCP's Senior Editor, a Roman history buff, and HCP is bringing out ALL ROADS next year.Bell, an internationally published biblical scholar, writes historical mystery fiction for fun. His present book is more than fun.Our sleuth is the Roman epistolist and administrator Pliny the Younger, backed up by Tacitus the historian, both at the beginnings of their careers, on the road home from their first political posts. For safety, Pliny and Tacitus join a larger group of travelers, who, it turns out, have come together not entirely by coincidence. Cornutus, traveling with a crowd of domestic help, catches our attention immediately by threatening to strike a clumsy slave. Nobody would notice if Chryseis weren't young, beautiful and blonde. When Cornutus is found dead in his bed in a Smyrna inn, with the heart cut out of his chest, everyone's mind goes back to that incident on the road.Bell treats us to a complex confection of intrigue served up with blood-red herrings and social questions, in an authentic ambiance of Roman imperial politics. Modern sensibilities are catered to by young Pliny's doubts about the ethics of public executions and slave ownership--doubts that the historcial Pliny expresses in his oeuvre--set against the fact that in his time, no major culture in the world had yet questioned either institution seriously. For this purpose, Bell includes a pair of Christians among the travellers, a Christian household where Chryseis finds a hiding place, and a mass execution scene in Smyrna's amphitheater.Bell's success with this story comes partly from knowledge of his topic, and partly from storytelling choices and engaging characters."},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"The field of mysteries set in ancient Rome is a bit crowded, with Davis, Saylor, and Roberts, but this new entry deserves to take its place at the head of the line.

While traveling back to Rome in a caravan in 83 AD, they stop overnight in Smyrna. The next morning they discover that a member of the caravan has been brutally murdered. Suspects abound: a gambler who was in debt to the victim, a group of women who may be involved in occult practices, an abused slave, and several others. With no Roman magistrates on the scene, Pliny takes charge of the investigation. He soon realizes that the case is more complicated than at first appears.

He presents Pliny as some sort of modern day \\"touchy-feely\\" metrosexual and this spoils what could have been a good historical mystery. Pliny's attitudes toward slavery, Roman justice and his falling for a slave girl are an excellent example of the worst sort of writing error - giving a first century Roman character a 21th century mentality and ethos. Honest to goodness, by the time I was halfway through the book I expected Pliny to be spouting theories of modern forensic science, DNA testing and possible slavery \\"reparations.\\" This book doesn't even begin to compare favorably with the writings of Davis and Saylor."},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"\\"All Roads Lead to Murder\\" has some interesting story ambitions--the murder of a wealthy traveler in Smyrna to be solved by two prominent figures in Roman history before they achieved their fame. A sub-theme is the contrast of two religions of the period--the cult of Hecate and the growing cult of Christianity, the latter featuring the Apostle Luke.Author Albert Bell develops a plausible, if somewhat convoluted, plot, but is less adept in his portrayal of believable characters. He aims to make the dialogue between his characters snappy repartee, but somehow they don't often come off that way. I suspect that this partly because he has chosen to put his protagonists, Pliny and Tacitus, in their early twenties. They seem to lack both consistent wit and gravitas. The secondary characters are also given less than credible dialogue and personalities as well.I couldn't help but compare this book to Lindsay Davis' excellent Marcus Didius Falco series which takes place in roughly the same time period, but somehow makes murder and humor work well together. In this book, Pliny does not touch the hem of Falco's tunic.A later book in the Pliny series is better, in my judgement, than \\"All Roads...\\".

I thought i'd give this author a chance. I'm sorry i did. There is absolutely no mystery involved; rather, the author uses this as a vehicle for a set-up plot: Pliny the Younger and young Tacitus (The Clueless, or perhaps The Hardy Boys) meet the Christians (Luke and Timothy, no less) and together vanquish the Bad Guys (various pagan Romans). Every single plot point is telegraphed and Pliny and Tacitus behave in ways that have little resemblence to what might have been expected of young men of high Roman birth in the first century. The jokes are lame and much of the book involves Pliny pining for his father's books, thinking beautiful thoughts about the Christians, or having dinner conversations whose only purpose appears to be to delineate differences between Roman and Christian practices.All that having been said,if you are a young Christian, say about 19, and have no knowledge of the period, this could be a valuable starting point for a more serious investigation into the early history of your faith.

The author also has a common but bad habit of endowing his protagonist with the sensibilities and morals of a 21st Century &quot;moral majority&quot; type Republican.All this makes for characters that are stiff as a board and a plot that is an extra."},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"It can be hard, being a fan of Pliny the Younger, who, having left us a collection of dainty and gentlemanly correspondence and an embarrassingly fulsome panegyric of the emperor Trajan, has long considered the lightweight of early second century Latin prose.It is even more difficult for would-be Plinyists in that Pliny himself makes much of his friendship and literary co-equality with Tacitus: next to that hard-nosed and cynical chronicler of imperial Roman history and the decline of the senatorial class, Pliny, with his loving catalogs of his villas and careful cultivation of aristocratic friendships, only looks worse.I spend so much time on this background because it is the best way to understand Albert Bell's rather startling premise for his mystery series: Bell's young Pliny the Younger is actually a brilliant sleuth &agrave; la Sherlock Holmes; his sidekick Tacitus is a rather dim, superstitious, and conventionally loutish exemplar of the Roman upper class, a surprise to anyone who has read even a translation of any part of the historian's works!Bell uses the conceit of \\"lost notebooks\\" of the Elder Pliny (he of the \\"Natural History\\" to give his hero (the Younger Pliny) access to forensic ideas and techniques that would never have occurred to an ancient amateur detective, but he turns backflips in order to present Pliny as older, wiser, more socially prominent, and more advanced in his career than Tacitus (the opposite appears to have been the case, to judge from the (admittedly) scanty evidence of Pliny's own letters).The mystery itself involves murder, missing wills, long-lost heirs, and -- for Bell is by profession a scholar of early Christianity -- encounters with St. Luke and a party of Christians. Here, too, Pliny turns out to be surprisingly interested and accepting of Christian doctrines, when one compares his attitude here to the one expressed in his famous Letter on the Christians. The mystery is not as clever as many, and, while there is a great deal of attention to period details of life and mental habits in many respects, Bell too-often drops out the 1st century when he really wants to make Pliny shine with modern virtue.It is not surprising, then, that one turns to the acknowledgments and finds that Bell is proud to tell us how much his friends compare him to Pliny the Younger! And indeed, this sort of casual, apparently obliviously-naive self-promotion of quite mediocre and unexceptional \\"virtues\\" is precisely the version of Pliny that Bell is fighting against."},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"Not up to par as a mystery but a colorful array of characters. It was a fair read. I never got the flavor or could picture the place in my mind, it had great characters but I think there could have been more about their surroundings so that you could better feel at one with the story,"},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"It's 83 A.D. and Pliny the Younger, with his friend Tacitus, is en route to Rome after a tour of duty in Antioch. While stopping over in Smyrna, a gruesome murder occurs, throwing Pliny into the role of a 1st Century Sherlock Holmes. Before we learn who dunnit, Mr. Bell treats us to a romp through the byways and highways of ancient Smyrna while at the same time painlessly illuminating for us the laws and customs of the 1st Century Roman Empire. He does an excellent job of incorporating historical personages into the plot. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of two well-known individuals from the New Testement and their \\"peculiar\\" beliefs.This is the first of a series featuring the detective exploits of Pliny the Younger. The second, The Blood of Caesar, is equally good and I look forward to more such adventures."},{"Title":"All Roads Lead to Murder: A Case From the Notebooks of Pliny the Younger","review":"Who doesn't love a great mystery? I know that I do. The reason I love this book is that it is suspenseful and gripping. I was immediately drawn into the plot and the details that the author describes in the book. Not only is it a great mystery but it provides Roman history for its reader as well. It gives us a look into the Roman citizen and his life."},{"Title":"Spend Well, Live Rich (previously published as 7 Money Mantras for a Richer Life): How to Get What You Want with the Money You Have","review":"...the author is just reminding you of things we like to \\"forget\\" -- credit cards are bad, being in debt is bad, shopping when you're upset is bad, and more. Yes, Ms. Singletary does offer some basic financial advice and explains some of the more complex money-management ideas in easy-to-understand terms. But mostly, she just seems to be yelling at the reader and repeats herself a lot. I don't need a book to tell me not to co-sign a loan for my unemployed alcoholic cousin, for example. The author does provide a good analysis of America's conspicuous consumerism and the downward spiral of never-ending debt on unnecessary goods and services that should be of great concern to many of us. Some of her mantras absolutely should be taken to heart by the millions of Americans who mindlessly flood the malls every weekend in search of yet another pair of shoes they don't need, another DVD they'll never watch, or another toy to placate the child they didn't spend time with all week -- her call to return to a simpler way of life, and living within one's means, is to be heeded. That being said, however, it is obvious that the author and her family enjoy a high standard of living (although, to her credit, she does not appear to indulge her childrens' every whim or spoil herself with luxury -- but they are comfortable and not in any danger of having their electricity turned off) and some of her suggestions to those trying to dig their way out of debt come off as glib and facile. Ms. Singletary grew up poor and has been taken advantage of by thankless relatives and she does profess a lot of good common sense that may be difficult for some people to hear (and more difficult to practice), but some of her reactions to spending money on fairly modest purchases border on panic. She does admit her own tendencies to go overboard (penny-wise and pound-foolish), but her tone is often scolding. Although the book certainly does not offer any concrete solutions or formula for earning more, saving more, paying off debt, etc., it is easy to read and may be a good first step for someone trying to improve their financial situation. It is probably actually a better preventative than a cure -- I think kids beginning college, or getting their first jobs should read this book in order to avoid all the common money mistakes in the first place. It's just as difficult to talk to kids about money than it is about sex; maybe using this book as a cautionary tale would make it easier for families to be honest about money and save everyone a lot of worry and trouble in the end. I don't think this book is worth the price, though. If you can borrow it from a friend, find it used, or get it at the library, it's worth a read, but it is not something you'll refer back to over and over again."},{"Title":"Spend Well, Live Rich (previously published as 7 Money Mantras for a Richer Life): How to Get What You Want with the Money You Have","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased it for all the young people in my family.

Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"I came to this book knowing very little beyond the sentimental inspirational \\"Story Behind the Hymns\\" profiles provided by the religious press. You will go away understanding her world and understand how influential she was in that world. The book places Fanny Crosby in the context of her age, when American Protestantism was at the peak of its influence on society. It explains how she fit into society, she was either related to--or knew--most of the people who held social or political power in the Northeast during the 19th century. This was before Church life had become marginalized from American Life.One would expect to discover about Crosby's hymns and the growth of Evangelicalism. But one will also learn about the education of the blind, social work, the growth of the Music Publishing industry and the development of copyright law! You will also discover that--yes she was related to Bing Crosby and had a close relative who became a Mormon!If you read this book, you will receive a great exposure to a wide scope of American life and how one women experienced it with everything but her eyes! A producer at PBS's \\"The American Experience\\" could very well use this book as a keystone to developing a wonderful documentary."},{"Title":"Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J. Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"People in the latter nineteenth century and early twentieth century(and those today who know of her) considered Fanny Crosby to have been one of the greatest persons who ever lived. They very well may have been right. This tiny (4'9\\") woman, blinded shortly after birth, wrote over 10,000 gospel hymns, many of which survive today, such as, 'Near the Cross', 'Blessed Assurance', 'To God be the Glory' and others(see the Cyber Hymnal for a partial listing). Having lived her life in poverty for the most part, she wrote her timeless hymns for the masses to enjoy. Fanny knew and conversed with the greats of her era: Presidents Lincoln, Van Buren, Polk, and Cleveland; Gen. Winfield Scott, Henry Clay, Dwight L. Moody, Ira Sankey, Eliza Edmunds Hewitt, Horace Greeley, and many others. She had a troubled marriage, where she and her legally-blind spouse were separated for many years. She was truly the servant of all, and was sought out by the high and low for counsel and prayer. Active for many years on New York City's rescue mission circuit, she was a speaker for whom crowds would line up around a city block and wait for hours to hear. An active member of the International Order of The King's Daughters and Sons, she also aided the city of Bridgeport(CT)with their missions on skid row. I would urge anyone to read this wonderful biography of a chosen soul who taught the world many lessons, chiefest among them that, no matter one's disability in life, one can truly excel. Get yourself a copy of this book and enter a more gentle, humble, and pious age where the things of God were held in major importance by persons in all stations of life."},{"Title":"Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J. Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"This book represents the best kind of scholarship. Edith Blumhofer, with whom I was fortunate enough of study reformation history at Wheaton College, is an amazing historian and scholar. Her work is exhaustive but not suffocating.While other accounts of Crosby's life are trite and a bit sappy, Blumhofer paints a more realistic portrait of this irresistible subject, with all her imperfections and eccentricities. The result is one of the very best biographies I have ever read.If you're looking for shallow, feel-good Christian writing, this book is not for you. If you're looking for incredible, thorough scholarship, historical accuracy and writing with heart, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J. Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"Edith Blumhofer has written an extensive biography of Fanny Crosby, the beloved blind poet and lyricist of some of the most popular evangelical hymns. She presents Crosby in historical context, and so much context that we get very little of Fanny's life. This is not the biographer's fault. There has been very little material about Fanny's personal life, in spite of her own autobiography. She is firmly placed in her times, and while I'd like to know more about Crosby herself, we're given all that is available. For lovers of hymnology and church history, this is an essential bio."},{"Title":"Her Heart Can See: The Life and Hymns of Fanny J. Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"This book is essential reading for anyone who loves the well-known hymns of Fanny Crosby. The fact that she was blind did not hinder her from using all of her creative powers, especially her insight, to write verse that is ageless.

Crosby (Library of Religious Biography)","review":"I purchased this book as a teaching tool for my music classes this year. So far, I'm over half way through the book, it is more of a history of New York and early America than a story of Fanny Crosby. Instead of learning about her, I'm reading about how the Irish and the catholics didn't get along and other political problems of the day. it's ok to put the person in the setting, but the setting is the focus. The writer even questions the character of Crosby by always being skeptical of her positive outlook on life. Although, she always has to come back and say that everything she wrote did point to that fact. I've been very unimpressed."},{"Title":"Becoming a Graphic Designer: A Guide to Careers in Design, 2nd Edition","review":"Everyday, more and more university students are choosing some area of design as a career field. This guidebook is divided into four major information sections: Design Specialties, Design Businesses, Design Options and Design Education, followed by a Resource Guide, which consists of the names and addresses of design-related organizations and publications. Interwoven with these sections are portions of interviews with about 90 design professionals on such subjects as How I Became a Graphic Designer; Advice to Designers; On Personal Style; Major Influences; and The Future of Graphic Design. Other informative features include How Many Graphic Designers Are There? What Do They Earn? and The Optimum Portfolio. For the curious but uninformed, this is very likely the best introduction available. (Copyright by Roy R.

But the thing that jumps out and slaps me in the face, right off, maybe because I have dealt with new design students and new professionals for the past several years, is a few dumb comments such as \\"If you are going to be a good designer, fine. If you aren't don't bother. The field is full of mediocre talents as it is.\\"And how, pray tell, does one know whether one is going to \\"be good\\" during the first year of ones study? --Or even during the first few years of ones professional practice, when sweeping out the place may be included in your job description, and hands-on real world work may come your way slowly and in small discreet bits? And doesn't every creative person at one point or another question the worth and validity of what he or she is doing, EVEN after recognition has started rolling in and they understand that their work is generally perceived by their peers as good? Further, I would ask whether everyone HAS to be a Saul Bass or a Neville Brody. Isn't design a broad enough field to encompass the work of those with less Olympian ambition? Comments such as the one above are relatively few and far between, to be certain. But where on earth was the editor when pompous uninsightful stuff like this flew in under the radar? Although the sheer snideness of the comment may make many jaded pros cheer, I have to wonder what useable information this kind of comment contains for the neophyte at whom the book is supposedly aimed? --To show that a lot of jaded pros have a really bad attitude?I do not favor the Pollyanna view whether we are talking art or careers. But I believe it is impossible to know how you will fare at something before you have been doing it a while. Thinking otherwise --for example, that a teacher in a design 101 class can tell you whether you are \\"any good\\" (and I have seen or heard about many students asking this very question)-- just intimidates and discourages people from being brave enough to give the life that they would see for themselves a try.

The book is divided into different sections on different types of design along with an interview of sorts with a person in that industry. What I found to be most informative was that at the beginning of each section there are recommendations on the types (as well as number) of pieces your portfolio should contain if you are interested in going for a job in that particular part of the industry.

I have taken one graduate quantum chemistry course, and this was more than enough background for understanding this book. This is the only text I know of (I asked my comp chem prof if he knew of any others) that walks through a Hartree Fock calculation step by step using an example. There are some mistakes in the formulas, but they are quite minor. All in all, I would recommend this book to anybody interested in beginning to learn about computational chemistry."},{"Title":"Computational Chemistry: Introduction to the Theory and Applications of Molecular and Quantum Mechanics","review":"Maybe there just isn't any way into the basics of modern computational chemistry.Lewars introduces the easy parts in a clear enough way. Potential energy surfaces make sense. Molecular mechanics has a good, intuitive feel - it's the springs-and-balls model, elaborated to include plane and dihedral angles, representing force fields derived from other sources.After that (i.e., after p. 80), it's quantum mechanics for a few hundred pages. The premise is that the layout of electrons across a molecule determines its chemistry, and that the wave function tells where the electrons will be. Since the wave equations can't be solved exactly for anything with two or more electrons (!), it's actually approximations to quantum. That leads to two levels of opacity: quantum itself, and all the facts that were scraped off in the approximation process. At this point, the chice is binary: become fluent in quantum, or move on. There are a few nuggets to be had for the non-fluent, including some of the techniques for solving these horrendous integrals. Mostly, though, I moved on.After the \\"ab initio\\" quantum mechanical methods, Lewars presents the semi-empirical models. These deal with simplified models of wave functions. Unlike ab initio methods, which stand on almost purely theoretical models, semi-empirical methods are informed by experimental data. They are based on the electron wave functions, as are the ab initio methods, but use approximations calibrated by experimental results. The book's final section presents density functional theory (DFT), another technique for estimating where the electrons will be.This book demands a lot of the reader, more than I came in with or had time to develop. I was able to use it to get a working vocabulary of the major kinds of computations, the general categories of approach to modeling, and a rough idea of the techniques and complexities involved. I need a little more information than that, but not the immediate leap into the deep end presented here.I look forward to a review by someone more knowledgeable. For now, my only real criticism of this book is lack of glossary. Initialisms and acronyms abound.

Fun."},{"Title":"Empress Bianca","review":"Just a note for those considering purchasing this edition: you are not buying the same book as that pulped by its original publisher, Arcadia Books (UK), in 2005 following a suit instituted by Lily Safra against the publisher claiming the book defamed her. There are apparently 17 changes (unspecified) in the text. If you want the original, you must be prepared to pay $600 or more as there are a few volumes still circulating on the used book market (volumes sold prior to the pulp order).Here's the relevant news clip from the NY Post:January 3, 2008 -- LILY Safra will be displeased to learn that \\"Empress Bianca,\\" the roman-a-clef by Lady Colin Campbell, is being published soon in the US. This is the novel Safra's lawyers forced its British publisher to remove from stores and destroy because its protaganist, whose rich husbands keep dying, was too similar to herself. There will be 17 changes in the book, according to lawyer Michael J. Griffith, a friend of Campbell who represented the convicted Ted Maher in connection with the death of Lily's husband, multi-billionaire Edmond Safra. Maher's trial has been termed a \\"fix.\\" Griffith told friends at DaTommaso restaurant that Campbell informed him she'll come to New York soon for a book party thrown by publisher Dynasty Press."},{"Title":"Empress Bianca","review":"I'm surprised this book is not more popular. No. it's not a work of art (the writing is a little wooden and the dialogue is often slightly ridiculous) but it's so much fun. Campbell dishes about the life of a woman who uses her beauty, charm and steely determination to get what she wants in life: money and power. She stops at nothing (divorcing a man she truly loves, murder...) to get it. That the story closely resembles that of a billionaire who managed to get the book censored in England is just another reason to read it."},{"Title":"Empress Bianca","review":"This was a book that held my attention from the very first to the very last page.

It's a scandal! But it's worth to read, thank you Lady Colin!!!"},{"Title":"Empress Bianca","review":"No wonder Lily Safra had this originally pulped!! EVERY page is spell binding.

There's a freshness and gentleness of tone here that might even be cloying were it not for the acerbic, sometimes boisterous, humor which the author uses to leaven his narrative and keep his issues in perspective. Though there is a mystery at the heart of the novel, it's a quiet mystery, more important for the lessons it illuminates than for any thrills it may provide.Damien March, the main character, is an expatriate American living in London and working for the BBC. Although he's had no contact with his uncle Patrick for twenty years, he finds himself the sudden beneficiary of his uncle's estate on Ionia, a fictional island off Cape Cod, an island which resembles Martha's Vineyard of the past. The only catch is that he must not change the interior of the house, which is packed with bric-a-brac. When he decides to spend six months living in the house, he discovers several unpublished stories by his uncle, all concerning Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock Holmes's mysterious brother, who has committed a terrible crime, but for worthy reasons. The parallels Damien sees between Mycroft Holmes's relationship with Sherlock and his uncle Patrick's relationship with Damien's father lead him to investigate the crime and, ultimately, to come to a new understanding of what family means and what its enduring values may be.It is possible that this fictional story reflects either directly or obliquely on the author's own relationship with his author-father, Paul Theroux, his author-uncle Alexander Theroux, his British TV-host-brother Louis, and the relationship of the elder Theroux brothers with each other. While these overlaps will provide tantalizing and fertile grounds for biographers, they are irrelevant to one's enjoyment of this narrative. Marcel Theroux, however, certainly seems to welcome such speculation by setting of this novel off Cape Cod, where Paul Theroux lives, and by his references to Medford, where the elder Theroux authors grew up. The accurate Cape Cod descriptions, the \\"Yankee spirit,\\" and the unpretentious lives so well illustrated by the peripheral characters here add immeasurably to the realism of this delightful study of family values. A captivating novel. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes: A Paper Chase","review":"The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes is charming and funny work in a small package. At just over 200 pages, this one won't take you very long to get through, which is a shame because it's such a lovely ride. Damien March, is a sort of British/American amalgamation, as is his family. When his Uncle Patrick dies, and bequests his home, albeit with many limiting strings attached, to Damien, Damien leaves his London life for life on an island in New England, where Patrick's ramshackle home is. Damien comes to the US and gives us many bemused, amusing observations about American culture, given in an amusing fashion from one who sort of belongs in the US anyway. Damien finds an old manuscript of his uncle's, the Confession of Mycroft Holmes. The novel sends Damien on a journey he had technically begun when he left England, a journey which brings Damien a surprising discovery. It's a lovely story, told in charming fashion. Enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes: A Paper Chase","review":"Nicely written and engaging, this book is well worth reading. Some of the other reviews cover details of plot, so I'll say only that I found it a good read with few shortcomings. But readers who are looking for a Sherlock Holmes story should be warned that this isn't about Mycroft or Sherlock."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes: A Paper Chase","review":"Theroux follows up his gently charming, and well-received debut, A Stranger in the Earth, with another witty and touching slim novel. As in his first book, the story revolves around a man starting a new life in a new place. Here, Damien March is a thirtysomething American who's lived most of his life in England and now works as a nightshift drone for the BBC. His Uncle Patrick, a prize-winning author turned odd recluse, stuns the family by leaving his New England home and its content to Damien, whom he hasn't seen since he was a child. The home sits on the fictional island of Ionia, a kind of Martha's Vineyardish place off of Cape Cod. The bequest is conditional on Damien living in the house, and so he makes the momentous decision to leave his dead-end life in London and head to America to live in the house for the summer.As he gets accustomed to island life, his deaf neighbors, and living in a house filled with random bric-a-brac, he also muses on his upbringing, his family history, and the meaning of family in general. Mostly he ponders the question of who his uncle was and why his writings grew increasingly bizarre, why he sequestered himself on the island, and why Damien's father and Uncle Patrick had an odd relationship. These internal musings are interrupted by various odd occurrences, such as the disappearances of some of Uncle Patrick's files, a later burglary, and the general oddities of life on the island. Then, about 2/3 of the way into the book, Damien discovers a manuscript of his uncle's called &quot;The Confession of Mycroft Holmes.&quot; It's a pastiche of sorts, based on Sherlock Holmes's enigmatic elder brother. The story itself is faithfully rendered in faux-Victorian prose, and characters in it appear to parallel some on the island. Damien starts to think there's a connection between the story and his uncle's odd life, and the investigation leads to a surprising (to him, if not to the reader) discovery. The book ends rather disappointingly abruptly after this revelation, but is nonetheless extremely enjoyable. Lightly written in a musing tone, and dolloped with sly wit, Theroux's second book makes the reader anxious for more. In a time when accolades are mainly gathered by sprawlingly undisciplined tomes like The Poisonwood Bible and The Blind Assassin, Theroux's slim work proves that yes, sometimes less is more."},{"Title":"The Confessions of Mycroft Holmes: A Paper Chase","review":"This is the sort of book that is worth reading when you have pockets of time like on the train or bus in the morning or at night when you have a little time to yourself in the tub.

Byrne's new book has moved to the TOP of my list of books I recommend to my students, from a playing perspective (this is not a science book). I don't care who you are, you don't know all the stuff in this book. And if you're at a level where you know a good percentage of what's in this book, you're also at a level where learning even one useful new thing is worth the price of the book. If you've been playing for a while, this book will open your eyes to a lot of new possibilities and understanding. If you're in your first year or two, you might do better by first focusing on fundamentals of form (find a good instructor) and getting a grasp of how balls behave and why (look for Byrne's videos - Volumes 1 & 2).

That meant learning a few new tricks. There's no other author on the game of pocket billiards who knows more tricks than Robert Byrne. If you think you have a good handle on the sport, think again. You are guaranteed to advance your game if you follow the tips in Byrne's book. Now I know why he's in the Billiard Congress Hall of Fame.

I think that it would literally take at least a decade to master everything in this book. Many of the shots are completely impractical except as trick shots, but they're still fun to try and the skills acquired can't hurt your game. I found his safeties and rail-first shots to be the most useful to me so far.This book definitely intended for more experienced players (playing for about 1 year or more).

His \\"Standard book of pool and billiards\\" is outstanding.This book, however, is an advanced book for people who seek to find hidden secrets. Most of the 350 shots illustrated in this book are esoteric and would rarely be encountered in practice. Also, quite a few of these shots are impractical; they can be used when playing/practicing alone to see how the balls behave under weird conditions but cannot be applied in a real game as they are low percentage shots.These are not shots that every player \\"must\\" know. The title is a misnomer.Also a good number of shots illustrated are useful for three cushion and straight pool which are not popular these days.On the whole, this is not a very useful book for beginner/intermediate players seeking to improve their shots and hence their game.It's a terrific book for enthusiasts who would love to discover unusual shots which are rare and low percentage, which obviously precludes their use in a real game.If you're an advanced player with a decade or more of experience under your belt and feel that you have a good grip on a lot of \\"regular\\" shots and want to find out more, this is the book for you.If you're a beginner/intermediate player who is seeking to improve his/her game with a view to notch up more victories, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots: 350 Moves Every Player Should Know","review":"I have been playing pool for twenty years and this book introduced so many concepts that I don't know why I didn't research this book out sooner.

I gave it as a birthday present. It was well received.Unlike \\"Byrne's New Standard Book of Pool and Billiards,\\" which is 50% devoted to 3-cushion billiards, this book is devoted entirely to pool. It's about how to put the ball in the pocket, which ball to shoot, and don't forget not to leave your opponent a shot.Byrne is good at this and explains the difference between what it appears is happening and what the balls are really doing. It is an enjoyable read and a book anyone who enjoys shooting pool should have."},{"Title":"Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots: 350 Moves Every Player Should Know","review":"This is something not only to read again and again, but also to take to the tables and practice some to the set-ups with which you may have previously had trouble.

I'm ranked as a 4 in APA 8-ball and have been playing on a frequent basis for the past 2 years. While this book is good, it seems to be entirely offensive shots. There are many instances where instead of attempting the shot shown in the diagram in the book, it would probably be better to try and play a safe (meaning you make a legal hit, but leave your opponent with a difficult shot afterwards).Most of these shots in the book are difficult to make once, but are incredibly difficult for most of us to make on a consistent basis. If you want to win, you should be playing the percentages and often a defensive shot has a much higher probability of success than these offensive shots.I would've liked this book better if it discussed the alternative shots that could've been taken, and mentioned the pros and cons of those decisions. Without it, it isn't very convincing that the shots shown are the best options.Therefore, I think this book is good for beginners who just want to know some cool shots, or pros who are so accurate and precise that these shots are possible nearly 90% of the time."},{"Title":"Byrne's Complete Book of Pool Shots: 350 Moves Every Player Should Know","review":"My people LOVED them !!

Even a &quot;so-so&quot; fingerplay can result in a fun time with them.The biggest advantage of this book, for me, is the topical organization. I am using the rhymes to accompany themed activities. For example, we were talking about corn today; I looked up &quot;foods&quot; (listed in table of contents) and quickly found a rhyme. We used &quot;Sweet Corn,&quot;(which briefly talks about picking, cooking and eating corn) with props to pretend we were actually cooking corn. Though the rhyme isn't incredible, it was perfect to teach a concept.The contents includes topics such as toys, snack time, Easter, snow, flowers, beach...about 70.You might check this book out at the library first to help determine if it will fit your needs.

Even the few traditional rhymes/plays were &quot;adapted.&quot; It was not illustrated as expected--there were general illustrations in the book, but none demonstrating the hand movements or gestures! In fact, there were frequent notes with the rhymes to &quot;make appropriate hand movements&quot; or words to that effect!Essentially this seems to be a compilation of 'rhymes' submitted to a daycare providers' newsletter by its subscribers. The book was divided into sections as follows: Myself, School, Community, Seasons, Animals, Plants &amp; Foods, Weather, Earth &amp; Sky, Holidays, Special Days, Special People.This book was a huge disappointment and I returned it the day after receiving it.

It provides ample politico-military information, as well as illuminating the reader on other scholarship in the field. However, it does suffer a bit on what I would describe as inferior editing. Basically, I would recommend this book for a serious historian looking for a good entry into American involvement on the ground in WW1. Once you have it and read it, it ought to stay on your bookshelf to help you find and work with other texts. If you are just a buff interested in a little light reading on WW1, go elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Test of Battle: The American Expeditionary Forces in the Meuse-Argonne Campaign","review":"When compared with the American Civil War and World War II, the historical literature dealing with America's role in World War I, is noticeable lacking. Although recent publications have added to the diluted historiography that once consisted primarily of memoirs, this crucial period is a potential gold mine of unwritten scholarship that could shed light on American military policy. In _The Test of Battle: The American Expeditionary Forces in the Meuse Argonne Campaign_, Paul F. Braim evaluates the American performance and combat effectiveness during this, the American Expeditionary Force's (AEF) largest and most significant campaign. Dr. Braim, a veteran of three wars, represents the delicate blending of the academic historian and their brethren in uniform that bring a high level of technical military expertise to the profession. That combination has some drawbacks here, however.The author does not grade the AEF's performance too highly. Among the weaknesses the author mentions are: poor leadership, inadequate training, and inexperience of the American units and command structure. Unpreparedness, a lingering malady of American \\"citizen soldiers\\" is the underlying theme here. Unfortunately, Braim devotes only seventy-five pages to the actual Meuse-Argonne Campaign. In the process, one gets the impression that he is placing the Meuse-Argonne Campaign under a microscope applying all the stored technical knowledge and jargon inherent in a modern day military professional. Braim dissects the Meuse-Argonne as if he were refereeing a recent exercise held at Fort Benning, Georgia. The author incorporates way too much hindsight for my taste. The majority of the book, is nothing more than a diluted political overview and massive military buildup that mirrors the work of other historians. Nearly half of its 245-pages is a series of appendices containing graphs and tables reproduced from an original record titled: \\"Final Reports of Assistant Chief of Staff ... to Commander-in-Chief, American Expeditionary Forces.\\" Most interesting, however, is the table indicating the \\"Responses of 728 Veterans of the Meuse-Argonne Campaign...\\" conducted by the U.S. Army Military History Institute at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania. It is this unique perspective of veterans that adds originality to a study of this type. Generous maps and battlefield photographs taken after the war are faithfully duplicated within these pages. Yet a book cannot be judged by cosmetic make-overs alone. Braim cites poor leadership wracked the Meuse-Argonne Campaign, with particular finger-pointing at Pershing. The author suggests Pershing was afflicted with a myopia which could be called \\"Battlefield Fixation,\\" and compares this preoccupation to the symptoms of Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. Braim has consulted an adequate collection of published and unpublished sources. According to the results of the questionnaire, the veterans agree with Braim concerning inadequate training, due to \\"lack of time.\\" The veterans disagree with Braim, however, on leadership. Of the 503 responses to the 'leadership\\" criterion, 467 veterans thought the leadership in the AEF was \\"good\\" noting that the \\"leaders cared\\" for the American soldier. It is also noteworthy to mention that Braim sent out queries to a group of the most highly respected military historians in the field to ask their views on this topic. They could not rescue Braim's bout with acute bad prose, however. The author's account is, for the most part, fluid, but contains annoying peculiarities. For instance, Braim repeatedly refers to himself throughout the text as \\"this author\\" and sprinkles his prose with contractions and the anachronistic exclamation point. Quoting a well known historian of the period, Braim exclaims, \\"That's the sum of it! This author wishes he'd said that.\\" When confronted with a debate over leadership, Brain once again blurts out: \\"If fired upon on this matter, this author will retreat!\\" This reader had to retreat for some fresh air or get sick. This book had all the makings of a great study. A qualified editor would have made all the difference."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"Some of these bring me back to the stories my grandparents and parents told (and they words and expressions they used to tell them!).

They can write, too."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"There have been gifted, even brilliant American writers of Italian descent going back at least to the Thirties, and there are many working today at the peak of their powers. But we've never been able to look at it all in one glance to appreciate it--until now. Spend an hour with this book and I guarantee you'll find half a dozen pieces and authors you'll love. I can argue with some of the choices and omissions, but these are minor quibbles next to the grandness and greatness of what's here. Where else can you find superstars like Mario Puzo, Don DeLillo, Gay Talese, Camille Paglia and Nick Tosches right alongside talented but lesser-known writers like Raymond DeCapite, Lucia Perillo, Pietro DiDonato? I'm not a big fan of kneejerk Italian \\"pride\\" but this book does (finally) make the case for this part of our culture. Bravo."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"I've got to admit, I'm not proud of my initial reaction to these wonderful selections -- that they seemed &quot;atypical&quot; of what I think of as the Italian-American perspective. But I guess that's the point of the book, and certainly it's part of what great writing does: it divests us of our biases by revealing our common humanity. Bill Tonelli has made an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"This book is not at all definitive. DON'T TELL MAMA from Viking or FROM THE MARGIN from Purdue U Press are better represenations of the top Italian American authors. Authors like Daniela Gioseffi, Ben Morreale, Gioia Timpanelli or Maria Mazziotti belong here more than some who are represented. And, Tonelli, a jerk about the Mafia stereotype and a fan of the horrible defamatory Sopranos ought to be tarred and feathered and ousted from his own community for representing the over glut of Mafia stories perpetuated by a myth that refuses to recognize the most important fact about Italian American culture; There is no more percentage of organized crime among Italian Americans than any other ethnic group. less. than .01 % of Italian Americans are involved in organized crime and there is no big international Mafia cartel of Italians involved in crime. That was a myth perpetuated by certain powers to make a scape goat for syndicated crime. The S &amp; L scandal of white collar crime on Wall St. and the Enron, Anderson debacle are still the greatest crimes of theivery committed in the history of the world. Hollywood and television have deliberately tried to scapegoat Italians to keep the eye off the real international criminals, and Tonelli should know better than to represent this theme at all. He is a fool for falling for this social engineering and it mars his book horribly, along with the fact that he leaves some of the best writers of all out. Other books on this subject have done a better job, and how can the reviewer from BOOK LIST get away with such nonsense, by saying the culture that produced Michaelangelo, which is the mainland Italian culture, did not produce a Shakespeare? Where has that reader been that he hasn't heard of Dante, the predated, rival of Shakespeare and the great world writer of Italian literature and culture--a different matter than Italian American immigrant culture. Tonelli and his misguided reveiwers show their ignorance. though Tonelli does well to include Mario Puzo's THE FORTUNATE PILGRIM mistitled in the first media review above. It is Puzo's best and truest book --much better than The Godfather, according to Puzo and all his literary critics, too. So read it instead while we send Tonelli back to the drawing boards to do a better job of representing his culture. He's an upstart who really doesn't know how to edit a good book on his subject. And his professional reviewers at top make factual mistakes and don't really know the subject well enough to write a true reveiw."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"This book is a feast."},{"Title":"The Italian American Reader: A Collection of Outstanding Stories, Memoirs, Journalism, Essays, and Poetry","review":"Even for non-Italians this book has merit.

Obviously much research has gone into detailing names of key players and the sequence of events. But this book is supposed to be about industrial democracy. While it is stressed that the term &quot;industrial democracy&quot; came to the fore during this period, there is limited coverage of why this is so and the nature of any industrial democracy that may have been established. No where in the book is there a detailed look at how industrial democracy worked in an actual place of work. Many obvious questions are left unanswered. How widespread was any such industrial democracy? How did the typical worker or the media react to the concept? How did shop committees and trade unions interact? Also, it is unclear as to what the author's claims are regarding industrial democracy's lasting effects. He clearly shows that employers dominated the ERP's of post-WWI. The New Deal intervention in labor affairs was clearly not one of instituting democracy. McCartin does indicate that labor relations of the current period seem to have come almost full circle to some form of 19th century thinking. Basically, McCartin's book seems to indicate that &quot;industrial democracy,&quot; whatever that was, was not much more than a blip on the screen of labor history. His book needed to focus far more on just what industrial democracy is and its difficulties and transience in real working peoples lives as well as an institution. The role of the AFL in stifling industrial democracy is given insufficient weight."},{"Title":"Labor's Great War: The Struggle for Industrial Democracy and the Origins of Modern American Labor Relations, 1912-1921","review":"For those who thought FDR was the leading left leaning progressive President with the \\"New Deal\\" social engineers should give pause and think again. Woodrow Wilson, his progressive labor leaning and political appointments were the foundation and building block for organized labors growth during the Great War. It was a war fought on two fronts one overseas with modern weapons of destruction and the other battle here at home over power and autocracy in the workplace. It would seem that political democracy had grown roots in the private industrial environment. Labor peace would come at a price. McCartrin's historical and well documented portrayal of the struggle for \\"industrial democracy\\" between 1912-1921 establishes an understanding about modern labor/management relations well into the twenty-first century. For labor to known where it is heading McCartin describes where organized labor struggles began. McCartin's objective discussion lends itself to a side of history less reported. The author presents the facts truthfully and without elaborate embellishment."},{"Title":"Labor's Great War: The Struggle for Industrial Democracy and the Origins of Modern American Labor Relations, 1912-1921","review":"The author provides great detail about the WWI industrial democracy debate. As a student, I found this book very useful in developing my own work and understanding of that time period's labor movement. Great resource for researchers. Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Labor's Great War: The Struggle for Industrial Democracy and the Origins of Modern American Labor Relations, 1912-1921","review":"This is a wonderful history of labor and &quot;industrial democracy&quot; in the World War I era. Mr. McCartin writes with bold force about the idea of &quot;industrial democracy&quot; and how it helped to shape the American labor movement at a pivital point in this nation's history. Mr. McCartin's illumination of Frank Walsh's role in this interesting period was particularly insightful. In addition to being painstakenly researched, this book was written with a style rare for most history books.

It was second hand when I bought it and it seemed to encapsulate where I was in my life as a vegetarian at the time. This book dispells the myth that vegetarians live on mung beans. It also dispells the myth that they are all unemployed and have enough time to soak beans and prepare things for hours. Vegetarians are people too. This book, to a certain extent, is one for people who are less interested in 'healthy lifestyle' and more interested in not eating dead animals. High cuisine it aint, probably not even a great recipe book (although I still do my own variation on the can-can spaghetti sauce), but if you are not into wholefoods but just don't like eating dead things, this is a book for your shelf. Full of attitude. Ironically, it would seem that the Author has gone into the horoscope business which seems to contradict my assertions. Ahh well.Great read if you can get it.A Fan"},{"Title":"The Mandaeans: Ancient Texts and Modern People (Aar the Religions (Unnumbered).)","review":"While the Mandaeans are something of an arcane topic, and have received less popular attention than other Near Eastern religious traditions, this book is not arcane nor is it unsuitable for a broad audience. Most books on the Mandaeans tend to focus on specific aspects of their culture: their ancient and moribund language, their unique literature and religion, and their numerous connections to some of the Near East's more familiar cultures, such as Zoroastrianism, Gnosticism of a Jewish or Christian persuasion, and Islam. No one would deny that all of these are important parts of the Mandaean tradition, and contribute much to our understanding of the Mandaean community past and present. Jorunn Jacobsen Buckley, on the other hand, has managed to present the Mandaeans in a light that they have thus far eluded: as a modern, living tradition, surviving in a world that has changed greatly from the days of Macuch and Drower, her scholarly predecessors.In this book, Buckley provides a thorough introduction to the texts most important to the Mandaean community. Interspersed within this introduction, alternating chapter per chapter, are vignettes of today's Mandaean communities in America and Iran. Her intent is to reveal how this written tradition is not merely a source for the scholarship of philologists and the historians of religion, but a hallmark of world literature, which forms the basis for a living tradition, and which continues to inform the widespread community that still celebrates it.I would recommend this book for any person interested in the Mandaeans, but I feel that it would especially suit individuals who have spent years studying such traditions, who would benefit greatly from seeing how they are practiced today. This book fills an information vacuum, which might otherwise be occupied by ignorance and misinformation."},{"Title":"Playing Out the String","review":"This book is so funny. Anyone who has been a college student, faculty member, administrator, staff, or maintenance person will get a chuckle - no, many, many chuckles - from this witty account of a senior professor who is accused of shameful behavior among the stacks in the library. He keeps wishing he had been accused of murder instead because it would have been more interesting and less embarrassing. He starts to believe himself guilty, even though he knows he didn't do it, because the accuser \\"has no reason to lie.\\" This Kaskaesque-but-funnier book is a fast and delightful read."},{"Title":"Playing Out the String","review":"The classic mystery novel has indeed run its course throughout the history of literature. Time and time again, readers are presented with the cookie-cutter images of a wrongfully accused protagonist, a sinister and conniving antagonist, a predictable conflict, and redemptive resolution. However, in attempts to prevent the reader from unraveling the mystery after three or four chapters, modern writers seem to elaborate on this age-old equation, in order to throw unexpected curve balls to the reader; keeping them on the edge of their seats and deeply interested until the very last chapter. B.J. Leggett is no exception.B.J. Leggett's Playing Out the String successfully explores the world of academic bureaucracies, complete with the intricate relationships between faculty members, students, and administration of a Southern University. Robert McCabe, a highly esteemed and respected professor of English and film studies is faced with an accusation that could quite possibly ruin his life and career. Obsessed with his innocence, McCabe begins a quest for justice and the truth, constantly testing the strength and validity of his relationships with his wife, colleagues, and ultimately, himself. This trying situation becomes more and more intricate as the novel proceeds, presenting McCabe with endless amounts of red tape and complications, having a drastic impact on his performance as a professor, writer, and husband. Throughout the progression of the text, the novel's main theme seems to focus around man's quest for superiority in life despite the consequences that may occur. Often obsessed with this pursuit, men sometimes fall to the depths of deception and greed in order to gain a leg-up on others who surround them. Playing Out the String contains characters who are constantly on guard against others, in the constant pursuit of superiority and personal gain, behind the faade of truth. As a theme, this pursuit is present throughout the entire course of the novel, as Robert McCabe is forced to put all that he stands for on the line in order to prove his true self worth. Highly intricate and imaginative, the plot of the novel is extremely unique and original. Leggett's use of intricate plot twists provides the reader with an extremely complicated plot to wade through. These hurdles within the plot serve to ultimately maintain the suspense and interest level throughout the novel as a whole. The elaborate plot is extremely unpredictable, constantly changing just as the reader begins to attempt to make any further predictions.Within Playing Out the String, Leggett succeeds in vividly establishing a strong character base. Through vivid character development, the novel's characters are extremely humanistic and complex, straying away from the character stereotypes present in the majority of literary works. Through this characterization, Leggett's characters indeed come alive within the pages, complete with unique idiosyncrasies and details that truly establish each character as an individual. This novel introduces many characters that are extremely likeable in the reader's mind, including Robert McCabe, Charles Redfern, and James Carpenter. In addition, the novel presents other characters that are ultimately sinister, such as Dean Schneider. Still yet, other characters within the novel continue to hang in limbo, balancing between good and bad within the reader's mind. These dynamic characters provide the novel with a sense of realism throughout. Set in and around Knoxville, Tennessee and the campus of Western Appalachian University, the novel's setting greatly advances the storyline throughout. Accurately so, Knoxville is a medium sized city with a small town mentality. Everyone seems to gossip and have a drastic desire to know what scandalous activities are afoot. Similarly, the campus of Western Appalachian seems to harbor the same problem. Gossip runs rampant throughout the student and faculty communities. Sides are chosen within conflicts, based often times on mere hear-say. This setting works hand-in-hand with the character development in providing a realistic tone to the novel, making it ultimately believable. The language scheme within Leggett's work relies mainly on the usage of dialogue between characters. This dialogue establishes the complicated relationships between the characters, thus promoting further character development. Through this dialogue, the characters reveal what aspects and themes are most crucial within the novel as a whole and the corresponding views and feelings that the characters hold in relation to the subjects at hand. In addition, this dialogue makes the novel an extremely quick read, advancing the novel at a brisk pace.As a whole, B. J. Leggett's novel, Playing Out the String, is an extremely entertaining novel, covering a wide range of topics, occurring every day in the world of academia. The vivid characters and intricate plot line establish a story that is quite out of the ordinary. Through McCabe, the reader learns to question one's true inner qualities, cherish every movement as it were one's last, and to always stick to what is known as the truth in life. Playing Out the String is an extremely delightful read and is thus recommended."},{"Title":"Playing Out the String","review":"Playing Out the String is an entertaining mystery by BJ Leggett. The novel focuses on an English professor who is accused of exposing himself in the library at his university. The professor is innocent (or is he?), but university politics and the professor's past conflicts with administrators combine to keep him under a cloud of suspicion. As a university professor, I could appreciate many of the dramas that occurred in this book.There are many things to like about this novel. Leggett's protagonist, McCabe, is well drawn. McCabe is likable, but he is by no means perfect; the uncertainty as to McCabe's \\"true\\" character adds a nice bit of suspense to an already-suspenseful novel. Leggett makes the reader care about McCabe's fate and, by doing so, draws the reader in to the drama.A major theme of Playing Out the String is perception. McCabe challenges his students and colleagues to think about how their individual views of the world shape their reality. Of course, this is connected to the central drama in the book, which is whether the seemingly-respectable McCabe has another side that others have not seen.Another interesting aspect of the book is McCabe's obsession with movies. Throughout the novel, McCabe references quotes and scenes from his favorite movies. This adds to the reader's interest in the novel. (I wonder whether McCabe's name was a reference to the film \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\" and, if so, how that reference is significant).The tiny University of West Alabama Press published Leggett's Playing Out the String. This is a much better mystery than many novels from names at bigger publishers. Readers who like mysteries (and stories about contemporary university life) will enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Kevin is a real expert in the field of Tinnitus which is more than I can say about my own Doctors.

This is one of the handful that actually doesn't beat around the bush with audiological theory or bogus natural remedies.Hogan has put together a remarkable book that anyone can use to reduce the volume of their tinnitus. (He is careful to note that the profoundly deaf are often not as easy to achieve good results with.)I found the information about medications to be an eye opener. I never dreamed there were so many medications that can help someone who suffers with this maddening sound.I also believe what Hogan calls &quot;SPADES&quot; (stress, panic, anxiety, depression, emotional difficulty) play a role in tinnitus generation and resolution.Maybe most compelling was the authors personal story about how he suffered with tinnitus. His very real pain that he experienced. His daily decision about suicide and the final victory which he was told could never happen.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"This revised edition of Tinnitus: Turning the Volume Down is excellent.I was one of Kevin's clients five years ago. I found him by his first book. It helped me enormously. After all those years of suffering I don't anymore!Kevin doesn't have hearing aids to sell or a practice he's looking to fill. Instead he puts everything into this book that can be done in a book...and there is a lot.He explains what medications can help the vast majority of people with tinnitus. (Yes, they do work as I can attest to.)He also exposes in a gentle way the frauds and shams of the tinnitus \\"cures\\" without quite labeling them as frauds. (Save your money and buy this book.)The relationship between stress and emotional problems with tinnitus seems to be quite high. Most of the books I read about tinnitus seem to focus on the ear. Hogan points out that half of all cases of tinnitus are not improved when the 8th nerve is severed. Hogan brings tinnitus relief by showing how to utilize the brain. His strategies including reducing stress, changing lifestyle, hypnosis, medication, psychotherapy, behavioral techniques and surprisingly osteopathy.Hogan's doctorate's is in psychology not otolaryngology and I suspect he means it when he doesn't understand everything there is to know about the human ear. But clearly he understands tinnitus and it's reduction. He helped me and the original edition of this book which was also good was where it all started.Thank you!"},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"If you have tinnitus, or you're a health professional, please read this book!!It is extremely comprehensive. Yet it's very easy to get through - it's written in an easy-to-read style, and is very concise and well organised.Best of all, it describes a range of scientifically proven methods to reduce tinnitus. It is extremely well referenced (and contains over 40 pages of research abstracts at the back, which is useful if you're a health professional).The vast majority of people who have tinnitus and read this book will see that the odds are greatly in their favor!!The book's author had extreme tinnitus, which he reduced to zero. (After doing a massive amount of research!) Very inspiring!Hogan has made a great leap forward because knowledge of tinnitus was really backwards, by being so fragmented. Tinnitus isn't looked after by any one type of health care profession. So no health profession has responsiblity to keep tabs on all tinnitus research, and no one was exposed to all the research - most of which was published in journals for other health professions...Kevin Hogan took on the task of reading all the research that was available, from everywhere! (So as you'd expect, he recommends a multi-modal approach to treating tinnitus - using a range of strategies which just one type of health professional can't give you.)The result of Hogan's research is that people no longer need to accept the following sort of hackneyed, awful advice: \\"Tinnitus is an incurable condition, that one can, with patience, learn to live with.\\" (Which is well-intended, but whoever says this simply isn't up-to-date with scientific research.)The book lists the different causes of tinnitus, the different ways in which it presents itself, and the different effects that experiencing tinnitus has on individuals. It points to the most likely strategies for success depending on individual characteristics.However, it emphasises that all tinnitus is just a perception of sound (not originating from the environment). It tells you how to reduce that sound perception, pretty much regardless of cause. Many people do that to the point where the perception doesn't exist at all - i.e. no tinnitus!This is a landmark book."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"I ordered this book after reading so many excellent reviews! Well, I have suffered with tinnitus for 5 years and I have to say this has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Mr. Hogan gives you some strategies to use and then over and over recommends the reader buy his program for tinnitus reduction. I felt like this was one long sales pitch with some real information thrown in once in awhile to make it seem like it's a useful book. Another thing that drove me crazy was how poorly written the book was. There has to be at least 50 typos, including some very poorly composed sentences. Doesn't this guy have spell check or an editor?One last thing, after I read the book I went in and reread the reviews and it seemed to me that a large percentage of reviewers were either fellow therapists or former students. Maybe he asked them for the glowing reviews to help sell the book. I have wasted my money, I hope you are smart enough to not waste yours."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"As a hearing aid account executive for a major manufacturer, I constantly get asked about tinnitus and what can be done for people who have it. I read this book and was ecstatic to find out that so much can be done to help people with tinnitus. I thought 40 pages of professional journal article citations was a bit much but aside from that, this book is wonderful. If you have tinnitus or work with people who have tinnitus this book is indispensable. It provides a workable framework from which people can improve their situation. Dr. Hogan's own story of how he battled tinnitus is compelling. The most useful section may have been how people with very little money can utilize a simple walkman for auditory habituation. The discussion about medications was also new to me. This book is a wonderful resource. Definitely recommended for everyone with tinnitus and everyone in audiology."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"While attending hypnotherapist training with Kevin Hogan in 1998 I was introduced to a potentially debilitating condition called tinnitus. Shortly following this training, I was assigned to write a college paper, the topic, tinnitus. This book was by far one the most informational and scientifically sound book which I was able to obtain on the subject of tinnitus. The facts and figures speak for themselves with the massive number of people experiencing this on a day to day basis. Tinnitus;Turning the volume down provides hope for those who have been told that they will &quot;have to learn to live with it&quot; this book says it is time to help the tinnitus find a new address. This book is good for the person who has been diagnosed with tinnitus, doctors wanting to learn more about tinnitus, family/friend of someone experiencing tinnitus, or student researching tinnitus. The format is easy to follow and understand while still containing just the right degree of scientific jargon. My best wishes to you and the journey to quiet the noise inside of your head."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Kevin Hogan has a clear insight into this problem, being a tinnitus suffer himself. He has done his research but presents the material in easy to read lay terms. His research data is current and varied. He offers hope to everyone suffering from tinnitus without giving false claims. Someone should find as least one thing helpful in this book, I found many."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"A few years ago, I attended a seminar lead by Kevin Hogan on the subject, \\"Tinnitus\\". Within two weeks, I was working with my first tinnitus patient who had been referred to me by her doctor. With the information that I received at that seminar, I was able to help this lady reduce the noise and cope better with life. Anyone suffering from tinnitus or theraist who is or will be working with a tennitus client should read this book. It has been very helpful to me as a hynotherapist in working with people with tinnitus. He gives a wealth of information concerning the various treatments for tinnitus and how they can be combined for the benefit of the client. I let the doctor prescribe the medication and I use hypnotherapy to enhance the desired results. Kevin Hogan's book has been a valuable referrence for me when working with clients suffering from the noise of tennitus. I am pleased to call Kevin Hogan: peer, teacher, and friend. Chaplain Paul G.

This great contribution, however, comes from his personal success in overcoming the frustrating inner noise of tinnitus (ringing and/or roaring in the ears). It covers the basics of tinnitus, including scientific explanations and current modalities of treatment. The use of competent hypnotherapy, used in conjunction with other appropriate professional health care, may offer the best hope of turning the volume down. This is a valuable book, written in a style that is easy to understand, and it is a MUST-read for anyone who suffers from tinnitus.--Reviewed by Roy Hunter, M.S., Published Author of: MASTER THE POWER OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, THE ART OF HYPNOSIS, and THE ART OF HYPNOTHERAPY"},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Overall this book contains a lot of good information, is objective and is honest about one's options with tinnitus. But, the writing style is awful. It reads like it was written five paragraphs at a time without going back to see what was written previously. Very repetitive. And, Kevin, when you do find a good editor and he or she wants to eliminate \\"quotes\\" and superfluous words, swallow your pride and listen. You don't, for example, have to say \\"but by no means limited to,\\" after each use of the word \\"including.\\" He or she will tell you that the phrase adds nothing. This is correct.

Other than the persistent thread throughout the book recommending the need to consider hypnotherapy and the lack of viable hypnotherapists specializing in tinnitus, the book did not come across as a sales pitch or claim to provide an \\"instant cure\\". The author stresses the need for patience and the application of a multi-modal approach, which seems prudent for attacking tinnitus. It's early in our road to healing, therefore I cannot confirm whether the methods suggested in this book will ultimately result in a reduction in the perceived noise and associated distress, but most of it makes good sense and can be applied with minimal financial investment. I definitely recommend this book as a source of encouragement for those suffering from severe tinnitus."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"No hype or black magic cures enclosed.

I have what I consider to be mild but chronic ringing, plus infrequent pulsing sounds matching my heartbeat. As with many tinnitus sufferers, I've been told to \\"learn to live with it.\\" In searching the internet about tinnitus, I found many of the \\"send me money and I'll give you a miracle cure\\" type offers, but in one chat site, someone said this book, \\"Tinnitus: Turning Down the Volume\\" by Kevin Hogan, was by far the best book on the subject. So I found and ordered it on Amazon.After reading the book, I must admit I was very happy with what I got out of the book. It promises no \\"instant cures\\" and in fact urges patience and months long efforts. Dr. Kevin Hogan suffered from tinnitus, and writes about his expensive and extensive efforts to relieve his own problem, and offers suggestions to the reader on actions to try. He guarantees no cure, but suggests plans of action. I am trying two of the suggestions now (prescription prescribed by my doctor, and the use of an iPod. Yes, and iPod.) Right now, I will wait and see if my volume does indeed get turned down over the next several months.There were at least three instances Dr. Hogan discusses in the book that I thought were quirks of mine alone. Reading about them made me realize that they were indeed tinnitus related and not just me! The biggest surprise moment in the book for me was his contention that the ringing is not necessarily just in the ear, but also could be programmed into the brain. Over the course of the book, he makes sense.Dr. Hogan does offer to sell cd's for very severe cases as part of his own Tinnitus Reduction Program, but the majority of the book discusses how to appproach the program on your own (or with the help of a good doctor.) There is no \\"You can't be helped without buying these\\" type of sales pressure.One final comment. In his book, Dr. Hogan highly recommends \\"Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life\\" by Martin Seligman, Ph.D. After reading the Tinnitus book, I bought this book, which was a REAL eye opener about my own attitude (which according to Dr. Hogan, can have a major effect on dealing with tinnitus.) I learned that while I thought I was a fairly optimistic person, I was far from it, and I learned how to become aware of my negativism and counter it. Now I am looking forward to dealing with both my known tinnitus and my previously unknown negativeness. I very highly recommend BOTH books."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Being a sufferer of Sudden Hearing Loss and subsequent tinnitus I purchased this book for some guidance on dealing with the infliction. The book did explain tinnitus as best as is currently medically understood but did not provide any viable or practical methods of reducing the ringing as the name of the book implies. The book is 260 pages, which in my opinion, could have been captured in 30. It kept repeating the same material over and over again just arranged differently. If you're looking for solutions on dealing with Tinnitus, I wouldn't recommend this book. The only thing it did for me was to make me more aware of the ringing in my ear while I was reading it. That's about it. You could get the same information from the American Tinnitus Association from free."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"There is some information in here but mostly it is a book length advertisement for this guy's hypnotheraphy course on CDs.

As one reviewer pointed out, most of the positive reviews appear to be from colleges or students of Hogan, or people who have attended one of his seminars. I doubt they even read the book, and instead just gave it good reviews based on their experiences with him. I'm sure he is a pioneer in his field and does indeed know a great deal about tinnitus, and can/has helped people. However, this book IMO falls very short. The 200 plus pages could have easily been condensed to 20 or so. Many chapters cover the same topics as other chapters, and he rambles on and on about things that will not help you \\"Turn down the volume\\". In closing, the book does offer a handful of tactics that may help; some of those will seem like common sense to most folks.

Waste of money."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Although this book has above average information on tinnitus, I have a problem with the fact that it's about how to DEAL with tinnitus!There is very little scientific info, or breakthrough information. If you don't all ready know most people believe you can't cure tinnitus. This is why the author spends his time speaking about how to deal with it.I just feel like a lot is missing in the scientific realm. As someone who has had tinnitus for 10 years I believe there are ways to improve it (that are not artificial like most are in the book). I just would like to see more charts, and learn more about the history of the ear and tinnitus, and the scientific properties, frequencies.Some of this info is in the book, but again it's written from a \\"how to deal\\" perspective which I don't like. I would like a more hopeful, and yet scientific approach.Lastly I HATE how this author talks about IPODS. If anyone watches the news everyone from Bono, to Mettallica talk about the dangers of I-PODS. Yet since this guy talks about how to deal, he thinks and IPODS is great for masking the noise. I know from my experience and my wife's, that IPODS make Tinnitus worst even at a low volume. The sound is so directly close to your ear! I don't have all the scientific info, but I know from experience this is bad.......My Tinnitus started from riding a lawn mower and blasting headphones, than turning up the volume even more with one of those Radioshaq volume boosters. So to me IPODS are stupid, it's also tough to regulate the volume from song to song and you could easily set off your tinnitus with an IPOD or a form of an IPOD."},{"Title":"Tinnitus, Turning the Volume Down: Proven Strategies for Quieting the Noise in Your Head","review":"Having Tinnitus myself since six months, I was given the standard ENT answer: \\"you'll have to get used to it\\". This book, written by a person who actually suffered and overcame it, provides valuable insight into the nature of Tinnitus - a condition which results from a combination of the ear and the brain. It provides also several possible treatments with different rates of success. On the downside, the book repeats itself several times, and it's always referring to the author's commercial Tinnitus Reduction Program. I'm giving it five stars for giving me a deeper understanding of the condition and above all, for giving me hope.25/July/2009 Update: I've found a much better book than this one.

I'm a college student suffering from Tinnitus. I ordered this book to try and learn about the different treatments available and hopefully find one that I can begin. This book did a very good job explaning the treatments and telling you where to get started on the recovery process. However, in order to do the things the author suggests to fight Tinnitus you would have to have lots of free time and extra money. And being a full time student at a major University I have neither of these. I wish I could devote everything I have to fighting this, but I can't. And I think most people can't.

The writing is amazing and the characters and story completely come to life. I have re-read the trilogy several times and I don't feel like I have wasted any of my time. Note the 5 Star rating.I was slightly annoyed that every book in this set came with a sticker about the movie on it. Then even more annoyed when I found out that the Golden Compass did, in fact, have this \\"Major Motion Picture in 2007!\\" or whatever it says, printed directly on the cover....very annoying for someone who wanted the original covers, but probably unavoidable at this point, unless you buy used.**Now the Spoiler/Warning (no Theological disputes included - I promise)**I will be telling you what happens at the end of the Golden Compass...I do have a concern, however. Such as in a few other reviews, I have to say that the movie does not do the Golden Compass any justice. What I worry about is how that movie is/was being marketed. It is clearly marketed and made towards an audience of children. The books, however, are more young adult. I was a mature 5th grader, and I still found myself disturbed by the content, at times.Pullman is very able to pull his readers into the story and get them to care deeply for the characters. Imagine the scene in the movie where the Gyptian boy, Billy Costa, is found after being separated from his Daemon. Well, now imagine that scene with lots of character development and with explicit implications that this boy has lost his soul. He is a ghost, he can't get it back, he is no longer a person. Think of the intensity of that if it was really made clear that he did in fact, LOSE HIS SOUL! IThe movie ends just short of pretty much the most traumatic event in the trilogy, and it cannot be avoided in either the next movie or the first book. The story would crumble. If you are a parent, and you have seen the movie and are now thinking of getting your kid(s) the books, please read them first. If you don't have time to read the whole series, at least read the last few chapters of Golden Compass - the part that was cut short in the movie - the murder of Roger by Lord Asrael for scientific and personal gain. Then decide if your child can handle the the series yet, or if maybe they should wait a little while.Also consider this before taking them to the second movie. The movies will have to become more intense, even if they are glossed over versions of the book like the last one was. I just remember seeing the movie and being worried that a bunch of parents were going to bring their 5-9 year olds and they would be completely scared and traumatized. If your kid is mature enough, then the books are amazing and there is a lot to learn from both the good things and the bad things that happen. If they aren't ready yet, it will just be a bad reading experience."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compassby Philip PullmanScience FictionLyra is an ordinary girl who likes to play and have fun at Jordan College, with her deamon Pantalaimon always close by.

I rushed onto book two, which I finished in just few days. Second book was even more action-packed, and revealed a lot of things that were confusing in the first book. But the third book in the series has regrettably betrayed the spirit of its two predecesors; it dragged on describing people moving from one place to the next, talking about landscapes, and introducing a bunch of new side characters. To be honest I didn't finish the third book, I got to a little more than half way, and just couldn't go on. I'm sure I'll pick it up again sometime, maybe there is a fantastic ending towards the very end?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A child's story, as in the harry Potter series where the heroes are very young. The witch craft is better explained if far fetched but I just suspend the irregularities and enjoy the story and the very adult themes. I have not finished the last book, The Amber Spyglass so I don't know who is going to get theirs in the end. Catholic church does take a drubbing but the very young heros and heroines are so unworldly that the author can sort of get away with it. I like the books,they are an easy read and not likely will be on the children's shelf in religious homes if the parents read it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I will be 60 years old this year and love to read good books. These are good books. Philip Pullman has a great imagination. I am almost finished with the last one and will cut this review short so that I can get back to it. Can't wait to go see the first movie. By the way, some of his ideas aren't fantastical."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Lyra, the young heroine of this trilogy, snoops in a room she is not supposed to enter, and so learns of and foils a plot to murder Lord Asriel. As a result, she is drawn into an epic battle between good and evil, in which many participants turn out not to be what at first they seem. Lyra meets Will, a boy from another Earth, and together and separately they have a slew of marvelous adventures involving witches, armored polar bears, and alien species as well as many varieties of humans, both good and evil.Pullman uses all four of the basic plots (rags to riches, boy meets girl, the little tailor, and the yellow brick road) with innumerable twists and surprises. The young heroine and hero make the story appealing to younger teenage readers, but the story is good enough to appeal to even old geezers like me.Buy them! Read them! Enjoy them! Read them to your children!watziznaym@gmail.com"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is not light reading, whatever adults might say.1. First of all, people shouldn't say that this book is only for children 16 and up. I am an eleven year old, and sometimes I am insulted because a book says it is only for children 16 and up. Just because I am young does not mean that I cannot understand heavy things!2. This book has well-developed characters, and gives you depth and perception into the characters feelings (esp. Lyra).3. I would recomend this book to everyone.If you haven't read The Golden Compass(GASP,GASP), you really NEED TO!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I wasn't going to post a review of \`His Dark Materials' (HDM) because there are so many already. This was my second reading of HDM and I liked even more the second time. But after reading some of the positive and negative reviews I felt as if I could add something to the discussion on three issues and add some comments of my own on Pullman's apparent themes. Two of these issues are, in my opinion, trivial and the third might be, but it is interesting nonetheless.If you look on Amazon or blogs or other book review sites you will see both positive and negative comparisons of HDM to \`Lord of the Rings' (LOR). This is one of the trivial issues: HDM has no relationship whatsoever to LOR other than both are long books broken into three parts and are the basis for some pretty good movies.The second of these trivial issues are the positive and negative comparisons to the \`Harry Potter' series (HP). The HP series are mostly for and about children and are about magic as in \`Hocus Pocus' magic. HDM is about children but I would hesitate to say that Pullman wrote it for children. Pullman in interviews has said that he dislikes the label of \`children's literature' as it implies \`not for adults.' The themes in HDM are very adult, but I suspect that an intelligent young adult would respond to them and the adventure aspects of HDM would appeal to most younger readers as well. More over HDM is not about magic at all; it is science fiction (a genre Pullman also dislikes) in the best sense. The so-called \`magic' is merely what someone might call the physics of alternate Universes.The last issue, and it may or may not be trivial, is the objection to HDM by Christians. There is no doubt that Pullman intended HDM to be a counterbalance to C.S. Lewis's slobbering exaltation of Christianity (and the superiority of male Anglo-Saxons) in \`The Chronicles of Narnia' (CON) and in general a condemnation of some of the practices the Catholic Church. However most of the criticism you see about HDM seems to come from the politically conservative Christian right that interprets any and all criticism of religion as profanation of Christianity in general. I would add that there are also positive reviews of HDM solely on the basis of being anti-religion as well.I do find it interesting that some of the negative reviews of HDM by Christians are really very long and well written. It makes me wonder why someone would say that HDM was a not a good book when it obviously stimulated them to write several pages on it. I suppose that it upset them and they don't like to be upset by what they read. That is strange as it is one of the points Pullman makes in HDM. In passing he mentions that the church has imprisoned a scientist for coming up with what seems to be a valid description of multiple dimensions in String Theory. These negative reviews seem to follow a general trend on the Internet of a group of Christians who spend a lot of time sniffing out heterodoxy and attempting to stifle it.My last observation is why I think HDM is exception SciFi and why you should read it and get your kids to read it as well. What Pullman has done is to take the implications of String Theory, Chaos Theory, the theories about Dark Matter and Dark Energy in modern theoretical physics and asks the question of what a world would look like if these theories were true. What if there are other Universes and what would happen if we could travel between them? This is really, really interesting and I think Pullman has done an exceptional job here. The fact that he uses the influence of religion as one vehicle may or may not have been a major issue here, but it does not detract in any way from the fascinating SciFi aspects of this book.You can read this in three parts as it was published, but like LOR it is best considered as a whole work. HDM is available in a number of editions and I read, this time, the omnibus of all three volumes. If you don't know anything about modern physics it will not detract from the enjoyment of the book as just SciFi or fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't understand what the fuss is about, the story is so clearly fantastical to me that I can't imagine getting so upset about one man's opinions about God, the Universe, and Everything. The books are engaging, well-written, and certainly thought-provoking. Lyra is a flawed heroine, she is not portrayed as a sweet naive innocent, and that's what makes her so appealing. I sense that some of Pullman's intent was to show children in a realistic light, not the fantasy naive innocents created by adults who pine for a time that never existed except in their imaginations.I will say though, the first book especially is severely disturbing, with the ghoulish experiments and the snatching of the children, I can't imagine this book really being intended for kids, it's so dark and disturging and terrifying at times. Then again, this series also illustrates why as a kid I vastly preferred British kid lit over American kid lit, with a few exceptions here and there, sure. On the whole, the English don't seem to feel a great need to clean up the unpleasant side of human nature the way Americans do. Maybe what's got some people squealing so loud about these books is the unpleasant reflection in the mirror. I honestly don't know."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We purchased this trilogy of books as a Christmas gift for our son's girlfriend. The books arrived promptly and she loved what we got her. Thanks Amazon for another great buying experience!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series of books was a good read for me (age 34) but would be better suited for teens and young adults. The metaphors contained are tried and true, though the presentation seems sort of stilted at times.If you have a youngster that you would like to see become a worthwhile person as opposed to a fake-churchy fruitcake, I recommend this collection very strongly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book of this trilogy was compelling and made me want to immediately read the next two books. Unfortunately, the next two did not live up to the dramatic build the first book started. The second book read like a book-long introduction. The third book was heavy handed, preachy, and almost patronizing in its explanation of events. The ending was a bit anticlimatic.While the message of these books is a good one: the continual strive for knowledge vs. denial of knowledge, I thought the delivery could have been a bit better."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy provides a wonderful fantasy adventure escape for readers of all ages.

Thought provoking and exciting; I plan to read the books over and over."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After I finished the last book I was annoyed at best. What a waste of time, both Pullman's writing of them and my reading them. How was I to know that the whole series would be based on the same old mistake that uninformed people have been making for nearly 2000 years. They think that Catholics are Christians. Sorry to disturb your atheist fantasies, but Catholicism has ALWAYS been anti-Christian. Pullman is right about Catholicism. He doesn't know anything about the Truth contained in the Bible.Oh yeah, neither do Catholics.As for comparisons to Tolkien...get serious!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I hated the first book, hence I only got to about page 40. Can't speak for the last two. I found the first book completely non-engaging. I found myself not giving a rats hoot about any of the characters. I found myself not caring if I ever read any further. Maybe I just didn't \\"get it\\", but I found the strange juxtaposition of a fantasy world with the real world as we know it very disjointed. The blending in of the \\"Church\\", the \\"made up\\" places with bits of places that really exist, the made up groups of peoples that sort of corresponded with the real world were to me, just silly, not to mention confusing and annoying. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to take place in the past, present or future. Was it Earth, another planet, another dimension? Who knows and who cares? Certainly not I! I couldn't tell if there were bad guys, good guys, and what the bleep were these \\"daemons\\" that everyone had? And as for the plot...what plot? I couldn't dig one out of this pile with a backhoe. To compare to other authors, I have found both Tolkien and Rowling books completely engrossing from the first printed word. I understood completely who the characters were, I loved them, both the good ones and the evil ones. I couldn't wait to read the next page and the next. These Pullman books are just...I don't know...STUPID! BUT...go ahead and read them for yourself. It seems I may be the ONLY one in the UNIVERSE that HATED at least the first one enough to NEVER read any of the others.

Don't waste your money!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Look, Pullman wrote this as a literary exercise. (You can read about that over at Wikipedia.)Book 1, was mediocre until the end, at which point he flips a protagonist into an antagonist.This book was mostly from the point of view of Lyra, the main character.Book 2 and Book 3... he spends whole sections going off talking about the world (as though he were Tolkien, WHICH HE IS NOT), and occasionally he gets around to telling more of Lyra's adventure.This is also the only story I've read where God was turned into a pathetic antagonist, and I mean pathetic.Yeah, you read that right, he TRIED turning the creator of the universe into the \\"bad guy\\".(Some people might view it as anti-Christian... but really it doesn't even merit the effort to argue it at that level...)...its just ANTI-good-STORY-TELLING.Like I said it was a literary exercise, and he FAILS MISERABLY at the exercise.SKIP IT.SAVE YOUR MONEY!IT SUCKS!IT IS THAT BAD.Oh, and this is one case where the story of the MOVIE of Book 1, is MUCH better than the book!The writers of the movie script actually knew how to tell a story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The maturity of the writting is on a par with Aragon - that of a writers first book.I would not recommend this book for children. The author's hatred of \\"the church\\" is such a great part of the plot, that it doesn't allow any other theme to shine through.In my opinion a children's book should either entertain, at their level, or help them find themselves in the larger world.For a child to enjoy this book, they would need to read it as an adventure with no attempt to understand why the adventure is happening.As an adult reading the material, I found it an interesting twist on string threory. The author's hatred of \\"the church\\" and miss quoting of the Bible was a little off putting, but then I didnt' read the books for a religious education.Because the level of writting left me flat - the characters emotions never came to life - I don't think I will bother reading any other works by this author.

If you tried to serve such vile-tasting stuff to the victims directly and without concealment they would spit it out after the first few pages.The fundamental dishonesty in Mr. Pullman's work is that he uses the imagery of childhood fantasy, sometimes very beautifully, (a polar bear that can gallop with a little girl on his shoulders across endless miles of snow under the northern night sky) to lure his prey into the final book, where he will aggressively proselytize them with the most horrible images of God that I have seen.Mr. Pullman's work doesn't show a God who teaches law, or who offers His love, or who calls on the faithful to surrender to Him. He sees a toothless and idiotic God long since demented by divine Alzheimer's, being carried from the field of battle by angels who must be wondering why they don't just toss the old moron into the nearest celestial dumpster.This is not religious art.-------------------------------------------------Mr. Pullman openly hates God and and one of His friends, C.S. Lewis, which to my mind sounds like choosing one's enemies with quite a bit too much ambition.I have read that Pullman consciously set out to be the anti- C.S. Lewis, and with _His Dark Materials_ he may have succeeded. C. S. Lewis wrote about what he loved, while Pullman writes about what he hates.I get the feeling from C.S. Lewis that he would try to convert Satan himself, if only the old monster would listen. Mr. Pullman has the opposite fantasy: he would like to find a knife subtle enough to kill God.Pullman is pleased that his message to children is \\"much more subversive\\" than Harry Potter, and that he has \\"flown under the radar\\" with it. He apparently sees your child as the target of his stealth fighter of a book.Philip Pullman has also decided lately that he is a religious man, since his thought and his art concern themselves with religious themes. That's exactly like saying that _Piss Christ_ is a religious work because it includes a crucifix. Don't mind that the artist has placed Jesus in a urinal.Virus Warning---------------------------------I read all three books about five years ago, when my daughter was starting to be old enough to appreciate such things. After reading the first one, I was so enraptured (enthralled?) that I thought I might start reading them aloud to her.After I finished the third volume, I disposed of all three as carefully as you might cleanse your house of poisoned lollipops.Mr. Pullman is a talented writer--after five years, many of his images remain in my mind. I thank God that I was able to protect my child."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book was a great adventure, but in the next two books, Pullman digresses into blatant church and Christianity bashing. He fully endorses eastern mysticism in his story and explains how the God of the Bible is an evil and spiteful being. Pullman's moral compass is way off as he clumsily closes his trilogy with loose ends, contrivances, and actually saves all of creation with some creepy prepubescent sexuality.It is unbelievable to me that these books got so much accliam and support as children's literature. I was looking for good fantasy and what I got was a disappointing blend of other great works."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am growing tired of authors who think that their religious beliefs are so important to rebuff the Christian culture. There was a time when we all agreed that we would get along and respect each other regardless of our personal beliefs. We do have a Constitution that promotes freedom of speech and I have to support this author's right to express it. I find with deep sorrow that I will never choose to read this novel because I would find the underlying premise disgusting and unfathomable (that God is killed). What ever happended to reading literature to be entertained?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If there's any doubt that Pullman's infamously anti-God, anti-Christian and anti-religious trilogy, His Dark Materials, is anything but, allow me to clue you, the reader, in on the exact genesis of the title of the trilogy alone. His Dark Materials is a somewhat veiled reference to the 17th-century, English poet John Milton's poem, Paradise Lost. In fact, this sacrilegious poem is the basis for Pullman's trilogy. As a refresher course, let me educate the reader into recalling that Paradise Lost is actually a poem in which the main protagonist is Satan himself who, from a modern perspective, is certainly presented as a sympathetic being who merely has the ambition to challenge God. This absolutely runs counter to the vast majority of Christians who view Satan as the Enemy of Man and the epitome of anti-life!!!! If that's not enough to make the case that His Dark Materials is hazardously atheist...then NOTHING will!!!!His Dark Materials is indisputably an absolute, unmitigated assault on religion and Christianity specifically, and what makes it all the worse is its insidious plan to primarily target children via indoctrination through its kiddie lit!!!! Adults can willfully decide for themselves whether to be God-fearing or instead choose the path of spiritual sorrow through atheism or even agnosticism, yet impressionable kiddies don't have the mental ripeness to make this decision themselves--especially if they're being indoctrinated into hating God and organized religion, as His Dark Materials does throughout.What makes His Dark Materials so lethal--and this trilogy is DARK indeed (as in anti-life and infernal)--is that it trespasses far beyond criticizing organized religion. It actually advocates DEICIDE of the Judeo-Christian God as described, in one of many examples, in a passage from The Amber Spyglass, which describes the encounter between protagonists Will and Lyra and the dying Authority (Pullman's catch-phrase for God)!!!! The passage reads \\"...there was nothing to stop the wind from damaging him, and to their dismay his form began to loosen and dissolve.\\" Further, \\"...he'd vanished completely...Then he was gone: a mystery dissolving in mystery.\\" There, anti-Christ Pullman fondly expresses his longing wish that God is destroyed forevermore.I wish that this lustful embrace of DEICIDE was the height of Pullman's atheist and liberal breaches, but, alas, that's only the tip of the iceberg. In further, mortifying example, in The Subtle Knife, there's the character of Mary Malone, a physicist who used to be a nun. She says of her experience: \\"...till I saw there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway. The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" Little, impressionable children--due to the reprehensible carelessness of their ignorant or amoral parents--continue to endure these anti-Christian messages throughout Pullman's trilogy!!!! Note that there isn't even a pretense of balance attached to Pullman's anti-religion bigotry--he doesn't even attack Islam, for instance.The whole premise of the trilogy is anti-Christian at its inception because the evil, institutional force in the books is termed the \\"Magisterium\\" which Catholics should be familiar with as the teaching body of the Catholic Church. Pullman's association of an evil, oppressive institution with the Catholic Church should be enough to start alarm bells ringing at once.In the Golden Compass, the \\"Dust\\" business, the plot-driver, is divulged, and it's a source of conflict between the villains (read: the Church!) and the \\"good guys\\" (read: enlightened, atheist scientists!). The Church views the Dust as the root of original sin and, therefore, kidnaps children in order to perform \\"cruel\\" experiments on them designed to sever the child's soul--in Pullman's world, appropriately called a \\"demon.\\" The severing of a child's soul turns the child into a zombie, yet Pullman accuses the Church of wanting to do this because of his prejudiced belief that religion turns people into thoughtless zombies.The anti-Christ themes only get more raging with the Subtle Knife (ironically, the worsening anti-Christian bigotry is anything BUT subtle!). In this novel, we discover that the aforementioned Dust is actually a code word for a bunch of rebel angels (read: Satan and fallen angels!) whose motive is vengeance. The witches in this tome believe that Lyra (a little girl), is destined to be the \\"second Eve,\\" a new mother of all through her disobedience (read: disobedience to God, or the \\"Authority\\" in Pullman's trilogy). These same witches learn that a certain \\"Lord Asriel\\"--the trilogy's liberal role model due to his embrace of science over religion--is planning a war against God, again, another metaphor concerning Satan who is eternally at war with God.The final installment, the Amber Spyglass, is so anti-Christ that if you're Christian, you'll be chilled with its blatancy!!!! The second main character (a little boy named Will) is being watched over by two rebel angels who are also HOMOSEXUALS--Will is moved by their man-love for each other--who encourage Will to bring his god-destroying knife to Asriel, who wants to kill the Authority (read: God). Another main character, a certain Mrs. Coulter (seriously), charges that priests of the Church are having lecherous, sexual obsessions, flagrantly an insinuation against the Catholic Church's small ped*philia scandal from a few years past.The worst part of the sacrilege is Pullman's revelation of what God is according to his mythology. God isn't shown as an omnipotent being, but, rather in line with an atheist disdain for God, a being who was \\"so old and...terrified, crying like a baby and cowering away into the lowest corner...Demented and powerless, the aged being could only weep and mumble in fear and pain and misery.\\" Any real Christian--not a liberal, fake one--ought to be up in arms over this antagonistic description of God, though Christians obviously won't stage violent demonstrations and issue death threats over this.The ending of this third book is practically a victory for the Devil over God in propaganda terms because God, as in \\"the Authority,\\" finally dies, and the kid-protagonists, Will and Lyra, find debauchery!!!! The Dr. Mary Malone character entices them into the licentious pleasures of erotica by explaining to them how gratifying--I bet!--her life's been since she quit being a nun and pursued a relationship with a man (at least it wasn't another woman in a lesbian slant!). So little Will and Lyra actually suck face to commemorate their murder of God!!!! The desecration's complete when it's revealed that Will and Lyra will attempt to build the Republic, not Kingdom, of Heaven on their own, mortal terms on Earth!If you're Christian and have kids, just Christian, or merely not an atheist, you should be shaking in terror and simultaneously seething in righteous anger at the aforementioned, vivid outline of pure, sacrilegious hell that's contained within His Dark Materials. If you're a Christian parent or a parent who's not anti-religion and doesn't want to prejudice your kids, you CANNOT in good conscience permit your kids to buy or read these \\"books.\\" If you're just a relativistic parent or merely a totally unobservant one, I ask you, \\"What the hell's wrong with you?!?!\\"His Dark Materials turns the interpretation of Christianity on its head so that all the good that comes from organized religion--morals, charitable giving, modesty, sacrifice, purity--is cursed as being the root of all rot in life. If more misguided folks surrender to this misconstruing viewpoint, society will stray even further into liberalism which is the bane of all life as we know it. Thus, it's no wonder that the film version of The Golden Compass is ruthlessly popular overseas (read: atheist Old Europe), but largely flopped stateside. With 85% of Americans identifying themselves as Christians according to recent polling, do yourself a favor and be a REAL American by rejecting this anti-Christian indoctrination."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Children are impressionable and in my opinion shouldn't read stories in which the plot revolves around the supreme blasphemy, namely, that God is a liar and a mortal. I believe it is not appropriate for children to read books in which the heroine is the product of adultery and murder priests act as professional hit men, torturers and authorize occult experimentation on young children an ex-nun engages in occult practices and promiscuous behavior, and speaks of it openly with a 12-year-old couple and the angels who rebel against God are good, while those who fight on God's side are evil. This is wrong. And while it's been softened in the movie -- or at least that's what Hollywood is telling us -- it's still there in the books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman certainly captured my imagination with his trilogy His Dark Materials. Unfortunately in Finland, at least, the books have been overshadowed by Harry Potter.

I have to disagree that youths won't understand the book, as I am myself only 17. I also find books where a few of the main characters more interesting than those where all of the main characters 'live happily ever after'. I personally found the ending very emotional, this is the only book I have ever cried over, and I wish that there were going to be more books after 'The Amber Spyglass'. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone as it is without a doubt infinitely more pleasurable, in my opinion, to reading the 'Harry Potter' series, which although they are good, do not measure up to 'His Dark Materials'.

In fact, there's little I can write here that hasn't already been covered, but I'll chime in and say that I enjoyed these books immensely. The plot is gripping, the story rich in detail, the characters complex and engaging. Readers who are concerned with Pullman's treatment of religion should be mindful of the distinction between belief, spirituality and faith on the one hand, and the political machinations of religious institutions on the other. I think Pullman's criticism is focused on the latter and well-justified.I just bought this boxed set as a gift for my brother on his 13th birthday (I'm an adult), and I'm sure his experience in reading it will be different from mine.

The third book, The Amber Spyglass, however, completely fell apart. It was such a huge let down in fact, that I feel cheated, which is why I'm giving this series 2 stars.For those of you who haven't read it yet, you'd better stop here.For those of you who have already made your judgement that I'm really just a disgruntled Christian, and that your beloved masterpiece is beyond logical reproach, you can stop here too.Why didn't I like The Amber Spyglass? Pullman pulls in so much superfluous crap into the third book that he can't tie together, that it bursts open like a bale of hay. To deal with this, he changes the nature of characters with senseless glee, leaves gaping inconsistencies and loose ends, and worst of all, he spends two and a half books preparing the reader for a dramatic battle that never occurs. Why? Because it seems that as if in the last book, Pullman decides that he hates God so much that he can't even bring himself to make God a formidible enemy, so he quickly disposes of God and his Cosmic Meathead Orderly with a few casual pages, and changes course. No, these divine enemies are way too pathetic. Forget that the entire series has been building toward fighting them. No, Pullman brushes them aside, and makes the TRUE enemy human nature. Selfishness, lust for our own desires, all the things that led to the making and use of the knife, the loss of dust, and the creation of Spectres. These are the enemy. But isn't it funny how these same exact \\"values\\" are what cause Lyra to \\"fall\\" thereby saving the universe. And what did happen there exactly? The consciousness of the universe was so interested in a pair of copulating 12 year olds that it stopped draining into nowhere? And despite this, it was still necessary to close all the the windows except for 1, not 2 mind you, but 1? All so we can have the heart rending dollar store tear jerker at the end? Sorry, the implausible, unexaplainable things that arose in the last book was just too much.While reading the last book, I had no idea where it was going. I kept waiting for a climax that never came. I was so excited about the prospect of watching God get an ass-whoopin (as prophesized), I barely realized He died. It was like a tarp blew out of my truck while I was driving down the highway, and I realized several miles down the road it was gone. I kept thinking, \\"So is it over?\\" But it wasn't. It dragged on with the excitement of hung-over teenagers packing up their campsite after a night a partying in the woods. And, in a truly astonishing finale, Pullman slaps his devoted readers in the face by taking these two 12 year old children who have saved the universe, whom you have come to love, and who have defied all natural and celestial laws with human ambition, love, and loyalty...All of a sudden they are forced to stand down, accept the authority of...the limitations of the physical universe, be bound to its rules and their own chosen concern for the lives and well-being of others, (is this starting to sound like Christian values here, I'm getting teary eyed) and force themselves apart in a monumental act of self restraint and sacrafice (wasn't it Mary, the serpent, who scoffed at these notions while tempting Lyra? ).The last book presents a loosely assembled, muddled casserole of conflicting ideas, unbelievable sequences of events, and totally contrived, unneccesary drama. The deterioration in writing from the first book to the last is remarkable, but by that time, many readers are so infatuated with Pullman's characters and worlds, they simply fail to notice."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"** Parents beware!**This saga is beautiful, magical, mind expanding. Pullman's creation of multiple fully-faceted worlds is spellbinding. Just beautiful writing, I'd recommend it for any adult/young adult.That said: the central premise behind this fantastic chronicle is not something I would want my pre-teen child to be exposed to. It's nihilistic and heavily into materialist philosophy: exactly what kids today DON'T need.For older teens and adults, highly recommended. For anyone younger (even tho the cover says this is recommended for anyone 8 to 80), definitely NOT recommended.If you're thinking about giving this to a child (-14 or so), please read it first. Consider keeping your young ones' innocence for a few years. Teach them values, hope, and faith in something. Then the imaginative springboard that is Pullman's saga will be a good thing.I loved this whole book.

Having extensively studied theology, philosophy of Religion and many eastern religions I had found myself coming to my own conclusions about religion, life, the universe and everything.These books will make you question your faith. I am the stronger for it and have finally consigned my church upbringing as an anachronism. Christianity IS a convincing and powerful lie and it is time for us to move on. So much of what the books say makes sense and I was amazed at seeing my own personal beliefs reflected in words so eloquently and persuasively. Strong characterisation, dynamic plot, moving concepts, enlightening ideas. If you are not changed by this you are not human, because these books are about what it is to be alive and conscious and independent. BUY ITNo doubt it seriously offends the religious Right though, but what 'Authority' do they have?..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"By way of a spying expedition Lyra overhears her uncle ( her father actually ), Lord Asriel, address a group of scholars about a strange phenomenon in the northern wastelands. Shortly afterwards her kitchen-boy friend Roger and a few others are kidnapped by a group of child snatchers. Lyra almost meets the same fate, but is rescued by a group of concerned Gyptians who are the parents of some of the disappeared. Equipped with an Alethiometer - an instrument that can reveal future and past events.. and more - Lyra embarks upon rescue mission.I was asked by my pre-teen nephews what I thought of Philip Pullman's Dark Materials books. I told them that I didn't know, and wasn't too keen on finding out after soldiering through the tiresome Harry Potter quartet. Then a short documentary appeared on the BBC a couple of months later featuring Philip Pullman and a focus on the Dark Materials books... it didn't look too promising. But my curiosity was piqued. So I bought the troika and started with The Golden Compass / Northern Lights to see how it would go.Your attention is immediately drawn to the gushing accolades on the cover and first group of pages by people who have won prizes and are - in many cases - professional magazine or book publishers / editors, making a reasonable person assume that there is indeed a rich harvest to be reaped from the narrative within. And, to a reasonable degree, you won't be disappointed.Unfortunately this book really ambles along, with an occasional burst of energy that saves it from being gracefully retired. Some of the reasons for this are as follows:Lyra and her daemon, Pantaliamon, are suddenly introduced in the first page with no indication as to what a daemon is. And a contradiction is suggested as to why Lyra's daemon and the servant's daemon aren't aware of each other and so give Lyra away as she and Pantaliamon hide from the servant's normal view. This matter is - later on - taken a stage further when Lyra, hiding from her pursuers aboard a Gyptian boat, has to be secreted within a cedar-wood box so that Pantaliamon is suitably subdued and rendered invisible to the pursuers' daemons.This sense of vagueness permeates the Oxford section of the book. the world in which the characters inhabit a kind of Victorian / Edwardian version of our own, but is actually intended to be a slightly skewed, parallel version. I found this to be annoying and distracting until I simply ignored the matter as an idea that hadn't been tidied up.There are too many characters, which simply give an 'everything and the kitchen sink' quality to the story, their use being justifiable only in that they are used to convey some background information or to make a point. This, in conjunction with Philip Pullman's loose narrative style, robs the story of the energy I would have liked to have seen. But his writing is very consistent and more agreeable than J K Rowling's, so I'll be getting on with The Subtle Knife.I know this is meant to be a book for kids, but its contents and the aforementioned endorsements make for a very bad example."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Here's my take on the four issues that seem to be raised most often with regard to these books - their supposed anti-religious message, the failings of the book #3 and suitability for children.I seriously do not understand why people say that these books are 'against religion'. The way I see it, they are against a religious establishment that is given extraordinary powers - the same powers as the Catholic establishment actually did have in medieval Europe. The power to burn people for saying the earth goes around the sun, the power to declare a scientific idea a 'heresy', the power to torture to 'cleanse one of evil', and to make you an outlaw if you dare to disagree with any part of the dogma, ... the condemnation of any sensual pleasure as sinful,... the practice of selling 'indulgences' where you could pay money and be forgiven a sin, ... The author condemns ideological totalitarianism - lots of people are very comfortable with ridiculing fundamentalist islamic regimes - how about swallowing a Christian version of Saudi Arabia?I found the 'message' of the book hopeful - the call to try to make a paradise where we are, and to live our lives so that we'd have some stories to tell when they are over. And the idea that when we die we become part of all sorts of living things again, and there is a joy in it.Reading the reviews,I was really surprized to see how many people liked the 1st book best, and the 3rd least. I myself have been telling people to just get through the first one, the 2nd one is much better, and the 3rd one is the greatest - fewer magic tricks, more food for thought. But then, I am not the type to regret not having lengthy descriptions of 'epic battles'... As for not having everying 'spelled out' for you - I view it as the author's leave to give me, the reader, room for interpretation. Go and look at Tolkien's preface to the Lord of the Rings and his distinction between metaphor and allegory...As for suitability for children, I think kids aren't given enough credit for their ability to judge for themselves and to choose. I myself read Anna Karenina at the age of 8 for the first time and was deeply annoyed when people kept telling me that I 'won't understand anything' . I understood the bits that were relevant and interesting to me at this age, and I enjoyed it - now, at 30, I appreciate other parts of it more, and I am sure that the book will read completely differently when I am 60, - which is not a reason to wait till then to read it. I think that 'His Dark Materials' is, too, a book, that has the potential to grow as you do, and if a child can read, (s)he is old enough to give it a try."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The 'His Dark Materials' trilogy is an entertaining read, not as good as the Harry Potter series nor the Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but better (in my opinion) than the chronicals on narnia. It is a coming of age story that concentrates on two adolescent protagonists coming to terms with the changing world around them. It is set in a multiverse which combines several fantasy realities with our own. The writing is tedious at times, but overall the story does flow and comes together in the end. There is no doubt to any reader that Phillip Pullman has no love for established religion, so if you are put off by opinions that don't fall in line with Christianity, I suggest not reading these books. I do caution parents, this is a dark storyline and (again, in my opinion) is not appropriate for younger children. Otherwise, enjoy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you are looking for intelligent, thought-provoking and fine prose, look no further. This is what Narnia and Harry Potter aspire to. Philip Pullman has managed to bring together the alternate anglophilic world of Harry Potter without the treacle and combine it with the metaphysical questioning of Narnia (without the didactic religiousity) to come up with a startling and satisfying read.Particularly moving and effective is the characterization of Lyra and her daemon, Pantalaimon. Also finely drawn are Lyra's relationships with various people and animals...her fierce personality makes me wish that I had been this type of young girl - brave, loyal, and determined. All of this without being sappy or obvious.I have to say that as an adult I find this trilogy inspiring in its daring and depth...what other set of novels dares to take on the question of life after death, the state of the soul, religion, parental relationships, and soul mates?I can't say enough to recommend this trilogy without gushing anymore."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read these books a year or two ago and felt that something was missing, or amiss, in this story so I am current rereading the series and finding that I still feel that something just isn't right. I've been trying to figure out what it is that feels so off but haven't been able to determine it. Even though Lyra (and most of the children that get spotlit with her) are only about 12, they don't \\"feel\\" like 12 year olds to me; they feel like 12 year olds as seen by an adult who hasn't had a close association with children for a very long time and has forgotten how 12 feels and act. The author also uses a whole lot of \\"leaps of faith\\" and just assumes that's a good enough explanation. But even those aren't what is wrong and I wish I could figure it out. I love a good fantasy story, love Harry Potter, Narnia, Madelaine L'Engle's series, King Arthur tales, LOTR, etc.; I just sink into their reality. But in this series, I just can't find a way in. I love the idea of daemons; I love the idea of holding a 2-way conversation with animals; having witches and angels and portals between worlds. Yet, there's something that just isn't right. Part of it is Lyra seems to be so shallow and one-dimensional for a main character--her reactions are rather limited. It's an alright series, but disappointing considering all there's a lot of imaginative things in there that should appeal so much to me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am an avid teenage reader, and any time I get ahold of a new fantasy book that I have not read, I snap it up. That being said, I will mention that I am also a Christian....and I am enjoying J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series immensely.Mr. Pullman creates a very intriguing world. His armored bears, alternate universes and daemons are intriguing. The alethiometer, the dust, the subtle knife are all fascinating and original in a world weary of Tolkin re-makes. The main characters, Lyra and Will, are for the most part well written. The story itself seems creative: Lyra is a young girl who lives in Jordan College in the Oxford of an alternate universe that is both like and unlike our own. She accidentally gets caught up in the exploration and research of \\"dust\\", a strange substance that does even stranger things, when her best friend is kidnapped by the very people somehow involved with the dust. From there, the books go on to chronicle the adventures of herself and Will, a boy from our own dimension who gets caught up in the plot, and who is the bearer of the Subtle Knife, a knife that can cut through the very fabric of different worlds and into others.When I first started the series, I noticed a possible anti-Christian slant, but I didn't pay it too much attention, because I was really enjoying the books, and I didn't have anything else to read. This slant became more apparent in the second book, but again I shrugged it off. In the third book, I kept thinking that surely Mr. Pullman was not saying what it appeared that he was saying, and that some last minute twist would change the direction that the series appeared to be careening headlong into. As I read the final page, I found this wasn't the case. I don't know exactly what Mr. Pullman has against Christianity, but I have trouble with his disguising it in children's literature. If I went by his opinions, the church would be a terrible, evil oppressor of all that is good, sin would be a hallucination of the church, and God Himself would be a decrepit old man who is too weak to even take care of Himself. Anyone with a Christian perspective is likely to find this beyond offensive.If you don't have a problem with any of this, you are likely to enjoy this series very much. It is original and well-written. It is also going to remain on my bookshelf, gathering dust and cobwebs until kingdom come. Will you read it? The choice is yours to make."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I absolutely love fantasy (usually) but was incredibly let down by this series. The first book was wonderful. I immediately bought the next two- and hated them. I love reading about other worlds, and the daemon idea is great, but I didn't like that some characters died (main ones) and others crossed over in my world (drinking coke, riding in cars, etc.) And the first book paid a lot of attention to character development, while the next two were incredibly rushed and hurried feeling, with confusing, badly-laid out, not-well-described worlds and religious theories. Plus, after the first one, the humor just disappears. Just goes away entirely. I read this series, and the reviews of it, with great excitement, but I was completely uninspired by it. If you like fantasy, other worlds, young children going toward their destinies, and, for god's sake, good character development and humor, buy something by David Eddings.

Maybe that wasn't his intention because fiction books are, after all, only imagination. His stories are fabulous, but what will be the after effects?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I, for one, was deeply disappointed with this series. Many people have already written on the jack-hammer like subtlety with which Mr. Pullman drives home his atheistic world view. What hasn't been brought up, however, is how poorly Mr. Pullman understands the religion he is trying to critique. For all his spite and venom against Christianity, the name \\"Jesus\\" (he being a pretty important guy in that religion, I hear) is mentioned twice, and both times in passing. Likewise, Mr. Pullman displays a shocking lack of understanding concerning the doctrine of original sin, which appears to be the main target for his thinly-veiled mudslinging. So much so, in fact, that at certain points I actually began to feel bad for him. Showing this much ignorance to so many people must be terribly embarrassing. In the end, the totality of Mr. Pullman's argument against all religion seems to be \\"some people who believe in God do bad things.\\" Bravo, sir. Your ability to awkwardly repeat the obvious over a thousand pages is unmatched.If my main difficulties with this series were philosophical or theological, however, I would possibly have considered giving it more than one star. As it is, I wish I could give fewer. I am no great fan of C.S. Lewis' Narnia series, but I find the comparisons of this trilogy to Tolkien's body of work and the Harry Potter series appalling. In both Tolkien and Rowling's novels, it is quite easy for the reader to tell that there is far more to the world that the characters inhabit than what is being revealed on the page. When reading about Middle Earth and Hogwarts, the reader is given the feeling that he or she is on a safari; seeing only a small portion of a living and breathing universe that stretches far beyond the page's horizon. In the worlds of Mr. Pullman, however, (and I would level this same criticism at Lewis) the reader has much more the sense of riding the tram at the Epcot Center. Everything is very pretty, overly convenient, and brilliantly defined. If we were to step off the tram, however, we would find nothing behind the carefully drawn backgrounds but convoluted machinery. It is an incredibly shallow world.I would not dream of making these remarks without providing examples to back up my statements, so here they are. This list is certainly not exhaustive, but I don't feel like going back through these books again. Suffice it to say, if I can pick these off the top head, many more lie just below the surface: (Spoilers Ahead)1) Lyra is prophesized to betray someone, and we are later told that this betrayal occurs when she leaves Pan to go to the island of the dead. Really, though, it's not a betrayal. It's just a choice of a necessary evil. No vow has been broken. That the reader must be explicitly told that this event is the forewarned betrayal shows just how unsatisfactorily the prophecy is fulfilled.2) As the reader, we are told that bears are impossible to trick. Yet, a hundred or so pages later, Lyra does just this with ease. How? By saying \\"I have to go into another room.\\" Mmm, very sneaky. Those un-trickable bears could never have seen through that.3) The subtle knife is supposed to be used to kill the Authority. It doesn't. Kind of a bummer.4) During the long, slow, and largely pointless falling action after the final battle, Mary is watching the clouds flow against the current of dust and beings to wonder why they appear to have purposeful movement; as if they were either fleeing from or hastening towards something. \\"But what this was,\\" writes Pullman, \\"Mary would never know.\\" Four pages later, she knows.5) The final, heart-rending conclusion, in which Lyra and Will must live forever separated in their own worlds, is brought about solely by a convoluted plot trick implemented in the last fifty pages. You see, they can only keep one door open, even though there's never been a reason till a reason was needed. Not even, say, one and a little one will do. Or one and then make-one-real-quick-close-it-behind-your-and-then-have-the-angels-kill-the-solitary-specter-that-pops-out, (since they say they'll have no problem killing all the thousands that already exist). Never mind, of course, that with hundreds of doors left open for decades, the universe has survived for three hundred years. No sir, only one, forever and ever, because it's sadder that way. Now where'd I put my hankie.The only thing that boggles me is why so many people love this series, and why it has won awards. When I read the gushing, five star reviews here at Amazon I scratch my head and wonder if I've read the same books as everyone else. Perhaps I have, and am just missing something. Or, perhaps I'm In some kind of alternate universe in which these books are really, really bad. Whatever the case, I wish I had been in one where I had never read these books. What a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are really not for children as young as 9 or 10. If you want a longer fantasy book, try Redwall. It's great and doesn't have all the darkness that Pullman books have. Also, it bothers me that the new film trailers for The Golden Compass leave you feeling like this book/movie is a follow up to The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Not so. Pullman didn't even care for CS Lewis and certainly not for Lewis' beliefs. Personally, I don't want to expose my children to such a dark tale at a preteen age. They can make their own decision when they are older. There are so many great fantasy tales out there. Why read this one when there are better age appropriate ones? Try M. L'Engle as well.

Philip Pullman rates up there with other great authors like Madeline L'Engle. He has created a richly woven, engaging story that invites readers to care for and want to know more about the main characters and where they'll end up. Don't give up on the story in the beginning, because it is a complicated plot, but unfurls into an absorbing and fantastic tale. Also, if you're interested in considerations of quantum physics, you won't be disappointed either; the subject is referenced often & probabilities are endless in the story: they get your imagination whirling with \\"what-if?\\" questions. The mythical creatures and beings are amazing and easy to \\"accept\\" (as well as the human ones); as if one understands how they can exist from the recesses of our own life experiences to draw on. Oddly enough, Pullman has been criticized as creating a \\"heretical work,\\" yet the overall message is about our interconnectedness with all that is, and focuses on the ability and urge for all human beings to think for themselves - morally, physically and spiritually - and the importance of love, honor, and the \\"human condition.\\" I loved the innocence and passion of the children, as well as their mistakes.

Blending science and magic, myth and even theology into a complex and thrilling adventure story that takes the reader on a journey through worlds that are both strange and familiar. Lyra and Will are two endearing heroes and Lyra's daemon is a wonderful creature, not a pet, but part of her soul. This is imaginative fiction at its very best, with rich characters, exciting conflicts and a story building towards a grand and thought-provoking climax. Heartily recommended to anybody who likes to become absorbed in their reading. Like Harry Potter, Mortal Engines or Hecate's Child, you might not notice time passing as you read it!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I thought that this was an excelent book, not only is it written for kids, but it also is written in a way that adults can enjoy it. And to the people that say this book is just about a kid destroying god. They are wrong, it has some inclanations to that but its just a book, they are just taking it to the extreem. if some one told me they were not going to read it because of those acusations, I would tell them they are missing out on a great book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I sit in my brother's bed room , gazing over all of the books in the shelf. I pick out a book, The Golden Compass, and my mother walks in.I ask, \\"Is this a good book?\\"She answers with, \\"It is a very dark book\\". She leaves it at that, she thought she scared me off. She didn't succeed, I walk to my bedroom and start reading.The Golden Compass is a dark book, not very dark, but a bit disturbing. The Golden Compass is the first book of a trilogy. Its sequel is The Subtle Knife . The last book in the series is The Amber Spyglass.It is amazing though how this book flips one's ideas upside down. The way the author, Phillip Pullman, does this \\"flip\\" is very gradual. In this way he doesn't throw you off the book by hitting you smack in the face with the crashing ideas of Good and Evil.Pullman convinces you to go with the main character's opinion of things through some great characterization.You have to use your imagination while reading this book or the book would be destroyed. I don't want to give the book away, but for you to understand this, you have to know that there are interactions between universes and there can be any kind of life form in that world. For example: when you find out that there are animals that roll on seeds as a form of transportation, you have to believe that in any world, anything can happen.Some things I didn't like about this book were that my opinion of almost all the supporting characters changed throughout the book. I think Pullman could have fixed that by changing less of the characters. If only a couple of people changed sides then the book would be a little less confusing.One would think those dark parts of the book would be bad, but they were very important to the book, and without them the book would not work.I enjoyed the way it ended. It ended with a suspenseful ending(like most series), but didn't leave you hanging. I would like for Phillip Pullman to write another book to follow The Golden Compass series. To write a follow up to The Golden Compass series would not be that hard. He would easily have enough material to write a short novel. The only other thing I didn't like was that my mother didn't like it. My mothers dislike of the series makes it less enjoyable to talk about The Golden Compass around her.These minute flaws in the book are diluted though by a very thoughtful and well done series of novels. The Golden Compass is a thrilling and ambitious series. I loved the amount of characterization put into this trilogy. It is a breathtaking and a terrific story. You have to read it to believe it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and I still remember the details of it. To those who think it is \\"atheist\\": It is a fantasy book! I would say that children should be at least 11 years old to read this book (maybe 10 if they are really mature) because it is dark. The third book is the best, but beware, the ending is really sad."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Come join Lyra & Will & the rest of the endearing, frightful, treacherous & brave characters, as they flee from one parallel world to the next, pursued by those who would snuff out all good & hope everywhere.A memorable, breathtaking heroic adventure about honor & bravery as two likeable children about to enter their teens take on the mantle of responsibility to save those they love & their separate worlds.Philip Pullman has composed, like a rousing symphony for an orchestra made up of every school band in the world, a formidable, intelligent & exciting story in which the struggle for dominance between those expelled from the Kingdom of Heaven is coming to a head & where good, at great cost, will survive.I have read nothing quite like HIS DARK MATERIALS & if your nerves are strong, your imagination vivid & you have a questing spirit, you will also be as impressed. Certainly not for the religiously squeamish or narrow minded."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are beautifully written, thoughtful and, in the end, hopeful. The story will hold the imagination of children that have enjoyed Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and the like. I suppose if you are a staunch Christian, you should stay away.

This trilogy may offend christians. But trust me, its not too bad. The author's main goal was NOT to put down christianity, but to express how life should be lived honorably and to the fullest. The main character Lyra is a caring, trustworthy, stong, and loving girl who's actions are very \\"christian\\" in value. Only the most gullible of christians would be influenced to abandon their religion after reading this story. I dont recommend this trilogy to the close-minded!This trilogy has and will continue to make a great impact on readers (IN A POSTITIVE WAY). The story of young love may jerk a few tears (as it did mine). Besides \\"Of Mice and Men\\" (when george has to shoot lenny) this was the only book that made me cry. This story makes ou ponder abot life also. i first read this book during some \\"dark times\\". it made me realize that life is to be lived to the fullest and cherished. we only have a short time to live, so we might as well make it memorable."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read a great deal of bad, and extremely bad sci-fi, and fantasy books. I'm unsure why it is that those two genras of fiction are so often bent on pornography and unreasonable amounts of blood-shed. What I like about this trilogy, having just finished the last book a couple nights back, is the stark lack of either of these characteristics that generally typtify the scope of sci-fi/fantasy. It echos the emotions and ideas/interests of other great(er) stories --The Little Prince or the Narnia Series for philosophy and theology, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for description of worlds, like our own, yet so terribly beautiful and different, and The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings for the increadibly important and epic battle between good (right) and evil (wrong).The hero and heroine are sympathetic characters, they are 'human' (neither perfectly good nor increadibly bad). They are forced by circumstance (a.k.a. the author's slightly heavy-handed manipulation of his characters) to make adult choices and through that process grow up themselves, feel love, and change the world(s) around them.In short (though it's already too late for that), it's good, honest writing, that deserves more than one reading by anyone old enough (or young enough in spirit) to be considered a \\"young adult.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Lyra is amazing. to compete against pure evil and win in book 1 and win is an unmeasurable feat!Will is also a person i admire(fiction or no fiction)then to come together they a a force to be reconed with!Excellent"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In a magical world similar to our own, it begins when a young girl sneaks into a college study and hears things she oughtn't. It ends when a young woman vows to build the Republic of Heaven in her own world.Between is a surpassingly marvelous adventure, switching among universes with kaleidoscopic abandon and filled with such wonders as armored bears, a knife so sharp it can cut passageways between universes, and a mysterious golden dust that permeates all the universes. But with the wonders come horrors: eerie scavengers that can eat your very soul, a brutal regime that performs unspeakable experiments on children, a passage through the land of the dead, guarded by harpies.Pullman is both a master storyteller and a master stylist. These books read clearly and easily, and no matter how extraordinary what he's depicting is, it's clear. He begins simply enough, in an Oxford similar to our own, though everyone has a daemon - a sort of familiar - and there is magic in the air. The first concern is that children are mysteriously disappearing, though this leads to a trip to cold northern lands (where the children have been taken) and eventually to our own world. The stakes and scope continue to build until the conflict is between the forces of Heaven, who want to control the worlds, and those who would wish to go their own way. Pullman develops a unique, \\"magic humanist\\" (as contrasted with secular humanist) viewpoint, telling a gripping tale while making a statement for human reason and individuality versus authority.A classic trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a new reader of Philip Pullman ( and now most likely his greatest fan ) , I had a hard time over the first 100 pages , but was completely involved in the story and bonded to the characters after.I never had so much fun and pain reading books like in this case, especially because Pullman here deals with the major features of life - faith, religion, deception and most important love ! I was completely overwhelmed by the power and depth of The Amber Spy Glass as I never expected a children's book being so dark and serious without being heavy .I will miss Lyra and Pantalaimon very much , in fact while reading the books I caught myself more than once hoping and wishing I could ( or would ) have a Daemon !"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of \\"His Dark Materials.\\" For pure \\"good read\\" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling. Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is pure and original in its imaginative scope. Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain. While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it. Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the \\"dark force in the universe.\\" I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Trojans as they appear from within. Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts. For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy. I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of \\"His Dark Materials.\\"To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people. It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.I understand that a movie version of \\"His Dark Materials\\" is already in the works. If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books. Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children. Okay, I know I'm not being realistic. It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader. He will also be a multi-millionaire.Well played, Mr. Pullman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Since I have been bugged for not giving a product description in my reviews, I will get that over with. These are amazing book, no one \\"kills\\" God, the representation of God dies after living a life oppressing the multi-verse and while arrogant peoples who want to follow their faith without thinking for themselves will disagree, it's not far from truth.When Phillip Pullman wrote these books, he was NOT promoting atheism. That's a very selective and arguably small audience. He was making an allegory on how people in our day and age live for the afterlife.Before posting a comment calling me arrogant, Monotheists, consider the following.If in the final seconds of life, you look back on your life, in the reasonably large chance there is nothing more, no Heaven or Hell, will you say you lived a good life worshiping something that wasn't there?I'm sure there's people out there who agree with me. And after the dismal results at the cinemas, whether you agree with my views or not, I say we do exactly what Phillip Donahue did to us; make Prince Caspian a failure and ensure there to be no more Narnia films since he did that to the vast amount of fans of His Dark Materials.I don't no how to make a website, but I say someone does. We can stand up as a force and not go see Prince Caspian. When it fails, poor little Donahue will cry himself to sleep wondering what's become of the world.THIS IS NOT AN ANTI-CATHOLIC OR PLUS-ATHEISM IDEA! THIS IS TOO PULL SO CALLED CHRISTIAN FILMS DOWN ALONG WITH THE SO CALLED ATHEIST FILMS! THE GOLDEN COMPASS MOVIE WAS VAAAAASTLY SUPERIOR TO NARNIA AND AS SUCH&lt; IT DESERVES BETTER! TOGETHER WE CAN GET A SEQUEL, BY DRAGGING THE OTHERS DOWN!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy was one of the most annoying works I have ever read. (And I have read a lot - I'm a retired English Lit teacher and adjunct professor.) The cosmology of this story is not only deeply, deeply flawed, it is inconsistent, ill-conceived and poorly conveyed. I felt that I was waiting in suspense for a overarching explanation that would clarify how it was that good was evil and evil was actually good, but I was left instead with a confused collection of twisted scenes from Paradise Lost that was obviously written by an author with a hatred of the Church and disdain for Christianity as a whole.I have read that Pullman considers himself an atheist, yet this is not the work of an atheist. Consider that the books require a cosmology that includes a God (the Authority,) His angels, and fallen (Rebel) angels. A true atheist isn't against God - that acknowledges God's existence. An atheist does not believe in a spiritual world at all.Pullman writes well at times, but many characters are flat and evoke little interest. His novum of visible animal souls is a creative stroke of genius - and I think a strong contender for why so many people are enamoured of the books. Pullman is, in the end, unable to pull it all together to create a world where there is a moral structure that works. He manipulates the forms well, brilliantly at times, but left me with a distinct empty feeling, and one of disatisfaction.These books are not for children, and I would question the appropriateness of providing them to children without some sort of guidance - again, these are not godless - as the Harry Potter novels have been acused of - these are books in which God is killed.Pullman is an artist, but his art is used to twist things so far that even his best efforts are incapable of connecting them again, and so this trilogy falls as flat as a Saturday morning cartoon that readily reveals that it's true goal is simply to sell toys to children, not to tell a story. Only Pullman isn't just selling harmless toys."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them. They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off. I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book. That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison. However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book. Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12. As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me. Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment. It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories. Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity. Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam. There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden. Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay. However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth. I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.I would never recommend these books to anyone. Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first enjoyed The Golden Compass by itself, and found it to be a compelling, well-developed story. I later read the second and third books in the trilogy and was both impressed by the detailed world created by Pullman and shocked by some of the apparent bias of the author.Although I am a strong advocate for free-speech and I am happy that I read these books, I am also an adult who enjoys comparing differing religious viewpoints. For those who hold strong Judeo-Christian beliefs, this can be a very disturbing series. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER 14 READ THESE BOOKS BEFORE THEY BUY THEM FOR THEIR CHILDREN. In my opinion, the books are a direct, literal attack on \\"God\\", and will likely raise questions that I believe should be discussed by families.I am also upset that the author's bias does not appear until the second book, allowing readers (i.e. parents and teachers) to read the Golden Compass and determine it to be acceptable, referring young readers to it who then go on to the Subtle Knife and the Amber Spyglass on their own, without adult guidance on the issues raised."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First, I went into it with the understanding that it was an atheistic book. And maybe the metaphor he uses simply isn't (to me) accurate and he does mean the antagonists to represent organized religion, not God Himself, but to me, the metaphor seems almost pro-Satan. Again, it may be that I'm being a bit too technical when looking at the metaphor. But when you take character A and equate it to God, then character B does NOT, to me, represent atheism or free thinking, but Satan himself. Or maybe you're supposed to take it a step further, and believe Satan *is* Man and there are no forces of Good and Evil, but rather, Human and a tyrannical higher being. But I was surprised by how the tone of the book (seems to) denounce the actual Person of God, not organized religion. I also found the POV a bit one-sided. Apparently, if you are a God follower, you must be stupid or evil, end of story.Second, I found his writing style so bad, I'm surprised it made it past the first editing, much less the final. He writes in the third person, but he jumps perspectives within the same page, sometimes within the same paragraph. You don't follow the characters' thoughts very well, because he's constantly jumping from one to another. Additionally, he tries the metaphor technique, but he obviously thinks his audience is too stupid, so he barrels through with an explanation. Seriously...if you're going to use a metaphor for a story, stick with it. Don't SUDDENLY explain EXACTLY in REAL LIFE what is happening because to do so, you must leave the story. In this way, he reminds me of Ayn Rand, who will spend 4 pages on a monologue about real ideas in an otherwise symbolic storyline, but at least her writing style was superb; his is not. Also, everyone -- from the main children character to people who seem to represent the Vatican -- speak in what I assume is supposed to be a low class English (except for the \\"Texan\\", whose verbage seems to be based on John Wayne movies). Another thing he does that annoys me is, he fills in parts of the plot by having the characters simply tell a story about how something happened,; the audience does not experience the events as part of the story, but is simply told via the character telling someone else. He also uses the word \\"desperately\\" a lot even when it really didn't make sense (\\"she was desperately hungry\\", \\"He seemed desperately naive\\", \\"Ann desperately wanted to just finish the series\\").Third, some of the ideas are so complex, it's obviously geared towards adults or older audiences. But he tries (to me) to really emulate CS Lewis' simple style (I think he wrote the trilogy in response to the Narnian Chronicles), who writes the NC for children. It just doesn't work. It might have if he had stayed within the story but he REALLY REALLY REALLY wants to MAKE SURE you know what he's trying to say. He is not a subtle writer, in which case he shouldn't try to use a subtle technique.Fourth, the entire series is plot-driven. I have always been of the thought that any good book/show/movie is character-driven, and you may disagree. But he makes his characters act how they need to act to move the plot along, even if you might think it's very out of character. I didn't feel any of the characters, not even the main characters, or the different worlds, had any depth. He tells you WHAT the characters think/do but not why.Those are my gripes. Overall, if he had simply stuck with the story, then this would have been a very good children's series, written for juvenile audiences. But he wants to make sure you know he has higher ideas behind it. I think the Narnian Chronicles (and maybe the Lord of the Rings...there is some debate if Tolkien also meant his series to be religious) work because you are never 100% certain Lewis MEANT it to be religious. In fact, reading it as a kid, I didn't realize there was any Christian connotation. But Pullman pulls too many direct parallels to the Bible and the Catholic Church, he leaves no doubt where he is trying to head. One parallel at the end made me LOL; it was so absurd...just ONE MORE NAIL...DO YOU GET IT? SEE WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU? I HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS ONE TOO, JUST IN CASE THE MILLION OTHER UNSUBTLE HINTS I GAVE LEFT YOU ANY DOUBT. I tried to just read it as an enjoyable fiction but he keeps slamming you with these comparisons so it becomes a chore to read.Oh one more gripe -- he obviously only has a problem with Western religion, not organized in general. Apparently the Taoists and Buddhists had it right, though."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The children in this series spend no time at all being children, and even kids forced to grow up quickly are still not little adults in their decision making. The series is inventive and clever, though the main characters are never believable. This is somewhat OK because it is aimed at children, and they may like their heroes to have baggage but remain uncomplicated. I don't know where else it has been tried, but it probably didn't succeed there either.The trilogy also is stocked with too many characters. It suffers from too many minor players taking up time that should have been spent developing the characters of the mains. There is next to no character development, so you either buy these twelve year olds as the saviors of the multiverse or you do not. I didn't.Because of the length of the series, and the time commitment to something so predictable, I can't recommend it. I am giving it more stars than you may think from the review, because the author did try something different with the plot, and can turn a sentence well. Better an ambitious failure than mediocrity."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is simply great writing, and acheives a level that the Harry Potter books do not. I highly recommend them, and I offer a bit of advice to the Christian zealots who can't stand any book that doesn't follow their narrow little path: get a life."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I wish I had better, more wonderful things to say about these books, but unfortunately I do not.I will start by saying that reading through the first two books was a treat, and I thoroughly enjoyed them, anxiously awaiting the ending to the story. However, reading the third and final book killed my enthusiasm for all three novels entirely. Without giving away the ending, it seems to me as if the author crafted these books merely to push a personal agenda, which may or may not jive with that of the individual reading the books. His story would have resonated better had he left some level of mystery around his ending, allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions, rather than explicitly telling us what to take away from the story. And therein lies the series' ultimate failing.I will conclude by saying that this trilogy is not for everyone. Some may like it's ideas, others may hate them. I would suggest though that any parent should read through the entire series before passing it on to their children. It certainly wouldn't be something I'd introduce to my young children, though adults should make up their own opinion about it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's Trilogy was highly touted as the last great fantasy work of the 20th Century alongside C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. I began to read The Golden Compass after having seen the movie, which was well produced. I found the literary quality of Pullman's work poor and would in no way classify this good or great literature. In terms of theme, the fantasy seeks to develop and explore an atheistic worldview. Thus, for example, one of the positive characteristics of Lyra Belacqua, the protagonist, is courage. But in an atheistic framework, this only amounts to self-assertion against all odds and authority. The value of such a work for our children is questionable."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Not a bad way to spend a few hours, but there are much better ones."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read these books and I thought they were pretty good. They would never replace Artemis Fowl or some of my other many favorites, but they were good enough for me to read the whole trilogy. If you liked these or if you were lukewarm to it like me, try Garth Nix. He's good."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this series on the advice of a friend who was enamored with it, after finishing them I confess I really don't understand the appeal. Pullman is most known for being an outspoken atheist , this was the only really original part of what was a mediocre fantasy series. It's clear plot came behind extolling his religious views.This is also morally problematic when you think about it, I'm not a theist but the idea of a children's book where the main characters have to fight and destroy the Catholic Church and the Judeo-Christian God only promotes intolerance. There is even a scene where characters kill a key figure from Jewish mythology who is trying to commit rape, sensitive to other cultures this book is not. Even if Pullman disagrees with other's religious views is portraying violence against any religious group as heroic something we want to teach to children?Even these issues aside there is not much original here. The first book's steampunk world is vaguely interesting but not something fantasy readers haven't seen before. Later books introduce the \\"real world,\\" which means that Pullman tries to write political intrigue that reads like a bad Dan Brown novel. The character's aren't gratingly bad but I am hard pressed to describe anything interesting about them not based on appearance or their role in the plot. There are some cool concepts, armored talking polar bears stand out, but nothing that I think will be remembered in 5 years.Final verdict, if your adult skip it. If your thinking about it for your child, even if you're an atheist, think about it's message first."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"By the end of the first chapter, you will be ready for the next book. It's that captivating. Never before have the complex issues of science, religion, love, innocence, and growing up been addressed in such a tasteful and understandable way. The characters are easy to identify with and, while there isn't much humor, the edge-of-your-seat suspense will keep you turning page after page after page. And when you're done with the entire trilogy, you'll beg for more. These books are my most prized possesion, and Philip Pullman is my all-time favorite author. READ THESE BOOKS!!! You'll never want to put them down."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The premise of the story held promise, but the story did not hold up to the end. The first two volumes held my interest, but the last volume became a jumble of characters and action. The story in the end seemed too far fetched for me (although this is fantasy). I assume the author is expressing his antiChristian and antireligious views through the story. I wonder if this will be one of the few instances when the movie will be better than the books. I hope so."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first 2 books - they were ok. The third, what a let down. I feel that I have a knack for picking trilogies that start out promising only to be utterly disappointed with the ending. The authors open hostility with the \\"magisterium\\" (it wasn't hard to see the the comparison to organized religion - especially on the Christian side) was almost amusing from an adult's perspective during the first 2 books. They had fantastical elements and yet I truly felt like the universe that Lyra was living in could have been an alternate universe for ours. The Ice Bears were a treat during the first book. The second book - well, that too was fantastical, but I wondered where things were going to go, because it got dark and creepy and the idea of the creatures that were created by the tares in the dimensions from the knife - I still after finishing the third book wasn't sure how that got resolved, or what their point in the whole story was.The first book was, despite the religious thing, fantastical and mythical and had an interesting plot. The gobblers stealing children; Lyra being able to read the compass (I can't spell what the book called it!); Oxford; the Ice Bears (awesome idea). And Pan - I absolutely adore Pan. I think he is my favorite part of the series. The idea of your conscious (or soul, maybe?) as a separate but integral part - the manifestation in the animal - is unique and I though was clever. But the turn this book took towards religion, yikes. I for one took it as hostility towards organized religion. But that was me. And to me, it wasn't veiled in the least. It was open and there for all to easily attempt to digest.The second book left me confused and disturbed. Getting introduced to the boy's universe was uncomfortable to say the least. The creatures that were created - were way to dark and creepy for me. I am in a lot of ways glad they haven't (yet anyway) attempted to make the second book into a movie - because I don't see any way it could reasonably be turned into a family film. It was more horror book then YA/fantasy. And, I still, after finishing the third book, wasn't sure how that got resolved, or what their point in the whole story was. The knife and the idea of what it could do was almost a distraction. Honestly, I think a slightly different ending to book one should have been the end to the series. The author should have left well enough alone.The third book... well, I guess this was supposed to be the redemption? Learning about how a world/dimension/universe (what ever) gets created? And yet the hostility towards the Magesterium didn't stop. So was the message supposed to be that we should embrace religion but be weary of organized churches? That is certainly one way I could have felt. And I guess I did. But I was more bothered by issues left unresolved by this book. And I was still bothered by the idea that was left \\"out there\\" that hitting puberty turns one evil. I mean really, is that what children should be taught? I guess there are certain groups of people that believe that way, but I am not. And I took some offense to what this series seemed to stand for in many ways. I understand the hostility towards the church, but I think books aimed at children that are so overtly religious should come with warnings, so that I know to avoid them. And I think teaching intolerance, which is one of the themes I got from this series, is unacceptable no matter what age the audience is.The third installment made me draw a lot of similarities towards the Magician's Nephew (I think... the one were we see the development of a new world). And it's not a novel take on the idea. And frankly, the writing isn't as good. Point me towards the Narnia Chronicles anytime over this set. (And, the religiousness isn't quite as in-your-face in those as it is here).I read a review where there was a quote that stated: \\"Philip Pullman contends that 'There are some themes, some subjects, too large for adult fiction; they can only be dealt with adequately in a children's book.' \\" I hate to disagree, but I think there are clearly some themes that should not be dealt with in a children's book, and Philip Pullman should have steered clear of some of the themes he tried to tackle. I don't know if they were too big for a children's book (and honestly, should have been dealt with in an adult book) or if they were just too big for Mr. Pullman himself. Either way, I felt he didn't know how to end the series without getting so religious, I might as well have pulled out a bible if I wanted that much religion.As previously mentioned, I felt there was a lot of open hostility towards the church (and I am by no means a staunch church-go-er) during the first book (at least) so the turn around with how religious things got and how the message seemed to be that religion saves, caught me off guard.And the notion that hitting puberty turns you evil - is just something that I feel has no place in a child's book. A similar review I read called this a children's book that is \\"Christian\\" the same way the Chronicles of Narnia are Christian - and I wish I would have seen that review before reading these. I remember loving Narnia when I was younger, and now, as an adult who loves YA/Fantasy books, I can only read certain portions of the Narnia series because others are by far to pro-religion for me (and given what I said earlier about pointing me to Narnia anytime over this series... that says something!). And so, while to moral of the 3rd book has something to do with the establishment of religion (honestly, I wasn't sure exactly what it was) - I should have read the first 2 and then just read the Wiki article to see how the third concluded the series. I would not recommend this SERIES to anyone who doesn't want an opinion (good or bad) about religion shoved down their throat."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read all three books, and I enjoyed the first one. By the middle of book two, I kept going because I had already invested so much time and surely, I thought, the books would get better. I thought the third book was entirely tedious, and the ending was anti-climactic and disappointing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like another of the reviewers here, I really enjoyed the first book \\"The Golden Compass\\" when it came out here in the States. It was several years before I read the other two. I was really disappointed. Interwoven with some wonderfully clever ideas and interesting characters, the author ends up, after all the adventures and losses and deaths of most of the major characters with the stupidest ending. The two young people end up where they started--in many ways worse off than when the began. I was left asking: \\"What was the point? What was all of this FOR???\\" I was, frankly, angry before I reached the end, but stuck it out. I wanted my money back."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Read the first two books and throw the third away. In The Golden Compass, the first book of the Dark materials trilogy, Philip Pullman proves that he can tell a great story. The characters are engaging, the plot is interesting, the action exciting. The second book, The Subtle Knife, is only fair. The action continues, but the plot is obviously just keeping time until the third book, and the (too) numerous new characters are flat. The third book, The Amber Spyglass, reads like a rough draft, one that should have been thrown away. It is worse than not worth the paper it's printed on.In the third book, the plot is building toward two related climaxes: a battle between the forces of good and evil on the scale of Milton's Paradise Lost; and a more personal, individual quest to preserve \\"Dust,\\" the cause of consciousness in the universe. After a buildup of nearly three books, the best Pullman can do with his epic battle is to have a couple of humans drag the leader of the evil angels into a hole. Then, the universe is saved from a total loss of consciousness when the 2 13-year-old protagonists realize they are in love and--it is implied--have sex. Writing doesn't get any worse than that."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I reviewed all the books individually, going from five sta5rs for book one, then plummeting to one star for book three. I would give the overall series a 2. I have no axe to grind with Mr. Pullman's opinion of religion, but I do resent his letting it get in the way of competently completing his story. (And how anyone can think that religion, particularly roman Catholicism, is not the main focus of the story is beyond me.) The Amber Spyglass is a muddle from start to finish, with so many different ideas tossed together yet never developed that it was an exercise in frustration to force myself through to the ending. He has a great imagination, but he is as zealous and self-righteous in his own opinions as the Chruch that he is railing against. While that may be good fodder for a story, it is not in itself a good story. Hugely disappointing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I sit in my brother's bed room , gazing over all of the books in the shelf. I pick out a book, The Golden Compass, and my mother walks in.I ask, \\"Is this a good book?\\"She answers with, \\"It is a very dark book\\". She leaves it at that, she thought she scared me off. She didn't succeed, I walk to my bedroom and start reading.The Golden Compass is a dark book, not very dark, but a bit disturbing. The Golden Compass is the first book of a trilogy. Its sequel is The Subtle Knife . The last book in the series is The Amber Spyglass.It is amazing though how this book flips one's ideas upside down. The way the author, Phillip Pullman, does this \\"flip\\" is very gradual. In this way he doesn't throw you off the book by hitting you smack in the face with the crashing ideas of Good and Evil.Pullman convinces you to go with the main character's opinion of things through some great characterization.You have to use your imagination while reading this book or the book would be destroyed. I don't want to give the book away, but for you to understand this, you have to know that there are interactions between universes and there can be any kind of life form in that world. For example: when you find out that there are animals that roll on seeds as a form of transportation, you have to believe that in any world, anything can happen.Some things I didn't like about this book were that my opinion of almost all the supporting characters changed throughout the book. I think Pullman could have fixed that by changing less of the characters. If only a couple of people changed sides then the book would be a little less confusing.One would think those dark parts of the book would be bad, but they were very important to the book, and without them the book would not work.I enjoyed the way it ended. It ended with a suspenseful ending(like most series), but didn't leave you hanging. I would like for Phillip Pullman to write another book to follow The Golden Compass series. To write a follow up to The Golden Compass series would not be that hard. He would easily have enough material to write a short novel. The only other thing I didn't like was that my mother didn't like it. My mothers dislike of the series makes it less enjoyable to talk about The Golden Compass around her.These minute flaws in the book are diluted though by a very thoughtful and well done series of novels. The Golden Compass is a thrilling and ambitious series. I loved the amount of characterization put into this trilogy. It is a breathtaking and a terrific story. You have to read it to believe it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Spectacular and the most satisfying read, across all genres, in recent years. The Golden Compass, originally entitled 'The Northern Lights' in the UK, is the first part of the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy. Already showered by numerous prices (Carnagie Medal, Parent's Choice Gold Award, Whitbread Book of the Year, among others) the story is soon to become a major motion picture and is already available in a very accomplished audiobook version with a full cast of actors and Philip Pullman, himself, as the narrator. The story revolves around a young girl, Lyra, as she embarks on an epic journey, in a parallel, and slightly different, universe to ours, away from the innocence of her childhood and into experience and wisdom. The first aspect worthy of mention is the quality of Philip Pullman's writing style: precise, sharp and witty, not a single word seems out of place. The reader finds himself/herself engaged on a highly emotional level. Yes, you will cry at the end of the trilogy but you are likely to emerge a better person when all is said and done. The many layers to the story will make it accessible to a 12 year old and yet captivate a 50 year old. The second dimension that appeals to me in particular, as an Aerospace Engineer, are the scientific elements skillfully sprinkled to enhance the narrative without any awkward heaviness or inane babble. Quantum Physics, Mathematics, String Theory and Astrophysics find a happy home along side witches and armored bears. As an example:'...think of Adam and Eve like an imaginary number, like the square root of minus one: you can never see any concrete proof that it exists, but if you include it in your equations, you can calculate all manner of things that couldn't be imagined without it...'. How true. The study of vibrations, such as the response of an aircraft wing to a wind gust, could not be performed without the square root of minus one. Third, a profound knowledge of literature and history make for a very fulfilling read. The story borrows from John Milton's Paradise Lost. Parallels between Pullman's Lord Asriel and Milton's Lucifer in their respective roles as Rebels are plain to see. Lyra's family name, Belacqua can be found in Dante's Divine Comedy (The Purgatory). The premise for parallel universes originates from choices being made. Universes come into being for each choice path. Pullman's Universe could have split from ours around the 16th century, when the Calvinist Reform took place. In Pullman's universe, Calvinism, not Catholicism, became the dominant Christian faith. One of the consequences is that none of the reforms that transformed our modern church into a kinder, gentler institution ever took place in Lyra's world. Truly destined to become a literature classic."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this series a few years ago and I fell in love with it. After finishing the last page of the Amber Spyglass, I bawled my eyes out. I was very moved with the conclusion of the series, and was shocked by the unexpected ending. Though I read this series a while ago, I still remember almost every detail, and often think back on it when I am reading other books. This series was one of those that you read, and when you are done reading it all you want to do is find another book just like it. If you read this series and don't like it, i would be shocked. I have made all of my friends read it, and they, too, loved it. When I read any other novel, I always compare it to this series, and yet, no other book that i have ever read has ever matched up to be as good as this. I love everything about this series, and am always looking to find another book equally as touching.Hopefully, Phillip Pullman will someday make a sequal to this series. Pullman writes with such poetry and emotion that you actually feel as though yo are one of the characters. He also is one of the most imaginitive authors ever. Pullman inspired me to want to grow up, go to Oxford University, and try to eventually be an excellent author just like him!Thank you to Phillip Pullman for writing a novel that helped me decide what i would like to do with my life."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are not only fantasy and adventure, but a learning experience as well. They open your mind to new ideas and new feelings. Will, Lyra, Pan, Mrs. Colter, Lord Aiseral and other characters are very animated. The main characters (Will and Lyra) become great friends starting in the second book. These books are good for mature readers who will understand and appreciate the book. If you read this, you won't be able to stop, so make sure you have a lot of time on your hands."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is, by far, one of the great books I have ever read. My brother read it before my and kept going on and on about how wonderful it was. He wouldn't shut up about it, and, so, I picked it up, and don't regret doing it a bit. By the time I finished The Golden Compass, I was captured."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Holy wow!! Thses books were recommended to me by a sales associate to tide me over until Harry Potter the 5th book was to come out. What a good set!!It has geat characters and settings. However, these books are not for those whom do not have a vivid imagination. Worlds are taken apart and put back together - both spiritualy and physically! Be prepared to use your imagination and get ready for a great story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass by Phillip Pullman is one of the most amazing books that I have read in a long time. I was absolutely shocked and absorbed into this book and could not put it down. This book has many characteristics that could pull any reader into it. It has the elements of mystery, fiction, suspense, magic, supernatural, realism, and so much more. This book is not for a specific gender or type of reader and would be great to use in an upper elementary or middle school level. Because of the twists and the story line I think that even high school students and adults would enjoy this selection immensely.The way that this book was weaved is astonishing. It reminds me of the way that Stephen King weaves his books, or even John Grisham, or Tom Clancy. At the beginning of the story very little is known but there hints given here and there that make the reader want to continue and figure out what is going on. As the book proceeds the reader is dying to know and understand what is going on. Pieces are slowly added up, but the puzzle cannot be figured out until the last piece at the end is finally put in. When I read the end everything was finally put together and I completely understood what was going on. I was saddened but relieved at the same time. Then to only enhance the readers' suspense the books ends with a new beginning for a sequel. I have decided that I have to find the sequel and read it now or I won't be able to go on!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were awesome! I got them for Christmas and didn't start untill mid Jan, because they looked boring! My Mom told me it would be nice if I read them and they were awesome! You can't put them down! I reccomend them at this price anyday!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ok,so these books do have dark parts.But that's life,take the good with the bad.During the first few pages of The Golden Compass,I was hooked.I love the plot and how Lyra had a tough life.She stumbles upon a door to a different world and gets taken on an adventure she'll never forget.The Golden Compass has to do with an artifact with special powers.In the Subtle Knife,Lyra meets Will,who finds a knife that can open up doors to the other worlds.The Amber Spyglass is when Will and Lyra go on a trip,I won't say where.I love all three!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I though these three books were amazing. I have read each of them several times because they are so great. Like all of his other books this has an excellent plot and story line.This is a truly amazing book which I highly recomend.I am an extreamly fussy reader but I thought this book was sensational.I would have to rate it at 10/10 or maybe 9.999/10"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I hate it when people compare these books to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, because they are something completely original. I love this books. The ideas are kind of complex for kids, but anybody could enjoy these. There's not exactly much to say except that these books are incredible, and recommended to anyone with a little imagination."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I stumbled across this series totally by accident. Thinking that they were just going to be the typical teen fantasy, I wrote them off and didn't give them a chance. Until one day, I decided to try it. I'm not a good writer so my review won't do this series justice. I won't go into the plot of this book but to say that it follow a young girl's adventures and this statement is far too simple to describe this series. No matter your age, this book grabs your attention, pulls you in, and makes you think! Be prepare for a good surprise. This series isn't what you think it is. It's sooo much more than some teenager fantasy. I still find that my mind wonders back to this series quite often. There are plenty of other reviews to say more of the books, but I have to say that Mr. Pullman is a genius. Thank you for writing this superb series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you LOVE Harry Potter, than pick up His Dark Materials. These books are about a twelve year old girl named Lyra Silvertonuge, (my favorite charater) and her adventures with her deamon Pantaliamon, her friends Serafina Pekkala, the queen of her witch clan, Iorek Byrnison, the bear king, the Aletheometer, the truth instrument that Lyra learns to read, and her new friend Will Parry, who becomes more than a friend...This book is the best after Harry Potter. It is something worth picking up and reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am reading something now that is a lot of fun, and great writing: the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman. It's a series of young-adult novels with multiple worlds and realities and an eventual battle against God or \\"The Authority\\", lived mostly through the eyes of two kids, Lyra and Will. Everyone in Lyra's universe has a daemon, which is kind of like a physical manifestation of your soul, usually in animal form. In some ways it is like the shamanic power animal that's always with you, or a witch's familiar, but even more \\"you\\" than any of those things. The author's imagination is rich and his storytelling superb. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are on the very top of my list. I have read them each twice and each time finding new depth and meaning to every word. As an avid reader i have found nothing more enjoyable to many ages as the Dark Materials Trilogy. It is a must-read book for everyone no matter what the beleifs. His portrayal of each religion is superior in its content and deliverance. There are no equals to these books and give it only the highest praise. YOU MUST READ THESE BOOKS!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved the first two of these books, but the last one I didn't enjoy as much as the first two. The first book (The Golden Compass) introduces Lyra Silvertongue. You learn all about her life and world and it's very interesting. In the second book (The Subtle Knife) the author introduces Will Parry, a boy who finds Lyra and they stick together until the end of the series. The second book is very good as well and I thought the whole deal with the subtle knife was awesome! The third book (the amber spyglass) was okay, but I didn't like the whole plot and it just didn't seem as good to me as the first two. But if you want to understand the whole series then I suggest you read all of the books. It confused me for a while who the good people were and who the bad people were. All in all, the books are pretty good."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ok so maybe its not for children...BUT...it does say recomended for young adult. I read these books all through my middle school years so 13 at the oldest. I'm not warped, I didn't turn out anti-christian. Those easily offended are warned to stay away, but those who belive substance is more than a surface explination of the authors views on god read it. Its amazing. Full of plot, and characters that are so rich and deep, and alagorical yet focused and clear at the same time. It is by far one of the pioneering books of my time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Don't be put off by the comparisons to Harry Potter or the awards that it has won in the Young Readers community. This is an excellent series; both thought-provoking and entertaining. The characters are well developed, and the premise is refreshingly original. While the books are certainly suitable for younger readers, more mature readers can pick up on the philisophical and theological undertones that your average child might miss. It's nice to read an engaging fantasy that is not a Tolkien or Jordan knock-off. It starts a tad slow, but don't give up. By the middle of the first book, you'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I was flicking through a book catalogue, like some silly little moth I was immediately attracted to the 'pretty' cover of Northern Lights (Golden Compass for Americans), and so it is fair to say 'judge a book by its cover'. Little did I know I would be entranced by the consistent brilliance of His Dark Materials. Not only are the characters and settings the most exotic ever seen in a book (forget Hogwarts) but it has real meaning, the only book I've ever read to make me laugh, cry, shiver with suspense, and genuinely think. For many days after reading the final chapter YOU will ponder on the meaning of HDM, which seemingly has no definitive 'message'.Easily the greatest book ever written (in my biased opinion. But I have read some other classics- If you really like fine details of HDM you'll love Lord of the Rings)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a great book series. I have read the intire series and am very pleased. These are the best books I have read! I higly recomend these books!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There is no doubt that Mr. Pullman is a outstanding writer. Books like these could only be crafted by a master. They are the kind of books you can't put down because you've just got to see what happens next.I wanted to read these books after the comments in the newspaper about Mr. Pullman advocating atheism in the movie adaptation of the first of the three books, \\"The Golden Compass.\\" I did not see anything to suggest that in the movie at all, but of course the Catholic Church forbade their members to see it, and others protested, most likely without even seeing it or knowing what it was about. I feel sorry for people whose minds are closed and who mindlessly obey authority without question. That is what these books are about. I find it hard to reconcile myself with the idea that we are in the 21st century with so many people like this around. As a matter of fact, if you look back at science fiction stories and movies of 50, 40, 30 even 20 years ago you will see that most of the writers expected us to be far more advanced in every way than we are in the 21st century, unless you want to call human robots an advancement."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This particular story has seemed to cause quite the stir among the religious people i know. I can see why, but it is just a story. I find it to be fanciful and entertaining. And so far as people who think it is blasphemous, it is no worse than any other persecution of religion by other religion that has been going on for centuries. I recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy. All you Darwinians out there would LOVE this series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm sure that plenty of people have already reviewed this series, so I'll keep it simple. It's a great fantasy read for all ages and I would definitely recommend checking it out if you have the chance."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It is hard to believe that Pullman's trilogy would be classified alongside books dealing with the trials and tribulations of dating and adolescent maturation. Although the protagonist Lyra surely matures throughout the three novels, there is SO MUCH MORE to be gained from reading these remarkable books than I would have dared to fathom had I read them as a &quot;young adult.&quot; To give away the political and religious allegories would be criminal, but suffice to say, these are probably the best books I have read in this genre--equal, if not in some cases surpassing: The Chronicles of Narnia, The Ring Trilogy, and Harry Potter.The second book, the Subtle Knife, is a little less in the way of character development than the Golden Compass, but it was definitely to Pullman's advantage to wait as long as he did to write the Amber Spyglass. Unlike other sequels and series, this conclusion to the trilogy does not disappoint and only makes you wish it wasn't the conclusion.You will inevitably find the character(s) you identify with most and be rooting for that character throughout your reading. However, be warned: Pullman does not feel it necessary to have happy endings for everyone and every circumstance. Herein lies the true value of these books...the harshness and elation to be found in reality, in a fantasy context."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the heck happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in the third.Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up \`anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him.In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . . all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?! And what happened to the \`temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the \`reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in God or anything for that matter!This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.We never get closure on Lyra's parents.We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from.We never see Will reunited with his mother.We get a lame battle where \`god' dies and no one even knows why or how.Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to \`sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it.The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing.The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of dissolves.Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.Another reader pointed out:\\" Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly.\\"It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd.This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life.[...]"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an excellent series that must be read. It does no more harm then any Bible Story or Narnia does, all of which are based on pure fantasy. Those insecure with their own belief system will of course find the series disturbing; after all they are stuck in a mind set that any questioning or blantant opposition to their religion is to not exist. However, that is not the case now days and HIS DARK MATERIALS could not have been made into a film series at a better time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There are a series of myths and taboos taken on by the author in this series, and he does it extremely well. I enjoyed the series completely, and wish that there were more follow-on novels to join it.Pullman, did a masterful job with character development and visuals, it will be interesting to see how they translate to the theater.I am a senior adult, and found the stories challenging and entertaining. This series is a good foundation for future reading in philosophy, you might go to the DaVinci Code next, if you haven't already."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a teenager I enjoyed reading the 'Lord of the Rings', 'Narnia' and a few years later, well outside my childhood years, I did derive significant pleasure from the Harry Potter series. As an adult though, these novels register as good works of fantasy well worth their entertainment value but it stops there. (Although I still envy the young mind that opens the Lord of the Rings for the first time). Philip Pullman's trilogy 'His Dark Materials' plays in a different league altogether. A child will enjoy it for the adventure and breathtaking storytelling. An adult will find the retelling of the \\"Felix Culpa\\", with a twist, very titillating and the penmanship mesmerizing. This work truly ranks with the likes of Selma Lagerlof's (1909 Nobel literature Prize winner) 'Gosta Berling Saga'. A true Masterpiece for all ages. Already showered with numerous awards, the best indicator of the excellence of this work is in the passionate debate it generates."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was complete, I told my daughters that I wished they would make a movie of this trilogy. Each book gets better, and the last one in the series brought tears on more than one occasion. It is an absolutely wonderful read -- read all three books to my daughters, starting with the Golden Compass when they were 8 and 11. Some parents may think too much violence."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This epic trilogy is closer in tone to Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_than the _Harry Potter_ books, but religion and philosophy take center stage. It's still a battle of Good versus Evil, where Pullman updates Milton and Blake by questioning a LOT of assumptions.With the Catholic Church scandal revealing painful new developments every day, Pullman's work becomes even more timely. Are institutions created to teach morality capable of staying moral? Can moral authorities resist authoritarianism? Which is more important, the integrity of the institution or protecting our most vulnerable citizens? All these issues come to fore in _His Dark Materials_.Written as a fantasy-adventure featuring 2 pre-teens, Lyra and Will, this three-volume set features an alternate Oxford (UK) where everyone has a animal-daemon who stays close at hand, intrigue in our own Oxford and the travel between the two, a dangerous Mediterranean world where soul-sucking wraiths only kill adults, and the underworld of the dead. Armored and intelligent polar bears figure, along with corrupt church adminisrators who kidnap and experiment on children.Pullman clearly detests the evil done in the name of religion, which is why the Good and Evil discussion gets intricate. He is not necessarily anti-Catholic or anti-Christian but anti-authoritarian. Anyone who has studied European history will recognize the characterization of a corrupt and overly powerful Church (denomination never specified in this book, btw). Lyra and Will are bringing The Enlightenment to several worlds who are as politically forward as pre-Reformation Europe, and must defeat powerful forces who have no interest in power-sharing. The books work both as a springboard to the Big Questions and as an allegory for growing up and finding one's own way.Literate, informed, evocative, and conceptually brilliant, this supposed Young Adult release will captivate adults as well."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Regardless with whether you agree with the author's political and/or religious (or lack there of) convictions, this is an extraordinarily well written series. Imaginative and compelling with unique and engaging characters. I do agree with some of Mr. Pullman's detractors that these books should not be marketed towards children. I do, however, think they're definitely good for Young Adults and Adult readers. Some of the themes take a bit more critical thinking than most children are capable of doing before high school. There is also a great deal of violence, that while necessary to the plot, I wouldn't let children under 13 read unless it were under the supervision of an adult who could explain some of the more adult matters to them.A side note to several reviewers who basically found some information on a political webpage and decided to bring their political viewpoints into the review of material they obviously hadn't read. This is a review of a book, not the review of an author. If you don't agree with what he has to say in speeches, go post regarding those speeches. If you don't agree with what he has to say in his books, it would probably be a good idea to have READ those books. There are many reviews here that disagree with the \\"anti religious\\" sentiments of the author, however all those reviewers have either read the work, or read enough about the work to be able to fake it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought the first two books of this trilogy several years ago for my brother for Christmas. He neglected them for a long time, so I decided to pick up The Golden Compass and give it a try. It took me a little bit to get into it, but once I did, I was hooked. As soon as I finished the Golden Compass I picked up The Subtle Knife, and finished reading it in about 3 days (which is really fast for me, considering I'm not too big on reading) I then borrowed The Amber Spyglass from a friend of mine. This is the only book that has ever made me cry. Pullman is an extraordinary writer, I got so connected to the characters. Any words of praise I have for these books cannot possible do them justice, that's how good they are. This is definitly my favorite series of all time. It is a good investment for anyone who is into fantasy, and anyone who isn't."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"From my blog:There were a number of classic series that came out during my adolescence, and I really wish His Dark Materials had gotten more popular. I realize that all the religious changes in the third book got some people a bit huffy, but I really think that Pullman came up with some quality outside of the box worlds in this trilogy. If you've only see the \\"Golden Compass\\" movie, then honestly you don't know what you're missing. The trilogy is so different than the first book or movie and you should read them!Title: His Dark Materials (The Golden Compass is the first book)Author: Philip PullmanPages: ~400 each (paperback)Setting: The trilogy begins in an alternate UK, however our world is actually just a stone's throw away if you can step between realities! Several different and very interesting realities/worlds are visited in this trilogy, some rather conventional and some not at all!Premise: Lyra is the main character and she has a furry friend named Pan who is a reflection/part of her soul and changes shapes between lots of different animals. The first book is a typical plot about a bad/mysterious group kidnapping children and Lyra going to save them, but later in the trilogy things get much more philosophical. There is actually a whole lot more going on across all the parallel universes and Lyra and some other friends she meets along the way need to figure it out before Everything is destroyed.Strengths:A very interesting take on religion in the multiple worldsFemale main characterFuzzy animals companions :DThe trilogy has a completely different plot than you think after the first book (and movie)Very awesome supporting characters and very moving death scenes (not telling who though!)Pretty easy read, though it does get emotional occasionally (you might cry in an airport if you aren't careful >.>)Some really interesting worlds that Pullman came up with!Weaknesses:Because of the reinterpretation of religions, this might not be a good book for strongly religious people, specifically Christians might not appreciate how God is portrayedThe last book of the trilogy is not nearly as child-friendly as the firstThe second and third books have a very different feel from the first book/movie, which might be a good or a bad thing depending on your perspectiveIf you cry at books, these will probably make you cryI might just be weird, but I'm easily spooked by books/television shows and there are some spooky parts in this book involving dead peopleSummary: Very good trilogy with a much more complicated and intricate plot than what the first book suggests. I highly recommend these books if you aren't going to be insulted by some interesting reinterpretations of religion, specifically Christianity. The worlds that Pullman came up with and connected together are fantastically done in my opinion. These books are easy to read and easy to love I think and should totally be on a summer reading list!More reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a fundamentalist Christian, I read the trilogy out of curiosity and enjoyed the world the author created in the series. The characters had great depth, and the plot moved quickly and kept you interested. For entertainment purposes, it was a great read.I found the works no more anti-Christian than the works of Homer or other Greek mythology, etc. What I found slightly laughable was how overt the attack on Christian faith was in the 3rd installment. All the religious characters in the first 2 books had the veiled digs (the daemons for these characters were either reptiles or insects), but the attack in the 3rd is direct, openly mocking those with faith. Being secure in my faith, I can move on, but can only recommend the books with the warning that Pullman himself said he wrote the trilogy as an atheist's answer to The Chronicles of Narnia (which has some terrible theology in it as well). The story is engaging and enjoyable, but the philosophy is antagonistic to those of faith, so just know that going in."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I seldom read fiction. My taste tends toward Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Jane Adams. They tantilizingly tell me stories that are quite real.Philip Pullman is their match in everyway, save his are openly fiction, but paint a portrait of reality for anyone who seeks to learn that which they are forbidden. My favorite work within the Dark Materials trilogy is the Golden Compass. It exposes the attempts by a few, self-ordained/self-commissioned, to manipulate and control individual thought. These denizens of deprivation demonstrates how fragile democracy is, and Pullman patiently, patently, painfully illuminates the illustriousness of challenging the establishment: state, church, and/or vendor.What Philips does within a volume is wonderous. Few fellow wordsmiths weave tales as tantilizing and pungent as Philips; there is even a greater paucity of penetrating writings that are capable of exposing within a cornucopia of tomes by less gifted writers, especially among his detractors.Philips makes each word count. Each is pregnant with purpose, driven with desire, and basted with a hint of a better taste to come. Thus the \\"bears\\" in the Golden Compass are truly heroes who stand behind a proven leader, but the \\"bears\\" can be persuaded with reason to change that leader. The bears are quite different, than those who pontificate on maintaining orthodoxy within the realm transmogrified into an unholy alliance and bred into a monstrous cause. They are the true demons whose sole purpose is to secure the soul (mind) of mortals and twist it unendingly until it is but a broken reflection of their own game of denying reality.Finding children massed in a common room is quite common when one looks at today's education. In the classrooms I visit, and in the salons where I teach, students harken to outmoded memorization in quest of passing--without questioning the reality of what is learned. Rote remembrances are prized and the individual who can repeat what the instructor wishes to hear will pass and go on to further the ignorance of other generations. Seldom do we find those who think beyond the thoughts of the teacher, for such action is treachery and treason, and the \\"spirit\\" of the instructor will come down hard upon the apostate or heretic.While the unholy Inquisition of the late Middle Ages is not mentioned, only one unlearned in history would fail to see it hidden in the folds of the words crafted by Philips. Paper near-by, and the means of placing pigment on the paper becomes the key to freedom, for Philips notes that treason must move forever forward and exist if there is to be freedom. Freedom is but another word for the conduct of inquiry away from the staid and ossified learning of those who lecture not in quest of knowledge but for the paycheck. Thus the note that is passed within the den where the children sit as if they were those bound by dust in Plato's Cave, will behave obediently until one thinker realizes that the images they see are but shadows on a wall, and then rise to look behind--even at risk of losing one's status.While this trilogy makes no mention of the odiously opportunistic Opus Dei and the brutality that belches forth from its purveyors and predators, its rapier to rape the mind always in hand, it is quite well fleshed out on the corpus of the uncle who seeks out dust to know of what generated life. This is the key--there was no single entity that began the universe--but an explosion of matter tantamount to the explosion of knowledge: with no beginning and no end but an expanding push to higher reason.Philips gives us a measured response to Darwin, Hawking, Dawkins, Higgins and others who forever questioned, and casts doubt on those desiring to remain enchained in the mythologies without reason or purpose. Philip's subtle knife cuts through the tattered patchwork quilt of guilt forced upon mortals until it becomes a new spread for expanding awareness. It comes when one looks clearly through the glass of maturity, reason, and individuality, that I find to be a better testimony to the words of 1 Corinthians 13:1-8 and Philips reality is far more clear."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Still busy and still enjoying it. have to admit my main reason for reading it is to try and find out (for myself) why christians criticize this book so much.Its a great fantasy, and i really think its only controlling parents that need to be concerned. Or in cases where you think the reader cant differentiate between fiction and reality, as in too young a reader, and only in households where the parents want to enforce the \\"there is only one true faith and its the christian faith\\" ideal, or where you dont trust your kids to be able to make up their own minds. My reason's for this is that the book is very close to home, but with a twist. Not like a completely otherworldly fantasy that is \\"obviously\\" fiction. I suppose it cant plant ideas and doubts in maybe a tiny percentage of youngsters , the kinds of ideas and doubts very conservative christian parents would dislike. I'd recommend that those parents read the books themselves first and make an informed decision about what age a child/youngster should be before they read it.For all the open minded people out there - enjoy!!!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Everyone gets all wound up about books like this. It isn't \\"anti\\" anything. It is a great trilogy that explores science, philosophy, religion, human nature, and world nature. It idea that humans don't rule all OR know all.Anyone who likes to think and imagine and enjoys a great fantasy/adventure story will love this trilogy. Don't let anyone label you (or it) and keep you from enjoying it.It is a must read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Good series for adult and younger, the book and series far better than the movie"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"For years I've had my own ideas about how the universe works and was fascinated to find some of my ideas reflected in these books. The worlds and characters were engaging and fascinating -- You have witches and armored polar bears and a Texan who rides in a balloon, people who see their souls in the form of animals... It sound outlandish, but they come together beautifully. I managed to read all three books in just three days because I couldn't put them down. As other reviews have said, this is not children's literature -- young adult at the earliest. To understand much of the series you need to have some reference points in Christian theology -- specifically the concept of original sin -- and in the spotted history of the organized church.If you are familiar with the many worlds theory, the premise of the books is easy to understand. There is a strong anti-church/organized religion theme throughout the books so people with strong religious beliefs --including the belief that reading ideas that don't correspond with the bible are 'satanic' or 'evil' -- will not appreciate this series. The moral of the series, however, is profound. You won't regret reading these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is such a great series. One of those where you can't turn the pages fast enough. I understand some people were up about the religious undertones. Well that's hardly the point. It's just a solid series. Not sure what the age bracket is for this series, but small children might be frightened."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is my favorite series. I am not the kind of person that changes favorites every week. It has been my favorite for three years now, but I've liked it at least for six years. The books are spectacular. They are a higher reading level than lots of the other popular teen books. I read and liked the book first when I was eight. When I was ten and reread the books I realized I hadn't understood half of what was in the book. Basically, if you think you're missing something in the books you probably are. After practically studing the books I would say I understand them very well.Nearly everyone that meets Lyra, the main character, likes her. She is comfortable around people in general. She was always given free rein in Jordan College where her 'uncle' and guardian left her. She would lie but almost always people would believe her because of her innocent attitude toward life. That is how the first book, The Golden Compass, starts out. It describes Lyra's life. It takes some time to get going but that does not mean that it was a boring begining. When it got going it did not stop. The end of the book was an annoying cliff hanger. (Cliff hangers are always annoying, I think.)The next book, The Subtle Knife, starts out very different. It starts with a character named Will. It does not tell his life story (then) but it starts out in somewhat of an action scene. It is not long before he meets Lyra. Once more the story is Lyra's. There is a lot of action in the book and a lot of detours to the main goal. In the way that the first book was the set up for the story this book was the set up for the complexity of the story that is shown in the third book. Once more this book ended with a cliff hanger. It was even worse than the other and in the same way better.The third book, The Amber Spyglass, is where everything gets complicated. Mrs. Coulter's split alliances become more pronounced. Lyra's life gets, if possible, even more complicated. Will is sort of stuck in the middle of everything by his tie to Lyra. By the end of the book the changes the characters go through is amazing. I thought that the ending was unbelievably sad but had the author not made it that way I would have been disapointed because the author wimped out.The writing style was in the third person. I thought that it was more detailed and of a much higher caliber than many of the books that I have read in the past. I realized that this was an author that didn't just have a plot he was an incredible author too.I loved the books completely even when I thought that he had used 'passionaltely' too many times! I cried during the end and drove myself crazy because I could not get the books out of my head they were so wonderful.That is all I can write about the book without tediously restating previous endorsements.-cdm"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a really enjoyable story that is mostrously engaging to read. At the end of the day, that is what puts Pullman's series into the top echelon of kid/adult books. It is also a complex book that can be misunderstood.I think it is very misleading to say Dark Materials is a new Harry Potter. What makes the Harry Potter series so engaging is that it really gets to the heart of kid-ness. Dark Materials has Potter's bullies, buddies, magic, friendship, and monsters, but it also captures the staggering mismatch between how we want the world to be and the compromises that adulthood and \\"civilization\\" seemed to necessitate.Dark Materials is imaginative like Potter, but it is not about adolescence. It is about humanity. In my opinion, it is the humanists answer to Narnia. In fact, it is really a story about storytelling, the type of storytelling that is at the core of civilization and who we are.For Lyra (the protagonist) Will, the Gyptians, witches, bears, etc., relationships with each other are simultaneously rigid - one is a bear or is not a bear, and fluid - can one be a person without a daemon? Their identities are revealed as a set of shared stories that define how their individual societies are organized and how they interact.The \\"tribalism\\" for lack of a better word, creates an extremely rich tapestry to explore issues about how we justify our actions. It also allows Pullman to explore the nature of authority, ritual, commitment, and personal choice across many dimensions (literally and figuratively). We get the opportunity to look at marriage, kiship, family, race, and, as you probably have noticed from other postings, religion.It unfortunately easy to overlook the creative genius behind these stories by over-focusing on the issue of religion. It is, however, worth it.I would encourage the reader to see this as a tremendously creative story about how the greatest fears, and the greatest motivators, are the stories that we use to define who we really are. It is a brilliant arc that illuminates the inconsistencies in our worldview, our insecurities, and our flaws. It also exposes how our stories ennoble us and enable us to survive.Read His Dark Materials. Revel in the creativity, the tone, and the story. Excuse the minor glitches in the ending. This is not Harry Potter, with its warm embrace of clear moral direction and clean endings. This is a book that revels in our complexity and reveals the massive creativity that underlies our conscious existence. It tells stories about how much existence relies on stories.It is also a great way to spend a few weeks worth of evenings!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think it's about time we were greeted with a literary series that shows all the qualities that 'His Dark Materials' does. I am only sixteen myself, and I find that the profound impact Christianity has on people severly limits our tolerance and imagination. With this series, though, we are entering an entirely new world so much unlike ours in the religious aspect yet so similar that I can't help but greatly appreciate and enjoy it.I'm glad that Mr. Pullman has introduced the young world into such controversial subjects that parents always try to steer their children away from. Children need to realize how differently some people see things - certainly not when they're nine, but definitely by the time they're twelve. If there was one thing about these books that kept me hooked, it was the role of the Authority and the Church and the fact that they weren't what everyone believed them to be. Will and Lyra went through many trials and tribulations before they reached a definite end, and the sad fact is: that's life. Sugar-coated happiness seems to be the only thing people think children should learn, and it certainly can't be said these two children were a part of that."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"... They're good, not great, and nowhere near amazing. There, I said it. Now read the reasons.I applaud Phillip Pullman on his spectacular imagination, which has created a world parallel to ours in which all people have daemons in the form of animals, the church has almost complete control over our lives, armored bears rule kingdoms in the arctic, and God himself is a lying slimeball. ...There are two major problems. One is the surprising lack of humor. I can think of one funny part in \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and about three in \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" And don't look for much in the way of wit. The second is the finale. While this could have ended on a thought provoking and mystical note, it instead has to go for a sappy cliche about how we need to do the best we can with where we are and what we have (Awwwwwwww...).P.S. Don't read these if you are easily offended by anti church slander."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is one of the most enjoyable stories I have read in a long time. Suspenseful. Scary. Complex. Sad. Interesting, multi-dimensional characters. Thought-provoking: Is organized religion inherently evil? What happens when we die? Are there other worlds out there? Does love and truth conquer all? Heavy stuff. Add to all this the fascinating journey of Lyra to meet her destiny. It's that good. I'm not exagerating.I am 39 years old. I realize these books are marketed for young adults, but readers aged 12 and up will enjoy them. (My daughter who is 12 read them with me and although I had to explain a few things to her, she loved them as much as I did.)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is simply incredible. Ignore all the fake negative reviews from the people who are afraid of a book like this. Open your mind and read it for yourself! If you're a person of faith, and you don't think you can read this, is your faith really so strong?The plot, characters, stories formed a beautiful, mysterious and thought provoking story that I wish never ended. I was literally sad when I finished, because it was hard to say goodbye to the characters and world within.(by the way, ignore the \\"A Kid's Review\\" as I'm not a kid.)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had previously owned all three hardcover books, but after reading them all, I gave them to my granddaughter. When I saw this boxed set of hardcover books was less expensive by about $15 (than when I bought them individually), I decided to add the set back to my library. Fantastic story line; wish the last book had been a bit more filled out in the end."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"AAA+++ Fantastic !!!!!!!The most intelligent, amazing and metaphysical books I've read so far this year. It is a battle of good over evil. It just happens that the good and evil comes in a form that most people don't see or understand.I think the books were not heavily promoted here in the US, hence most parents don't know about this series and buy it for their kids. Overseas, this is a very well known series, especially in UK.The Golden Compass invites you into a world where the Magisterium (think Stalin, Nero, Qin ShiHuang, Hitler, any megalomaniacal ruler or government) wants to control people by controlling people's free will.As long as there is no free will, then people must follow what the government or ruler says, and believe in their doctrines.And the source of the free will is the soul, which in The Golden Compass world, is the daemon, the amorphous animal companion that each person has. One who has no daemon, or soul-less person, is not human, and not to be trusted.Lyra discovers that the alethiometer tells the truth. And she has the only remaining alethiometer in the world, the rest had been destroyed by the Magisterium.After destroying all the \\"truth\\" meters, and then creating the machine to separate and kill the souls of children, the Magisterium thinks it can now control all the soulless children that it created. For children without souls will do as they are told, will believe in whatever doctrine or dogma they are told to believe in. In the words of a Bolvangar doctor, \\"this is how children grow up\\" - by killing and removing their souls - the ultimate act of evil.And now, the stage is set, for in the coming wars all people in all parallel universes must choose between a world with no control over your life, or free will.And then there is \\"dust\\" - that which is in all, permeates all, and was there at the beginning of time. In my opinion, \\"dust\\" is the metaphor for the Universal Creator, your God, whatever God you choose to believe in. In the books, it says that \\"dust\\" was there at the beginning of time, dust permeates all, while one lives, \\"dust\\" is channeled into us through our souls (called \\"daemons\\" in this world) and when one dies, we return to \\"dust\\". So far, this is very Christian. God created us, God gave each one of us our soul, so that HE is always with us, and He gave us free will, so that we can choose, and when we die, our souls return to God. This is the allegory.It is so important for children to understand they have a soul that is their inner guidance, and the soul gives us free will, so they can create whatever kind of life they wish for themselves in the future. This kind of information has always been suppressed and the people who don't know this info were oppressed by rulers throughout time.Knowledge is information, information allows us to choose. Without information, we have no choice in life.For Americans, it should be a no brainer that we value our freedom. Our freedom is tied in with our free will - our ability to choose and decide for ourselves.Yet we don't teach our children these values ???I don't understand the controversy, maybe because I think for myself and decide after I have read them. I choose freedom - I choose to have my soul - I choose free will."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Wow, what a lot of venom from the bible bashers, sounds like an organised campaign from their programmersI just have to get it to sit on my shelf next to Narnia."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first read the Dark Materials series a few years ago, and recently got the Omnibus edition as its beautifully presented with a gorgeous cover and has all three books in one volume. Frankly, I am bewildered by all the hoopla surrounding these books, and can only conclude that its tied in to the movie release and its controversial approach to traditional religion, specifically Christianity.My answer to all those bashing the books - if you truly feel that the author's anti-Christian stance offends you, then don't read them. But, please, let the rest of us who would like to make our own informed decision as to whether to read the book or watch the movie do so in peace. Yes, there are aspects in the books that may require some explanation esp if younger children are reading them, and yes, there are also some dark elements that may not be suitable for really young children, BUT this is where parents/ guardians come in - to explain the deeper issues brought forth in the series, and inculcate critical thinking skills in younger readers.In the end - its an individual's choice, and parents can make informed decisions for their kids if they are too young to grasp the complexities within these stories. The series itself in my opinion is well-written, and though there are some touchy issues, it makes for compelling analysis and intelligent discussion, things that make a book worth reading. Stop with the bashing already!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The five stars I give are for the beauty of writing and the brillance of the author as a creator and a storyteller.I would normally spend a long time in person to praise the author, but as a quick note for the inquiring reader, the books are very Anti-Christian (and Anti-Jewish, even blaspheming the Tetragrammaton [Hebrew 4-letter name of God] itself). The charges against the church are by and large false, but are based on some abuses of the church and some disagreements of the author with Christianity given to satire.Some of the subject matter is centered around discussions of sexuality- parents, do not just hand the books to your children without a thourough read yourself. (I would generally say they aren't for children at all).If you are an open-minded adult, willing to spend the time to know the areas where Pullman is fancifully critical of historic Christianity, then I heartilly recommend these books for the read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy had me really hooked with the first few chapters, and the first book was as good as any book needs to be. A first rate writer, in the same class as J.K. Rowling, and a first class imagination too. Daemons, armored bears, the subtle knife; things that stay with you.However, one of the many keys to great writing is to make everything \\"work\\", and I felt the ending didn't finish with the same tremendous clarity of the first books. I think it's because endings are difficult since you have to work out all the stories, have them make sense, and when you have a series of books that are so exceptional, it's a high standard to reach.It may be a fantasy world, but you still need to make sense within your own structure, and have people do what a \\"real\\" person would do.So read the series, but then go read Dune by Frank Herbert."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many of the people who like this trilogy try to defend it against the attacks. In all fairness, this series takes a dramatically anti-Christian stance (slowly at first, and climatically near the end, as if the tension of the plot and the vileness of faith are exposed in parallel). Christians do well to avoid it, unless they're willing to be offended.However, this series has the potential to show through fiction what hundreds of angry essays have failed to communicate - that the war we fight is not \\"good against evil,\\" or \\"order against chaos,\\" but rather knowledge against ignorance. However, this moral isn't dropped heavy-handed. Rather, the books characters, plotline, and subtly alien worldview (a culture almost exactly like our own, only without any real division between magic, science and theology) engross the reader without regard to the reader's metaphysical stance."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass is such a great book to read.I can't get my eyes off the book,I just keep on reading.I really excited because I just started reading the second one.Lyra seems like a real person to me.I like the way Lyra's world is,having daemons.Now that totally rocks.This book is just full of surprises."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"No praise is high enough for this fabulous series by Philip Pullman. I have read these books 4 times each so far, and each time I do, I am struck once again by the beauty of Pullman's writing, and captivated by each of the novels's (sp?) intense plot. Also, because there are so many fibers of meaning in each of his novels, I realize something new each time I read them again, like parts of a gigantic puzzle that I piece together. The fantasy worlds created by Pullman, which almost cannot be called fantasy because they are so like our own, are captivating enough so that the reader, or at least I, finds themselves there, with Lyra and Will, battling Specters and befriending witches and armored bears. I would be very surprised to find someone who didn't think highly of these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I first read the Golden Compass in the middle of January I was repelled by the dull begining, but quickly that changed as I was enveloped in a magical tale of a girl and her daemon, Pantalaimon. The book is full of wonder and kept me at the edge of my seat all the way through.The second book, a great sequel, had me even more, if that's possible, entranced in the continuing journey of Lyra and her new found friend, Will. The book kept rising and rising into epic heights that I haven't experienced in quite a while. The detail Pullman has used to describe ever bit and cranny of his awesome world is just a surrealistic experience.Well anyways, as the book finishes off with a mild cliff-hanger, I devoured the last book as I was once again whisked away and enchanted by Pullman's brilliant trilogy. The last book had, more then the other books, some anti-christian points, but this was appropriately interlaced in Lyra and Will's grand destiny. I don't want to spoil anything but the last book had me laughing at times, on the edge of my seat at others, and saddened as well.Overall, these books may not be for the same audience as Harry Potter, because of it's more mature themes and myriad of descriptors that children in elementary school may not have learned, but when it comes down to it, I feel that this trilogy has sent me away on a magical journey, impossible to duplicate, and something I haven't felt in a long while."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Look, any book with violence and scary scenes should be look at carefully before being given you your children, but come on - it's fiction, not fact! If you can't present anything but well-worn dogma to your kids, then these books are not for you. If you are able to articulate clearly to your kids why you disagree with the premises of this story, then you might have some very deep and wonderful conversations about the meaning of your beliefs and just what it means to have God in your life. These are beautifully written books that should delight most any reader who isn't afraid to simply contemplate another point of view. Condemn it as wrong, evil, etc., if you must, but it is a wonderful, epic story that Pullman has written."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I keep returning to this book over and over again. Everytime I read it, I discover something new inside of it. Pullman writes this story fantastically, and the plot develops seamlessly through all three books. I have enthusiastically recommended it to many friends.Being Jewish, the part about The Church didn't really bother me or strike me a blasphemous. Though there are violent and rather dark themes in the book, the main point of the novel is a lovely story of the coming of age of two kids, Lyra and Will.I strongly recommend this book for ages 11 and up. Kids younger than that won't pick up on many of the important aspects of the novel, and frankly, some kids are just too young for the cold blood murder and dark subject matter of this book.This set of novels is a great gift, especially for a kid who is very bright or loves to read. I even got my parents to read them, and they enjoyed the trilogy as much as I did!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of \\"His Dark Materials.\\" For pure \\"good read\\" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling. Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is pure and original in its imaginative scope. Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain. While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it. Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the \\"dark force in the universe.\\" I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Trojans as they appear from within. Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts. For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy. I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of \\"His Dark Materials.\\"To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people. It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.I understand that a movie version of \\"His Dark Materials\\" is already in the works. If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books. Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children. Okay, I know I'm not being realistic. It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader. He will also be a multi-millionaire.Well played, Mr. Pullman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"\\"His Dark Materials\\" is a nothing short of a meditation on the nature of humanity and divinity masquerading as a series of fantasy novels. Eliminate the name of the trilogy in that last sentence, and it could describe several really great works -- The Lord of the Rings, Dune, the Chronicles of Narnia. And this is a work equal to those. There are significant differences: perhaps because Pullman is a contemporary author, the characters speak normally, and not like Oxford dons, the action is not broken up for lengthy expositions on the history of the imaginary lands, peoples or languages, and of course, this is a profoundly irreligious series of books. This may be viewed by some as a strength and others as weakness, but all in all it does make for a great readable work with a terrific fresh sense of where good and evil come from. It is labelled a young adult book, but I'm really not sure why -- maybe it's part of a subversive effort to keep the theology under the radar of those who would never deign to read something that involves teenagers. Whatever. Lord knows how many doctoral dissertations and book clubs this has launched -- the possibilities for provacative discussion are endless. Read it and participate."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As soon as I started to read this trilogy, I couldn't put it down! I recently finished the last installment, The Amber Spyglass, which I spent all of my free time reading. I highly suggest this book to any reader who likes mystery and fantasy books. My English teacher even suggested this book to my class for a project we will be doing, and she herself said she enjoyed Philip Pullmans other published works. So this book isn't just for young readers, but adults as well. However, these books do contain violence and the details are described in great detail, so very young readers should not pick this book up."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Having received a recommendation from a Terry Brooks site for this trilogy, I followed it and found this set of books to be excellent. You travel through many locations, situations, and fantasies while touching on many sujects, which may surprise you. In the end you are allowed to experience a sensation that each of us have had at some point in our lives. By doing so your focus is provided with a sense of understanding and melancholy, which cements these books in your mind. I highly recommed them, but they should be read in order so that you do not lose the ebb and flow."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Whilst Tolkien presents an excellent Roman Catholic view of mythology in Lord of the Rings, and Rowling provides an exciting introduction to the world of imagination and classical literature. Phillip Pullman on a darker tangent writes a book that I recommended to five parents pre Christmas all teenagers plus parents have all got hooked. This is exciting writing. Not for under 12 year olds but satisfying page turning adventure with mythical and classical undertones. I have read LOR over 50 times and potter books 2-3 times, Pullman will be a yearly read for me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm 13 year old girl, and even at my age I find these books incredible. They're deep, creative, and hard to put down. I find nothing wrong with the religious perspective- it's not trying to persuade you to believe that, it's simply seeing everything from a different angle. Some adults, I guess, can't enjoy the books as much as my friends and I do, because they're too close-minded and strict in their ways.But to any open-minded people, I surely recommend these books. Incredible. My favorite books, best I've ever read.And to those who think they're &quot;horrible&quot;- loosen up. open your mind. look past the religious aspect, the &quot;mistakes&quot;, and see the books for what they are- a deep, thoughtful, fantastical journey."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of the best series I have ever read. It's got adventure, action, romance, and it's also VERY deep. What more can you ask for? Yes, it's a little on the dark side and its contents can be controversial as it questions the existence of the God most people associate with. But just because that some people will not agree with the beliefs presented in the story does not mean it's low trash. Sometimes controversy is a sign of something great. Pullman's writing just pulls you into this other universe and it's just impossible to forget the characters and what happens to them. It's definitely something more people should read and keep. This is not a library book that you can check out, read, and return... You'll want to keep this for as long as you live. Amazing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"... I didn't get to sleep before 5 AM on any of the nights that I read them because I couldn't put them down. They are interesting with ideas that adults can relate to as well. I kept having to remind myself that they were for teenagers!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is incredibly well done. It is much darker than Harry Potter, but it satisfies on the same level. The goodies and the baddies aren't always easy to label, and there are surprising and sad twists and turns of the plot. There are also some interesting theological questions to think about without putting forth a religious ideology of any kind, and all this is tied up in a rip-snorting good story about people we'd love to know.Orson Scott Card's \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Ender's Shadow\\" are good in this way also. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In my writing class at UCLA, my professor taught the class that rereading pieces of literature gives the reader new insight into the work because not only does the time around the writing change, but the reader changes as well.I began reading the first book in Phillip Pullman's trilogy probably over five years ago. As a nineteen-year-old, that's a good chunk of my life. My bookmark showed that I had finished the first two books of the series and was about a third-way through the final book. When I picked up the series to read again a couple weeks ago, I barely remembered anything I had read. As a child, I never really picked up on characterization or foreshadowing or any of those fancy writing devices that were pounded into my head in high school. Reading a book as a child was simply a different experience than reading it now with knowledge and experience. Which way is better? I can't say.Now I don't have writing skills comparable to any successful author, but Pullman does state that his series is aimed towards children, and it does occasionally show with some of the simpler content and writing. Armored polar bears? Well, I admit that I did become a fan of Iorek Byrnison by the end of the series.In my opinion, the best of the series is The Golden Compass. The opening book creates an amazing fantasy world (with armored polar bears) that sucks the reader in. There is no specific explanation for any of these wild images--the reader is simply let to believe that Pullman's creations, as wild as they are, are possible and even normal.The Subtle Knife continues the series, adding new characters and adventures, but not as powerfully as its predecessor.Although I think the finale The Amber Spyglass was a solid conclusion to the series, it wasn't as gripping as I thought the ending of this series would be. The conclusion of Dust wasn't the amazing revelation that I had prepared myself for. A little disappointing, but Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials gets bumped up half a point for being a part of my childhood memories.Last summer I finished A Series of Unfortunate Events and this summer I followed it up with His Dark Materials. Finishing these books from my childhood has been pretty satisfying. Give old books a chance to be reread. You'll be surprised at how much you missed the first time.9.5/10 -> 5/5"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first saw the movie for the first book and liked it. When I looked into when the next one would come out, I found that it was forbade by the Catholic Church, all the up to the Vatican! This, of course, just made me want to know more. I decided to read the series and, my god, what a story!! Awesome set. Great seller too, cheap set and in great condition!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have to admit that i was a bit relentles with buying by internet, and internationally, that's why i only bought the Dark Materials Trilogy, \\"just in case\\", but i was surprised not only because it arrived in great conditions, but also because arrived earlier than expected (it was supposed to arrived on december 9th, and it came on november 20 something). thanks Amazon for the books, it came before my birthday, and cheaper than i would've bought it here in Chile.ps:sorry for my misspelling, but my english has got a bit rusty with the years"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"With the movie in the cinemas I think that interest in this trilogy will be renewed...The first book is inspired and a very good read. I could hardly lay it aside before I was through. The world which Pullman conjures up is exciting strange and believable in a mix of familiar and fantastic aspects of his creation. The adventure which follows a thrilling and mysterious start in Pullman's Oxford is colorful, daring and full of surprises.Then I read the second book or rather fought my way through it. To me Pullman went overboard with badly formulated concepts which cross over into blasphemy. A friend of mine who loved the first novel never got through the second. The narrative looses in intensity and the seemingly blasphemous aspects of the expanded multiverse The Subtle Knife opens up to the reader can further discourage.The Amber Spyglass does realign with the captivating style of The Golden Compass while not fully coming up to the same quality. The plot regains pace and the reader can be drawn into Pullman's world again if he did not leave it during the second novel. What reeked of blasphemy in the second novel is slowly explained away and the story arc left unfinished in the second novel comes to an end.I greatly enjoyed The Golden Compass, fought through the confusion of The (all too) Subtle Knife and gained a new perspective of the whole trilogy by looking through The Amber Spyglass.If one is willing to go through a hard time with the second novel, the whole trilogy comes still out all right but expectations should not be set too high. Do not judge the whole trilogy against the charm of The Golden Compass and you will be able to enjoy it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In spite of lovely writing and interesting characters, I think this trilogy does not match the excitement and color of the Harry Potter series. Pullman is a great writer, but he is lacking in JK Rowling's special gifts of humor, excellent secondary characters, and roller-coaster plotting.In fact, Pullman's plotting is plodding. The third book was, for me, about 100 pages too long.I don't believe this is a dangerous book for young people, but perhaps most who have limited time for reading will pick something else. Pullman's criticisms of organized religion ring a bell at times, but the pathetic creature who is killed in book 3 definitely is not most people's idea of God the Father, Son or Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had heard lots of good things about this series for a long time so I finally broke down and bought it. As a reader of fantasy for 10+ years I have read plenty of good stories and bad ones. This story isn't one of the bad ones but I caution those of you like me who read alot of fantasy, Don't Believe the Hype.For a longtime fantasy reader this story will be simple in plot and beyond simple in writing style. I could see this being ranked high as a Young Adult book but put up against other mature fantasy stories it is highly lacking."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm a fan of Tolkein, Rowling, Lewis, Leguin et al - but this really is the 21st century heir to all of them. It's beautifully written, creative, and addictive (try to put it down - dare you), but it's far, far darker and more complex than Harry Potter or any other of the \\"young adult\\" fantasy classics. It's closest to Tolkein - Pullman has obviously put a great deal of time into cosmology or theology (or however you want to see it), and it's paid off handsomely in a coherent framework that seamlessly connects the three volumes.I know a lot of conservative Christians who don't like Pullman's work because it IS, in some ways, an indictment of organized religion. But it's a long way from anti-Christian - anti-establishment is more like it. So don't let that put you off! It's also a truly fabulous read, full of astonishingly beautiful images like paintings on the pages - images that burrow into your imagination and stay with you.To be honest, I'd consider this a PG-13 trilogy - not for risque reasons (there aren't any, really) but because it's sometimes blunt, even brutal in its depictions of loss and pain. It's harrowing at times even for a grown-up, so I don't think I'd buy it for a really young reader, precocious or not. But if you want to inspire an SF/fantasy fan who's looking for something far better than the usual unicorn fluff, this is it. It's just great storytelling, period."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ignoring the religious aspects for the moment, this is a well-written and well-crafted set of books. The author creates a consistent world, which believable characters. The story is tight, the writing is good, plot is fun and dramatic. It is well worth reading.Now that being said, I do not recommend these books to those who are sensitive to religious issues. If you do not want your adolescent to have exposure to ideas that contradict your own then keep them away from these books.I enjoyed it at 33. My eleven year-old goddaughter has picked it up and seems to be enjoying it as well. We will speak at length on what I do and do not disagree with afterwards."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an amzing novel, I relly advise you to read it, So lovely and magical. I won't say more not to spoil the surprise, but it's about kids and animals when you get to the heart of things, but with a lot of suspense and action. Really wonderful book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In His Dark Materials, Philip Pullman writes an exciting, engaging, and enjoyable adventure story that should be on the bookshelves of both young adult and older readers.Why? In part, because its heroes (Lyra, Will, Iorek, Lee Scoresby, Mary Malone, Serafina Pekkala, et al.) display many of the finest qualities found in humans: love, compassion, loyalty, bravery, reason, etc.Pullman is also adept at portraying the ambiguities of making choices. It may make sense to present the world in stark \\"black and white\\" to 4- and 5-year olds but when a child reaches the \\"tweens,\\" it's time to make them realize that very few decisions are entirely good or entirely evil. An example is Will's use of the \\"subtle knife.\\" With it he can open windows into many worlds - helping him and Lyra to escape or making it possible to go to the Land of the Dead and free the spirits there. But every time he uses it, he creates a Spectre an another fissure is opened through which Dust escapes.As to Pullman's obvious dislike of organized religion: I think he's right on the mark. It's probably a hallmark of any large institution or bureaucracy that it stifles dissent, compassion, and individuality; sacrificing the human in favor of something supposedly greater (whether God, the state, or some other abstraction). From a spiritual point of view, the worst thing that happened to Christianity was Constantine.As to Pullman's take on God: Again, I'm in complete sympathy with his point of view. Assuming that there is a transcendent creator, it's certainly not the God of Abraham and his children. Actually, Pullman follows a long tradition that goes back (at least) 2,000 years to the Gnostics. Some sects believed the God of the Hebrew Bible was a psychopath who maliciously condemned/trapped innocent souls in filthy material bodies. Others took a more charitable view, characterizing the demi-urge as merely hapless. More recent explorations of a similar theme would include James Blish's Black Easter/Day After Judgment duology, Michael Moorcock's The War Hound and the World's Pain, Steven Brust's To Reign in Hell, and, most recently, Jacqueline Carey's The Sundering.In sum, keep an open mind, let His Dark Materials join Tolkien, Lewis, Le Guin, and others on your fantasy shelf even if you can't accept his philosophy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"So this is the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Phillip Pullman. I almost didn't hear about it at all, I admit, but eventually, someone mentioned the first book to me, and I decided to give it a look, and after the first book, well... I couldn't just leave it at that. The story of each book is not complete by itself. It's not enough unless you've read all three. It's like the Lord of the Rings, in that respect.Well, now having finished all three books, let me give them an honest, frank evaluation, and if it sometimes sounds like I'm griping, please remember that I've only just finished reading them as I write this, and the feelings of the main characters are still fresh in my mind.Pullman's much-appreciated trilogy leaves several general impressions on my mind. It predates many of the things it has similarities to, but on the whole, it left a flavor in my mind that is part Lovecraft, part Anne Rice, part Kingdom Hearts, part Digimon the TV Show Season 1, yet with other flavors as well that I can't quite place. All I know is that it's not part Shakespeare.Using his phenomenal writing style and ability at conveying intense and powerful emotions through the written word, Pullman has sculpted, as the title of the trilogy suggests, a sort of dark mythology/grim multiverse, in which, like Lovecraft, existence as we know it only survives by being sealed inside a virtual bubble, to protect it from the all-encompassing dark forces that extend into eternity beyond. In addition, Pullman's mythology paints God, all gods and all angels as being foolish and idiotic to as great a degree as man, if not more so. Much the same method as used by the ancient greeks to sculpt their gods and heroes.So there is a force of ultimate evil in Pullman's multiverse, so powerful as to be sickening and terrifying, and no visible force for ultimate good, since Pullman simply chose not to make one. Even the main characters, while being basically likable people, are still fundamentally flawed in all the normal human ways. The story revolves, really, around two characters. Lyra, who hails from a world where everyone has a spirit that follows them around in the shape of an animal called a \\"Daemon\\" (the original english spelling for demon.) Hers is named Pantaleimon, which even sounds like a Digimon's name. The other main character is Will, from a world very similar to ours.The premise of these countless worlds that can only be connected through the darkness is the similarity I draw between these books and Kingdom Hearts, and the \\"Specters\\" (evil spirit-like beasties) even strike me as being something like KH's \\"Heartless.\\"Other than these two main characters, I really only have one character that I want to say anything about, and that's Mrs. Coulter. She starts off as, in the first two books, the undisputed \\"bad guy\\" of the series, but is simply not terrifying in the least, and when a bad guy isn't terrifying, at least in a book, I find that they have an easy time becoming annoying. This happened with her.In this respect, the Specters are a much better evil bad guy concept. Obviously significantly more powerful and just as malignant as Coulter herself, they ultimately fail to be the perfect bad guys for this series because Pullman simply chose not to use them that way.In the end, the general mood of the story, though it's set against a heavy backdrop of evil and vile deeds, gravitates strongly away from either good OR evil, preferring instead to focus on the less-distinct areas of depressing mortal existence. This it does with such strength and talent that I probably won't get over it for quite some time.This, really, is my primary beef with His Dark Materials, just as it was with Digimon's first season, and to a lesser degree, with the Lord of the Rings.You don't (or at least I don't) feel anything approaching happiness or hope when this story comes to a close, partly because there are still so many issues to be solved, and partly because both of the main characters are given the most dismal fate imaginable. You see, when two people love each other, and I mean real love, not just simple attraction, they become very similar in relationship to Pullman's humans and daemons, and seperating them is most dangerous, when it's possible, because they mourn for one another so deeply that their every moment apart is painful by comparison. Pullman seems to realize this, depicts this tragedy in great, unneccesary detail, but does nothing to correct it, or even, as with Romeo and Juliet, to carry it through to its natural conclusion. In the end, all this eventuality really does is upset me terribly, and I don't need books to do that. For this reason, I won't read this trilogy again, ever, but who knows? You may find some deeper interpretation of this work that I could not."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am currently reading Northern Lights (The Golden Compass to the US Market) but I have just come back from London where I saw the stage production of the trilogy at the Royal National Theatre and have read the play numerous times so I am familiar with the HDM theology. Nicholas Wright, the author of the adaptations for RNT sums it up well. The plays and the book are not anti-religious, nor are they anti-god. They are anti clerical dogma. When spiritual beliefs are tied so much to earthly dogma, coming from man and not the numinous, beliefs get \\"hardened\\" and \\"dreary\\" and downright \\"untruthful.\\" His Dark Materials is a celebration of the numinous beyond earthly dogma. It is a critique of what we as a race make of spirituality. The Authority may represent G*d but rather more what we make of Him, and not whatever He may really be.On that note, I think Phillip Pullman is a storytelling genius. The story is memorable; Pullman makes you feel emotional about the characters and their many experiences, and keeps the reader riveted. When I saw the play last week, I was amazed by the number of children in the audience, and how many of them stayed riveted for the entire 6 hours of action (The three books were split into two 3 hour plays.) There were no children talking loudly to their parents at any point in the whole theatre. This was not a visit to see A Chipmunk's Christmas Story, these were young children entranced by what they were seeing.I highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone who has ever wondered if we've got it right when it comes to how we perceive G*d and organized religion. And to those who haven't, because these books will challenge what you believe and strengthen your own spirituality, if you allow it to. I also highly recommend the stage production at the Royal National Theatre on the south bank of the Thames in London, England. It is playing until mid April 2005, and it is the best epic piece of theatre I have ever seen. And while you're there, buy the script for the play. I don't think it is available anywhere else.The bottom line is this: experience Pullman's world in any way you can because it is worth it. Unexamined and unexplored beliefs are as true as those explored and examined, but I know my experience with Lyra, Will and Pan has strengthened my own spirituality in ways that I never thought possible."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"first off to all the people crying about the church being the the antagonist get over it.... I dont cry about the chronicles of narnia because of its blatant christian message and how C.S. forces his view on me in those books.As for the book its a great read and i highly recommend it"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Before I talk about the collection, I would like to say this: These books are works of fiction; FANTASIES. People who have read His Dark Materials and claim that it is an attack on God need to get a grip. It is NOT an attack on God or the Christian faith, but is about growing up and the loss of innocence. The trilogy is labeled as a work of fantasy, and its positions on issues such as religion are not to be taken seriously. That being said, on to the books!I'm not going to say what the books are about, you can read the other reviews for that. Instead I'm going to say what a great piece of work this trilogy is. The characters are very well developed; you feel a personal connection to each of them. There are many biblical references throughout the books, and most of them are indeed contrary to what Christians believe in. I personally find it refreshing that Philip Pullman can so openly write about this touchy subject. The scope of the trilogy is amazing, and you will instantly find yourself drawn into the worlds that Pullman has created. I simply could not put these books down, and there were many occasions where I found myself reading hundreds of pages at a time, and I loved every minute of it. However, I would not suggest these books to children under 14 or 15...some of the concepts are rather complicated, and some younger children might not be able to appreciate the absolute extent of the books. Also, if you are a close-minded Christian I would not suggest these books, as they do question certain aspects of the Christian faith. Other than that, I highly recommend this trilogy to any fantasy fan, or anyone that would like to get into the genre. Hope this review helped! Have fun!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These are wonderful books. They are fantastic pieces of literature that will blow you away. It is well thought out and just amazing.Yes, there is a war on God, but it is very originial, something fresh and exciting.Secondly, I am a Christian. In fact, I go to a Catholic school. I still enjoy theses books. They are some of my favorites. I can still be a Christian and read these books, and it offends me when people speak for me and say I can't. Philip Pullman is not corrupting me. Jeez. I also do not like the fact that some adults speak for 13 year old kids, namely, ME, and say that this book is not for me, it's too confusing and complicated for our pea-brained minds. Excuse me, I am 13 years old, and I fully understand this book and the concepts of it. Just because I am 13 does not make me stupid. And don't you DARE go speaking 13 year old children if you are not a 13 year old child."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'd like to offer a bit of dissent from all the raves concerning the Dark Materials trilogy.Let's begin at the beginning. *The Golden Compass* is a work of true genius, sparkling with inventiveness and carrying the reader on through its essentially absurd plot (do you *really* believe that any eleven-year-old girl, no matter how precocious, could accomplish all those things?) with fine panache and an unflagging sense of wonder. Don't stop to think, just sit back and enjoy the ride. Lyra, the girl from the parallel universe, is out to save her father from the captivity of armored polar bears and at the same time free her friends from the diabolical experiments of the fiendish Mrs. Coulter. What could be better?Book Two, *The Subtle Knife*, jars us a bit by switching the viewpoint to our own world, where Will, a young lad about Lyra's age, also sets out on a quest to find his lost father. Will is another full-fledged superkid, able to accomplish tasks that would daunt even Odysseus as he meets Lyra, interacts with all manner of bizarre beings and hops from world to world with tireless stamina.Alas, Will is never quite as convincing as Lyra, perhaps because he's so thoroughly grounded in our own mundane world, perhaps because his beyond-adult courage, wisdom, endurance and innate nobility are so utterly over-the-top (far eclipsing even Lyra's astonishing talents) that they begin to test the boundaries of our suspension of disbelief. Even James Bond was never this resourceful, and certainly never so remarkably articulate. There are some things that just don't wash, even in a fantasy. But all the same, there's action aplenty, and if you're not in too critical a frame of mind, *The Subtle Knife* makes for an enjoyable read.But by Book Three, *The Amber Spyglass*, Pullman's characters and storylines begin to explode in all directions, leaving us to wonder just which of the many players we're supposed to be rooting for -- and why. Multiple plotlines are fine, if they're kept within reason, but when the device is overdone, the reader becomes like a passenger on a fast-moving train, trying to look at all the passing landmarks but unable to concentrate on any of them long enough to really appreciate them. Maybe it's simple authorial zeal; but then again, maybe it's to keep the reader from looking closely enough to spot the ever-multiplying logical inconsistencies.Very quickly, the author's astonishing inventiveness begins to betray him as new concepts, magical gadgetry and otherworldly beings are piled on in such relentless layers that we very quickly reach the saturation point at which anything is possible and therefore nothing can any longer be surprising. Worse, many of them seem to have been invented as mere devices for hauling the characters in and out of the latest alarming predicament. Does the Intention Craft, to name just one, really have any purpose in the storyline other than to give Mrs. Coulter a way to escape from Lord Asriel's fortress?But most unforgivable of all, *The Amber Spyglass* is less of a novel than a thinly-fictionalized religious -- or should I say anti-religious? -- screed disguised as a fantasy novel. For Lord Asriel's intention is nothing less than to slay God himself and leave the multiverse the exclusive property of its wise inhabitants. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that God turns out to be nothing more than a drooling, withered, senile angel who gratefully evaporates when the two juvenile protagonists release him from his crystal life-support coffin, but Lord Asriel is undaunted. After all, there's still God's Regent to contend with, a lustful angel with a name (\\"Metatron\\") that would hardly be out of place on a Japanese giant robot.Of course with no God, there's always the thorny question of life after death, but militant atheist Pullman has an answer to that one, too. There is neither Heaven nor Hell, but there is a sort of Homeric underground afterlife where the powerless, whispering shades of the dead go to mutter to each other while harpies mock them for their earthly shortcomings.Not too appealing, you say? Will and Lyra agree, and after the usual superhuman efforts, they descend into Hades and free the dead souls. But being dead, after all, where can the shades go? Why, to oblivion, of course! They now have the option of choosing utter dissolution over an eternity of ghostly mediocrity, and just so we don't get the mistaken impression that this isn't really much of a choice, Pullman shows us that the dead are just deliriously happy to die for the second time, this time for keeps.I single this oddity out as an example of the author's relentless atheistic digs not because it's unique but because it's simply one of so very many from which to choose. Personally, I have no problem with atheists, but I can't abide *strident* atheists any more than I can abide strident religious fanatics, and *The Amber Spyglass* is one long atheist tract masquerading as a fantasy novel. Again, I emphasize that both atheists and atheist novels per se are fine with me, but when the ideology starts to overwhelm the storyline, it's time to bail out. Pullman's loathing of religion -- particularly Christianity, *most* particularly Roman Catholicism -- drips from every page, until even the most militant apostate is ready to scream \\"enough!\\"Whatever the characters are fighting *for* in this great battle against the All-not-so-Mighty, isn't entirely clear, since the multiverse still seems to be an awfully bleak and unappealing place after the Dust finally settles. It certainly isn't Love, because none of the couples in the trilogy -- be they Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter, the homosexual angels (yes) Baruch and Balthamos, or Lyra and Will themselves -- are allowed to come to a non-tragic end after their travails. In fact, poor Will and Lyra are cheated out of their hard-earned right to each other by a plot device so heavy-handedly contrived and artificial that we can only believe that the author was determined that there should be nothing remotely resembling anything as trite as a Happy Ending tainting the lunar landscape of his saga, no matter the cost to the readers' credibility. The \\"tragic\\" ending to *The Amber Spyglass* isn't so much tear-jerky as simply jerky.The *His Dark Materials* trilogy certainly is not, as the cover blurbs would have it, a new and formidable competitor to *Lord of the Rings*. It is, in fact, a kind of antimatter version of C.S. Lewis' heavy-handedly preachy Narnia books, but sadly lacking any trace of Lewis' charm. Fanatical Pullman fans will (and do) loudly proclaim that only \\"fundamentalist Christians\\" (aka \\"religious bigots\\") could possibly be disappointed with *The Amber Spyglass*, but in fact it's more like disappointment in a trilogy that begins so promisingly only to deteriorate into a rambling, unfocused, illogical rant in what should have been the climactic volume.My recommendation: buy *The Golden Compass*, and enjoy it without hesitation. If you feel that you absolutely *have* to see more of what's going on in Philip Pullman's sad multiverse, go ahead and get *The Subtle Knife*, too. But unless you have an unslakable thirst for obsessive antireligious tracts wrapped up in grimly contrived fantasy trappings that fairly groan at their stretching seams (and I know there are many people out there who do), don't bother with *The Amber Spyglass*.Well, if you *really* want to read it, I have a copy I'm willing to let go. Cheap."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this trilogy when I was in my early 20's and found it fascinating, a little TOO surreal and not as enthralling as some other classic fantasy stories. No, its not like Harry Potter...its darker and there aren't the humorous word plays JK Rowling so masterfully executes and I enjoy so much. And yes, it did drag a bit and you didn't put down the book with a light and cheerful heart-which is fine with me - I prefer books I need to think about a bit . I decided to re-order this series to refresh my memory before seeing the movie and was amazed at the amount of venom, directed both towards religion and atheism, being shared on this page and in reviewer's comments.For all those folks who think that these books will corrupt their children, and are promoting Narnia instead--let me just say that I grew up reading and re-reading all the chronicles of Narnia (while living in a Catholic household) and grew up to be a well adjusted and agnostic adult. I was never influenced by the undercurrents of religion in those books, and neither did I find myself positively overwhelmed by the atheistic themes in Pullman's work.Please consider that reading a wide variety of literature is what gives children and adults some of their insights into other people and helps them develop tolerance, insight and understanding of the very global and multi-faith (or lack of faith) world we live in today. Please, instead of banning a story whose fictional message may make you a little uncomfortable, have FAITH in your childrens' and your own ability to form opinions--if brainwashing was so easy, we'd have much bigger things to worry about than book boycotts."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are amazing. I love the story. At first, i'll admit I didn't quite get what the fuss was all about. After a little more reading, I found the story so captivating!It's a story about magic and fantasy with religious undertones. Be warned: Christians may find these books offensive, but not necessarily.Overall, wonderfully written, fun and beautiful that keeps you going page by page. If you like the books... this set is also great. I like that the spines, when held together, form the words 'his dark materials.' For some reason it just makes for a nicer set....oh and the movie is coming out soon and these don't have movie tie-in covers like you'll soon be finding. Come December this will likely be the next big thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read the first two parts of the trilogy tonight, rather than finishing up some much needed work. I found them entrancing.I take issue with those who've criticized the religious content of the books or said that they're only fantasy: Mr. Pullman is an Oxford trained literature professor and he's pulling a great deal of this out of Milton. Which I think is wonderful. Children's literature shouldn't pose moral issues any less clearly than adults. Indeed, the world portrayed by these books is much more morally relevant than so-called guides to moral rectitude, such as the unspeakably horrible &quot;Prayer of Jabez.&quot; But there is more to it than that: they are a window into an entire branch of literature that Americans almost never delve into. Comparisons to the Lord of the Rings are apt, but not because of the moral sweep or epic tone. They are apt because this is the creation of a careful and cultivated mind steeped in the best of our western literary and philosophical traditions.I'd also add that these books are only anti-Christian if you hold a very narrow view of Christianity that has more to do with social hegemony of fundamentalist churches in small communities than it has to do with any real engagement in either the historic or textual framework in which Christianity is contained. The thoughts they express are not heretical but strike to the quick of the essential contradictions of the continuing adventure that is Western literature. (I hesitate to say world literature, or post modern literature or any of the like because I think anything told as a novel, with chapters, is pretty well western literature by this point, The Tale of Genji aside.)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You will find that these books provide a fast paced journey with fantastic creatures, characters and plot development. There is a good flow to the writing and it will keep you turning pages whether you're 15 or 25. The polarization of reviews to be found are religious in backing. You won't find a one star rating from someone based on the story or the prose, but on their distaste for any themes they find against their own dogma. The story does attack tyranny and religious domination. A snippet from the book: \\"I met an angel: a female angel.. She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupidity. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom, have always tried to open minds; the Authority and his churches have always tried to keep them closed.\\" Its really a sum of that; independence and critical thought over suppression, dogma and dominion.Lyra and Will are the two heroes of the series. Each has an instrument that provides them some fantastic power. The books are filled with parallel worlds and various other entities borrowed from theoretical physics. If you are looking for science fiction and fantasy mixed stories in marvelous settings with plots to keep you jumping, this is a good bet."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One of the things I love about this series is that it is so multifaceted. It is not a typical fantasy story of good versus evil. There are a myriad of characters, each with their own agendas, their own realities. The narrative voice doesn't push the reader into rooting for any one side. The focus is on Lyra throughout the books, because the books are about her journey to adulthood. The further I got into the series the more delighted I was to find that characters I once thought to be evil weren't predictable.Take Mrs. Coulter for instance. Evil? No doubt. But does she serve the agenda of any other character or cause in the book? No, she'll switch sides whenever it's to her advantage, and just because she's ruthlessly evil doesn't mean she lacks soft spots (Albeit she does know how to use her soft spots to her own advantage).This is an intelligent series, one that is sometimes misunderstood if you try to see the books as saying anything about religion. The books aren't trying to say anything about religion, they're trying to talk about humanity and growing up, using a multi-faceted and complex universe in which to set the cosmic intrigue and machinations of the various characters."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have completed two of the three novels and have begun the third.This is a powerful book. The only character with any depth at this point is Lyra, the protagonist. However, she is a very wonderful creation -- feisty, real, and totally captivating. The character \\"Will\\" also offers some potential.The level of \\"invention\\" as Aristotle called it, which is the very heart of fantasy, is very high in this book. Full of amazement, astonishment, surprise. Pullman is an older man, but he has the imagination of a middle schooler, and the literary skills to bring his imaginary worlds to life.Without spoiling anything,I must say, we are back to the \\"War in Heaven.\\" This is a popular theme with British fantasy writers, and \\"War in Heaven\\" was the title of a classic by Charles Williams, a dear friend of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. Well, we are there again.Aside from \\"deep themes\\" of theological mystery, just on the immediate level of narrative this story \\"kicks.\\" It grips the reader, and forget expectations or cliche plots. I defy anyone to predict -- halfway through -- where this story is going.Various church groups, mainly in America, have castigated the book for \\"spreading atheism.\\" Well, Pullman seems more anti-clerical than atheist, although I have no idea what his personal beliefs may be. Anticlericalism has been an old staple of European literature since Voltaire. Much of this ill-considered attack seems based on ignorance. Few of the bishops or fundamentalist ministers attacking the book have even a glimmer of understanding of literary history.Marvelous. I can't waste time on this review-- have to get back to the third volume of the trilogy. Can't stop.This is a real winner. I'm out there in the snow cheering for Lyra. Hope this spunky little lady keeps her courage and prevails!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read all three books. I thought they all were well written - the first being a fantastic read ... even given the anti-catholic views you can't help but notice throughout the stories. I don't see the books as detrimental to anyone's faith. It is what it is ... well written fiction - albeit you wouldn't mind the girl being replaced with a more likeable main character (and maybe gotten rid of some of the daemons. Some were just downright creepy). Someone should have taken notes from Tolkein, Rowling and Lewis. Unfortunately, the movie was a major disappointment. Like Timeline, Da Vinci Code and a few others out there, DON'T READ THE BOOK BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE! You'll be severely disappointed.Would I let my nine year old read this book? Probably not right now - He has read and enjoyed Lewis and Rowling, but I don't think he's quite ready for Pullman. As a librarian, I would reserve this book for the high-schoolers....maybe even jr. high depending on their level of understanding, but not any younger. Thankfully, we aren't lacking great reads before he's old enough for this one.As to this book being anything like Harry Potter, Tolkeins works of art, or Narnia ...forget it! Someone clearly hasn't read them. There is just no possible comparison! Although, there are some \\"newbies\\" out there that come close to being great written works of art - His Dark Materials isn't one of them ... even if it's been out for a while and had a movie made."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is supposed to be a twist on Milton. I can't comment on that, as I've never read Paradise Lost, but it is an interesting work. Catholics appear to be angry at the depiction of the Church, but seem to miss the idea that the Church in this series seems more Calvinist than Catholic, so I'm surprised there hasn't been more Presbyterians up in arms over it. In any case, Christianity hasn't always been the world's greatest influence, and drawing a picture of a Church that controls science will make people who know history think of Galileo and other scientific \\"heretics\\", with heresy of course being defined as going against the doctrine of the Church. I suggest that if you plan on reading this and are deeply religious, examine yourself first to see if you can think about something contradicting your beliefs. Try Job: A Comedy of Justice by Robert Heinlein as a warmup. If you don't have a problem with Heinlein's depiction of God in that book, then you shouldn't have a problem with Pullman's.Feminists are angry that Lyra is such a strong character in book one, and then Will has to help her out in the next two books. Well, if I were to fall through into a completely different world, I think I'd need some coaching on what is safe and what isn't too. Just because Pullman has the characters in his world say that \\"women can't be Scholars\\" and other things, does not mean that he is a misogynist. Lyra could not work as a character had she been raised differently. People, please realize that an author does not have to believe everything he writes. I haven't ever read an interview with Pullman, but I doubt that he holds all the views on women and religion that he has written in this series.To those that say that there is nothing really new in here, I ask you to remember that there are very few works created that do not have the feel or even the influence from other works. I suggest that you do what one reviewer suggested and go and look up those references, as then you will have learned something new and have an idea where Pullman got these ideas from.Admittedly, there are some plot holes and some things that sound like quasi-physics. I don't feel like going into them as there are plenty of other reviewers who hated the series to tell you exactly what they are.To those comparing Pullman with Tolkien and C.S. Lewis--here's a novel idea, he's neither. All of Lewis' fiction is deeply religious, with all of his works having Christian allegory. Don't try to tell me Aslan is not a Christ figure, or that most of the Peralanda trilogy seems to be a retelling of the Adam and Eve story, but with evil not getting a foothold in the world. Tolkien helped set the standard for fantasy, and his world is so well-developed and realized that comparisions against him are often unfair. Tolkien was also deeply religious but it didn't make it into his work in as blatant a manner as Lewis'. It is quite clear that Pullman in the book is unhappy with the power Christianity has in the world.When it comes to the daemons, maybe Pullman could have come up with something better than just using the ae dipthong as a substitue for demon. Nevertheless, a person's daemon is their soul. They also seem to be both a foil and a reflection of that person's characteristics. That's why it makes sense that cutting someone off from their daemon makes them a shadow of who they were and why they die. Get some kid to explain to you what digimon are and then you'll have another idea of what the daemons are like, but without the actual physical and psychological connection. I personally think it could be troublesome to have your soul revealed to the world, but it is still an interesting idea.The story does seem to drag at points, and the marketing of this as a children's book could be questionable, unless the kid was reading the aforementioned Tolkien and Lewis at a young age and as capable of understanding the violence and some of the confusion of the books. If you are a responsible parent, and actually take an active interest in what your child does and sees, better read it first.To those who say the ending is contrived I say to you to go watch Escaflowne (subtitled of course). These kids are supposed to be humanity's great chance to make itself better. The fate of the world resting on a couple people, kids or adults, is a common enough device that you should have run into it somewhere before. Remember, this is supposed to be a twist on Paradise Lost, and the idea is that Adam and Eve (...) it up, but Lyra and Will get it right. It seems to me that the people complaining of this have not had enough exposure to the idea.I love how all these people are saying that \\"it's bad for impressionable children.\\" Remember, when it's Nazism or Communism, it's brainwashing, when it's religion, it's instilling moral values.Bottom line: You'll probably either love or hate this series. The ending indeed could have used some work. Pullman wasn't as tight with his ideas as he needed to be to really make the series work well. But overall, give it a shot. You might be pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I purchased this box set only after seeing the movie trailer. I had recalled reading Golden Compass years before, and I remembered it was good, but decided to read it over since I couldn't recall what it was about.Utter Brilliance. Philip Pullman manages to create a world unlike any other using a mixture of both fantasy and science. Being a scientist myself, I could relate a lot with the alternate realities and although the concept of daemons was confusing at first, he explained the complicated idea of it so well that I believe he should get a notable mention for just that. If you are the type of person who hates slow paced books, than I can guarantee you will not be bored with this one. Looking back at the trilogy now, the only \\"slow\\" parts in the entire series took place in the Golden Compass first four chapters. After that, Pullman has us moving ahead at an astonishing paces, juggling between various intertwined plot lines at once. I sometimes found myself having an adrenaline rush keeping track of it all, making me feel much more for Lyra since she had so many things to take care of in such little time.I don't really see why C.S. Lewis's books are compared to Pullmans. I don't believe they have anything in common. Lewis does create his own world like Pullman did, but Pullman seemed much more epic to me with a much more complicated storyline, while Lewis just goes straight ahead towards the goal. There was just so much going on here that I was not at all suprised with the way he split the narratives in The Amber Spyglass. Pullman is also darker than Lewis is, and presents much more character development. We see Lyra go from a child to an adult in such a short time dealing with a very complicated world and adultlike situations.For those concerned with the religious aspects of the books, I myself am a religious person but this did not stop me from enjoying his books; instead I think it made the experience even better. Pullman is constantly challenging the norms in His Dark Materials, not only the magisterium. It's just the idea that not everything is perfect, and you see this within the characters a lot since there is no clear cut line between what side who is on. If you are really a staunch Christian why don't you give it a go: you really might be surprised at how good it is. I myself recommend these books to both children and adults alike- they contain so many different uses of language and themes that both sides can appreciate it. Pullman makes a lot of implications that younger children cannot understand but adults will see immediately. So, even if you read it as a child- read it again, you might be surprised.Pullman did not bore me even once in his books. I was intrigued throughout all of it, and at this I was very glad I purchased the hardcover copies since I gave it to my younger siblings to read as well. It was so amazing that my brother (who never reads anything in his life) finished it in one go. A must read for everyone, fantasy lovers or not (I'm not)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"No doubt about it -- Phillip Pullman is a fairly militant atheist, and these books do, strictly speaking, profess heresy. Pullman loathes C.S. Lewis, so if you're expecting to find an analog to the Narnia series, read Harry Potter instead. If I were a fundamentalist Christian, I am sure I would find His Dark Materials very offensive; as a mostly secular Jew, I found the books eyebrow-raising.However, it's hard to find anyone who doesn't like these books on literary rather than religious grounds. I can read perfectly well with raised eyebrows, and I was entirely captivated with the thoroughly imagined world and indelible characters Pullman creates. Lyra is one of the best female characters I've ever encountered, and I really, really want my own armored bear. Very quickly you come to care passionately about many of the characters. I remember reading The Subtle Knife on the Stairmaster at the gym, and working out for about an hour and a half because I just couldn't stop reading. In fact I remember crying during a particularly devastating scene, right there on the Stairmaster at the gym. Maybe I pretended I was just sweating really hard.The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife set a standard that Pullman could not sustain in the climax to the series, and The Amber Spyglass is more formulaic and less compelling than the other two. Still, those two are so good that I have to give the series five stars over all.A final word: in the Harry Potter vs. Dark Materials debate -- they both win."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In addition to the original and well-conceived story of this series, what struck me the most was Pullman's really great pacing of the whole thing. Usually, stories have slower and faster moments to keep the reader moving along, but this series truly keeps your attention from the moment you begin until its conclusion. You'll find it hard to put down, so I recommend either getting this omnibus edition with all three books included or at least getting all three books at the same time. You'll be in agony waiting for the second or third book to arrive after reading the first!The His Dark Materials trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is ambitious, original and intelligent. While geared for and marketed toward young adults, the complex themes and undercurrents in the story are relevant and fascinating for adult readers as well.Kudos to Pullman for creating such a high-quality literature offering!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have just this moment finished the final book in the His Dark Materials trilogy. I honestly don't know what it was, but this trilogy has blown my mind.Imagine plodding through the first book of a trilogy, not too impressed at all with it. Throughout the second half of the book, I'm thinking of going back on my plan to read through all three books, back to back. Whereas I once thought how nice the trilogy would look in my bookshelf, I was now thinking of who I might give them to once I finished. Then, I reach the end of that first book. It finishes on a high point, with a final chapter which is intriguing enough to send me to the first chapter of book two. And then the series takes an interesting turn...It turns out that the world in which the first book took place was merely a small part of the universe encompassed in the entire trilogy. Without expecting it, I am captivated by the story which bored me at points. I tear through the second book in a little over a week (quick for someone with not much time to read), and then read the astonishing third book in a little less than two weeks. In reading the final pages of the third book, I have finished a trilogy which I now consider to be one of the best stories I have ever read, one which I am likely to return to more than once. It is not Lord of the Rings. It is not Harry Potter. Nor should it be compared to either of the two. It has some similarities, but is an entirely different creature. Characters I was iffy on at the beginning have become very dear to my heart. Most amazingly, I am very anxious to reread the first book. Knowing what I now know about the rest of story, the events in the first book, as well as the other two, will take on some whole new meanings.I don't expect people to feel as I do, but I would recommend this book to just about anybody. And I would tell them to throw out all of their expectations of what they think the story will be like. Throw out all preconcieved comparisons to any other stories until the end of the last book, at which time they can make their own comparisons. I would warn them that these are NOT children's books, even though some articles make them out to be. The religious and emotional issues dealt with are too deep for almost anyone below high school level. And some of the violence is definitely not for the young. Lastly, the only type of person I would not recommend these books to is someone who is not open minded in terms of God and religion. Deeply religious people might be offended at some of the ideas presented in the story, unless they can objectively differentiate fiction from non.So there you go. It saddens me to be away from the worlds inside this story. I can only hope Philip Pullman, still being alive, might continue with a new story set in this world at some point in the future."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read these books over the course of two weeks. Whenever I had a spare moment, I could not put them down. The characters, settings, storyline are incredibly compelling. Pullman certainly creates memorable characters, from the ethereal, compassionate Serafina Pekkala unforgettable coldness and complexity of Mrs. Coulter to the fearsome Iorek bear king. These books had me mesmerized and totally immersed in the world/s of Lyra and Will for three straight weeks. If you like fantasy, adventure, colorful and memorable characters, these fast-paced novels are chock full of all these things.However, since this series has recently attracted controversy due to the upcoming release of the film version, I might as well address the obvious.. If you are a Christian conservative, this books will likely offend you... I would strongly caution that if you even allow your kids to read these books, you'd better be intellectually prepared for the results. There are very strong adult and religious (or anti-religious, rather) themes, especially laced throughout the second and third books. You should read them yourself and prepare to engage in some thoughtful, open-minded discussion. You can either use the opportunity to simply bash another book a la the Da Vinci Code, or you can use this as an opportunity to thoughtfully engage the culture.I myself found the atheistic themes a bit overdone and contrived, especially in the third installment, but that doesn't mean I enjoyed the books any less.The Golden Compass was by far my favorite book of the three."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of those times where I just don't get how other people could come to the conclusion that something like this deserved any awards. I don't my conclusion is purely a matter of holding different individual preferences or personal beliefs either. This series just doesn't match up to the hype it's received. I agree with many other reviewers, that the first one is the best of the lot, and the third hardly digestible; but even the first one doesn't rate five stars. The alternate reality Pullman creates is imaginative, but his characters, dialogue, and moralizing are not. Sure, bears in armor are pretty interesting, and the daemon idea was somewhat unusual, but armored bear, 12 year old girl, and gyspy-like men are all depicted in a similarly flat fashion. It also seemed to me that the daemons, instead of lending much of creative value, provide a short-cut venue for characters to talk to themselves and let us silly readers in on what's supposed to be happening. Lots of telling and very little showing here. Finally - the dialogue! I could barely stomach it, especially in number three. When Pullman doesn't use dialogue to preach at us, it seems like he wants to use it to try his hand at harlequin-esque romance. Twelve year old protagonists breathlessly declaring their eternal love, spending the night in each other's arms, sharing hot kisses and thrilling touches? And all this is supposed to save the Universe from that nasty, horrible, God person and all his evil minions? Uh...come again?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a wonderful fantasy trilogy that is a good read regardless of age. It is hard to find a good story line that doesn't borrow ideas from great past authors. It is original and thought provoking. I recommend these books to all fantasy lovers of all ages!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman's Dark Materials Triology is a masterfully written set of stories that should appeal to adults and older children (I would suggest 12+) alike. They extremely well written, and perfectly conjure up the images of the worlds and people that are the subjects of these books. While the messages are sometimes dark, and left me with an ongoing sense of unease throughout, I think that the \\"anti-Church\\" sentiment that some find in these books should actually be seen as a statement against corruption, for example the abuse of the position of power and trust that the Church holds in society. The stories are actually about the fact that innocence, love, friendship and faithfulness are what will save everything.I would recommend these to everyone, they are stunningly well written (and should be read with an open mind). As for parallels with Harry Potter? ... forget it - these far outclass JK Rowling's books (which I also enjoyed), and are novels about childhood, not children's novels."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First thing I'd like to say: people who talk about this book having no character development are wrong, I believe. Philip Pullman depicts his characters in such a subtle way that you become attached to them without having to read through their life stories. You can take so much out of their actions and dialogue. The absence of sap in this trilogy blows me over.Nothing has affected me so profoundly before. It was this trilogy that inspired me to write my own. My views are completely altered- and I hope they never change back. It is like seeing the world through new eyes. You start looking at things differently, wondering how you ever could have been so shallow and ignorant.I've recommended these books to many of my friends, but judging from their responses, they are truly not for everyone. People have different preferences, of course, but I don't see how you could just drop any of these books without knowing what happens. The plot reels you and and keeps you there, close to the end, but never quite reaching it. Even at the Amber Spyglass, there are questions unanswered, and I think that is part of the majesty of it all. Pullman doesn't tell you how to think, he presents each idea in the same way, lets you decide what to believe.These books had me thinking and feeling differently than I ever have before. A period of depression I've never known crept up on me after the conclusion, keeping me awake at night, hoarding my attention during the day. One morning, however, I woke up and realized it was okay to feel the way I was feeling. That day I noticed the smallest things, thought more about life in general than was normal. Now, this is a regular occurence.These books leave me with a sense of beautiful sadness every time I read them. It takes something powerful to send chills up my spine. After reading His Dark Materials, I am grateful that I don't have nerve damage. What else is there to say? Read them, if you think they're your kind of books. Don't shun them because they are classified as children's fantasy. And please don't compare them to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. These are wonderful books in their own ways, as are His Dark Materials. As I am reading The Golden Compass, or The Subtle Knife, or The Amber Spyglass, I'm not thinking about Hogwarts or the Shire. There's not enough room left in my mind for them. You wouldn't think a thirteen-year-old could think in this way, but they most surely can."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I sent these to my daughter to read after she saw the new movie. She is enjoying them immensely."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Bought this set for my girlfriend for Christmas. Got a great price and she loves the series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First, I would define this book as geared for older teens not children. I (a graduate student studying Molecular Biology) had to have a dictionary with me when reading the first book; that said, I loved it. The first book is written from the main characters perspective, and so well in fact, that when she was by something, so was I. Although in retrospect I should have been able to determine who the said person was. I clearly am not as well written as the author. Pullman is able to pull you in and re-direct you in such a fabulous way as to make you giggle or gasp out loud (much to my husband unease). All I can say was that it was certainly more pleasing and thrilling of a ride than the Potter series and certainly far better written. I would say this series is written for adult readers, where-as the Potter series is written with the goal of getting small children to read and enjoy reading. In comparison this is a much better written series and much more worthy of attention and glory.I read the first 2 books in 7 days, and am in the middle of the third. I have every other book the author has published in my wish list.* I have not seen the movie, and thus cannot compare*Adults BUY THIS SERIES!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These three books are amazingly well written. In inventiveness, language structure, and vocabulary they outclass the Hogwarts' tales a hundredfold or more. The characters are very well drawn, dynamic, and even highly un-likeable in moments, like real people.This is true Literature in the classic sense of the word, educated writing for intelligent readers, not just thematically but creatively as well. It is meant to challenge and entertain within a fictional world(s).However, without giving away anything, I must say that no one \\"kills god\\" in any of the books. If you read that comment in any review, it simply means the reviewer is puppetting secondhand information without even bothering to educate themselves first with the literature....much in the same way that most Americans treat religion, unchallenged faith without thought or education. And contrary to popular belief, ill-informed opinions based on hearsay are ultimately empty and carry no merit. This particular story is much more complex than some alleged assignation plot against god.(Incidentally, there is another book which contains a storyline about the overthrow of god, it's called \\"The Bible\\" and it isn't nearly as well written.)I would urge you either to read these books or read something else that interests you, but reading is imperative to understanding or challenging opinion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While I feel this story could have been told in one or two books, they all moved quickly and I was constantly interested. I greatly suggest this series!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like most children's literature, this trilogy is so enjoyable and tangible that kids and grown-ups alike will become entangled in the world of Lyra and her companions. The books are captivating and dark, and the allegory of religion is prevalent. You should read books to enjoy them, but also to learn from them. I think Pullman does an incredible job of weaving together characters and plot with a message that causes you to think even after the world of the books is over. There are messages about faith, love, trust, instinct, and human nature that appeal to the curious mind. That's something special and makes this trilogy worth reading.I recommend these books to anyone who enjoys fantasies."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ever since I first read Northern Lights (UK name for the Golden Compass) over two years ago, I've been competely obsessed with this series. I just couldn't stop reading it from when Lyra and Pan crept into the retiring room right until Lyra and Will made a pact to come to the bench on Midsummer's Eve. This book is perfect for people ages 10 and up who like a little bit of Fantasy, Sci Fi, and Reality. Philip Pullman, you are without a doubt the best author that ever walked this, and other, worlds!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Just like anyone else, I liked the Harry Potter series, but I really thought this series of books was much more intelligent. The protagonist(s) really get to your heart, and the story is fast-paced and interesting. I think this would make a good read for anyone who loved the Harry Potter series. It will also make a great present for anyone who likes to read. These books are appropriate for both older children and any adult."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an exceptional trilogy. The characters are deeply founded. Their world is also wonderfully crafted. The writing, no matter what you think of Pullman's ideas, is beautiful.I would just like to point out that I think it is amazing how narrow-minded people can be. When you choose to read fantasy, you should realize that it is fantasy. There are some things you might not agree with, such as the portrayal of God. If, however, you choose to criticize the book based on religious principles, you need to take a second look at yourself."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I really enjoyed these books! The storyline is great. I couldn't put these books down, and I love all this contrversy it has caused! Read these books ASAP, and you will be in for the best read of your life!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love this book series and I can't wait for the author to realease his next book related to this universe. I think these books are a must read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is an epic fantasy trilogy that is right up there with Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in terms of detail and scope. Philip Pullman has created a world, or rather, many worlds that contain a vast array of characters both good and bad. The novel is listed under \\"Juvenile Fiction\\" at my local library, but some of the content, especially in the third novel, gets into some pretty dark stuff and is interesting and suitable for both teenagers and adults.Lyra, an orphan girl, finds herself in the midst of a war between good and evil in which she plays a crucial role. She is armed with a truth-telling device that leads her on a journey across many worlds. The book borrows ideas from popular topics in physics, namely, the belief that multiple universes exist in different dimensions that are inaccessible to us.THE GOOD* The world that the characters live in is intricately detailed* Even the most fantastical aspects of the story are rooted in truth* The story unfolds slowly so you aren't overwhelmed* Each chapter ends with a twist that makes you want to continue reading* The lines between good and evil aren't always clearly drawn, giving the story an element of truthTHE BAD* Sometimes the story unfolds a little too slowly* The physical version of the trilogy is big and sometimes hard to handle - ie - holding it in your hands while reading for long periods of time becomes tiring - if you have a Kindle, go for the digital version for a more manageable format"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman does a wonderful job of emulating C.S. Lewis, and other top fantasy writers. His style is easy to read. His plot flows smoothly, but not to smooth, or else I would fall asleep. I will recommend this to all my C. S. Lewis friends who are on the verge of changing over, and to my friends who have already seen the light. Pullman is worth several re-reads."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read the first book so far. It is excellent! I got the books after reading about Philip Pullman in ffrf's daily freethought emails. (see ffrf.org) It is fast paced, origonal, deeply philosophical without being pedantic. The daemon's are a wonderful device in the plot and themes.I highly enjoyed the first book and will finish the series.John Whitney"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Read these as a kid (in middle school) and purchased to read again for a religious studies course my senior year in college. I definitely did not pick up on the (anti)religious undertones as a kid. The author reminds me of an Atheist version of C.S Lewis. Religion aside, this is an amazing trilogy, and I'm please to add it to my collection. Each book is difficult to put down."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an engaging tale, that keeps you entertained from the beginning to the end. It combines all the elements for a splendid read, the work of a highly creative mind."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although i am only age nine with only marginal skills of reading comprehension i love this book it has action adventure mystery and here and there love. in this book philip pullman shows his great understanding of writing literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had heard of this series for many years and finally after a friend's recommendation decided to order this set. First off, the set itself is in great condition and the case is very beautiful.Secondly, and most importantly, the series itself is just so well done. The science mixed with religion mixed with magic is just seamless. The storyline holds you tight and never lets go as you delve deeper into the worlds of Philip Pullman.Get these books now!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am not a huge 'fantasy' story fan. I liked the Harry Potter series and thats about it. However, this trilogy was written so well, I couldn't put it down. I'm reading the BBCs top 100 books and this trilogy was pretty much the first one on the list so I thought I'd start there. I can see why it made the list! From the first page, there was action, adventure and mystery all put together by believable characters that you love to love, or love to hate. A must read for any young adult or adult in general (I'm in my 30s)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I wanted to read the book after I saw the movie for The Golden Compass, my sister was kind enough to purchase it for me. I couldn't put it down once I started- I finished it in about 3 days. I liked that the trilogy was all in 1 book since I like to back track sometimes."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Meet Lyra and Will, two (what seem like) ordinary children who come from to different universes...Staring with The Golden Compass, readers with meet Lyra, a half wild, half civilized child.

Soon, they get separted...In The Amber Spyglass, Will and Lyra discover their destiny, and the meaning of Dust..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I usually dislike science fiction books, but a friend referred me to this book and I changed my mind quickly. Pullman creates new worlds that are unique and clearly written. I started reading this book and I could tell right off it was going to be good. Pullman introduces you to Daemons, animals that follow you around all you life, early on in the book and it was this unique idea that locked me into the plot. The symbolism in the book is priceless. Pullman really outdid himself with this one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I cannot say enough good things about this trilogy. A friend gave me Compass, which I loved. I promptly ordered the next two books which were even better. The type that I read just a little bit each night, savoring the story, until the last part of book 3, when I just couldn't put it down anymore. This is quite a compliment, as I usually have a hard time getting my feeble mind to embrace and follow stories that are not written in first person. Follow Lyra and Pantalaimon on their journey to the North. With them, meet the many terrifically developed characters that make this story such a joy to read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are so great! I read all three in three days. The only part I didn't like was how it ended...although I won't tell you the end let me just say you'll be shocked and heartbroken. My friend recommended these to me because I finished my other books and I'm so glad she did. Please read these books if you are a fantasy lover, they will make it impossible for you to put them down.*Note: These should only be read by people who can handle slight violence and language."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After I finished Sweep #14 I was on the book rebound. I was wondering around (literaly) without an aim. My friend recomended me this book (normally I wouldnt take him seriously) but I had seen the Amber Spyglass in stores before. So I bought the first book (The gold compass) and read it. It was good, but I was out of cash...so I borrowed the second one from him. I just finished it an hour ago..and if he dosent give me the third book on Monday, I might just have to hurt him....just kidding!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is hands down the greatest series of books I have ever read. After I had read the first one I felt a longing for the other two. I bought them and never regretted it. This is definately a series of books that you'll want to read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The stereotype of fantasy is a good guy pitted against a bad guy in a magical battle to save the world.This is certainly NOT that.These were truly some of the best books I have read. These aren't just simple fantasy books for children or young adults; these will be enjoyable and thought-provoking even to the parents. It is true to realistic events and real characteristics. No character is purely good or evil. The books seem so real you forget that it's fiction after a few pages. It all seems possible. Subtle debates about issues appliable to real life carry through the trilogy.A word of caution, however: some material may be offensive to Christians, though I have seen few who were offended and would suggest reading it with an open mind. The material is open to interpretation."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is my all time favorite book. The world rises so many questions and things I think would be cool if they were real. This book is very exciting and creates a whole second world in which most of it takes place.This book was so great I couldn't put it down and when I finished it I HAD to read the sequel, then the next. When I learned by the third book that was it I was very disapionted. I reallly liked this book.It's Great"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These novels are some of the most impressive young adult novels I have ever read. Pullman has written stories that can appeal to adolescents as well as adults. Almost as soon as beginning the The Golden Compass I was drawn into caring for the young characters and couldn't wait to find out what would happen to them. These books are definetly not for young childen, these are not Harry Potters. However that is what makes the stories so compelling. The reader does not know what is coming and how the story will end. As a devout reader on young adult fiction it was a relief to finally read novels with a decidely adult twist, stories that did not \\"dumb down\\" for their audience. All in all a thouroughly engrossing read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It was boring at first but the more into the book I was the more entangled and fasinated by it's charecters and scenery, how could a person write such talented work and I'm sure many would agree with me when I say that it is the best book of many by far and I would recomend it to anyone that loves fantasy stories."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While I admit that Pullman has considerable skill as a writer, I'd like to warn others that these books are blatantly anti-Christian. Do a simple Google search of the authors name or the book titles and you'll find plenty to concern you IF you are Christian."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman is an excellent storyteller, and you don't pick up on his plan until the 3rd book, the Amber Spyglass, when he reveals the God is a liar and did not create the universe. Pullman is a self-declared atheist and calls his books the \\"anti-Narnia\\". Just be warned!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman pretends to write fantasy, but rather uses fantasy as a platform to denounce God and present a reversed spiritual world. Witches and the rebel angels fight on the side of good, and God and the psalm singing angels are considered evil. One example, towards the end of the third book, is when the girl Mary describes an angel she met... \\"Her name was Xaphania. She told me many things... She said that all the history of human life has been a struggle between wisdom and stupididty. She and the rebel angels, the followers of wisdom have always tried to open minds; the Authority (God Almighty) and his churches have always tried to keep them closed. She gave me many examples from my world.\\" The Authority dies in the third book and is replaced by Enoch from the Bible. Pullman finishes the book by encouraging people to build the Republic of Heaven since there will never be a Kingdom of Heaven. The most frustrating thing about these three books is that the reader doesn't know for sure who is bad and who is good until the third book. As a teacher, I was reluctant to recommend the first book in the series to my students because I wasn't sure what the author was really trying to say. By the second book, I was pretty concerned about the content but decided to wait until the third book to make a judgement. The third book confirmed my concerns, and was disheartening to read. I finished it, just to make absolutely sure that there wasn't a redeeming ending. On the contrary, the book ends with the two emerging pubescent children falling in love and being intertwined in each others arms then parting for life. Yuck!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I picked these books up at a used book sale. The first half of the first book didn't even make sense with all the new terms mixed in a parallel universe. The second book was better at explaining things, but had some questionable material. The third book was downright sacriligious. The \\"good\\" guys are out to challenge the \\"Authority\\" who is just a really really old angel, and to replace society and religion. The church is seen as nothing but a mindless enemy. I destroyed my copies, and I hope with this review, some parents will think twice about allowing their children to be exposed to such filth. It's amazing that this offensive stuff even gets printed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A definite read for only the most callused anti-Christian bigot. It is unfortunate that this author's adequate skill at story telling is lost on such a blatant bigot. His intolerant views are forced into this story unnecessarily. The bigotry adds nothing needful to the plot. Even at the point when he kills God it is so anticlimactic you barely noticed that it has occured. The story could easily have been told without his trite narrow-minded views clouding an otherwise good story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I didn't know these books were about the death of God. I loved Harry Potter. They were creative and good vs. evil with good winning. It was pure fantasy and fun to read. These are NOT like those fantasy books. The books end with the DEATH OF GOD. Google more info on these books before you buy them and decide for yourselves. They should come with a warning that subject matter is controversial."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am so sorry i had to give one star to this book. I dont think it deserves it.To begin with we wouldn't have a problem with his atheistic perspective, if it was nicely set, and the philosophical questions expressed in the book were not so completely naive.But the book is a failure, badly written, his author seems immature and so obviously low talented. He simply cannot write. Some of the ideas were pretty good, but poorly developed.The third book, above all, where one would normally expect the stories to come in a nice conclusion, is unacceptable. His ideas remain unfinished, or badly finished, which is almost worse.The beginning was not so bad, but it could be better and we thought it would turn interesting at the end. Lyra was a lovely trump, but she became irritating and indifferent.The author seemed to love her so much, and he thought equally natural that everyone of his heroes would share his feelings. But the devotion of the Texan pilot, or Iorek, or even her mother's at the end, is unjustified. Inexplicable.God, the-bad-guy in the book, is such an idiot. Everybody is preparing to fight the last and greatest war of all, but it's so f***ing easy at the end, the way God, this elderly pathetic man, comes to fall right at Lyra's and Will's feet, so that they can destroy him just like that! A thing that they won't do (they won't do even that!!!) since he seems to die out of age!Metatron is a loser, he falls for Mrs Coulter, believes all her lies, he is betrayed, he is deceived and killed at the end because of Marisa's and Asriel's conspiracy, which he is so blind to detect! Surely an angel of his age and powers should know better than that! Not falling into the abyss, while he could fly, for example!The chapters about the world of the dead were ridiculous. Lyra changed the rules, convincing the Harpies to cooperate with the idiotic alternatives she proposes.The battle was so brief. The Subtle knife, whith which we were promised God would be killed, was used only to open windows, create gosts and peel potatoes. The Aletheometer, a authentically inspired instrument, is not asked as often as it should.We didn't quite understood why Lyra, as Eve, after sleping with Will, stopped the Dust of slipping away of the Worlds. Mary as the snake was also poorly justified.We cannot understand why this is a children's book, and why it became so successful. It was an adult book, and really bad literature. The author -lector in English Literature- should be better in writing, avoiding all those gaps in the plot (especially in the end, where everything should come together to a logical explanation and conclusion).Pullman lingers here and there, giving us insignificant and useless and boring details, while in other cases where details are absolutely needed, none is given.At last, we are just happy we borrowed it, because if we had also spend money in buying we would feel extremely stupid.Now I am just sorry I lost my time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I tried getting past the first half and simply lost interest. I don't think Pullman is a very good writer. So I didn't finish and don't plan to. If this is the best of the 3 books then don't bother. With so much out there to read, I decided not to waste time on this one. Now that I see that the end has to do with battling armored polar bears, I am glad I jumped ship."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you are a christian, or at least believe that there is a God and God is good , then you may not want your childern reading these books, or if you let them I advise that you read the series first before allowing them to. the premis of these books, in a nut shell is, God is an evil tyrant, the rebel angels kicked out of heaven are good, and gave humans consousness(spelling?) so we would not just be slaves. In the end the humans who have realized that God is bad, along with the rebel angels, storm heaven and kill God. pullman uses the missuse of realigon through out history to give creedence to his view that God is evil. This is a very short sighted and naieve view, however children reading this may not understand this and be influenced to believe that religons always act in the way that their god wishes them to, so if a religion acts in a evil way then it is god who is telling them to."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just finished these books. I very much wish I had not started. The first two books are not particularly well written, Extensively developing characters and situations that are not relevant to the story and ultimately a vacuous waste of time. In book 3 it becomes clear the purpose of the first 2 is to attempt to lend legitimacy (through sheer weight) by turning the third book into a trilogy.I am FAR from fanatical about this stuff, and thought those who condemned Harry Potter were overreacting at a basically irrational level.But these books are quite another matter indeed. They are truly the most virulent, blasphemous, and obscene things I have had the misfortune to stumble upon. I do NOT appreciate Amazon's recommendation that because I liked Harry Potter I would like these. Other than the main protagonist being under 18 they have little, if anything at all, in common.I was stunned by the depth of anger and hatred dished out by Mr. Pullman. Dare I say it is reminiscent of the Nazis? Some might well see similarities.Having wasted my time, and polluted my brain with this trash the only good that can come of it is to warn off everyone I can.So be warned, \\"The Golden Compass\\" is Pullman's platform for a many hours long rant of his malevolent hatred of God, and just about anything else to do with objective morals. Any person believing in any higher being, or even the absolutes of right and wrong, should consider this a MUST MISS!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'll begin by saying that this is an engrossing series. It is well written, much more so than Harry Potter, and quickly ensnares you in a web spun around a 10 year old girl and her journey towards, uhh, killing God, explaining string theory, becoming a sort of neo-Eve, freeing the tortured souls of all eternity, exposing monotheism as a fallacy, and several other rather impressive ends.The problem at this point should be self-evident; overreach. For some reason, Mr. Pullman is attempting to formulate a new epistemology in a series aimed at 12 year olds. There are strains of Cartesian dualism throughout the latter two books and I kept having flashes of Leibniz's \\"Monadology\\" as I was reading about self-aware, indivisible and irreducible \\"Dust.\\" These are confusing topics when tackled by philosophers, slightly more so when done so by a CHILDREN's author. What started off as a fun and intelligent children's series in \\"The Golden Compass\\" very quickly becomes a depressing slog into the tyranny of religion and church (Christians beware) and, moreso, an investigation of sin, redemption, the afterlife, and the nature of divinity...if it indeed exists. Worthy subjects for sure but perhaps not for the target audience.I rated the series as a whole not less than 3 stars because Mr. Pullman is a good writer, and I was engrossed enough to read the series in a couple of days and feel happiness and despair at appropriate parts. I rated it not higher because what should have been a Chronicles of Narnia strained towards becoming a philosophical treatise. The series is powerful and enjoyable in parts, but it is not for children. I could not imagine giving this to a twelve, or even a sixteen year old, and not having them come back with some existential questions.I look forward to reading some of Mr. Pullman's works if he ever decides to get \\"serious\\" and write an adult series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass books are new to me and I've not yet read them. I saw the movie yesterday and was enchanted by it, literally. The production was top-notch and a very sensitive presentation of all the complex facets of the book. The Daemons were very real, each one so like it's living counterpart, they did not seem like they were man-created. The central argument is one I'm very familiar with, that there is no real need for a God that is outside of ourselves. Each one of us has within us the potential to evolve not just to the Christ level of consciousness, but to the level of God, with all of His attributes. This is not a radical or new idea, but is certainly a heretical one. This doesn't happen overnight or by taking a few seminars, it's the work of a lifetime, I speak from personal experience here. I'm not there yet at 77. Works of art like The G.C. and the Narnia books are bringing this much needed new idea forth into our culture. I know that there are visionaries in the movie industry who are supporting this evolution with their movies. This introduction of these ideas into popular cultures mark the beginning of an entirely new millennium. I will certainly read the books in the near future."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you liked the Narnia Books, but felt they lacked depth, or if you liked the Tolkein Ring Books, but felt lost in the labyrinth of battles and characters, then this trilogy will satisfy! It takes a bit of patience to understand the set-up of the story at first, but once you get it, it's an exciting ride. The characters are magnificent, complicated, heroic. The sub-text is profound and touches many aspects of humanity including greed, loyalty, bravery and the passage from childhood to adulthood.In the first book \\"The Golden Compass\\" we are introduced to Lyra Belacqua, the noble young heroin of all three books, and her shape-shifting daemon/familiar Pan. Longing for adventure, she gets more than she bargains for as she journeys north to face witches, armored polar bears, the deceptions of her own parents and an evil plot to harm children. Her plucky heroism and quick thinking save the day but each of the first two books finishes with the steps into the next story. The three books could have been written as one, and should be read in order.This otherwordly tale will inspire and delight. Parents, read these books aloud with your children. You will all have a great adventure together, and find yourself immersed in a vast world peopled with exciting and fascinating creatures."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Given, these books are aimed towards a younger audience, but adults should find them enjoyable as well. Pullman creates a unique, fantastic universe for his characters that is interesting and diverse. It was very nice to read fantasy that was in no way a Tolkien spinoff! I am particularly fond of the bear king. Books 1 and 3 were better than 2, in my opinion, for overall plot and writing panache. For those worried about the books being an \\"attack on Christianity\\" or any religion, for that matter, I think perhaps these books are best read by those willing to accept that different viewpoints are valid, that questions sometimes *should* be asked, and that a set of fictional books, while introducing new ideas, are not \\"making\\" a given young person think differently. If anything, Pullman leaves the deductions up to the reader, and does not engage in preaching."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"i don't read sci-fi. i don't read lord of the rings, nor have i finished the first harry potter book. i first picked up 'the golden compass' with strong reccommendations from a good friend of mine. i was reluctant at first, but within the first fifteen pages i was swept up and intrigued by this psuedo-historical fantasy setting. it's not fantasy. it's as if one took reality and moved it an inch to the right. perfect and beautiful. never before have i so eagerly anticipated the release of a trilogy. am forever a devoted fan of the 'his dark materials' trilogy. gorgeous, romantic, and nostalgic somehow. good god."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love these books and I think that everyone who likes fantasy will too. They are an amazing adventure for everyone. Starting out with a 12 year old girl named Lyra who's world is different from ours. In her world souls are on the outside and you can talk to them! All three books are great reads and should be read by anyone who is 9 and up."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These are books for all ages. I remember tying to find the third book in this series and the Librarian giving me a funny look while saying \\"you know its in the juvenile section.\\" Maybe this was written for children, but it isn't exactly Dr. Suess either. I might be 27 but I enjoyed these books immensily. It took me away to a magical world and a journey of emotions that few books have. I intend to read these stories to my daughter when she is old enough to understand them. I would recommend this book to anyone 8 years old to 100 years old."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ah, His Dark Materials.The series accused of being anti-christian(and religion as a whole),and still, more importantly, being an amazing an amazing series(the Carnegie and Whitbread awards speak for themselves). Basic Summary without spoilers: Lyra goes all around oxford doing such-and-such, but her friend Roger is kidnapped the Gobblers. Lyra is sent to the leading Gobbler's huose, and she has an instrument callled the Alethiometer, which gives her the answer to anything. Stuff happens, she goes to another world, and meets Will(she meets Will in book 2).The plot is very interesting, and though the first book is more subtle then 2 and 3, overall I don't think there is material TOO offensive. I'm pretty sure that accusations of being anti-christian are wrong, this series is just anti-god and church.The characters are VERY interesting. Lyra, Will, and Coulter by far are the most interesting.This series is VERY original. I was stunned by it all, really. The idea of daemons and the subtle knife especially, for me atleast!And now, THE WRITING. Pullman's prose is PERFECT. His descriptions give you a perfect vision of how everything looks, but he does it WITHOUT giving away into purple prose! Its astonishing!Overall, I give the series a 5(I wish I could give a 6)/5. The Golden Compass/Northern Lights is the greatest work of fiction I've ever read, rivalled only by Johnathan Strange and Mr Norrell, and The Goblet of Fire. 2 was brilliant also. 3 was great, but not anywhere close to 1, and fairly far from 2. I hope you find this review helpfull!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Because of my age, (54), I started out slowly in this work. I have read so many great action adventures over my life and this one became a page turner. This audience for this work is probably late elementary through middle school. The author creates a beautiful possibility and coming of age journey. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in contemporary fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These, are definetly the greatest books in history. Past, present, and future.Young adult? Throw that comment aside -for most people.I was 9 when I read these, and they were (and still are) the absolute best! The only more mature part is in \\"The Amber Spyglass\\", but I'm not spoiling it for you. Go read it yourself!Anyway, I think this time, Phillip out did himself. I mean... WOW!!! \\"The Nancy Drew Files\\" and \\"The Hardy Boys\\" used to be my favorites (they're my third favourite now, the \\"Sally Lockhart Trilogy\\" is my second favorite. Frederick sounds so cute. Don't forget to read them too!), but when I read these, they seemed to be tossed out the window.About 10 of my ex-favorite books were taken out the bookshelf, put on my desk, and the space filled by these extremely great books. VERY original idea! No boring parts, just interesting stuff. If you're looking for a good book with imagination. These, are the ones for you. Like action? Try these!The only thing I'm very confused about is the trilogy title. \\"HIS Dark Materials\\"??? But isn't Lyra the MAIN character??? Isn't Lyra a girl? I mean, yeah, at first she's a tom-boy, but she turns more lady-like later on.But whoever has read these books, I believe are wishing, like me, for it not to be a trilogy, but a whole series. Don't push yourself, Phillip, just WISHING. To anyone who HASN'T read these, I really encourage you to read them.THEY ARE THE BEST!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To some up the entire expirience in one word. Wow. As seems to be a genre turn most science fiction books today are dealing with destorying one god or another.. ((See also Dragons of a Vanished moon) At anyrate I started this serries when i was a sophmore in Highschool and am just now getting around to finishing it. It is deffinatly one of the most inventive stories of its time, and the explanation of Daemons in the last book just makes the serries incredibly believable.. The only thing i was disappointed with was the ending.. I guess much like Dickens original ending of Great expectations.. The book deffinatly sends the reader through the full range of emmotions and was deffinatly entertaining. I'd suggest this book for anyone with the capacity of reason.. :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These three books are wonderful. Now that they come in one book you'll be able to read the whole Magical series. This book is adventure,humore,action and is heart breaking. This wonderful story will make you want to see what else Philp Pullman has written. You will be dissapointed that there are only three books in this series, but that makes your imagination explode with ideas! This book is wroth reading over and over again."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"this book was pretty good. If anyone has ever read Gaiman's \\"neverwere\\" it vaguely resembles that. It is very creativily written but not quite as good. I know I enjoyed this series emesly but be sure to get all three, it never really ends until the last one (amber spyglass)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was initially wary of the marketing blitz surrounding this series in anticipation of the upcoming film, but eventually decided to buy the books because of favorable comparisons to the Harry Potter, Narnia, and Oz series, all of which I loved.While I did enjoy learning about the inhabitants of Lyra's world in the 1st book, the exclusively negative portrayal of religion made me squirm even as a non-religious academic. The 2nd and 3rd books were not only filled with blatant political agenda, but also frustrating to read from a literary standpoint as none of the characters seem to have logical motivations and the plot abounds with inconsistencies. I was not favorably impressed.Pullman's creation of the world of witches, daemons, and armored bears could have been an appealing backdrop for a fanciful epic, but the series that he actually wrote is ridiculous, frustrating to read, and will be offensive to many. I am embarrassed to have bought into the marketing hype and I caution other fans of fantasy writing not to have too high of expectations."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought these books to read nightly with my 10 year old son, but ended up reading straight through them by myself over a few days, impatient to get to the end. Pullman has brought together all the important elements that parents think of discussing with their children, but sometimes never get around to...or can't find the words for. And he encases all these concepts in such a rich and engrossing tapestry that it's a joy to re-read it now with my son. In this age when our society lacks rituals for children to transition into adulthood, these books provide a tool parents can use to ease the process."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved the first two books, and I thought the 3rd would be the best. I was far mistaken. The third book had a huge rise to a tiny climax. It just isn't anywhere close to the caliber of the first two. I will rate book 1-5 starsBook 2-4 starsBook 3-2 stars"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Great set of books that are the basis for the recent movie The Golden Compass."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Enclosed in a colorful box - the cover of the book, The Golden Compass - this is an excellent way to purchase the complete His Dark Materials Trilogy.The slightly-oversized paperbacks provide ample room for a highly-readable font. With the focus on the release of the movie - The Golden Compass - it is a bit surprising that the book only has one movie photo, but that does not detract from an attractive box-set of three classic fantasy novels from Philip Pullman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought 2 copies of this, one for me and one for my 14 year old son. he loves that we are reading the book together and it is keeping both our interests."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just finished the trilogy and was moved enough by it to bother writing a review.In short, the Golden Compass is an imaginative, unique and captivating story. The Subtle Knife is not quite as good, but still engaging. They both build to what you think will be a satisfying and well constructed conclusion in the third volume. Unfortunately the Amber Spyglass doesn't deliver.The series could have been great, but ends up being just mediocre. Pullman brings up so many interesting concepts and vividly describes his world(s), you can't help being drawn in. You become emotionally invested in Lyra and Will and can't wait to see how they are going to solve the ails of the universe(s). I pulled a couple of all nighters on the first two books .. completely engrossed.I can't say the same for the last book. First, there were to many disjointed subplots .. some leading nowhere. I found myself skipping chapters to have plot continuity and then going back and picking up subplots. Character development seemed to have ceased and there were too many outstanding questions that were unanswered. Like ...Warning: SpoilersWhat happened in the end? Did they really save the universe through love and sacrifice (and if so, aren't these Christian ideals leaking through a supposed Atheist outlook)? It seemed like nothing changed. The few characters that were still alive just packed up and went home. Granted, the imposter god was disposed of (in a very anti-climatic way), but did it really change anything?What was dust? It's never explained. I was hoping the whole Mulefa adventure would shed some light on dust since they seemed to honor and understand it, but that never amounts to anything. And the Amber Spyglass itself was a trivial part of the story ... unlike the compass or the knife.How did Mary play the serpent and how was Lyra the new Eve? This could have been a facinating tale. Instead, it was next to non-existent. The closest I can gather, after re-reading and re-reading, is the Marzipan chapter where Mary told the kids of her own first love and how it influenced her decision to leave the church, setting the stage for Lyra and Will to make a similiar choice. Is that it? Rather lame. Did I miss something?What did Will and Lyra's deamons do when the kids went into the land of the dead? Enquiring minds want to know.What happened to Will's mom? Who were those people after him?If angels could deal with specters, why didn't they do it right from the beginning?And the list goes on.I was disappointed with Lyra and Will in the end. You get to really like these kids because of their determination, resourcefullness, and spunk. In the end they (and a lot of the characters) seem to fizzle out and become paper thin - no more than puppets to exact a contrived tragic end. The Lyra and Will I know from the first two books would not have just dutifully accepted their plight. They would have told that angel and witch to get bent .. then run off to figure out their own solution. :-) Also, aren't they still pre-teen? Their character changes would have been more acceptable if they had aged a few years over the trilogy.After a while, I wasn't sure if I was reading a fantasy book, a treatise on Religion, or a Harlequin romance novel. I think it tried to do and be too many things and didn't succeed at any.Overall, I give the Trilogy 3 stars for the first two books. If the characters had been developed more, and the plots storyboarded better, the third book could have been great. As it is, I felt the first two books were a big build up to a contrived ending in the third book that was hollow and completely devoid of any humor or hope. It left me gloomy and empty ... not to mention annoyed I had spent a good part of my vacation reading it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of the most gripping stories I have ever read. It was next to impossible to put down.Pullman a powerfull and emotional ride with his characters. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who appritiates great fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass is a book that you would really like, if you love adventure. The main character is Lyra who tries to save her friend Roger from the gobblers. The book is a little sad at the end, but very good overall. At the end,Lyra's father opens up a gateway between worlds which leads you to the next book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I received The Golden Compass as Christmas present probably 4 years ago (ironic, these books as a Christmas present) and never touched it. Finally I picked it up and read. I was hooked and went out and bought The Subtle Knife only days later, proceeded to devour it, and luckily, The Amber Spyglass has just been released. Wow, these are probably my favorite 3 books ever. And that's saying something, because I've read a LOT of books. The are very obviously Anti-Christian, but never the less, I found the matters discussed very fascinating. Actually, it reminded me a lot of the movie Dogma, believe it or not, thought Dogma was decidely pro-Christian. Anyways, go read these books, they are the best."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are definitely the most wonderful that I've ever read. Some reviewers have compared them to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, but I say that the two series are incomparable. If Rowling goes an inch deep into making us think, pullman goes 20 feet. His Dark Materials are wonderful for their fantasy (for those who like other-worldly and thrilling reads) but do not read these books if fantasy is all you're looking for. These books delve deep into religion and philosophy, and sometimes force us to question beliefs that we've had all our lives. In other words, don't read these books if you're looking for a light read.For those who say that the trilogy is \\"evil\\" for the way it probes our thoughts about religion and introduces some new ones in our mind, I would say, bluntly, \\"too bad\\". The books are not denouncing religion, but rather showing us some of the horrible deeds people can do in the name of it. No religion accepts murder or evil deeds, but power-hungry people can use religion as a shield or weapon to excuse or promote what they do.I would reccomend these books to anybody mature enough to read them sensibly, and with an open mind about religion.With strange, imaginative creatures,strong, very human characters, and deep philosophy, these books are quite unlike any others. The only feature the books lack is humour - but, then again, these are not exactly your light \\"Harry Potter\\" type books.These books are WONDERFUL - for their fantasy as well as philosophy.Brief summary: Lyra Beviaqua, a precocious 12-year-old girl living in the Oxford of another world, discovers Dust, the existence of billions of universes, and the alethiometer, an instrument that can tell you anything - if you know how to use it. When her best friend, Roger, is kidnapped, she embarks on a journey to save him. In the process, she discovers the subtle knife (which can cut through to other worlds), Will, a boy from another world who becomes her best friend, and many other strange creatures, instruments, and friends. Soon, she discovers that she is the major part of the largest rebellion in history, and must do unimaginable things to save Dust and all the good in the world, and keep her promises, no matter how hard it is.ABSOLUTELY MUST READ - an experience not to be missed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read these books a few years ago and they were AWESOME. Everybody that I recommended them to winds up reading them and loving them. I just bought myself a new boxed set and I lent it to my father. He read the Golden Compass and loved it and he is now on the second book in the series. I have told so many people about these books. I read a LOT. I work for a book publisher so I get tons of free books and this series remains one of my all-time favorites. I told my sister-in-law about these books, she read them and now she rants and raves to everyone about them too.What makes them so good? A combination of things: the characters are really strong - you either love them or love to hate them; the story is tight, well-paced and imaginative and it makes you want to keep reading; the setting is a world like ours but different and special - like a dream, but not too weird that you can't picture it. I can't say enough about how great these books are. And although these books can be found in the young readers section of the bookstore, I personally think they are pretty complex and adult in nature. There are some rather mature undertones throughout the series. So don't let the fact that they are placed in various sections in a bookstore throw you off. It's just that they are very enjoyable for a wide range of ages.Buy these books!! You will love them!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I would have loved these books as a child. I think I would have appreciated them by 8 or 9, but all I ever did was read. A lot has been made of the fact that the author is an athiest. In my opinion, the series isn't any more \\"anti-god\\" than the Harry Potter series - it's just far less subtle about it. It's refreshing that the central character is a girl because so much fiction for young people centers around male characters (historically). I would recommend these books to any parents who aren't afraid to let their children think for themselves. Let them read the bible, some C.S. Lewis and some Focus on the Family crap and then let them read this series and decide for themselves what they believe."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Christianity, Phillip Pullman tells us, is mindless, self-righteous and mean-spirited. Those who read to the end of Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy will learn that new-agey liberal moralizing is just as bad. The first book gets the reader's hopes up with a plucky heroine and a quirky alternative universe. Pullman teases us with literary references and the promise of some big philosophical ideas.By the second book, however, the ideas have become predictable. Meanwhile, Pullman abandons his initial setting in favor of half a dozen relatively bland alternate realities. As the book goes on, one must suspend more and more of one's disbelief. Pullman establishes his credentials as a hip free-thinker by sniping at religion and coming out in favor of sex. The third book ends, however, with whole chapters in which protagonists Learn Lessons. A chorus of angels, scientists and other authority figures assist them by giving Good Advice.To make a long story short, this reviewer maintains that most of this advice is not only tiresome, but repressive and poorly-thought out. Readers, of course, may judge for themselves. In this reviewer's opinion, those who want a compelling, intelligent children's fantasy are better off with Lloyd Alexander, Susan Cooper, or, for that matter, J.K. Rowling. Those who like hard core theological weirdness should leave children's books behind and read Neil Gaiman, an author with fewer moral lessons and a stronger moral compass."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Perfect. I could have easily read these books back to back but then it would have all ended too quickly so I had to read one, wait a few months and read another. I have the last chapter left in The Amber Spyglass because I cannot bring myself to finish it. I have not been this enthralled since first reading The Chronicles of Narnia about 20 years ago. I especially love the fact that Mr. Pullman doesn't portray his female characters in a chauvinistic way as did Mr. C.S. Lewis. Both authors have painted lovely, vivid pictures though. I can't say enough good things about this trilogy. I find Lyra, Will, Mary, Iorek and other characters and storylines come to mind frequently...it's been years since I so desperately wanted to believe such wonderous people and places could exist. I have encouraged everyone I know to read these books as discussions can be as entertaining as the books themselves. I could easily become fanatical about this set...I disagree with some reviews that a particular book in this trilogy is better than another. They are equally astounding. Thanks--"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Finally a fantasy book written in an intelligent manner that has elements of fantasy and incorporates a strong belief in science and logic. Christians are the most narrow minded, cruel and ignorant people on the planet and it is fantastic to see them portrayed as such. Amazing plot, characters and story. I was absorbed totally throughout the entire series and hardly noticed the fact that this is a YA book. Unlike Harry Potter and the Twilight series, these books can be read and enjoyed by adults with reasonable intelligence. An excellent book that I am reading to my nephew as soon as he can grasp the concepts!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm a devout Catholic, and found these books to be absolutely a joy to read...People really need to be secure enough in their faith to not allow such abhorrent and fascist proposals as the banning of books, to even enter their minds let alone our society. Shame on those who even entertain those ideas!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Upon finishing the first of the Pullman trilogy, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" I'll admit, I was captivated by the initial story line. It was unique, entertaining, mysterious, and slightly bizarre. I was very excited to read the other two books. Unfortunately, I did.Basically, this is a series that explains to our children that the struggle between God and the \\"fallen\\" is all misunderstood--It is God, His angels, and followers who are evil, degenerate, and wish to destroy all things beautiful in life. The fallen are portrayed as true angelic beings who wish to preserve life in all it's goodness. In the end, God is actually represented as a decrepit, senile, old man and is killed. Because God and His henchmen are now removed from the world, all creation is liberated and equality, true love, and justice established for all time. Pullman even allows his two pre-adolescent hero's to fall in \\"love\\" and share a romantic Adam and Eve experience.Pullman claims to be a staunch athiest. However, his writing's contain belief's commonly held by individuals considering themselves satanists. I strongly encourage all people of faith to: first, read these books for themselves so that you can speak about this series with knowledge; second, do not allow young, impressionable children to have access to this series or the upcoming movie based on \\"The Golden Compass,\\" (apparently a watered down version of ideology); third, tell everyone who will listen what this series is really about; and finally, pray for the author, Philip Pullman, that God may show him true love through Grace."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Parents beware! The evil in this story is God! I read the first book of this trilogy and enjoyed the fantasy aspects of it, although it seemed rather dark to be a children's book. I became attached to Lyra, the protagonist in the story, and was anxious for her to continue her struggle with evil in the second book. I was horrified, however, when I realized part way through the second book, that the characters Lyra had been fighting against, and I had been rooting against were God, His Angels, and His followers. Also, I am extremely concerned about children reading a series of books in which the main messages are....If it feels good, do it, and rules are wrong! Cleverly, Pullman does not make the reader aware of these things until the reader is emotionally invested in the series. With the movie, The Golden Compass, soon to be released, I fear that both children and adults will flock to read this series. I enjoy all genres of literature and was a big proponent of series such as Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia. These books are not in the same league. They are filled with blasphemy, and I have to wonder and Pullman's point in writing them. I wish I could rate this series a zero!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Mr. Pullman's trilogy is well-crafted, although his inventions fade rapidly after reading (unlike Lewis's Narnia, which remains mint-bright in the mind). The trilogy is also teeming with religious hatred, specifically of Christianity and Christians. As a parent, a college professor, and someone who respects all religions, I find this incomprehensible and unacceptable. I would strongly recommend that parents avoid buying these books for their children; if a child does read this trilogy, parents and educators should make every effort to point out to the child Mr. Pullman's bigotry, and perhaps discuss the dangers of all prejudice: religious, racial, ethnic, national, and so on."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I agree that Pullman pulled this series off with intricate plot and interesting creatures / characters. However, I cannot continue to finish book three when the story enfolds the so called dark side of God and the explicit condemnation of the name of God. The fabrication of events in heaven and the creation of man are misleading to young readers. I strongly recommend parents not to buy these books for their kids."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book does appear to offer an enchanting world to read about, but be warned. The world is a lot darker than what readers of Harry Potter are accustomed to. In fact, the feeling I get from the writing is that the author is a disturbed and creepy man. I can't bear the thought of this writer \\"speaking\\" to children through his writing.I loved Harry Potter, but this book is not in the same area. Readers beware."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Enjoy! If you liked LOTR, Harry Potter and the like, you'll love His Dark Materials. A subtle masterpiece."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved Harry Potter, The Hobbit, and Lord of the Rings. I hated The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe and the other Narnia stories. I hated the Golden Compass, and I would have thought that I would have liked it. Personally, I don't think His Dark Materials are children's books. The story lines are too adult. I didn't mind the dig at religion. I just thought the story was stupid, and didn't make sense. There isn't an ending. I won't be reading the other two books in the series. I jumped ahead and read a few bits out of the next two books, but the story just didn't grab me. Like the first, each of the other two books doesn't have an ending. Very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Is it possible to just read the book for the sake of the book or is for sure going to color your point of view? if you have no view before, will you have one after (as children may or may not)? is it (criminal, unjust, wrong, etc...) to put money in the pocket of a man who may not believe as we would like him to?from pullman's own website, may or may not help. the rest of the info on his site is mostly concerned with his writing style, inspiration, etc, and speaks neither to good or evil.His Dark Materials seems to be against organised religion. Do you believe in God?I don't know whether there's a God or not. Nobody does, no matter what they say. I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away.Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them.Your books deal with many of life's big questions? God, the church, good and evil, love? and you are not afraid to challenge your young readers. Is that a conscious aim when you sit down in front of a blank sheet of paper? Do you think children's writing has a duty to pose difficult questions?No. The only duty it has is best expressed in the words of Dr Johnson: \\"The only aim of writing is to help the reader better to enjoy life, or better to endure it.\\"You have run into criticism from certain religious groups who regard you as subversive, with the Catholic Herald describing your work as 'worthy of the bonfire.' Do such emotional responses concern or upset you or does it please you to generate strong reactions?I'm delighted to have brought such excitement into what must be very dull lives."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Greating trilogy fans.

The Last Gentile, Deacon's Horn and The Final Witness."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is what the heros believe in The Amber Spyglass. This and much, much more. This is a book for adolescents? I haven't ever read adult literature so pro-atheistic."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Lord Asriel has passed through to another world, with the intention of finishing a conflict that had been unsuccessfully fought before. This time, the good guys might win because of his passion and determination. But he is without a decisive weapon, which mustn't fall into the hands of the enemy.Lyra has followed Lord Asriel and encounters a boy called Will, who has found a way, by chance, into this new world from a world almost the same as her home-world. She has the Alethiometer, and Will - by virtue of further happenstance - becomes the bearer of the Subtle Knife. The Subtle Knife is the decisive weapon that Lord Asriel requires to determine a victory, and it is up to Lyra and Will to deliver it to him.And Lyra is important, too.The Subtle Knife was a more agreeable read than The Golden Compass / Northern lights. This was mostly due to the longer sections that gave the various characters and associated events pages, instead of a couple of lines or a short paragraph to play out, in relation to the unfolding plot. Even so, Philip Pullman's use of mixed viewpoint in multi-character scenes is a distraction that robs the story of useful energy and quality of character association.The endorsements compare Philip Pullman to J R R Tolkien, proclaiming him to be his successor in the pantheon of greatness. In terms of the story this isn't really an issue for debate, but Tolkien's more skilful writing, with respect to maintenance of viewpoint, means that Philip Pullman has a little way to go. This subtle and decisive weapon should be less difficult to obtain.Next up... The Amber Spyglass."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First, no, it is not anything like Harry Potter. It's much darker and more complex. If you're looking for more Potter, which are truly children's books, push on. Nor is it anything like the crudely sanctimonious, morally corrupt Narnia books. Secondly, artistic vision is so rare and precious that it is unreasonable and a great loss to insist that it must also toe the line of Christian indoctrination."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many others have reviewed at length the beautifully-woven story and captivating style of His Dark Materials. Your empathy with these characters and your immersion into their world grow with the sheer scale - it is the only story to ever move me to tears at the end.On its own, the depth and uniqueness of the world and the characters would more than hold their own against such undeniable classics as The Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series, unburdened by the former's flood of detail or the latter's prosaicism; the story is a nearly-perfect fusion of creativity, epic and allusion.But what really puts this trilogy a step above its rivals is that the faerie-tale is only the avatar of a deep and very *real* ideology. The allegory is the binding element that takes it beyond a mere story in a way that others seemed to stumble over, transforming His Dark Materials into a single, complete entity that is, in a word, sublime.The trilogy should probably not be read by children younger than thirteen or fourteen - its dark and graphical nature aside, I don't think many children are able to fully appreciate its total scope (largely for reasons that the books themselves explain).Otherwise, though, I recommend it to anyone and everyone, including Christians. I want to put to death the notion that these books are some kind of an attack on Christians, which I find to be incredibly selfish. Christianity is a philosophy and ideology, and His Dark Materials challenges it - Pullman is simply standing up and saying \\"I have a different idea!\\" It's an opportunity for Christians to step back for a moment and *think* about their beliefs, and look at them a little differently. Religion, like any idea, deserves to be tested and questioned - and if it is truly the right one, then it will come out on the other side with twice the strength and stability. I think that reading books like His Dark Materials is just as important as reading the Bible. Faith is much more powerful when doubt has been conquered than when there was no doubt to begin with.And as for the story? It's all fiction, of course! It's understandable if its being based on the Christian Church and God is a bit disturbing - ironic, considering that the elements of Middle-Earth and Narnia are even more heretical, yet were written by devout Christians. But in the end it's simply a beautiful story that stirs the emotions and the imagination - the kind of experience that everyone deserves to have at least once in their lifetime."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read a number of one-star reviews that compel me to write a review myself. What I think is disturbing is the lack of recognition of the spirituality in Phillip Pullman's writing that reviewers seem to have. This book is not a testament of atheism. On the contrary. There is a VAST difference between spirituality and religiosity. I think Pullman attempts to make these differences more stark in his story-telling.That does not make one an atheist.Like the characters in the book we are invited to look beyond our own limited vision of our world and our concepts of what we believe God to embody. Pullman is not out to destroy God, rather he is out to destroy the reification of spirituality. Those that criticize this series on this basis are missing the point entirely. I suggest you go back and re-read with an OPEN mind.For those who have not read it, it's an enjoyable series that at times can drag a little bit in plot and have seemingly point-less diversions. The arc of the story is not limited to one book but rather all three. See it through and you will understand. Read with an open-mind...because when it comes down to it there is no other way to be."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman is one of the best fantasy writes for both adults and children. This set was originally loaned to me by a newphew. I have since purchased my own copies and have been routing them throughout the family. Great character definition, complex but imaginative plot, and excellent writing style keep you glued to each book. The alternate worlds theme is very skillfully handled. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is truly a must read. It has everything an epic should have, and more. You will laugh, cry, and by moved by the characters in this story. Adults can easily appreciate this tale, but it must be read objectively. There are many \\"big\\" issues in this book that some people could be easily offended by and maybe that's why I like it so much. This series is thought provoking, as is any good literature. Read it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In trying to figure out why these three volumes were such a letdown for me, I noted the following: the books are well-plotted, with continuous action and excitement, and a large cast of colorful characters, and yet... to continue with the theatrical language... some major roles are completely mis-cast.I can't buy the characterizations of Lyra and her mother at all. They alone, of all the individuals we see throughout the three books, never come to any kind of convincing life. Tolkien knew he couldn't do a convincing female character, so in his LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, there are no important female characters. The hollowness of Lyra and Mrs. Coulter results in a corresponding nearly-fatal hollowness in much of the book's action, particulary in the final half of AMBER SPYGLASS.The other problem is, of course, the main villain Metatron. Here's an all-powerful character who ruthlessly rules many universes, and effortlessly outthinks humans, yet he is unable to do anything effective to thwart the plans of Lord Asriel, and he is decoyed to his death by a preposterously transparent ploy that wouldn't fool a tiny child. With Metatron so easily disposed of, the completely emotionally unconvincing love story that infests the last half of AMBER SPYGLASS is something the reader must simply endure to get to the last page.Among the trilogy's many positive points are a delightful use of the mythologies of Milton and William Blake, a terrifying depiction of the afterlife, some sexy and charismatic witches, a Clint Eastwood/Man With No Name clone who pilots balloons for a living, and the Panzer Bears.Those looking for Tolkien-style giant battles will be disappointed. If you are a lover of epic fantasy, this is well worth your time, but it is far from being consistently well-done."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Not only has Phillip Pullman created a world of dark fantasy filled with things that pull at the depths of your imagination, his writing uses enough reality to make the events seem almost possible, but elusive, like a flash of movement that just catches in the corner of your eye.They could be a little bit hard to follow at times, so I wouldn't recommend them to anyone with a short attention span. The violence wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been; most twelve-year-olds could probably stomach it.These are definitely books to buy and read over and over. I'm loathe to compare them to \\"Harry Potter,\\" but both series share an aspect of adventure and mystery that keeps you enthralled right until the very end. A must-read if I've ever found one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"\\"Unputdownable\\" is how I would describe Philip Pullman's superb \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy comprising \\"The Golden Compass\\" (released as \\"The Northern Lights\\" in the UK), \\"The Subtle Knife\\" and \\"The Amber Spyglass\\". I am so glad that I picked them up after all the three books had been released as I cannot imagine how I would have borne the agony of having to wait for a couple of years to find out how this delicious saga unfolds.Pullman combines the multiverse and dark matter theories from modern physics with theology and pure fantasy to create a gripping saga with only a few logical loose ends. The tale begins in a parallel universe quite like ours (even in the names of places and their relative geography) populated by humans who have externalised polymorphic souls called daemons. The corrupt Church has established a stifling theocracy and seeks to suppress anything that goes against what it has propagated. In particular, it wants to reign in and control the research into a recently discovered curious form of matter called Dust.The ebullient and charming heroine Lyra Belacqua and her daemon Pantalaimon find themselves dragged from their blissful abode in Oxford into what becomes the ultimate battle led by Lord Asriel against The Authority (God) itself. They are ably supported by the brave Will Parry from our own world and a whole lot of other characters including gypsies, witches, armoured bears, mulefas, Gallivespians, etc.While the story in the first book happens entirely in Lyra's world and is quite linearly narrated with Lyra always at its centre, the next two books have several threads of narration, many more prominent characters and keep switching between worlds. The story is quite gripping and the pace quite good. I did find the end a bit disappointing and strange considering the ambitious swipe of the story's plot, but I still found the book on the whole an extremely satisfying read. I was a bit sad that it had to end and I keep wishing I had an external daemon of my own too.Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"All I can say is I am without words. This is the most beautiful story ever written. Book snobs, should lay off. I adore Harry Potter and worship LOTR. This book is in it's own place.My question is...Why are all these religious fanatics reading Fantasy in the first place? Just to have something to argue about? Burning Harry Potter is atrocious...My GOD, get a life! There are far more meaningful things to rant and rave about."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These stories are a true delight. Anyone who whines about them, has not read them. Yes, they do speak of killing a fake god who stands in God's stead. Why are the Christian right ruffled by this? Perhaps they, too, are fake gods, standing in the place of the real God."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman is a pretty engaging writer, and I like this enough to reread it, but I think I've figured out why His Dark Materials doesn't grab me the way some other books in the broad fantasy genre do. To make an imaginary world--especially one so far from everyday experience as that of HDM--real to the reader, the author must describe, describe, describe. The old dictum \\"show, don't tell\\" applies here. You'll notice that in the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings, Lewis' Narnia series, etc., the authors describe everything. This is what draws the reader in, and pretty much distinguishes a classic from a merely competent, mediocre, or downright bad work.Pullman belongs in the competent, even good, category, but not classic. One example of why: the daemons. If this were J.K. Rowling or the others I've mentioned, you would actually see them. For example, how do they move? Do they follow their \\"owner\\" on the ground, float in the air, or sit on his/her shoulder? Do they look like real animals, or are they some kind of ethereal being? It's never clear. As a result, it's hard for the reader to imagine them except in a cartoonish way. There are other examples... I'll be interested to see what the upcoming feature film does with all this. It may turn out to be one of the rare instances where the movie is better than the book. Pullman is certainly an imaginative author, and the concepts are--as we used to say--mind-blowing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's not very easy to put this book in a category, or to describe the effect it had on me. However I have decided it can best be described as a represenation of the story of original sin (Adam, Eve, the serpent, the garden, you know) in our modern theories of physics. In other words: it is the story of Lyra, in another world, and Will, in our world, and how they change not only their worlds...but all worlds. It functions as both a book for children on the surface with Lyra, Will, and the absorbing story of the different worlds, as well as a deeper allegory appropriate for adults and even some advanced children. I don't think I would have fully understood it as a child, but it is a book appropriate for all ages. It explores morals and philosophy of all religions as well as telling a finely crafted story with a good/evil dynamic that brings Tolkien, Susan Cooper, and others to mind.I admit it: I cried at the end of this book. It was too good. You literally do not want it to end, but it does, with possibly the most satisfying conclusion I've ever read. Can't think of a better book. Don't let the possible meanings of the book scare you, if you decide to read it--it is first and foremost a story about two children, and if you can handle them, you can manage the rest of the book. I hope you all enjoy it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman is one of the most gifted fantasy writers of the 20th century. Unlike Tolkein whose focus on creating a world causes him to neglect plot and characterization, Pullman creates an elaborate world (universe), tells an amazingly original story and develops wonderful characters (esp. Will who first appears in book 2).As an historian whose work focuses on Calvinism, I was especially impressed by Pullman's creation---a world in which the Calvinist Reformation succeeded (what a scary place that would have been!). Many critics claim Pullman's work is anti-Christian but it is more of an attack against clerical institutions than an attack against religious belief per se (and ironically, the rebellion which Lyra, her father and Will stage and participate in establishes an alternative religion---that is a world without a God but which has an afterlife---if only b/c it claims that there is no afterlife).The details in this story are fantastic. I loved the idea of a world where one's soul is visible and takes on the attributes of the character (I esp. liked the fact that one's daemon assumes a permanent form in puberty).Lyra is a wonderful character---no, she is not likeable but frankly, her likeability is irrelevant. What is key is her mission (here Pullman seems to cheat a little---he denies the idea of Calvinist predestination but Lyra's fate is, to some degree, pre-determined).This book is not intended for young children. I would recommend it to 14 and 15 year olds---and even then you should be fairly well-read if you want to grasp all of the subtle nuances of the book. That said, I strongly recommend the book to adolescent girls. Lyra is a great role model for young girls (her bravery, her intelligence and even her conviction that she is right are characteristics which young girls need to recognize are acceptable and even valuable)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" series consumed almost all of my time- because I loved them so much. The book had everything I could ask for, love, adventure, complexity, and more! Every word was carefully thought out, that came together in a brilliant ending. Cheers to Philip Pullman, the author of such exquisite litterary masterpieces!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials (as the series is called in the UK) is ostensibly for children, but it incorporates such topics as quantum states, parallel universes, the political nature of religious intitutions, and the nature of the soul. All three of the titles in the series are fascinating and a great read. I highly recommend the series to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I purchased the trilogy because I saw a movie was coming out and I generally enjoy the books more and wanted to know the full background to the movie. In this case, without knowing all the drama about the author and his view on Christianity, I did not catch all the anti-christian thoughts that are supposed to be espoused. Instead, I enjoyed the young hero that did the right thing even when society and those around her wanted to do something else. I wasn't shocked by her first kiss as a blooming young woman. I made note of the angel's relationship, but personally I don't think angels need to be thought of as male/female and put in the same light of our own human sexuality. We expect angels to love deeper, and while the intimacy that was implied was eye-brow raising, I wasn't offended by their open and loving concern for one another. So I'm glad I read the books, because, as usual, the media in reviewing the Hollywood version, which I haven't seen yet, is making the wrong points about the book. I didn't offer it to my 13-year old daughter to read because I didn't think it was aimed for her level of reading, but I enjoyed the series. As with all books and movies, I recommend the parents know what their kids are reading and watching. This isn't a masterpiece of writing, but short entertaining stories."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Very complex, well-drawn characters, intricate and very innovative. Helps if you have read science fiction plus were raised on Grimm's Fairy Tales in the original (people die a lot in the originals)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am eleven and a pretty good reader. But, I feel so confused. I am reading this with my mom and she seems to be at a loss for words for me. She reads all the time (all the Harry Potter's twice in one or two days) and is pretty smart, but we have to reread alot because we don't understand it. It's like the author expects us to know what he is talking about in the beginning. We are getting to the good parts and understanding more and more, I was just wondering if other kids had such a hard time getting in to it. We have not read any sci-fi before so maybe that is the problem. We also have no problem with religion. I hate to abandon a book, but with school starting I don't know if I should stick with it or start it again when I am older. Should I buy the Dark Materials Guide that is in book stores now?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS!Plusses were the cool ideas and overall subversive tone. A diverse array of creatures large and small populate various worlds, which all seem to be in some sort of crisis centered around the ever-mysterious \\"dust.\\"Minuses: the overall length (I thought it could have been about 100 pages shorter), absence of humor, and cold-bloodedness.The gadgets and magical devices have a sort of retro-future stylish coolness which makes me automatically like them, since I simply adore retro-future anything. Oddly, the use of zeppelins as a form of transport in various worlds is widespread, in spite of their obvious, well-known hazards, and this results in a number of spectacular explosions. Fortunately, it's mostly the bad guys whose zeppelins explode, but still you gotta wonder why they couldn't find a better way to get around.Many vague pokes at the \\"church\\" and \\"authority,\\" though exactly where they're pointed is not entirely clear. A healthy skepticism seems to pervade, and we're given some hints at Eastern philosophy (e.g. the I Ching), but there is little indication where the line of questioning might lead.Down sides include a general absence of humor, which I find odd coming from a British writer. There is nothing to compensate for the generally aloof atmosphere.Big downside: the reader is led to develop affinity and affection for many characters who wind up dying in order to serve the greater cause of, well, it's not exactly clear. The dust, I guess. Fortunately the deaths aren't generally gory, but they often seem rather pointless.The resolutions often left me with somewhat of a hollow and perfunctory feeling. For example, a cataclysmic ozone-hole-sized leakage of the valuable 'dust' into the infinite abyss suddenly ceases when the two main characters engage in a bit of sparking and smooching. Its explained by vague references to the garden of eden, Eve, and original sin, but I found the logic unsatisfying and anticlimactic. And worse -- the 'romance' was unconvincing.Perhaps the author was trying to explain things a bit too well. For instance, the dead are all teleported into this grim, dismal underground cave, where they traverse a large body of water to land of ghosts. Fortunately, one of the main characters creates a doorway back to the land of the living, so the ghosts can -- well, vanish into oblivion.An improvement over being a ghost in a dreary cavern, I suppose, but somehow lacking in a quality of mystery which I somehow associate with one of the greatest unknowns in the sphere of human experience (i.e. death).In the last few pages, the author begins dispensing morals, which seem oddly disconnected with the rest of the story.Despite imperfections, I would still recommend it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Absolutely the best story I have ever read. Thought provoking, entertaining, endearing, and enthralling. I'm sad that I've finished these books, but I couldn't put them down. I laughed, I cried, and I bit my nails (unfortunately) every page of the way. I fell in love with the characters, the story, and the settings. I just can't say enough about this wonderful series. Great trilogy for adults even though these books were written for young adults. I would not recommend these books for children under 13 as they may have some difficulty following the themes. If you haven't read these books, I envy you. You have a whole new world to delve in to."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am a big fan of Harry Potter, so I decided to read these books. One is actually going to be for a book club at my school on October 3. Very quickly I was sucked into the Golden Compass, and the excitement just never stoped. They were heart pounding, interesting, and very deep books. They present a picture in your mind so great, and there charm just never wears off. A must read for science-fiction fans. The pace, the charecters, the excitement is right on. The world is so descriptive, and the plot complex, yet it is easy enough to understand.Please note though: These books are quite more evil, and deep then the harry potter books, and some of the things I would say should not be read by people under 11-12. It is a great read for 13+ year olds. There is also a level of violence that is much higher then that of Harry Potter also."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Just getting back from a study of children's literature in England, I dove into Pullman's trilogy, (first titled NORTHERN LIGHTS on my UK purchase). I was impressed to see that on the children's best seller list, Pullman was first, second and third! Our instructor warned us that Pullman is quite controversial due to his stand against organized religion. I do hope that adults don't spoil a perfectly wonderful read with overtones that young readers may never pick up anyway. Leave the deep meanings to adults, but let the children immerse themselves in the delightful description of two worlds--like ours but different. If you buy the book for a young reader, do not start reading it (or just go ahead and buy two copies right away!)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy has occupied more than enough of my time over the past few years. I read the Golden Compass, and then the Subtle Knife.. and at that time, the Amber Spyglass wasn't even out, so I read both of them over again, and then when I read the last one, it all came together. It's a wonderful read, great fun, exciting, full of adventure, and it's all set in a wonderful world unlike anything you could ever dream up. Fortunately for us, Pullman has, and what a world it is... after I was finished reading, I just wanted to go there, to be there, more than anything; and I wished there was more to read.The story is that of young Lyra Belaqua, who you meet in the first pages. You learn that people in this world have \\"Daemons\\" -- magical parts of themselves that take the form of animals (one of Pullman's greatest ideas). The adventure soon starts as Lyra finds out about Dust, and of the North where secret and cruel experiments are going on. It just gets better and better and better in the two books following \\"The Golden Compass,\\" And you'll read for hours on end, mystified. Or, at least I did.The only downfall of these novels is Pullman's obvious opinions of religion, which he makes clear mostly in The Amber Spyglass by killing God and through a smattering of mocking religious allusions (my favorite: preemptive absolution). I have no problem with that; however, I know that many people will. So, I warn you with this: these novels are not for those who are deeply religious. But man, if you can just get past that, or even learn to accept that, then this becomes almost a perfect trilogy.Okay, the other thing about this is that it isn't a children's series. I wouldn't even call it a pre-teen series. Definately 13 and up here. You may see reviews that say that the last book is just sick, but I can tell you honestly that it isn't. Pullman writes that \\"scene\\" so well that it isn't even obvious what has happened, and it all is very fitting, purposeful, and required to the story. Speaking of the end, it will surprise you. No doubt. If you're sensitive, you will cry. If you aren't, you'll probably still cry. It's that powerful. You know the characters so well by the end that it's impossible not to feel their feelings and thoughts yourself. I know I'm being ambiguous. It's like they say -- You'd have to read it to know. So buy this now (no, they're not paying me ;-), and read it, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have a collection of nieces that read these books before me. Like the Harry Potter series, they read and loved His Dark Materials. And, like Harry Potter, I set out to read these books to have some common ground with the kids. To my delight and surprise, I was entranced.Plot and theme you can get from other reviews. I must say simply this: read these books. They are a wonderful trip down that grey early morning period of the soul between youth and adulthood. More than that, though, they navigate these tough times with skill, intelligence and heart.Read these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is THE most amazing series I have ever read. I have read many books including the Xanth series, the Book of Three, Harry Potter, Virtual Mode, and many other fantastic books. But, I HAVE to say that this is the best book, best trilogy out there. A girl named Lyra and her daemon innocently get involved, through an eavesdropped conversation, in what will eventually become THE ultimate battle. Who can she trust? Where will she go? But most importantly WHY? WHAT is a 12-year-old girl doing in a horrifying battle between good and evil? Which side is good, and which side is evil? Fascinated? You should be. The plot is remarkable, the story thrilling, and you are helpless. Once you start, all you can do is turn the page. You cannot put the book down, eat a snack, or even glance up. The plot is enthralling, unpredictable, you can never tell what is going to happen next. You also grow to know and love the characters. I feel as though I am living this book. The quality of writing is high, the characters realistic, the plot almost believable, and the story astonishing. These three books not just talk about magic, I could swear that they ARE magic. Reading these three books leaves you not with just the satisfaction of finishing a terrific book, but also with something, a lot to think about. For several days after I finished The Amber Spyglass, I went around like a zombie in a kind of daze. All I thought about was those three books. In class, I paid no attention, I did not participate, and my friends thought that I was insane because I didn't say a word to them for almost a week. I can not, in words discribe this book. It is too good to be described with words. Anyone who has read this book will understand.The effect this story had on me is startling too. I actually had several dreams involving these characters, some interesting, and one terrifying. When I read this book, I was frightened, or happy, or relieved, and at a couple places I cried. You see, this isn't just a book, just a dream, just a fantasy. It is real, in your mind. The characters are there, as are the places. In time, memories from the story, and your personal history mingle, and eventually, they are one. You have not READ this story, you have LIVED it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found this trilogy enthralling with too many good points to name. I have to disagree that youths won't understand the book, as I am myself only 17. I also find books where a few of the main characters more interesting than those where all of the main characters 'live happily ever after'. I personally found the ending very emotional, this is the only book I have ever cried over, and I wish that there were going to be more books after 'The Amber Spyglass'. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone as it is without a doubt infinitely more pleasurable, in my opinion, to reading the 'Harry Potter' series, which although they are good, do not measure up to 'His Dark Materials'. So I would say BUY IT."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books will tear you away from your everyday life as thoroughly as finding out that you're actually Bill Gates' secret love child and that he wants to give you $5 billion as a birthday present.

Here's why: even though it has very obvious fantasy elements such as magic and witches and talking bears, it doesn't fit the traditional mold of a fantasy because it draws upon scientific knowledge and theory, which pushes it into SF. However, like other good fantasy, Pullman's tale is also strongly interwoven in myth. Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" forms the basis of Pullman's overarching theme, woven by a rich fabric of setting and characters, each journeying toward their own sense of purpose and final destiny on this world. This is a book of great scope, unfolding, aptly, through the eyes of a child.Wrongly (I think) categorized by many as just a YA (young adult) fantasy, this SF-fantasy slipstream should appeal to readers of all ages. It is, after all, a multi-layered tale of universal scope. Pullman, himself, de-emphasizes the fantasy elements of his tale, calling it \\"stark realism\\" because these elements (such as daemons) are used to embody phycological truths about human personality. Say's Pullman, \\"I am trying to write a book about what it means to be human.\\" The coming-of-age of an intrepid girl and boy serves as an elegant metaphor to explore the story of everyman's journey toward enlightenment and whose every step comes with it a price. It brings to mind a quote by Victor Frankl: \\"What is to give light must endure burning.\\"Jordon College in Oxford is not an ordinary place for a girl; but then Lyra Belacqua is no ordinary girl, she can hear the hushed messages of truth uttered to her by the strange particles that animate her golden compass. Abandoned to the care of old scholars who know nothing about children, the little scamp runs wild through the streets of the university town, seeking adventure and not quite recognizing her yearning for \\"home\\" and love. She finds it - or it finds her - in the most unlikely place when she blunders into a vortex of danger, love, betrayal and intrigue. And it all begins with dust. Again, not just ordinary dust, but \\"magical\\" dust. Dust that provides a gateway to thousands of other worlds. . . .As our intrepid heroine journeys through a rich tapestry of worlds, she meets and recruits the services of an amazing variety of strange creatures in her quest to uncover more of the mystery of dust and the shattering truth of its role in her own destiny. Lyra journeys first to the far reaches of the north, where strange experiments are being conducted and where she meets the formidable armored bears. As she continues on to a mysterious tropical land, Lyra meets Wil, a young boy looking for his lost father, and together they flee the soul-eating Spectors who stalk the streets. Neither is aware that their destinies lie on a collision course with the otherworldly struggle of good and evil and that their innocence will only be one of the casualties.Pullman spins imaginative and metaphorical worlds both familiar yet unfamiliar - giving us a strange but titillating sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This is surely what phasing into another universe may well feel like. Pullman pulls off (pardon the pun) what few fantasy writers are capable of doing: he marries arcane SF with the lyrical elements of fantasy - the epic adventure of good vs. evil. He does this by using scientific facts and logical premises and weaves his heroic tale around them. For instance, the idea of parallel universes is not only old but very much in vogue with physicists these days. Check out the May 2003 issue of Scientific American for a good summary on this topic. While Pullman borrows His Dark Materials title from Milton, he also takes the concept of dark matter from real science. Dark matter is some form of matter theorized to exist that cannot be observed by radio, infrared, optical, ultraviolet, x-ray or gamma-ray telescopes and is theorized to be MACHOS, WIMPS, or GAS (see http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_astro/dark_matter3.html for more info on this incredible particle).I suppose I was spell-bound by Pullman's imaginative worlds, his sensuous descriptions and his creatively bold use of scientific concepts but it was his complex and passionate characters who captured and still live in my heart. His main character, Lyra, has learned to spin the tallest tales to get by yet she possesses the most sincere and brave heart, and her interactions with her daemen (an alter-ego, part of her soul embodied in an animal bonded with her) are touching and humorous. It is her paradoxical combination of traits that makes her both charming and sweet: she is brave yet vulnerable; enveigling yet genuine; innocent yet crafty; nave yet wise. She personifies the child in all of us, the child who must grow up and lose something to gain something else. So we laugh with her and we cry for her.The ending of the third book, which is bitter-sweet but provides excellent closure, leaves the reader - as all good fiction should - fulfilled yet drained, and wondering about both our own personal destinies and how we fit in with the larger questions of our universe. This is a must read for those seeking compelling adventure that does not compromise intelligence for action, character and setting for pace, heart for thrill, depth for speed; and imagination for story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is not for kids-- or, rather, they are not for those uninterested in being challenged, hugely entertained, and carried along on a metaphysical thrill-ride. However, if you ARE, rejoice! A friend of mine described this series as part fantasy, part science fiction-- but these books delve into the very substance and meaning of consciousness itself. You will be transported to other worlds, inspired to trust in and cultivate your inner-nature, and kept company by a whole slew of vivid characters-- from armored polar bears to benevolent, ancient witches. Our heroine, Lyra, comes from a world that is similar to-- but not quite-- our own. Her Oxford has the \\"dreaming spires\\" of ours, but people there have their spirit/soul living close to them in animal form-- a daemon, who is friend, comfort, confidante. We begin the journey with Lyra, and her daemon, Pan, eavesdropping on a presentation given at Oxford by her uncle, Lord Asriel--- a revelation that the world we know, and others, are in grave danger. What follows is an adventure harking back to Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\", infused with the ecstatic mysticism of William Blake... Sounds too lofty? Trust me, it reads like a house a-fire.

While I agree that this series is fantasy, as is the Harry Potter series, the similarities are overstated. These are different writers with different strengths. Philip Pullman is adept at creating mood, of sucking the reader in, of involving the reader in the story, of creating a real, palpable world of ghasts, daemons, alternate worlds, and so on. I was totally riveted. I recommend this series to anyone who can engage in the imaginary, who can totally let go of their current reality. You will certainly not be disappointed.*NOTE* - These books are listed as appropriate for children or young adults, but they are dark and scary and, in some instances, gory. They are darker and scarier than the Harry Potter series. BEWARE!Also, give the books a chance. When I started the first book, I didn't like it until I was in about 60 pages - I had a hard time figuring out what was real and what was a product of Philip Pullman's imagination, which was frustrating.

I have to agree with the critics, the books are outstanding. Very interesting, exciting, imaginative and creative. They definitely compare to the Lord of the Rings. I think these books would be good for 11 years and up."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you read one book in your life, make it this one! This book is one of the most amazing texts that I have ever read in my life. Phillip Pullman paints the characters so well that I felt like I knew his characters better than I know my closest friends. This book changed the way I look at my world. I read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife when I was in high school, and I was hooked. I have read tons of amazing fantasy and adventure books but this tops all of them. Just a few weeks ago I went back and started reading the series over again, but this time The Amber Spyglass was out so I didn't have to suffer like I did in high school by not knowing the ending. These books are amazing! Lyra is a character that I fell in love with in the first book in a way that I thought I'd never fall in love with another character. Then, in the second book Pullman introduces his readers to Will who is just as loveable a character. I sat on the edge of my seat as I experienced the impossible challenges these two children face, and the amazing creatures they met along the way. I always thought that The Lord of the Rings would be my favorite series of all time, but it pales in comparison to Pullman's series. These characters and the ideas in these books will stay in my heart forever, and I'll always wonder what my own dameon looks life (a being you'll learn about in the book)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many have characterized this book as an 'atheist' tract. That is nonsense. Atheism denies the existence of God, whereas God certainly exists in the book. Of course, he is portraid as an impostor who, by trying to hide his imposture, becomes the root of all that is evil. But that does not make the book atheist; we can call it 'demiurgic'. We can also call it 'luciferic' ('satanic' is a bit too harsh) because we are supposed to cheer for those who rebel against God and end up killing Him.So top marks to Pullman for courage. Writing such a book, especially for a children/teenager audience, is an impossibly dangerous taks, yet he achieved a fantastic commercial and critical success. Good for him!I appreciated many things about the book, most of them previously pointed out by other reviewers -- hence the 5 stars.There are also many things I didn't like about the book. A work of such scope is bound to have many holes and raise many questions, I understand that. But I consider this a major question which should have been dealt with: what is the relation between the Authority and the Church? This is important for two big reasons.First, if the Church is a genuine representative of the Authority then it cannot be blamed for its actions in trying to protect and preserve the Authority. The actions of the Church, even though harsh at times, would be justified. Just like Lord Asriel's killing of Roger is justified by his bigger mission. If the Authority himself is evil, then the Church is, or may be, as much a victim of manipulation as anyone else.Second, if the Church is not a genuine agent of the Authority then killing the Authority is pointless. Killing the Authority did not even stop the leaking of Dust anyway; in fact the leaking of Dust was caused ultimately by the war against Him: by the Knife and by the Church's bomb. After Lyra's return to Oxford the Church is still in power, but some vague reforms are brewing. But the Authority is dead, so the Church had become illegitimate. A weird situation.I think this question, of the relationship between God and Church, is so big that another book is required to sort it out. In fact, by going gnostic rather than atheistic, Pullman gets himself into a bit of a difficult position because he accepts the main claim of the Church as the representative of God on earth. I'm curious how this will work out.Finally, I didn't care much for the mystic romance between Lyra and Will. Romantic love seems to be becoming the official religion of the 21st century, with all the ensuing nonsense. If one is rational enough to dismiss all religion as a mistake based on fear and prejudice rooted in tradition, why not dismiss romantic love as jealosy and infatuation triggered by raging hormones?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman has undertaken one of the most ambitious young adult series that I have ever read. Along with being just a very creative adventure/fantasy story, Pullman addresses a huge variety of universal questions and themes. God, religion, the origins of the universe, war. He has the nerve to call the church in his world corrupt and completely lost from the original purpose and mission it intended. He has adult characters who have major personality flaws, and greedy ambitions - who manage to redeem themselves in the end in a way that doesn't clear their deeds of the past.The book has a strong female lead character, and several other stong female characters throughout the books. One of the strong female characters is very complex, ambitious and greedy. Pullman makes her pretty dislikable throughout the book, yet her role turns out to be very important to the side of good. It is rare to see anywhere in literature a character like this pulled off so well.I am highly impressed that this book addresses the issues it does, and forms opinions that don't go where you would expect them to go. More amazing that this is a kid's book - I think that this book would have received alot of slack even if adults were its official target.These books are truly unique and I am excited they exist for young adults (or younger if you are a precocious reader). I am a big fan of Harry Potter and these books seriously rival that series. It certainly is braver in taking on the themes it does in not so black and white of a manner."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I attend Narbonne High School. I often ask the Librarian if has any suggestions as to what to read. She suggested The Golden Compass. This has been one of the best books I have read. I like fantasy and this fits it to a T. I felt that I could connect with the characters in the book. For those who do not know, the book is about a girl who receives and interesting compass. The compass is unlike any we have in our world. Lyra is the main character. She is a smart young girl who lives in Oxford at Jordan College.In Lyra's world it is unheard of for people to not have deamons. Pantalaimon is Lyra's deamon. He acts as her conscience. They are a perfect pair. There are many other fascinating characters, such as Mrs. Coulter, an aeronaut Lee Scoresby, \\"uncle\\" Asriel, witch queen Serafina Pekkala, Iorek Byrnison the armored bear. It is fascinating to see how all of these characters are intertwined to make such a marvelous book.Philip Pullman has really outdone himself. As soon as I finished the first book I couldn't wait to get my hands on the second one and the third one. His Dark Materials is set up like Lord of the Rings. It's a story that is about one huge adventure mad into different books. I recommend the series to all of my friends. The way the story id written leaves me wanting more. It was very hard to put the book down. I would strongly suggest that for anyone who is intending on reading these books to make sure you have enough time. Once I got reading I couldn't stop. Pullman has really outdone himself.His Dark Materials should be in every library. No library is complete with out it. The Golden Compass is food to everyone's imagination. The characters feel so real that it is hard not to believe it is truth. After I read the first one I wished that I was in Lyra's world and had a deamon. The friends that I have recommended the series to go on to read other books written my Pullman. The Golden Compass is a fascinating story that leads to suspense, action, adventure and drama. I would give this book a ten!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Other reviews have compared The Golden Compass to the Harry Potter books. I agree that these books compare well in literary finesse, complexity of plot, and interest value. They are both wonderful fantasies, and both settings occur in a world parallel to England, yet they are really very different!For me, Harry Potter is lighter in mood; the scary beings are more cartoonish in feeling, making them entertaining and \\"delightfully scary\\". The Golden Compass has a darker feeling, with intimidating characters with mysterious, sinister plans. There are kidnappings of children, battles with gore and bloodshed, and even children die.This is not to say that one series is better than the other; just to note the differences. I personally favor Harry Potter, and enjoyed its lightheartedness, but I thoroughly have enjoyed The Golden Compass, and so have my two young teenagers I've been reading it to. In fact, they prefer it to Potter for its greater sophistication. For them, HP was too childish.The Golden Compass has its light and funny moments, but seems to carry a commentary about religion and the forces of good and evil... a dark fantasy. Yet I've mostly savored it for its rich vocabulary, letting it create for me fantastic visual images of ponderous old buildings and crypts in London, icy northern strongholds where experiments are carried out on children and their daemons, where talking, armored bears live, and hordes of raven-shaped witches fly overhead. It's potential material for the next great fantasy movie."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like many other people who read these books, I came to them through a Harry Potter-related recommendation. Pullman is technically more proficient than Ms. Rowling, but, as it sometimes goes, the training shows, as do the clear influences of William Blake and Paradise Lost. More than the plot line itself, those three things, the training, Blake, and the Milton, are what I think of when I think of this book. To contrast with the Potter books, these seem much less young adult fiction than an English major's attempt to write proper young adult fiction. The sense of whimsy that made the Potter books such fun is absent here, lost in the almost overweening structure. I'm trying not to pan these books too badly, as I rather enjoyed the series as a whole, but overall they're no more than a placeholder, albeit a quality one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Harry Potter might satisfy you, but it is nothing compared to this. \\"His dark materials\\" is full of action and adventure, and while harry potter might seem like it covered both of those, it was not nearly as satisfing as these books. Harry Potter was a page turner, but this is a stay-up-all-nighter. These books have a much deeper story than Harrry Potter. These books are very creative, which is more itself than any harry Potter book. If you are looking for a magical fantisy book to satisfy your needs, get this!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullmans triology is a masterpiece dspite what others may say.The ideas in it can only be the work of a genius and talented author.I dunno how he thought some things up but I'm grateful to him because they make such a great read. Deamons are very cool and Pan (and later in the amber spyglass,) Kirjava are wonderful!!I like everything about these books and there is NO reason to be put off reading them. They explore a great deal of puzzling but spectacular things and their are lots of amazing subplots that branch off from the main plot that will leave you dazzled and wondering.The characters are almost real and places descriptions so life like it's to think of them as part of a story.You almost believe that Deamons and Deaths and Dust exist and you wonder about the other worlds...like the world of the dead........Even if you have read certain reviews that put you off don't let them convince you these are &quot;bad&quot; books coz they're far from it and at least deserve to be given a chance. You'll most likely find your doubts wrong and will be cursing yourself for not reading them sooner."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Mr. Pullman weaves a great story, and it is clear he is a brilliant writer.But the only way you could read these books and not find offense is that you don't believe in god. He specifically writes that the Christian/Jewish god is evil, and that is a bit of a disturbing message to be putting into a children's book. He intentionally frames himself as the anti-C.S. Lewis, who he considers \\"evil.\\"The problem with this book is not that he criticizes the church, its that he specifically and directly criticizes god. I don' think that has any redeeming qualities, and isn't a healthy outlook no matter who you are or what you believe.Frankly, if you read these books carefully, its impossible to miss. So if you are an atheist, go for it, you'll probably really enjoy his tremendous skill. But if you believe in god, or your children do, find a book that has a more adjusted criticism of the church or one that is more friendly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Have just finished the third book in the trilogy. The first was pretty good, but I was wondering what all the fuss was about. By the time I got halfway through the third it was clear! The great theme of the books - the perpetual struggle for freedom and against authoritarianism - is captured splendidly and in a suitably grand way (and on the grandest of scales!). The characters are well developed and sharp, and then incidental plots are always supportive and never intrusive. Basically a great read..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Brilliantly written, intriguing plot, well-developed characters, thought-provoking - everything I love in a book.Please note that this series is written for teens/young adults - not young children. One item on the [...] page suggests ages 9-12, but it is clear from the content and the vocabulary/level-of-difficulty that the Amazon Editorial Review 13+ suggestion is more accurate.I read them for the first time as an adult and they are among my favorites."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The series was slow, difficult to get into and at times hard to follow. The overall story was good but each book individually can't be considered anything but an average read if you have nothing better to do."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did find this book a little bit hard going to start off with. It was slow for about half of the first book but in hindsight, you need that time to establish the amazing concepts that will unfold through the rest of the trilogy. Once things started moving it was very hard to put the book down, and I carried on with book two and then book three. Along the way we got to know and love so many likeable characters that it no longer seemed fiction, more like a story written about family. I am glad I had the three books to read at once as I don't think I could have survived the suspense otherwise. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13, although to those people overly sensitive to implied criticism of the Catholic Church it may be a bit confrontational."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love this book series it was very engaging. All the arguments about how dangerous this is to children reading the series always go over my head. I can't imagine how all the dangerous complicated thoughts that some adults are so sure are going to destroy a child's soul. They are just too complicated for any child to really come up with on their own. The only dangerous ideas that they are going to get is for the adult to announce to the child the exact dangerous ideas that this material is supposed to give them. Only then will they understand why the books are \\"supposed\\" to be so dangerous for them. That is not really my point for writing this review though. I have this series of books to thank for giving me a real interest in the concept of physics. I know want to expand my mind and find out how the universe really works. I want to find out what Dark Matter is or isn't. I want to know about black holes. I want to learn mathematics so that it will aid me in working out the more complex and fascinating concepts of physics and I think that is very exciting. High school didn't give me as much fascination with science as this book series did and I have Phillip Pullman to thank for it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"i bought this amazing trilogy and i can totally say that this series is one of my favorites..ever... its too great to resist...4 thumbs up :P :)!!!!get it"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought this book set in hopes that it was literature that could keep my imagination rolling, and it did more than that. Mark Pullman put together a work of art with this trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is a really good series of books. I've never been much for fantasy, nor have I read a lot of children's books. Harry Potter looks boring, so I've stayed away. My draw to these books started with a an e-mail forward last Christmas, one of those alarmist e-mails trying to convince me to boycott the movie due to its \\"atheist themes.\\"...I wanted to see what all the controversy was about, what could rile up the e-mail mob.Pullman's story is fascinating. Yes, his story does challenge authoritarianism and dogma. He does so in a way that not only entertains, but provokes thoughts, forcing the reader to challenge his beliefs on human nature. The story isn't necessarily anti-God, as much as it deconstructs the mythology we've created around the worship of God. This theme isn't in any way heavy handed...the story is also one of two children growing up and developing their own worldview.Despite all the symbolism and controversy, these are 3 very good books that were fun to read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of the most original fantasies I have read in a long time. I found it a good read. The first book is by far the best of the three. However, I think parents should read them first before deciding to give them to their children. These are very dark stories. The first book alone includes murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, torture, and betrayal. It is hard to know who is the good guy, and who is the villain. It is also openly anti-church (not that I had a problem with that, but some people might).It is interesting that Pullman, an atheist, has written a trilogy that is actually profoundly spiritual. The positive themes (yes, there are some) include friendship, loyalty, honor, cleaning up messes ( both the ones you have made and those of others ), keeping your word, and generally trying to do the right thing. Pullman presents a different concept of \\"soul\\" than has previously been explored.All in all this is a thought-provoking work, and worth the read, but I would say NOT suitable for younger children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I somehow skipped over these books in my adolescence (though I read and enjoyed another series of Pullman books) and I'm SO GLAD that I've finally gotten around to reading them because they are truly amazing. Not only full of adventure and intrigue and many well-sketched characters, but also full of deeper meanings and issues that I might not have picked up on as a child. All three are wonderfully rich and suspenseful and as soon as I finished the first I knew I had to read on through the end. If you haven't read them I would highly recommend it and if you haven't read them since your childhood I would suggest reading through them again. Truly thought-provoking and wonderful."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I picked up these books out of morbid fascination after seeing the movie and hearing a coworker talk about the book. I borrowed the first one from her and found my self intrigued so I bought the series and waited anxiously for the post man to deliver it. I found that I love these books! They are together a great work of fiction. They carried me to worlds I had never imagined through perils I would never have known. The characters are engraved in my heart. Each cut and bump and soul wrenching tear made me love them all the more. I wanted so badly for true love to win and triumph over evil and In the end I could barley see through my tears and with no truly happy ending in sight I love these books all the more."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman has created a modern classic with this trilogy.

I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Move over Harry Potter!I'm 28 years old, and was forced to read this trilogy by a friend. It took me a bit to get into, but then again I'm not really a sci-fi/fantasy fan. If truth be told, I double majored in college, and one of my major was English, with my concentration in British Lit., romantic era.However, when I got into the third chapter or so, I couldn't put the book down! On the surface it's such a page turner, with such imagination, unique characters, and witty lines.Divulge deeper, and there is so much there that in order to absorb it all, you would have to re-read it again...and again...and again in order to hope to grasph all the meanings, a sign of a great book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy read, with deep meaning, and to people of all ages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Northern Lights. Or better known as the book that lead to the film \\"The Golden Compass\\", the fist of the three motion pictures. The book obviously is better than the filmed version. The story is more complicated, but explains a lot of things that in the theatre are left untold. The reader understands more about the \\"Dust\\", more about the organisation called Church in the book and Magisterium in the film (because of years of battles by our beloved Vatican, that has nothing more important to do that feeling itself threatened by a children's book)!The book goes further on with the story than the film.Well I'm about to start with the second book \\"The Subtle Knife\\" (no idea of its name in theatres)!This is my suggestion: first read the book (if you are really interested in the story), then watch it (it's surely very nice made on what concerns special effects and actors)!A Subtle Knife. I've spent the whole day reading these 325 pages, which made me so passionate chapter after chapter. My workmate told me this was a \\"holiday\\" book because you haven't to be bothered or stopped while reading it, but I didn't think it would have been like that... :-)Anyway I see now why the church is so strongly against this book and I am quite sure that in the middle ages the same book would have been bunt at the stake together with the author! :-)So... let's talk about the book, but I wouldn't like to spoil it for those who are reading it or plan to do it. In this story many \\"worlds\\" or \\"universes\\" get entangled together through many \\"windows\\". Among which there's also ours! There are basically two factions: those who want to put an army together to fight and destroy the \\"tyrant\\" (you would never guess who that is!!!) and those, who want to stop them with all their means. Lyra is the girl of the prophecy and in this book the prophecy is being told. Another kid, Will, is from \\"our\\" world and they are destined to help themselves, even though he has another important task to fulfil.Lots of unexplained events come to an explanation and the reader discovers that many \\"explorers\\" have already discovered some of the other worlds. In the first book we leave the bears who fight to find other characters: the angels (those who rebelled so much time ago - take a look at the bible -), witches, strange spectres that suck the life out of the adults leaving them as zombies (not alive but not even dead). Evil people who seem to be good... others that one wonders are they simply mad or do they have a plan?Anyway everything mixes and in the different worlds new human beings, new animals and new weathers meet... Beings that exist in all the worlds but are of different forms or even unseen. Like feelings... like human being's souls. Only one thing seem not to have boarders or limits: the dust, or dark matter! But what is it really?Just one word: GENIAL!His Dark Materials Boxed setI don't know how to describe what this book made me feel... a book full of feelings and fantasy...Really...I don't tell you to read it, but not to do it would be a huge pity.If you visit the wikipedia site of this book [...] or the Italian website \\"Queste Oscure Materie\\" [...], this last site full of quotations from the book (see what follows) you can maybe, only maybe, get a small hint of what it talks about... but not the sensations it leaves within you..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Received the book in great condition.

Mainly about a girl named Lyra, but with a good amount of other charcters sprinkled in. And a polar bear, i mentioned that, right? The characters are complex and um, realistic, if you don't mind the fact some bears actually talk, as well as these familar-things i can't explain well. Oh and angels, and these mammoth like things that biuld houses. But even they are believeable.This trilogy really is quite similar to other 'many worlds to travel to' books, but it's done oh so much better. But it's complicated so it's hard to summerize, not that i've ever really tried that.But aside from it all, the polar bear, Iorek, probably made me give this book four stars instead of 2. That chacter made me turn a blind eye to the other flaws.

In the triology, everyone you meet is stuck into your mind due to their seperate characteristics, just reading the name gives an immediate immpression of the character, and Phillip Pullman cleverly weaves in tiny detail which leaves the reader want more.With the above said, this triology is a must read, a classic; an epic. The themes inside are clear and direct, and provokes the reader to think as well as be captivated by the complex plot which boils down to one simple story; the fall of mankind.The title of the triology, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is a reference to John Miltons \\"Paradise Lost\\", if you liked this epic poem, this book is for you. Nevertheless, I heartly reccommend this triology, for its splendid writing, breath taking adventure, the simplicity of it all, yet it a classic that one will not forget, this remains the best book I have yet to read!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a big fan of Harry Potter and LOTR I was looking for more epic and wonderful fantasy to escape in when I found this series last year.Skeptical at first I quickly read all three books. What was the verdict? I loved them and they became my all time favorite books and favorite series. Yes better than Harry Potter and LOTR. Why is this? The emotional value is intense.I won't give away anything imprtant but at times I was sobbing at others cheering. These books really made a big emotional impact on me. With romance and adventure they seem the perfect series of books and they are.Reading them as a preteen and a young teen now I could really identify with the main character Lyra and rejoice and cry with her. I couldn't, however, understand them at first.How?, I thought could a fanasty book not have a happily-ever-after, not have a total resolution, not leave you feeling inspired and happy.And as I read the three books I reliezed they were inspiring just because of that. Because they mirrored real life where everything doesn't work out and yet dwelled in the world of fantasy.I highly reccomend these books for all fanatsy lovers. I guarentee you'll find yourself inspired and emotionally moved and perphaps find a new favorite fantasy series. Have fun reading the books!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Amber Spyglass, the third book in a series called His Dark Materials, is one of the best books I have read.

I was too young to understand the adult themes, sub-text (I was really naive and didn't realize how anti-Christian Philip Pullman was aside from feeling there was something odd about how the Church was the bad guy, and actually thought,\\"Well, they're only bad guys in the other universe so that doesn't mean anything.\\") but I knew one thing: It was very compelling, interesting, and I still wanted to read it even though it was a bit advanced for me. I still think the book is fascinating and re-readable and I recommend it.As for the anti-Christian themes, I don't really care about them but then again I'm not Christian.

It is a morass of plot holes so large, ocean liners could get lost in it. It seemed that Pullman completely ignored writing a decent story just so he could get to his 'message'1.In Ci'gazze we are told that spectres attack any adult, it happens to the witches hunting Lyra yet when Mrs Coulter turns up, they leave her alone and not just alone, they follow her orders. We are not told why this happens, except some allusion to Mrs Coulter's force of will. Then Mary Malone manages to walk from the spectre haunted city and up the mountains without being bothered once. So too does the assassin priest. If you are going to come up with a set up like this, use it or at least explain why it's suddenly not working.2, Mrs Coulter sudden transformation into mother of the year. Why? No actual reason save that Pullman wanted her and Azriel to sacrifice themselves for Lyra.3. Lyra and Will being told that sex is nice. Well forgive me if I'm wrong, but sex is part of human nature and no one needs to 'tell' you about sexual feelings. They just happen. The most you need to know is how babies are made. No one needs someone else to tell you to suddenly feel attracted to people. Given how much was made of Lyra's choice, I thought it'd be something ground shattering and not whether she should fall in love with Will. It also felt false and forced. Also for those who insist that it's about their first kiss and not sex, at one point it is mentioned that they are lovers. That's a phrase used to describe people who have had sex not just a snog.4. Mary Malone's reasons for not being a christian. Sorry but given her words about how good a christian she was, it does not follow that she would lose her faith, simply because she wanted to have sex. She would have stopped being a nun, but why would she suddenly lose a deep faith just like that. Seemed lazy and unbelievable.5. How does Azriel manage to build up this 'rebellion against god' in a matter of weeks. Because that's how long it feels. If it were supposed to be set over a year, then okay, but that's not the timeframe and it makes no sense.6. So what was the effect of Azriel splitting open the heavens? None apparently apart from global devastation on Lyra's world. But if there were so many doorways to other worlds, why did he have to split open the heavens. Not explained, made no sense.7. Will's father. How did he become a shaman? Not explained, he just is and we have to accept it. Yet Will and Lyra can't be full witches with magic, so how could his father have power?These are just the glaring holes in the plot that I picked up and possibly why I hated the series the first time I read it. My advice, read the first two books and make up what happens next, it's bound to be better than the book on it's own."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read all of these books as they came out and have recently reread them all.I have again marvelled at how good they really are!!Pullman has amazing width in the scope of these books, they all interconnect, yet stand alone beautifully. The books are an amazing set of adventures against evil,power and selfishness, some have even compared them to \\"Paradise Lost\\". Northern Lights follows the story of Lyra, she lives in a world not quite our own... the second follows a child in our own universe who uses a knife to cut into other dimensions, the last shows the two children nearing puberty and losing some of the power of childhood. Their loss in this book is handled well by Pullman and reminded me of that netherworld of teenagehood when you are not really anything and life is starting to become emotionally very scary... i have given this an overall rating of 5 but actually my favourite is \\"The Subtle Knife\\" as it is about our universe and the problems a young boy with a mentally ill parent encounters here, as well as his \\"magical\\" problems in the other worlds he travels to... this is a great adventure and will be read for generations by adults and children alike.... you should read it...or listen to the audio tapes released by the BBC, a radio play of the books.... and you should also look at the other books Pullman has written. (My other favourite is \\"Ruby in the Smoke\\"... very different than these but really cool about Victorian women)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you LOVE Harry Potter, than pick up His Dark Materials. These books are about a twelve year old girl named Lyra Silvertonuge, (my favorite charater) and her adventures with her deamon Pantaliamon, her friends Serafina Pekkala, the queen of her witch clan, Iorek Byrnison, the bear king, the Aletheometer, the truth instrument that Lyra learns to read, and her new friend Will Parry, who becomes more than a friend...This book is the best after Harry Potter. It is something worth picking up and reading"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Before the movie came out, I have to say I was sadly unaware of the existence of Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. And had there not been so much controversy stirred up over the movie, I probably never would have picked up the books anyway. So I have to give the religious right a hearty thank-you for turning me onto such a wonderful story I would have otherwise missed.This trilogy focuses on Lyra, a young girl who we learn early on is prophesized to do great things. An \`orphan,' she was brought up by Scholars at Jordan College in England. Lyra's world is an alternate version of our own, so while there is an England, there are also places that don't exist on the earth we know. She and everyone else also has a \\"daemon\\"--an animal personification of their \\"spirit\\" that everyone can see and even talk to. As children, daemons can take any shape they please, but once you reach puberty, your daemon will take on the permanent shape of the animal that personifies your spirit. So, (as one book explains) if you're a loyal person who willingly follows orders, your daemon will probably be a dog.Lyra starts on her adventure when she and her daemon, Pan, hide in a closet and see the Master of Jordan College try to poison her Uncle Asriel (her guardian who left her at the college), who is visiting after an expedition from the North. After saving him from being poisoned, Lyra watches from the closet as Asriel shows the heads of Jordan College pictures he took of a mysterious substance called \\"Dust\\" that seems to fall from the sky and settle on adults, but not children.At the same time, children are disappearing all over England, and rumors abound about \\"Gobblers\\" who are stealing the kids to \\"eat\\" them. Right after Lyra's friend, Roger, goes missing, she leaves Jordan College with a mysterious and powerful woman named Mrs. Coulter, whom she later discovers is one of the Gobblers. With the help of the alethiometer (the \\"golden compass\\", given to her by none other than the same Master of Jordan who tried to poison her uncle), which tells the truth if you ask it a question, she heads for the North to save Roger and find her uncle, whom she learned is now being imprisoned by the armored bears in the North. There she learns what the Gobblers have really been doing to the missing children, and what Dust really is.I can't really summarize the later two books without giving away huge spoilers, so I suppose I'll leave it there.Anyway, I appreciate when authors make their protagonists (and villains) believable, by creating characters who have realistic flaws, positive attributes and believable motivations. Since HDM is a \\"children's\\" trilogy series, that's especially refreshing, as you often find literature geared toward kids with ridiculously virtuous heroes and ridiculously stupid and pointlessly evil villains. Lyra is no where near a \\"perfect\\" person. She's headstrong, rebellious, impolite and impulsive (and, not to mention, a chronic liar). But she's also loving, loyal, strong and virtuous. If I had a daughter, I would want her to be like Lyra. Mrs. Coulter, as one example of a villain, is beautifully done. She is easily despised, and yet, not everything she does is despicable.I'm sad that there are parents out there who would deny their children the experience of reading this series merely because of its religious allegory storyline. This isn't a series about \\"killing god\\" or \\"defiling Christianity.\\" It's a story that elevates love, logic and reason over hate, fear and tyranny. Yes, the Church is portrayed as \\"evil.\\" Yes, \\"God\\" is portrayed as a tyrant. But it is a fictional story set in a fictional world, and you could simply explain to your children that the Church portrayed in the series is not the same as the one in the real world, and that the themes of beauty and love are the important messages to take from it. And if your children have true \\"faith\\" in their religion, one good story isn't going to sway them from that. There is so much spirituality to these books, and appreciation for the world and beauty around us. It shows how even an atheist can believe in the connection between all living things, and a spirit and a soul.My one criticism comes for the end of the series. Unfortunately, I can't really go into detail because I would be giving away the end of the book, but I just felt there were some easily avoided plot holes near the end. Don't, however, let that deter you from finishing the books. It was a wonderful story that I look forward to letting my kids read one day."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's epic fantasy is sometimes compared to those of C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, or Susan Cooper, but while it is at least their equal in richness, beauty, and page-turning interest, it is much more ambitious and thoughtful. Tolkien and Cooper excel at atmosphere, but their stories are built on the morally empty \\"good versus evil\\" framework, where little thought is asked of the reader about what \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" might consist of. They are two opposing teams, one of which is pretty, and the other, ugly. Lewis's moral universe is much richer, but still one in which goodness consists of submission to a benign authority.\\"His Dark Materials\\" is morally complex and provocative, and many other things I don't want to give away. Great for older kids and grown-ups."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are what the very best of Children's literature does. They are entertaining and fanciful, yet they simultaneously challenge and educate both the mind and heart. Like hot soup when you are sick, they are \\"Good and Good for You.\\"\\"His Dark Materials\\" are a great counter-point to the mindless fun of Harry Potter and friends. Pullman's writing is educated and insightful, his characters are real and multi-faceted. The series is packed with adventure, ideas, beliefs, fantasy, talking armored bears, Texas Balloonists, animals, gypsies, and just about everything else. The tone of the series is serious, and as dark as the name implies.\\"Chronicles of Narnia;\\" \\"Prydain Chronicles;\\" \\"The Hobbit;\\" \\"Harry Potter;\\" \\"The Time Quartet;\\" \\"Wind in the Willows;\\" and now...\\"His Dark Materials.\\" Philip Pullman, welcome to the club."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"so many \\"readers\\" who are writing reviews (I use quotes because many of these reviews are written by people who obviously have never read the books...) have the misconception that God was killed in this series.Not only was the being known as the Authority not God.. He was never killed.The Authority was a Angel, the first Angel to gain conciousness who had at one point tried to gain power by calling himself falsely the creator.He was imprisioned by Metatron (who is known in religious texts as the voice of god) who in this series is another Angel who once had been a man.Once the children release him from his prison he joyfully discorporates into Dust.. wich in the book is like life essence.. the spirit diffused into the universe to become a part of everything else.This is hardly murder, more like a prison break. The Angel who was once man is then Dragged into the Abyss by the girls parents who sacrifice themselves to save her.I think what the Author is trying to say is that if there was once a being who wrote the Bible, or rather dictated it to humans then this being was captive by humanity who has used this set of Ideas to hold all of us captive within the power of the church. You say that pre-marital sex is evil? Ok well then we should shun, punish, stone to death anyone who has it. Why? God said so. So now the church has the right to dictate who has comitted sins, and who descides whats a sin? the church does.. just look at the right to life murderers who bomb clinics.. the Church says its evil, so they carry out the sentence.Dont forget that the only beings killed in this series were mortal.Now this is just one small part of the stories, please dont feel that im simplifying everything to this one issue. But I have been reading reviews here and it seems like the con is mostly about how the Author kills God, or about how children will be corrupted.Personally I feel that if you are raising your children in a insulated bubble where you try to keep their eyes averted to everything you dont believe in... then they will have one hell of a time once they get to college meet other people with other ideas and start to think for themselves.Stop trying to force your children to think exactly like you do..and stop telling me what you think is safe for me to give to mine.I never would have found these books if it wasnt for the controversy though... so thank you for publicizing them so well :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I recently finished reading Pullman's \\"Golden Compass' in anticipation of the upcoming movie. I was disappointed in the quality of the writing and the story itself. I am a retired literature teacher and this book does not meet the quality of the works of Tolkien, C. S. Lewis or J.K.Rowling. I found it depressing, the abuse of children was appalling and it seemed to have no redeeming features. Instead of eagerly beginning the second book, I found myself drawn back to read again the Harry Potter books, which leave me with a much better feeling at the end, whichever book I may read.I was surprised at the many awards the trilogy had received. There are many more books available for the young adult reader which are worthy of the time to read them. This book, and I assume the series, are NOT for young children, and not really recommended for young adults. More science fiction than fantasy, I am not sure I want to read the next two books, particularly when I hear that the first book is the best one. I will probably see the movie since it is considered 'watered down' from the book. Too much darkness in this book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is the rare book where I found myself nodding along with as many parts from the five-star reviews as from the one-star reviews. I am honestly very torn in my intellectual and emotional reaction toward this series. For me, the pure imagination, philosophical depth, and sense of adventure in this trilogy outweighed its flaws--making it a very worthwhile read, in the end--but it was these flaws that kept me from giving the five stars it had the potential for. Yet because it is a story I feel quite passionate about, I have a feeling this is going to turn into a rather long review. At this point I should say that it is impossible to discuss either the merits or the demerits of this series without giving specific examples, so read no further if you wish to avoid SPOILERS.In \\"The Golden Compass\\", Pullman introduces us to the wonderfully imaginative pseudo-Victorian world of Lyra's, full of daemons, armored bears, and intriguing and morally ambiguous people (including Lyra herself). The richness of Pullman's description of the Oxford of Lyra's world as well as the arctic north remind one of the wonder the reader first experiences upon discovering Harry Potter's Hogwarts or C.S. Lewis' wintry Narnia. I do not make these references lightly, for while the later books are more evocative of Milton or Dante, the first book has the familiar feel of the best of the genre-typical \\"ordinary boy/girl discovers extraordinary powers and embarks on an amazing adventure\\" theme, this time casting Lyra as an obstinate oracle with parents who happen to be two of the most powerful people in the world. Lyra is given the alethiometer, an interesting \\"truth-telling\\" device that is the first of several problematic plot devices. Even if one suspends their disbelief that Lyra (not exactly a Scholar-in-the-making, at this point at least) is able to intuitively use such a device, the problem with its existence is immediately obvious with the first time of many \\"Gee ... what should we do?\\" \\"Hey, let's ask the alethiometer!\\" patterns (it's ironic that an anti-religionist uses a deus ex machina plot device, but I digress). Pullman's choice to have Lyra use the omniscient alethiometer at certain points in the plot but not others makes for a convenient (but transparent) plot device. Imagine how different this story would have been if Lyra had done the obvious thing and asked the alethiometer \\"How come Dad's acting weird?\\" toward the end of the first book.We meet Will in \\"The Subtle Knife\\", and I must say that I was surprised to find that I liked Will a bit more than Lyra (who becomes oddly dependent and submissive as the series progresses--same as her mother). Whereas Lyra is a tad schizophrenic at times (one second she awes the reader with her insights on human nature and the brilliant ideas she creates, the next she causes the reader to smack his/her forehead as she forgets lessons as simple as \\"don't take rides from strangers\\"!), Will is an intriguing young Byronic hero--brave and passionate, yet full of inner turmoil and doubt. Being from \\"our\\" world, the reader is more able to identify with his perspective of Lyra, the \\"multiverse\\", and the other odd occurrences going on around him. Pullman again creates a beautiful new world quite different from the ones we are familiar with, and we see the complex and touching relationship between Lyra and Will begin to blossom.The story begins to unravel with the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" as there was a lot of action but a lot of unclear motive. Why exactly did Mrs. Coulter kidnap Lyra (and how did she get so quickly to her hiding place when it took her pursuers a rather long, hard journey)? What was up with Metatron exactly? Why exactly did Lyra go to the world of the dead? I must say that that journey was a spine-tingling good adventure evocative of both Dante and ancient Greek mythology, but it seemed less a chance for Lyra to \\"make good on her promise\\" to Roger and more a needed opportunity for Pullman to show what \\"really\\" happens when you die. I realize that many of these questions were answered, at least superficially, in the text ... but few had truly convincing answers upon deeper thought.The anti-religious rhetoric reaches its peak (which is too bad because the underlying, humanist re-telling of the Genesis story was quite clever), often blurring the lines between the characters as they confessed their similar stories of how the Church is evil/empty/unfulfilling and avoiding/leaving it was the best thing that could've happened to them. There are a number of \\"low blows\\" as well, such as the ... over affectionate, shall we say? ... priest Will encounters as he searches for Lyra. Meanwhile, during Pullman's zeal to bash organized religion, a number of important characters and plotlines were virtually ignored or grossly underdeveloped, the increasing battles between Lord Asriel's forces and the authority are confusing and cartoonish, and after one of the most genuinely touching and beautiful romantic encounters I've read in fiction, Pullman creates a number of rather arbitrary rules about the metaverse to pull Lyra and Will apart. I mean, come on ... can't we just have one more little open window? Or an industrial sized rattrap for the Specter that would be created every time the knife was used? Even Adam and Eve got to stay together in the Bible ... pulling Will and Lyra apart seemed unusually cruel for both them but especially for the reader who's invested all this time in them--and an odd (and unnecessary) departure from the otherwise parallel re-telling of \\"the Fall\\". Their choice is a curious one, and sadly left unexplored--is a long life apart really better than a short life together?After all this complaining, you might wonder why I still gave this trilogy even four stars. First, I cannot describe how incredibly imaginative and captivating these stories were. Despite this trilogy's \\"warts\\", I was completely absorbed in a thirst to discover \\"what happened\\" as well as \\"why\\". The basic message which I believe to be at the core of this trilogy--paradise is not something lost in the Fall, nor something to anticipate after death, but rather something to create right here on earth--is actually rather uplifting, and the extolling of \\"conscious goodness\\" rather than \\"childlike innocence\\" as the core element of virtue and spirituality is quite fascinating. Even though the trilogy has numerous internal inconsistencies and Pullman commits the writer's mortal sin of selfishly valuing his message more than the enjoyment and stimulation of the reader, I might have been able to overlook those problems if the ending had been more palatable--the story might have been even all the more perfect for its imperfections. Yet, in the end I couldn't help but thinking that for a story promoting love, wisdom, and humanism the ending was quite bleak and melancholy AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE. Pullman waited until the end of his story to add and change the laws of the worlds he created (a big fantasy/SF no-no) in a heavy-handed and artificial way to avoid a happy ending that seemed inevitable and deserved for his bloodied and weary young protagonists. An epic will always be judged by its ending--the reader must believe that its characters lived, loved, and died with a purpose. With the ending Pullman chose, that \\"purpose\\" becomes ambiguous at best.In conclusion, Pullman's underlying message is unorthodox yet uplifting, and this trilogy was both interesting and intellectually stimulating and it should be read *and discussed* by religious people, agnostics, and atheists alike rather than either blindly banned or praised simply because of its views. Yet, because of the flaws mentioned above, I cannot shake the thought that he could've conveyed his message even more effectively and in a way that would be even more satisfying to the reader without sacrificing his core beliefs. Rather than sermonizing, Pullman should have remembered his own advice--just tell stories."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm currently an English BA Major, due to graduate in December 2004. For one of my final literature course requirements, I'm taking a Young Adult literature course, with the goal of studying Young Adult literature as a genre of literature worth study and analysis. It's also geared towards future English teachers, both to make them familiar with what their students are reading, and acquaint them with how to teach literary theory in secondary school environments. One of the books we were to read for this course was The Golden Compass.First, I loved the book, and was so spellbound about what was going to happen next, I had to buy the rest of them and read them. I was astounded by Pullman's tremendous diversity. While the plot continued through the second and third books, it was as though I was reading a totally different story in each book. It never got boring, and Pullman has a way of twisting the plot in ways you never expect. In fact, several times, he literally pulled the ground out from under me.Also, an interesting note for those of you who have studied literature, Pullman deliberately re-creates Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" with this series. Keep that in mind while reading them.P.S. - For all of you older readers out there, and maybe even a few of the younger ones, keep a box of kleenex on hand for the end of the third book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Reviewers who give books such as this strong negative reviews because the theme conflicts with their personal religous belief should not affect your decision to purchase this book. This series is not attacking the exsistence of God. To attack one aspect of this novel such as the exsitance of God is to attack the nonexistance of the armored polar bears which appear in book one of this trilogy. The person who states (in another review) \\"The author is obviously talented and it's a shame that the thrust of the trilogy was to try to denounce God's existence...\\" obviously is mistaken and has not allowed him or herself to forego this independent ridculous suggestion and denounce a quality piece of literature by Pullman.For God's sake, its fantasy! The person who made this abominadble comment is misinterperting this story as one thats sole purpose is to blatantly attack the exsistance of God. Clearly this is not the case: The Amber Spyglass continues the captivating trilogy set in motion by the Golden Compass and continues to develop the characters of Lyra and Will while the story reaches an extrodinary, unprecedented and ultimate climax. It is a quality piece of work which, as Terry Brooks commented, is of the quality of Tolkiens best.Do not pass the the His Dark Materials Trilogy. It is a FANTASTIC read for ANYONE, young or old, regardless of religous affiliation. Concerned parents who wish to shield their children from literature which they feel may contradict their beliefs only succeed in revealing the insecurity which they have vested in their own beliefs. As a teenager, this series revived my interest in reading of which I had previously none. It was this series that propelled me into the world of fantasy and gave incentive enough to read more difficult literature produced by authors like Robin Cook, Tolkien, and Orson Scott Card.This book and the rest of the His Dark Material Series: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass are superb pieces of literature which despite the aforementioned critism, have continued to maintain high acclaim among critics and readers alike. To pass up this series is most definately a mistake."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are absolutely fantastic for people of all ages. I started reading the first one in 1995 (when I was 10 years old) and loved it. Years later I stumbled on the sequels which I hadn't even known existed. They make you think, which for some people, is a good thing. Its refreshing to read fantasy novels where good and evil are sometimes ambiguous.To those who \\"fear\\" the message that their kids are getting: Its ironic that the same people who claim they are against brainwashing are those that want to censor and control what ideas children are exposed to. Whatever your views, let your kids read it and have a conversation about it afterwards. What is there to hide? Its fiction."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First a disclaimer. I am 28 years old and only read the series as the first two books happened to already be in my apartment in Japan and I was bored. I had to buy the third book in Tokyo.The first book in the series was great, no questions. The idea of people with daemons is a fascinating one and it got my imagination fired up. As some people have mentioned, Lyra is not exactly the most interesting heroine, but the book moves at a strong clip and her world is a familiar yet unique place.Book two introduces Will and Dr Mary Malone and things start to slow down. Not necessarily a bad thing as sub-plots come to the forefront. Dark clouds looming for book three though.I was 'lucky' enough to find book 3 in Shinjuku, Tokyo (English books not being exactly popular in Japan) and I still have about 20 pages to go. The thing is; I just don't care. I just want the book to end so I can put it away. Definitely not a good feeling. There are just too many sub-plots and the characters are dull as dish-water with some completely out of character events and dialogue (based on the first two books).Also, while not being particularly religious myself, Pullman's ideologies are rammed into your face page after page. There is no subtlety to it. God is dead, Christianity is for stupid people, wisdom comes from . . . well who knows? Obviously he is a very bitter man but if I want to read some crackpot religious treatise I will go to the Religion section in the bookstore.The whole book is a shambles, boring characters, inconsistent dialogue/action (not in character), long winded chapters where nothing happens and constant nagging about Christianity. It was just not enjoyable for me.I don't know what to say, the first book is amazing, the second is so-so and the final book was just a chore. I would say read it, but there is much better junior fiction (or adult fiction if you are around 12 or so) to be had than this."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is not a children's book, nor is it meant to be one. No more than Animal Farm is, as George Orwell claimed, a \\"fairy tale.\\" Those that assumed it is a children's book made an improper assumption. Both works feature deep layers of allegory, many of which children will not come to appreciate until they grow older.This work of literature presents the reader with a poignantly expressed case for spiritual freedom. Not atheism, not agnosticism, but freedom of spiritual choice. It blasts Christianity less than it highlights the detriments of blind dogma, the same kind of knee-jerk dogma that drives a number of reviewers here to condemn the book as \\"evil.\\" These people fear their children thinking outside the box, even if it furthers their spiritual understanding. I am a Christian, and believe the faithful must base their faith on enlightened choice. What is there to fear from a novel, when it is obviously a work of fiction? Those that assert this book is especially unfit for children are tacitly admitting children are most vulnerable to brainwashing... their own. Why else wail like the Sirens about \\"researching\\" the author, save to make haplessly sheltered children even more sheltered? Indeed, today's brand of \\"pray and get a Lexus\\" faith, as seen here perpetuated by ignorance not understanding, has fallen pitifully far from the original purpose.Mr. Pullman also makes a powerfully written case for readers to be the best people they can be. Better people not in judgment, not in dogma, not in conviction, but in attitude and action. In that regard, Mr. Pullman's fantasy world presents a better case for Christ's compassion than the below basketload of pharisaical fundamentalists. To those of you more open minded to one of the greatest works of fiction from the last decade, purchase His Dark Materials for your own enjoyment and judge for yourself whether your children deserve such a treat."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a beautifully written trilogy. I was lucky enough to grow up with it. I read The Golden Compass in about 3rd grade and fell in love with Lyra and Pan. Towards the end of elementary I tracked down the 2nd and loved it too. It was several more years before the final one came out, but I read it as quickly as I could get my hands on it. As young as I was, I didn't get the deeper meaning behind the story, but the imagery and the characters were engrossing. Ever since then its been one of my favorite stories. I've probably reread 10 or more time.What everyone needs to understand that is is not an attack on god and religion as a whole. It is a symbolic attack on the people who take it to the fanatic and dangerous levels. The ones who corrupt the true essence of what faith is supposed to mean. You have to keep that in mind while you read it. *SPOILER* Yes, there is the scene in the final where they let god out of his crystal case and he breaks apart and blows off into the wind. But when you really read the subtexts of the book you see its about releasing god out of the confines man has put him in and allowing him to return what he is truly supposed to be and stand for.I read it as a child and I certainly wasn't scarred for life with the \\"brutal blasphemy\\". This book is not for the narrow minded who's sole purpose in life is marking what is and what isn't right. If you cant see what the author is truly saying, then this book isn't for you. I can see why parents wouldn't want young children to read it, it does deal with several dark issues. But allow your older children to think and experience for themselves. If they truly believe then a book inst going to effect anything. Their beliefs are going to be tested so many times in life, you will never be able to shield them from all of it.As to the comments about underage sex, no where in there does it say anything about them having sex. It says they kiss and touch. If you are that depraved and are searching for a reason to find the book disgusting and hateful, maybe thats what you see in it.Pullman is a wonderful author. His characters are realistic and 3 dimensional. His imagery is better then most I've ever read. The plot is original, intriguing, exciting, and complex. The books are full of adventure. There just aren't enough glowing adjectives to describe these books. They are a great read at any age and good enough to be read over and over. Don't let narrow minded people cloud your judgment."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I purchased this set for my 10-year-old who is (was) a die-hard Harry Potter fan. I told her that some believe this author to be better than Rowlings and she scoffed. She came down the next morning having devoured the first novel, and agreed that it was right up there with the Potter series, and was possibly superior in some respects. She also has discussed some of the sociological aspects of the fantasy world painted, and I love that because it makes her think and compare and contrast these sometimes idealized and stylistic fantasy worlds with the reality she experiences here in the 'real' world.

It is however unsurpizing that the reviews on amazon.co.uk do not have knee-jerk fears of evil satanists. But in some ways it's funny that it's the fundamentalist Americans who liken a fantasy book that has the church torturing children in experiments that leave them as zombies to Christianity.If you actually read the books - at least without automatically being offended - you'd realize that the actual morals are what Christianity is supposed to be. You know... about being good and not evil no matter your excuse. It's about totalitarianism that attempts to control all aspects of people's lives through kidnapping, assination, torture and censorship. Never once does he mention the actual theology nor refer to Christianity.According to the wiki:\\"However, Pullman has found support from other Christians, most notably Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury. These groups and individuals contend that Pullman's negative portrayal of the \\"Church\\" in His Dark Materials amounts to an attack on dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress, not on Christianity itself. Dr. Williams has gone so far as to propose that His Dark Materials be taught as part of religious education in schools.\\"If you really think that a series of books with good underlying morals yet opens minds, will ruin your children then don't let them read it.

After reading the series, I can say that I'm neither British or Catholic enough to really get upset over it. The story makes several large assumptions in order to justify the conclusion of the tale. It makes more attacks on the church itself rather than Christianity. A few small changes in names and Pullman would probably have to fear for Muslim retribution. In short, it's quite clearly a work of fiction and a pretty enjoyable tale."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have to laugh at all the \\"reviews\\" by people who are fearful of a book/film they haven't even read or seen. Minions of the Authority, perhaps? LOL!!Pullmans lyricism and story are fascinating. Second parts of trilogies have a tendency to drag, and this one is no different, but the story still advances and the third book brings a resoundingly successful climax."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am writing to review the series \`His Dark Materials' by Phillip Pullman - I read them in the same hardcover version sold here as a box set, before they were boxed. They are beautiful books, the same size as the large paperbacks, and \`The Amber Spyglass' has a beautiful library binding style cover (glossy boards with illustration) and a rather delicate dust jacket - be careful not to tear the circle. This injury seems common with this book.I have seen the movie \`The Golden Compass' and I found it utterly satisfying, and wonderful.I read these books two or three years ago. I found them captivating books for young readers that also seemed to have a lot to offer adults. I never really took much notice of the religious themes in this book, preferring to see the \`Magisterium' as a stand-in for any totalitarian organization - religious, political or otherwise. I know that, with the movie coming out at Christmastime, there is already a great degree of (I feel unfounded) controversy about the so-called \`anti-christian' themes of these books.Other reviewers on Amazon - many of whom have never reviewed anything, let alone another young person's book - have taken up the call to paint these books as some kind of \`campaign for atheism', and to name the prime campaigner Phillip Pullman.It shouldn't be hard to discern from a review if the reviewer has actually read the book, and with most of these strongly negative reviews of \`His Dark Materials' it's easy to see that the reviewers have not. It seems that a lot of talk and blather is being bandied about. If you are inclined to read these books, read them for what they are: a very well written fantasy trilogy for young people, not for what fearful antagonists claim them to be: an atheist's primer and attack on God and religious faith.I want to review these books mostly from a fiction perspective, but it's very tempting to answer some of the false claims that some reviewers make in ignorance of the actual story.\`The Golden Compass' opens the series by introducing us to a world kind of like our own, where some of the place names are the same, but the people are different in at least one striking way: they are all accompanied by a companion animal we soon learn to interpret as their soul. This arrangement makes life distinctly different in some ways. The animal companions can play together, children's companions can change their form, and there are taboos about touching the companion animals of others.The story really begins when a mysterious figure appears before the board at Oxford, to show evidence he's found for the existence of other worlds, linked by metaphysical \`dust' that has some of the qualities we ascribe to quantum particles in our science. The Magisterium has forbidden any mention or study of Dust, proclaimed it heresy, and condemned those who express an interest.As Lyra, the heroine of the series begins to follow the path of her destiny, she deals with themes of \`Truth', the innocence of children, control, loyalty and betrayal. She meets and either befriends or battles various tribes of Scholars, Religious officials, Tartars, Armored Bears, Gypsy-like people called Gyptians, century old witches and abducted children. As the series progresses, travels to parallel worlds, and meets her male counterpart - a boy named Will, who will help her in countless ways as she continues onward, under edict from the church, pursued by a high assassin who himself has already been absolved of her murder before he commits it,The stakes in this story become incredibly high, with Lyra's constant capture, escape and recapture, and the coming storm of conflict draws people of many races from several worlds, as well as from the ranks of angels, into a war fever-pitched cyclone with Will and Lyra in it's center.Help comes in unexpected forms from other children, angels, lost souls, dragonfly riders, a resourceful anthropologist who befriends the children, and of course giant armored polar bears.This series is dramatic, dark, and stirring. Expect young readers to make favorable comparisons to Harry Potter. If anything, the emotions run higher as the stakes get larger in this series than they do for the young wizards in the Rowling series.For comparison I also offer Lemony Snicket, the Life of Pi, and C.S. Lewis. Admittedly the Narnia books are at the opposite end of the religious spectrum from His Dark Materials, but they are similar in their greatness, drama, and sense of high purpose.Another book that was once commonly handed to young readers is George Orwell's 1984 The anti-authoritarian message in His Dark Materials speaks out against oppression in a very similar manner to Orwell. In Lyra's world, the oppressive (fictional) organization is not a totalitarian government, it's the church. It's a story, and the author can go with it where he wants. In this world, God (actually the primary angel) ends up wearing the rectangular black mustache. It's not wrong, it's just fiction. I would even go so far as to say, in spite of what various church officials say about these books and films, that these books fit on the same shelf with the Narnia books. I think they'll inspire the same quality of thoughtfulness' and feeling.Part of this story - near the end, treats the subject of first love. If a reader has reached this part of the story, they are probably exhausted, because the level of intensity required just to see our main characters through to the end is unparalleled in much of fiction. I bring this up only because there are claims that these books have inappropriate sexual content. I don't believe so.There is no overt sexual content. There are short passages in the end of the series which are open to interpretation, but would likely be interpreted by an adult who already has sexual experience as being about sexual experience. For a younger reader, these scenes would be much more in the realm of hint and intimation. They are scenes about falling in love and enjoying the physical presence of the object of your love, and having strong sensations and feelings associated with that experience. In my opinion this is more healthy for young readers than harmful. More accurate and honest information about the feelings of romance than you'd find if what you knew about sex, you learned from the internet. I'm sure Judy Blume might agree.Organized religions of all stripes will object to this work of fiction, because it paints the church as a horribly corrupted and evil institution, and the 'Authority' that the church worships as malign, controlling and cruel angel, who proclaims himself as God, in the absence of an active or actual God. I say if you are a young reader of dramatic stories, you should just let those organized religion people sweat a little, and read as you see fit. Let them see that you can read stories that scare the heck out of them, and still turn out to be an alright person who can be sensible about your own beliefs and religious faith. They may be scared, but they won't break. Neither will you, or your faith, if you read an enriching fantasy series. It doesn't hurt, if you believe in God, to know that the writer Phillip Pullman doesn't. I don't think anything in these books is intended to change your views or faith, but even if it were, I don't think it could, and I don't think you will notice anything like this in reading these stories.Lastly,The main thing about this series that will stick with you is the ending.It is a fine ending, bright and beautiful, but not a fluffy happy ending. It draws a great deal of emotion from the happenings of the story out to a fitting close, but it also introduces the world in a real, harsh, adult light. Things don't end perfectly, they end with the fierce dictates of fate, and some very real heartache. This is really the \`absolute moment' of the series, deeply emotional, and unforgettable. I have no doubt that any young person reading this series will ever forget this ending. It will scar them. Not in a way that will make them licentious, or atheist, or even resentful of authority. It will scar them in the good way you want children's fiction to mark children - they way that the loss of Old Yeller, or Black Beauty scarred you older readers; the way C.S. Lewis's Prince Caspian marked you, or the fall of Gandalf wounded you as a young reader, giving more reality to the world by shedding some light on Its reality through use of fiction. I can give these books a heart felt recommendation, and say they are destined to become unforgettable classics, you will have to sort out any controversy you encounter - Let your heart race with the contours of the story, not over the anger and upset of critics who don't read the books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I just finished reading this grand trilogy to my kids, aged 8, 10, and 12. My wife ended up sitting in on almost the entire series, and all of us were riveted from Oxford to the World of the Dead and back again. These books are incredibly ambitious: they set out to stitch together a religio-political history of the multiverse with deep, informed reference to physics, religious history, adolescent psychology, Nietzschean heroism, etc. etc. etc. The result, as I read it, is one of the most compelling indictments of church and state ever written for a broad audience. Author Philip Pullman concludes, without didactic hamfistedness, that the first purpose of churches and governments is self-perpetuation through maintaining the ignorance of their adherents and citizens. The greatest wisdom and joy, in Pullman's worlds, comes of full, mortal, bodily engagement with the physical world per se: with domestic comforts, food, sex, art, aesthetic involvement, work well done, craft, cleverness, etc. The well-earned consciousness of a human adult, earned through Blakean experience, is the crowning moment of all creation. Antithetical to this wisdom and consciousness is dogmatic narowness, asceticism, monasticism, self-denial, narrowness of experience.That this idea is dramatized through the adventure stories of children is remarkable. One could do worse than to say that the weakness of fictional biography is its narrowness, its dependence on the particular, the local, the kind of detail that is very difficult to universalize or even generalize. And the weakness of allegory is its didactic tendency, its broad-stroke enmity to personal meaningfulness except in the most abstract terms. What Pullman has done is to weave a sharp, poignantly-rendered, intimate set of psychological dramas into grand, almost scriptural allegory. As though Charles Dickens were setting Tiny Tim against the backdrop of the Old Testament. In this way, which should not be attempted by lesser writers, the touchingly naive and personal actions of a 12-year-old girl take on universal importance. Every minor petulance, every petty preference, every whim shakes creation. In this setting, in which cataclysm feels immanent and everything hangs in pre-apocalyptic balance, our little heroin's encounter with God himself feels simply a natural step in the narrative. How Pullman pulls this off, I don't know. By all rights this should be embarrassing, overblown stuff, but it isn't. It is emotionally raw, heartbreaking, and lovely. Just like life.I highly recommend these books for children with good vocabulary and their fixed-Daemon authority figures."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think it's interesting how people come here and say this series of books isn't for children because of its anti-Christian message. Following such logic to its fullest would mean that The Chronicles of Narnia or Pilgrim's Progress are equally not for children due to their obvious pro-Christian message. Aren't they just as guilty in their attempts to indoctrinate children with Christian beliefs? What these people really mean is that you shouldn't let your children read this series if you don't want them exposed to alternative ideologies that might compromise your agenda of indoctrination. However, if you are a parent who is interested in instilling critical thinking skills into your children, then by all means buy this series, read it together, discuss it, then let them decide for themselves what they are going to believe."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This tale gripped me immediately as an exciting adventure story built around the remarkable Lyra, a young heroine so simultaneously splendid and rough... her naive, emerging femininity so credibly balanced by innate wisdom and clear seeing... so instinctively cautious and yet so capable of recklessness... so able to apply and also withstand her own self-criticism... so much the daughter every man's soul dreams of. Later in the story we meet Will, who embodies all the complementary mythic heroism we would ever want to see in a son... but painted into a surprisingly believable picture of a normally conflicted 12 year old boy from the 21st century.I suppose the most enduring theme and the basis for the subtle beauty of this work lies in the exquisite psychological BALANCE that is found everywhere... although not obviously or early on in most cases. Opponents are ultimately balanced to one another in the endless struggling, but the outcomes are sometimes tragic and often disappointing as they are in life. Slowly we see and eventually come to trust that tools and weapons are perfectly soul-balanced and psychologically suited to their possessors. Still, we are never quite sure how the fight will go.This is a dangerous story to read with kids in some ways because the child characters are so powerful and allowed so much sovereignty... and yet that is precisely how it captures and holds any reader Lyra's age or older. All together, the dizzying array of characters comprise a pantheon... a mythological representation of one whole human individual... and of his or her endless battle, first to know then achieve a degree of benevolent mastery over him or her SELF. It's the story of dawn of creation... the falling away of innocence... the ascent... the purifying struggle... and the mysterious subtle marriage of opposites in which the Self is finally discovered and ultimately \\"redeemed\\"... but probably not in the way you'd expect. Thank you Mr. Pullman, for a wonderful tale. My hat's off to you, sir!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Dark Materials great fantasy read...unconventional, great characters, and quite a bit of sci-fi mixed in with the magic"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Could not put this book down, as soon as finished #1 had to read #2. Spouse was reading also so i had to read as fast as I could. Was sorry when had finished the trilogy. Great book, now daughter and granddaughter are enthrawled. Will keep this and read it again."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have to laugh at the warnings on there that this series is anti-god. Sure, you could equate the bad guys with god and his followers, but so what? It was an alternate universe. It was interesting and thought provoking and I wept at the end. It's called fantasy for a reason."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books left me breathless. Rarely can you read something with as well-realised world (even worlds) as this one.We start in a kind of Victorian Oxford in a world were people have damons - which, while being separate, are a part of human being (it's too hard to explain this in several words, but it's not very comlicated, really). Our heroine is Lyra - a small girl, who will soon go on a great journey. Though it may sound like a kiddie book it is NOT. The book is mature in tone (espesially in later volumes) and may be not suitable for younger kids. For example, there is a scene where a bear catches and eats a seal. While not graphic, it's not something you'll often find in a book for children.One of the strongest points of the trilogy is that it doesn't follow standard structure. For example, we won't meet some of the main characters untill the second book, and the third volume also holds enough surprises and new characters.The books not only give us a wonderful universe, but also raise some questions, including religion and church which make some of the readers brand the books as anti-christian. In my opinion, this is not the case. Then again, if you consider books about Inqusition or \\"DaVinci Code\\" a threat to your fate, then you won't like this one. But, really, you should try to change your viewpoint, 'cause you will be missing a lot!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"OK, so my kid is reading the trilogy, and keeps insisting that I read it too. So I picked up the first book.Book 1 is GREAT. It ends in a cliffhanger.Book 2 is pretty good. It never resolves the cliffhanger, just makes the cliff higher and the hang-iness more suspenseful.Then comes Book 3 -- long, confusing, and MISSING THE CRITICAL PAGES THAT PRESUMABLY RESOLVE THE CLIFFHANGER FROM BOOKS 1 & 2.So I read over 1,000 pages and get ... no satisfaction..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved the trilogy!

It's a very deep investigation into the nature of reality, presented in a very easy-to-follow manner. Excellent!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The authors theistic fantasy reminds me of some of form of Gnosticism, in which the immediate God, who has the dominion over earth, is evil, and less powerful than the original creator, a Super-God. Of course in this case the \\"Super-God\\" has a pantheistic, impersonal nature, it is the dust who created the tyrannical angel who called himself \\"God\\"The author injects a lot of supernatural in his story like \\"witches\\", \\"demons\\", \\"angels\\", \\"spirits\\". By doing that he suggests that the evil of the personal Godhood stems on the ethical, rather than just epistemological grounds. Thus even if Personal God, existed ,and every word written in the Bible were true, it wouldn't deserved to be worshiped more than any other tyrant. In fact the whole process of worshiping, that denotes a process of slave-like submission, it is unethical in its nature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first read these books several years ago, when my sister purchased the set for my son. Immediately read one right after the other, very engaging and well written fantasy. Very sad when the series ended, I felt like I had lost a good friend. Read the series more than once now - highly recommended for adults young and older alike."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have been so happy with my purchase of these three books at such a great price. I would definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels to purchase this boxed set, especially when the three books bought together are cheaper than buying just one at the bookstore.I haven't been able to put a book down since beginning the novels and can't wait to read them over again."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I wish I could give this zero stars. My daughter gave me this book to read. I started reading it and was instantly sucked in. It's very well written and the character is very likeable. Then I started reading reviews and interviews with the author, who says \\"My book is about killing God\\". The enemy in these books is God, the premise that in the war for Heaven the wrong side won....that God is a power hungry senile jerk....I will not finish this series. I think I'll go re-read the Narnia books now."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't even know where to begin. Just keep your children away from these books.

Research this author and his beliefs before buying this. This book may be fine for adults to read, but impressionable young people should not read it without adult supervision. Thankfully, I was warned ahead of time and researched this author before my children had a chance to read it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I actually read this trilogy THE same semester I took a course Milton. An acquaintance made the recommendation in a completely unrelated encounter. I even assumed the title and opening quotes were a matter of pretense or homage or something silly. Well, how wrong I was! Such a scatterbrain, I! There is method in Pullman's... okay, wrong bard.Any rate...Quite a bit going on here. I have some issues (naphtha? give me a break Pullman, could you USE a more Edenic word for \\"oil\\"? pearls before swine...) but on the whole a captivating read. If you happen to be an easily-scandalized, fundamentalist Christian, DON'T BOTHER, as you'll wet yourself reading and then tell your pastor about it. Milton, as Puritanical as he was, would be sick with your lot (yeah, read \\"Areopagitica\\" and tell ME about censorship). Otherwise, whatever age you might be, you'll come away with more than you left with......Like thinking Lyra every time you read of \\"immortal Eve.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As an avid reader, a Christian, AND a Harry Potter fan, I was deeply insulted by these books. I can deal with fantasy worlds, and I am, in fact, a great fan of fantasy works. I can deal with fantasy works that have different gods than mine, but Mr. Pullman does no more with these books than to use them as a vehicle to attack Christianity. I suppose I should not be surprised since people have been attacking Christianity for two thousand years. He promotes all the old lies, such as our goodness and works are better than Grace, and that if we just muster up enough goodness and work hard enough, then we can establish heaven on earth. I read these since I am a teacher always looking for books that I think my junior high students will like. They have also won several awards, so I was thinking that they might be interesting. I was so wrong. These books were a not-so-subtle attempt at brainwashing. If Mr. Pullman could have left off his attacks on Christianity and all religions in general, they would have been fun, exciting adventure stories. His attacks, however, went too far, and I have advised our librarian to remove them from the shelves. There is too much really decent literature of all types out there that is not insulting or offensive to submit kids to the rantings contained in this trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although this book targets children as its audience, it is not appropriate for kids. Parents please look into what your children are reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This movie/book series is anti-Christ. If you're planning on your children reading these books or seeing the movie, it's against God and Christianity beliefs so if you're planning on your children to go ahead and read this and watch the movie, plan on discussing the issues."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A film called \\"The Golden Compass\\" opens December 7. It is based on the first book of a trilogy titled His Dark Materials. The author of this children's fantasy is Philip Pullman, a noted English atheist. It is his objective to bash Christianity and promote atheism. To kids. \\"The Golden Compass\\" is a film version of the book by that name, and it is being toned down so that Catholics, as well as Protestants, are not enraged.The second book of the trilogy, The Subtle Knife, is more overt in its hatred of Christianity than the first book, and the third entry, The Amber Spyglass, is even more blatant. Because \\"The Golden Compass\\" is based on the least offensive of the three books, and because it is being further watered down for the big screen, some might wonder why parents should be wary of the film.The Catholic League wants Christians to stay away from this movie precisely because it knows that the film is bait for the books: unsuspecting parents who take their children to see the movie may be impelled to buy the three books as a Christmas present. And no parent who wants to bring their children up in the faith will want any part of these books.\\"The Golden Compass: Agenda Unmasked\\" is the Catholic League's response. It provides information about the film, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" and details what book reviewers have said about Pullman's books; a synopsis of his trilogy is also included."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I feel like I've been mugged. Seriously, these books were a scandal, and they have caused me pain that I never want to feel again. I will admit that I wanted Will and Lyra to fall in love, but not 50 pages too soon. Such a struggle to read through... such agony... By the end of this saga, I didn't care. I had trouble remembering why I loved The Golden Compass. I have forgotten the mastery of The Subtle Knife. Indifference. pure horrible indifference. The worst pain of all!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, did I mention blah? If I'd wanted to read Phillip Pullmans dumb musings about his perceptions on God and religion then I would have looked them up. I thought that I was buying a fantasy novel and was very disapointed when I found out it was just his little outlet for his mental constipation he was having. I am annoyed that Mr. Pullman managed to waste so much of my time. In addition, all pathetic athiest dogma aside, this is NOT a book for children. Even if it had no alterior motives, there is some sexuality and violence in these books that is not for kids. Nor adults for that matter. Anyway. Waste of time, waste of money."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To all the Christians who believe that this is a heretic book, I would ask you to please look a little closer and realize that the God in the story does not model the God of our religion. Rather, like Plato's Republic, it is a demonstration of the weakness of an idea. This book shows us that deities are in no way physically alike or connected to mortal beings and, in fact, shows us God's transcendence of our reality. Phillip Pullman is an intellectual person who takes time to think about his beliefs rather than going along with everyone else."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"From the beginning Philip Pulmen was astonishing. From when Lyra met Will and became friends till their sad separation. I find that it is a simple charming book and should be kept reading forever and years to come.

The story is amazing, the plot immersive and spectacular, he combines the both with heart a warming charm, if only more people could write stories like this.I am, however, quite annoyed at the publisher's for changing the name of the first book. 'Northern Lights' as it is called in the UK is a lot more apt considering the nature of the story, than the Golden Compass! What's that all about? The Alethiometer, which i'm assuming is what they are refering to is not a compass, it is something completely different. The fact that it looks vaguely like a compass is not the point, IT ISN'T A COMPASS and shouldn't be called such.Why then have you changed the name? What was the point, why not call it Northern Lights'? I hope Philip Pullman was equally disgusted with the name change as i am. Thankyou very much."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed this trilogy immensely. This definitely isn't the usual tired 'swords & wizards' fantasy. It reads more like old-fashioned science fiction, with alternate worlds, alien beings and worlds almost like our own. It is wonderfully written. There are so many wonderful, densely portrayed characters worlds, it is just captivating.The reason this series got only 4 stars is that I had some problems with it. First, in some parts there is so much going on that the reader gets lost. Too many minor characters, dead ends, red herrings. Then there's the part about \\"killing God.\\" This provoked a \\"you've got to be kidding' reaction from me. It was just so 'over the top'. Why does all fantasy have to be about universe-shaking events? The more overblown the storyline got, the more my attention began to wander. And what really irritated me was that the same old religious tropes are being recycled after all: prophecies about a miracle child who will save the universe, a replay of the Garden of Eden. We are being preached at, by the author who wants to tell us that the love of two young folks will save the universe from disintegration. How come everyone has to preach a sermon to me? Mostly what I want from a book is engaging characters, an interesting plot and an escape from mundane reality. Yes, this series did offer all of that.

It struck me at once that it must be referring to God, (or some cosmic force) for who else could be referred to in such a vague fashion, the lone pronoun. The point that sealed my fate as for the reading of these books was the implication of God posessing something dark, seemingly quite a stark contradiction. My interest was piqued. I let the title nag at the edge of my mind for a few weeks before I actually picked up a copy. I wasn't dissapointed. The feeling I was left with after finishing the series was that I had truly stumbled upon a treasure, and in retrospect I found it hard to believe anyone could just walk into a local wal-mart and get a copy of their own.To sum it up: A masterpiece by Pullman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love this book series! the first book was kind of hard to get through because it was longer than i'm accustomed to,but it's fascinating! a real sci-fi meets fantasy thriller/adventure series! you quickly fall in love with lyra and pan and then learn to love and cherish will who becomes their best friend in the subtle knife. their epic tale of mystery, betrayal, adventure, friendship and heroism trascends worlds and genres. A must read!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is wonderful. It is set in a world not unlike our world. The theories behind the book's story are based in science. There are some fasinating thoughts on religion in this book if you think hard enough to realize they are there.The end of the book is a bit sad. It made me want to cry. I do think it was worth reading. I did enjoy it overall. I recomend it to all of my friends. If you liked Harry Potter but wanted something stronger you must get this book. If you like Lemony Snicket but wanted something older like then this is your book.This book is geared more towards the older child. The story is a bit strong. There are scary parts and sad parts. This is one of the things that makes it good. It also makes it something you would not want your seven year old to attempt to read.The way the story is written makes the words melt on your mouth. The details in the plot make your mind run. It will give you something to discuss for hours with another who has read it. I would recomend it for a book club that has open minded members willing to discuss it throughly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one top banana book, yes, at the end there is romance, but it is so well fitted into the story, you are conviced it is real. it is so well written you drawn into a world of daemons, spectres, witches. Oh, this is pure masterpice.i'm 13."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy starts off tranquilly enough, by introducing a young girl that you are not sure that you actually like all that much. The tale takes off from there, however, as Lyra is gradually sucked into a whirlwind of events from kidnappers to soul-stealers to a battle against heaven.The first question to enter my mind after finishing this trilogy was \\"how is this a children's book?\\" Other than the main characters being two pre-teens, I did not see how these books offered more to children than adults. The major themes are heavy indeed, from God and consciousness to the discovery that intentions, good or bad, often have unforeseen consequences. While the more metaphysical aspects of the story may pass by the younger reader this dazzling tale offers much to young and old a like. The adult characters are inherently flawed (which makes them believable) and the children, though flawed themselves, have powers that help them achieve their great purpose. Interestingly enough, their strength lies in the very fact that they are children, Lyra's penchant for lying gets her out of many a scrape and her unknowing state of grace provides her with the ability to see truth. It is their unconsciousness that allows these children to do what no others can. Pullman has invented characters from Lyra and Will to Iorek Brynison (an armored bear) and Serfina Pekkala (a witch) that leap off the page and will live in the hearts of readers everywhere.Admittedly, this story has much that would disturb certain people, mainly issues such as the sexuality of children, the fallibility of the \\"Church,\\" the corruption of the kingdom of heaven as well as violence and homosexuality. If you are more open-minded and are ready to be entertained by this amazing tapestry of unique ideas and unforgettable characters, I recommend that you pick up a copy of these books.As for the Harry Potter comparison that everyone is so eager to make, other than the two series both being written by British authors catering to a generally younger audience about amazing events, they truly stand on their own having nothing in common, though (in my opinion) both stand as exemplars of the finest of storytelling."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book is wonderful and gripping. The second book feels like filler: just a bridge between acts. The third book is OK as a wrap-up, but it feels exactly like one.SPOILER ALERTFankly, I can't see what the religious furor is about. In particular, in the third book makes it very clear that the God being fought is not a/the creator. There are even examples of complex skill sets being imparted by \\"grace\\" of an undefined higher power. This is not an indictment of religion as much as it is of the inevitable corruption of churches.And it's pretty spot on on that one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman is a gift for those who enjoy reading fantasy but are also readers of philosophy and science. I suppose Pullman is more interested in creating and peopling other worlds, but he is, nonetheless, adding his bit, however much leavened by a wonderfully imaginative tale, to the prestigious work of thinkers including the humanists Voltaire and Rabelais (who also wrote some very entertaining stuff).The scientific possibilities, parallel universes, e.g., he makes a part of his work are part of the scientific dialogues presently being considered in actual scientific circles.Thanks, Mr. Pullman, I wish there were more thinking writers like you shedding some light in thisvery murky world of ours."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman fires a provocative shot across the bows of the religious right with his fantasy story of Lyra's quest. She wanders between parallel worlds, each different to 'our' earth in sometimes subtle ways, but all permeated by a pervasive dark matter \\"Dust\\". In some worlds, the church labels this Original Sin, in others an Inquisition does its divine work; all the while secularists and atheists recognise it as little more than a manifestation of collective human intent. The flow of this matter between worlds is a destabilising influence that must be stemmed, hence Lyra inevitably finds herself embroiled in a thinly veiled Revelations scenario that pays homage to CS Lewis' Last Battle. Witches, talking warrior bears, angels and a hero braver than Frodo Baggins (and more fallible) lead us through this rollicking tale that will be hidden from children in places where theories like Intelligent Design are not dismissed as nonsense. Had he similarly creative genius, this is the kind of story Richard Dawkins would have written for his grandchildren."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"i loved this, and zipped right thru it. i would say it is 100 percent suited for adults, and even though i don't like fantasy i liked this. i found it a little sexist, but not more than other books for teens, and i appreciated the anti-narnia ideas. mostly, tho, it is just interesting and well-written."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this series, though I am certain I still don't completely grasps its intracies or the ultimate moral, if there is one. May I caution religious readers that this book may pass a few boundaries, and though it is for young adult readers, it may be troublesome to young readers, more so than Harry Potter. Some imagery left me thinking of nightmarish things, and I'm not religious or young. This said, however, like Milton, I feel that everyone should read this series, for all the parallels it draws, all the metaphors it makes and all the feelings it stirs. I'm very glad I read it, and I think that it will stick with me for some time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read and loved all the Harry Potter books, and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, and I have to say, Pullman surpasses them all. With effortless grace and an amazing imagination, Pullman essentially re-tells the story of the fall of man through the characters of two utterly real, conflicted and all too human children, Lyra and Will. They are pitted against dark forces, but are given some astonishing helpmates and tools with which to fight a battle for nothing less than the souls of all humanity. Assisted by Daemons and Angels, Lyra and Will seek the answer to a puzzling mystery - what is \\"Dust\\", and why is it spilling out of the universe? Pursued by some very determined and evil adults, Lyra and Will meet armored bears, flying explorers, and witches in their travels through parallel worlds to find the answer and elude their persecutors. Dark, richly imagined, occasionally terrifying, Pullman is a breathtaking storyteller. Young adults will love the fantastic creatures and situations Lyra and Will must surmount, and adults will get a kick out of references to Milton's Paradise Lost, and Dante's Divine Comedy. Young or old, this is a brilliant series of books best read in one juicy gulp."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book was great, with engaging characters, and an interesting alternative world to ours, in which every human has a daemon, an animal of the opposite sex who is the person's best friend and dearest love throughout life. I enjoyed Lyra's adventure to travel north to rescue her friend Roger, kidnapped by evil forces experimenting with separating children from their daemons to unleash and use powerful energies.The second book was also enjoyable, introducing Will, a boy from our world, the epic hero in the making who is worthy of acquiring a weapon that lets him travel among the myriad alternative worlds. He and Lyra become friends and travel together to find their fathers.The third book became silly, and was a let-down. All through the first two books, religion was an enemy force, but few details are given as to how it became such an enemy, nor specifics on what it promoted. I surmise that the Church suppressed the free expression of sexuality, and this is what made it evil. In the third book, all is explained. I did not like that Pullman recreated the ancient Greek Hades as the grey, listless underworld where the souls of the dead linger in boredom for all eternity. The souls of the dead are presented as being blissfully happy at being released to the world above only to dissipate as individual beings, rapturous at the opportunity to lose their identity and feed plants. Although they are presented as being disembodied souls, they dissipate into atoms that float up into space, meeting their daemons there, who have been waiting since their death there, and after a few seconds of a happpy reunion, both dissolve into nothingness. I personally believe in heaven after we die, and find the prospect of our individual sould living there with God and other souls forever much more nourishing and even believable.There is much too much emphasis on sex. There is nothing explicit, nothing objectionable on those grounds, but the union of male and female is depicted as being what gives meaning to life, nay, the entire universe resonates to the blissful sexual union of male and female, and it is only that which permits the natural elements to do what they are called upon to do. The sea, the wind, the trees in the forest, only exist on the foundation of human sexual union. That of Will and Lyra is what saves their worlds and permits the vitiated natural elements to recover their lost vigor and health.The depiction of the ideal society of the mulefa, mini-elephants that require seed-pods from a tree to wheel around on, is rendered at great length. Every aspect of their society is held up for admiration, and I really didn't see the point. The homosexual angel pair which helps Will and Lyra, is inferior to humans, and envies us our physical presence on earth, our strength, our senses, our potency.The children do not kill \\"God,\\" he is so old and decrepit that when he emerges from his box he dissipates on the wind. \\"God\\"'s evil regent, the Metatron, is the character responsible for the iron grip the Church has on humanity, but is depicted as a lecherous, murderous old man, whom Lyra's parents kill. They are only able to do so, though, by their cooperating with each other, again, the sacred union of male and female can accomplish anything.I frankly cannot see why the Catholic Church objected so strongly to this trilogy. It is fatuous and silly, but its depiction of religion is so distant from reality that I don't see how anyone could take it seriously. And no one older than fifteen years old could worship sexual union as the foundation of the universe."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The books are great, and bear repeat readings through childhood and into adulthood, as the books appeal in some way to most ages. I have to say, however, that I really think reviewers should actually read books completely and thoroughly before opening their mouths or typing on the computer screen. The VAST majority of \\"plot holes\\" are easily cleared up if you don't skim while reading. For example, one I saw was a complaint about Lyra tricking the king of the bears when bears are un-trickable. First of all, she's the hero of the story, of course she's got to have some talent, and as it happens sneakiness is her's. Secondly, the author makes a HUGE point of how the king of the bears wants to be a human, and therefore trickable. Or that Mary was not the \\"snake\\" that tempted Lyra, or \\"Eve\\". Well, she was, and it was more obvious before it was OH YEAH, CENSORED BECAUSE IT SUGGESTED THAT GIRLS SOMETIMES HAVE FEELINGS OF LOVE AND ROMANCE (and it didn't even mention sex involving children once, thanks for freaking out everyone needlessly, skimmers). Also Mary gave them the \\"red fruit\\" that they shared when they realized they loved each other, but whatever, I digress. Nearly every plot hole I saw reviewed was due to poor reading on the part of the reviewer. I've read the books many times and know that it can be easy to miss things, so don't be nit-picky on your first reading. As for the anti-Christian nonsense, or saying that the author shouldn't write about Christian ideas because he's an atheist, I think that's just crazy. His ideas are based on symbolism and if you read it with and OPEN MIND you can see that those ideas can apply to many faith or non-faith concepts. As for not being allowed to write about something you don't personally believe in literally, well, I guess only schizophrenics should get to write fantasy then. Anyways, great fantasy with much to be gained at any age. My favorite series by virtue of the adventure, the wonderful characters, and later on in my life the intricate symbolism gave me imagery to understand my own spiritual beliefs."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Good quality, and great books to have it at home, and after you done with it will looks great in your bookshelf, until your next generation would be able to enjoy it too."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like the title of the series, very dark. I would compare this to being the darker version of the Chronicles of Narnia, perhaps even the prequal to the Mist series/games. But full of adventure, and much more female oriented."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"i totally agree with people when they say about the religious ideas of this series. i mean i do have to give credit to the author this is really a spell bounding series even if i thought the ending was too sad. i'm 13 and felt offended by the aethesist ideas in this book so not everybody is ok with it. if that doesn't bother you than your really enjoy the series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Why is so much fiction in print full of bad writing? At some point, plot, characters, and imagination cease to be important. The glaring fault of this book is the writing itself - dull, flat, colorless. Philip Pullman, like so many other big authors of today, has absolutely no grasp of the power and beauty of the English language. His style lacks flow, ease, and grace. My opinion? Skip this series. The story isn't worth the poor writing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS.'His Dark Materials' turns the Christian view of the world upside-down. 'God' is actually an evil, controlling spiritual being/angel who Pullman calls 'The Authority'. Get it? Authority is bad. God is bad. The Church is bad. Eve's 'sin' was actually not a sin at all. She was 'tempted' to 'freedom' by a good spirit who appeared as a serpent. 'Freedom' is good. 'Sin' is good. I don't usually use so many 'scare quotes', but Pullman chooses a moral orientation for these books which is almost entirely contrary to classical Christianity. I hate that teens and kids are getting this totally slanted view reading these 'Young Adult' books.I'm not suggesting that Pullman has an anti-Christian agenda. But the worldview of these books is strongly anti-Christian, at any rate. In some ways, the results might be worse, since the 'values' are so subtle.I'll be the first to admit, the Church has done a lot of bad things. I'd agree with most of Pullman's examples. But his presentation of God/the Church/Christianity is a caricature. He presents none of the good things. I hope Pullman just doesn't know. Otherwise, his selective use of information is misrepresentation.We need to criticize the Church when there is evil in it, or even wrong-doing. But to caricature the Church as all evil and all wrong is false. It amounts to propaganda before unformed young minds.Pullman takes the common tack these days of coming up with supernatural providence that is bigger than us, but smaller than God. His device is that 'dark matter' (thus 'His Dark Materials') is conscious and good. It's not much different from Lucas' 'midichlorians' in 'The Phantom Menace'. GK Chesterton said 'It's not that atheists don't believe anything, it's that they'll believe anything.'I read this story all the way through to the end, hoping it would improve, hoping against hope that some turn would take place. But it didn't. It got worse. In the end we have 12 year old sex basically functioning in a redemptive way for a whole universe (and maybe all of them, I didn't read it that closely). You've got to be kidding. And this man has children of his own. This must just be his own wish nostalgic adolescent sex-wish coming out. None of us wants our twelve year olds having sex, right?Good story, interesting plot devices, fetching characters...and an infernal worldview. It's not wrong to criticize Christianity or to say you don't believe. But to say everything in Christianity is evil and wrong is false at best, and evil and wrong in itself at worst. The product, at any rate, is inexcusable."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were torture to read. I got through the first one and hoped that the second might pick up and be better. Wrong! I don't even want to read the third because I'd rather spend my time doing something else like sorting my sock drawer.On the same level as Harry Potter? I think not!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did enjoy the first book of the trilogy but as I read the other books I bacame more and more upset that this series should be found in the children's section of a bookstore. Most fantasy books for children do not directly denounce, or promote a god found in modern religions. This series did and did so blatantly.For children from religions where there is a belief in a good and loving god, this series can be very troubling and frightening. I would not recommend this series to anyone under high-school age and even then I would be hesitant.I have seen this series compared to C.S. Lewis. As far a children's literature goes, His Dark Materials trilogy does not hold a candle to the Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe series.If you are looking for good children's fantasy literature, look elsewhere. This series is sure to trouble and disappoint young readers."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The author is obviously talented and it's a shame that the thrust of the trilogy was to try to denounce God's existence and authority. In the first book, the author takes a section of chapter 3 in Genesis, adds a few lines of his own and presents it as a direct quote. The second novel denounces God and his place by name and goes to great effort to do so while skillfully weaving this within the fantasy of the story line. The third book states \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" This was quoted by a character, ironically named Mary, who denounced her faith in God and became a physicist specializing in \\"shadow particles\\". Her character concluded that there was no God and that physics was much more interesting. Portions of the story could have been a wonderful tale and did not need to utilize atheistic theology or undermine faith in God. It presents the Kingdom of God as a tyrannical place that denounces freedom and real thought. The thrust of the books was to overthrow the Kingdom and make it a republic. God was presented as a weak, old deceiver -- an angel claiming to be creator hiding behind the tyranny and hypocrisy of his churches. The main characters were to aid the rebel angels in a new battle, thus creating a republic that would let free thought reign and put them in complete charge of their own destinies. God was unnecessary. I am still trying to determine how this could be considered such good reading material for children.One caveat that I would like to add is that this is NOT an epic story on good versus evil where this time the other side wins. This author lets the reader get interested in a character and at the end of the first book starts in on a direct battle with God. But then he gives it minimal effort as to why this is a battle, why there is such a vicious attack on the validity of God's very person, and then lamely says that it's the \\"life stories\\" that are most relevant. He tries to completely nullify good and evil and then doesn't provide a clear-cut battle ground or resolution. For an author so capable of depicting the feelings of his characters and making them seem personal, this was beneath his talent and seemed more a venue for expressing his contempt for God and wrapping it around the facade of a children's story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Why the low rating? A few observations in Q &amp; A format:1. &quot;On purely aesthetic grounds, is this a truly great example of Fantasy Literature?&quot;YES. Considering the beauty, detail, and believibility of the fantasy worlds Pullman creats, and the skill with which he weaves them together, this is certainly on a par with Tolkein or Frank Herbert's Dune books, and I would rank it above the Narnia or Harry Potter books (though that last might provoke some dissent....)2. &quot;By the traditional standards of any 'Abrahamic' religion (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), is this a blasphemous work?&quot;YES, most definitely.3. &quot;Besides the blasphemy, are there other elements antithical to those religious traditions?&quot;TO NAME A FEW: hostility towards organized religion, towards the marraige bond, and towards the notion of a fixed morality. Favorable portayal of fortune-telling techniques as a guide to decision-making.4. &quot;You must admit, though, that the book raises some interesting philosophical issues. Does it do a good job of resolving them?&quot;I THINK NOT. I don't want to get into specific plot elements here, so as not to spoil the ending for anyone who does decide to read the book. Let's just say that--having thrown off the yoke of divinely inspired morality--the main characters are then confronted with an ethical dilemma that a child of 6 could solve. Their success in solving it is hailed as a triumph of the human spirit. If Pullman wants to show how we can get along without a divinely-provided code of conduct he'll have to do a lot better.5. &quot;But you said the book was beautifully written. Doesn't that count for something?IT COUNTS NEGATIVELY. As C. S. Lewis said, you don't get devils from fallen sparrows, but from fallen archangels. While I don't share Lewis's (and apparently Pullman's) belief in an independent Devil, I would agree that when great gifts are turned to a foul purpose, they only serve to make the offence worse."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story of Lyra and Will and their attemptsto understand the universe and its nature is fun and gripping.Pullman's ability to evoke realistic worlds and images isamazing. His characters, on the whole, are interesting andcompelling, and his creativity is second to none. The booksattempt to deal with the great themes of philosophic and theologicalthought: the nature of evil, the nature of redemption, thepower of love, loyalty, the consequences of our actions andchoices, etc. However, the overall messageis fatally marred by what can only be described as thepersonal blind spot of the author himself.It becomes clear in The Golden Compass that Pullman equatesthe Catholic Church, and Christianity in general, with thevery _essence_ of evil and power-grubbing authoritarianism. And nearthe end of the Amber Spyglass he has declared, unambiguously,that there is no God and that Christianity is a compelling buterroneous belief. He describesan institutional Church that, apparently, preaches hatred, intolerance,torture, and fananticism. Interestinglyenough, however, every _other_ religious worldview presented (secular humanism, Deism,Scientism, Shamanism, agnosticism, paganism, pragmatism, and a watered-down form of Buddhism)is seen as worthy. All beliefs about the world are shown to be valid andhonorable..._except_ Christianity (and Catholicism in particular).The incredible narrowness of the author's expressedhatred of Christianity may well be, as some reviewers have suggested, a personalthing. But the very zealotry that he seems to display in his hatredof Christianity is the very _essence_ of what his protagonists profess tohate about the Catholic church...their intolerance, their inabilityto see beyond their own closely-held worldview, the \\"rightness\\" oftheir point of view versus everyone else's, etc.I don't believe this book tries to \\"take down\\" Christianity per se,although one could argue that Pullman tries to do just that. ButI believe because of Mr. Pullman's own confused moral sense andbigotry, the books seem to show an incredibly lopsided view of what the universelooks like. Lying, cheating, killing are all fine and have no long-termconsequences, according to Pullman, if the ends are worthy enough; you don'teven have to regret the wrongs you to do others along the way.Morals are all relative, and all philosophies of the nature of life arefine, just as long as they aren't Catholic.Deep truths abound in these books, but they always seem just out of reachof its author, and thus, out of reach of the reader. We never seem to knowwhat the point of the journey was, unless it was just the fun of the ride.But this moral confusion and undisguised bias against all things Christiantakes what _could_ have been a great trilogy...even a saga of the magnitudeand scope of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and reduces it to a moral muddle.What a shame."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"SOOOO not for kids. There may be deeper meaning and all that, but children will read what is written: a story about kids' and parents' worst nightmares - children being kidnapped, tortured and murdered. This book is being compared to books that are read by kids in junior high or high school for its controversial undertones and even openly stated iconoclast ideas. Promote it for that audience and purpose, and I am OK with that. I don't care about the religious aspects, but don't want my child reading about castration in a \\"children's\\" book. I also didn't like the writing (sorry everyone) and the ending didn't follow through on the storyline. This book is OK to read along other philosophical works and would probably be great for such discussions about religion, life/death, politics, etc., but is not an outright fantasy as it has been publicized to be - on the surface it is just plain creepy. Blech!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"it was not a nice surprise that I have 2 books that have same intend but differant name."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is perhaps THE best fantasy ever written! It manages to be completely original, while nonetheless following the standard heroic archetypes of its genre!'Lord of the Rings', which has been called 'the best book of the 20th century', pales in comparison to this.I like the concept of daemons- everyone is born with a daemon, a physical representation of the soul, and the daemon is, most of the time, of the opposite gender of the person whose daemon it is. And if human and daemon are seperated, the human will resemble the living dead!Pretty cool, huh?If you enjoy that concept, you will love these books.The first book, the golden compass, is so suspenseful and enchanting that I read it twice!Right now, I'm reading it out loud to my family and they love it!But I'll stop with my insane ranting for just a minute to explain the plot:When Lyra sees the master of Jordan College slip poison into a glass of tokay that was poured for her uncle, the enigmatic and powerful Lord Asriel Belacqua, she warns him. He spills the wine, makes it look like an accident, and THAT is where the story begins.I can say no more of substance, so I shall continue with my insane ranting:I hear there's a movie scheduled for 2005 based on 'Golden Compass'. I hope those people at new line cinema write the script soon, and pray they do a good job of it!WARNING: This book contains references to blood and gore and underage smoking.

Good aren't they? Oh, apart from that one of Stelmaria for chapter 21 of Northern Lights/The Golden Compass. That's rubbish.I quite envy you these covers actually, they're really nice..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Due to misuse of the Subtle knife by its creators and subsequent bearers, Dust is leaking from one world to another. And due to the abyss that was created from Lord Asriel's campaign against the Authority, all the worlds' Dust is in danger of passing into oblivion, destroying all conscious life. To stop this from happening, all of the windows, created with the Subtle Knife, in all the worlds, must be closed.The lovers, Lyra and Will, reluctantly accept that this has to be, and that they will be parted from each other for the rest of their lives in their own worlds where they and their daemons can enjoy a long life. But, as a compromise, the window that was created from the world of the Dead into the world of the Mulefa can be left open so that, like the ghosts that Lyra and Will have set free, they, too, will someday be re-united.There is quite a lot in the Amber Spyglass and its precursors to criticise. Mostly this would be to do with logical clarity and consistency from one book to the next, and the ever present misuse of mixed viewpoint. But would the nephews really notice these details.Probably not. And this is because they would be unlikely to persevere with a set of titles that really need to be considered as one long twelve hundred page book in order to get a hang of the inter-relationships. Simply skimming the action highlights wouldn't be recommended, since many of the highlights are only relevant when a subtle tie in from somewhere else is applied. Skimming would mean that they would miss a lot of the story's goodness. Compounding the problem is the schematic quality of many of the techno-thoecratic details that are also slightly contradictory, which, to the more experienced eye gives the impression of window dressing, they being too vague to spend the time on to make satisfactory sense of.All that aside, I did enjoy the three books overall. Philip Pullman's writing is very consistent in quality from the start of The Golden Compass to the end of The Amber Spyglass. But he could have spared the reader so much use of \`which' and \`too'. And he should have spent more time on clarity and less on a cast of thousands.The Dark Materials set is worth reading, but readers shouldn't beat themselves up about any misunderstanding of the inner detail.As for the nephews, I'll be recommending J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and C. J. Cherryh's The Paladin and The Goblin Mirror."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The \\"His Dark Materials Trilogy\\"....ahh, where do I begin? These books are outstanding. They are #2 on my list of favorite books (no one can beat Harry Potter- not even Lyra and Will!). The first is incredible, the second astounding, and the third is utterly amazing. Whenever I read these, I am taken into the world (or worlds) of Will and Lyra. When I stop reading (which only happens if I desperately need to sleep, eat etc.) I am left craving more.Many people have denounced these books for religious reasons. I am Christian, and I admit that I was alarmed by the anti-God views in this book. But I believe that it is fully acceptable to read something you don't believe. Just because I read these books doesn't mean I am going to abandon my beliefs for someone else's. This book is a work of fiction, and should be treated as so.In conclusion, I think that Phillip Pullman has done a more than admirable job in writing 3 of the best books in history."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"THE BEST BOOK EVER!A magical atmosphere, a whirlwind adventure, and a heart-wrenching, evocative conclusion to a wonderful series.Strong characterisation, vivid description and imaginative entities make this series, this journey, definitely a favourite read of mine.The only thing that could slightly blemish this series' impact would be the emphasis on anti-Christianity. Yet, this series is only fictitious. The anti-Christian approach is only disturbing because Pullman's talent and effort has made the books seem ultimately real.An EXCELLENT READ!I'm twelve years old, and I would say that most people from my age up would be able to read this book and gain maximum satisfaction. However, keep in mind that although being magical like Harry Potter, just as vivid in character and setting, this series is decidedly darker, with more depth in concepts and emotions."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First off, don't let the reviews that denounce this book because of atheism fool you. I just finished the first one and it is very good. The story is somewhat complex and very compelling. Most importantly it encourages this thing called.... THINKING. For some reason religious people do not like to let this little thing get in the way of \\"faith\\"...For those of you who are wondering wether or not you want your children reading this book, you might as well shut the light off in their spirits and brains. Parents whom try to shut off their child's mind in order to preserve their own beliefs are poor parents. If your child truly believes in their religion then a book about armored bears and a small girl with an althiometer will not change their minds.The book is VERY good. It IS a children's book, and it IS an allegory against organized religion. The last passage in the first book is the most thought provoking, and it makes a great deal of sense if you apply it to the controversy surrounding the books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Not the book, you fantastic God Squad members - particularly the ones who think they are undercover by saying \\"I'm not very religious but...\\".Christiane Hendriksen displays her ignorance by refusing to believe the church would \\"cut off the genitals of children\\" (at least that was what she was trying to say): refuse to believe all you want - it's still true. I particularly like the line of that fine argument since it's probably the one the God Squad will use on an unbeliever like me.Stefanos Erini does a great impression of Gollum - unless of course it's the royal \\"we\\" he's talking about, my precious.Best of all though, are those who hate the book for it's lack of factual basis or evidence for Pullman's theory. As opposed to the Bible which, co-incidentally, is far more poorly written and full of plot holes.Those who are offended by this \\"anti-religious\\" (sic) propoganda betray their underlying insecurities in their own faiths - when was the last time you saw an atheist or agnostic scream and rant that the Bible was published? Hmm? That's because they can cope with those who have different beliefs.As for the book not being suitable for children until they reach the right age not to be sucked in by its \\"brain-washing\\" potential, I completely agree. But, while we're at it, I think we also need to ban them from reading the Bible in that case. Surely that's fair?Bottom line is, keep your reviews based on the creativeness of the story and the skill with which it is told. Whether you agree or disagree with the author's take on religion is totally irrelevant.Idiots."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Let me start by saying that I love this trilogy. My friends love this trilogy. Even my father loves this trilogy. It surprises me that something could appeal to so many age groups and walks of life. How does it accomplish this?First, the plot is spectacular. So much so that I don't even know how to sum it up in a convincing description. In The Golden Compass, a young girl must escape from those who would seek to control and with her with her daemon (magical companion that reflects your soul and position in the world)at her side flee to safety. She meets many strange and wonderful people and saves and armored bear that then helps her free children whose daemons are being severed from them in an attempt to stop coming of age and thus a knowledge of sin. Phew. It may sound over-the-top or far too strange to understand, bu Philip Pullman makes it all work perfectly. The world is well-crafted so that every piece of the story fits together and is completely believable.The characters are also wonderful and relatable. You'll be rooting for Lyra (the main girl) from the beginning. All the characters and creatures introduced have wonderful and fully-developed personalities. And one of the greatest things about this book is that every character has varied motivations. The strict line between good and evil drawn in so many fantasy stories is missing here. Everyone has some of both and is trying to do what he or she believes in. Pullman also does not force entire races into either good or evil descriptors. Armored bears and witches can be both and even the evil creatures of the underworld have very understandable desires.The second book continues in the same vein, introducing a second main character and more magical and wonderful ideas. I don't want to describe it to much, except to say that Pullman does it again. New ideas are introduced and old ideas are furthered, and once more, we root for the characters with all we've got.Let me preface my description of the third book by saying that some Christians may be offended by this book, but while it seems to be anti-religious, if you read closely enough, you'll find that it truly is not. Really Pullman is just telling a story of a corrupt religious organization that is attempting to extend its power too far. I think most people would admit that at some time or another the church has had corrupt officials within. While Pullman does this, he also promotes deep spirituality and overtones of a greater power and the wonder of the world. He is not trying to slam religion. Instead he is merely telling a tale.Furthermore, though this stories may be great for young teenagers (I read them for the first time at that age), they are wonderful for all age groups. There are intricacies that will intrigue the most well-read reader, and the characters and language never cease to amaze. So please, do not be offended and do not write these books off as children's tales. There is much, much more to them.The third book has the most fantastic plot of all; it ties everything together beautiful and all the characters come together in one final attempt at good. This is one of the most epic events in any fantasy story ever, for the climax of the plot of the trilogy involved people from the entire multiverse, I suppose you would call it. The wonderful thing about this is that while the plot climaxes at one place to satisfy those who love a spectacular climax, the characters have their climax later to satisfy those who love a character study. I know that both made me extremely happy.These books are well-crafted and follow an ingenious and inventive plot. The characters are well-developed. You understand the motives of both the good and the evil. The trilogy is a great read for anyone who loves a fantastic (in all the senses of the word) story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is by far one of the most brilliant fantasy trilogies I've ever read. Philip Pullman is a genius fantasist and a world-class mythologist. He turns the Catholic Church inside out so that we see its dark, nasty soul in a completely inspiring way. Finally, someone with the balls to creatively criticize one of the world's greatest evils!His characters are by far, however, his greatest strength. Lyra is strong, moral and adventurous, an incredible spirit who doesn't need religion to shape the goodness in her heart. She's one of the strongest female characters I've found in some many years. I adored her instantly.If you want a challenge to Narnia, are sick of the Christian allegory that infects that series, yet want an alternative for your child that promotes intelligence, courage and strong values, this is a must read. Even for adults, this trilogy is vastly entertaining and beautifully written. Something that everyone can enjoy on all levels!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These are the greatest fantasy, most scientifically valid materials to date in the area of M theory, on theology, and the psychology of growing up. This person has obviously studied and understood all that western Philosophy, Science, and History can offer. Philip Pullman deserves a salute from any reasonable, thoughtful, learned, and curious person on the planet. The cool shades go to you amigo.Martin"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If I were to list my ten favorite books, \\"The Golden Compass\\" would be towards the top of that list. With each reading (an annual event) I am reminded of the beauty and mystery that is the fabric of this work. I think of it as a transcendent work in that it far exceeds the usual limits of this genre. Adolescent tales of magical worlds are understandably popular-the target audience is on the brink of enormous change and is feeling quite confined by the circumstances of their lives. Those other books are, however, generally limited to fairly superficial characterization and plots which, while often exciting, are really just aimed providing the reader with an emotionally cathartic experience. There is nothing wrong with that; but, as this trilogy shows, so much more is possible.The \\"Dark Materials\\" Trilogy is a more solid work because it is dealing with essential truths of our life and the nature of existence. While it is a fantasy, it is quite realistic in its portrayal of what it means to be human. At the most accessible level this means that the characters are fully developed. They are consistently portrayed and feel real. They are fully human (even if they happen to be bears or witches!). More profoundly, though, is the feel of the world created in this book. We live in a world of beauty and mystery. For countless reasons, however, we are generally cut off from this aspect of our nature. In this work, however, you can get a feel for this part of the fabric of our being. From the opening scenes at the school or on the streets of Oxford, we feel our grasp on the ordinary world slipping. This is our world-almost. These real people in this slightly altered time and place create a world of wonder. It is as though you looking at the unfolding of events through a shimmering silky black fog. It is not only mysterious in the sense of plot development, but also in the more profound way as we, through Lyra's eyes, let go of our firm holding of our ideas of how things should be.Some reviewers and readers are concerned about an anti-religious tone they see in these books. While there is some questioning of the worst of organized religion, the work is, in a deeper sense, a support to a spiritual life. These books help us connect with a sense of awe and wonder about the world. By bringing us into contact with that sense of mystery, they bring us closer the divine that is within everything."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Let's face it: most books are terrible. However, many readers get sucked in by a great first chapter---and then watch in dismay as the rest of the book seems to be a slow slide into poor writing, contrived plots, irritating side stories.The Golden Compass was very, very good. Lyra was amusing, brave, and the surrounding cast of characters; the gyptians, Lord Asriel, Iorek.... It was an excellent book, with a fantastic ending. I highly recommend this first book. It is both satisfying and tantalizing---you can read just this book (which, frankly, I would advise) or launch eagerly into the next book. Given that several characters are left kind of dangling, you will probably do so immeaditely.You will be slightly confused when, instead of continuing with Lyra's story, we dumped into our world, or rather, Will's world. You're told way too much about his mentally disturbed mother, his missing father (oh, oh, THAT'S original) and watch with bland interest as he manages to (accidentally) kill a man. Poor Will.Magic appears in the form of a \`window' into another world. That's convenient for lil Will. My biggest problem with the whole windows into other worlds and the handy *subtle* knife is that it means that Asriel's accomplishment is rendered completely unremarkable. You're expecting that Asriel is going to step into some marvelous world, the Northern Lights world.Instead, we barely hear about Asriel, and Lyra is practically abandoned so we can follow Will around. Will is a weirdly stoic, dull, uninteresting, unamusing and nasty character who belongs more in some morbid \`literary' novel. And he gets PAGES of screen time. Since he managed to get the immensely powerful Subtle Knife (hint: it's far, far from Subtle) he effs off anyone who gets in his way.He effs off angels, even helpful angels, and basically sends one to his death. He offers no comfort to the grief-stricken angel who is left behind. The character of Balthamos, who added much needed sarcasm and humor, is effectively castrated when he promises to be nicer (hint: much more boring) to the irritating Will.Will is exactly the type of character that C.S.Lewis would have parodied with sly and biting humor. I hate Will. He is an immense bore, who quickly grows tedious in his continuous use of this all-powerful knife. He probably attended Experiment House.I realized from the first that Pullman disliked Christianity and organized religion. However, whether through poor writing skills, or the rabid rage that blinded him, the last two books totally dissolve. There are brilliant scenes interspersed---and then there are the hideously irritating side plots. Mary, the ex-nun, offers an idiotic reason why she left her religion. Basically, she falls in love, and decides that God doesn't exist. Her reasons as follows1. He just doesn't.2. It's more fun and convenient.3. Physics are more interesting.She also is the protaganist of a side story that creaks and groans and screams to any sensible editor KILL ME! Wheeled elephants, who are sooo cute in their wisdom and sweet, innocent ways, show what Pullman thinks the world could be like if people just didn't believe in God. Wheee! Mary's role as supposed serpent/tempter never materializes. Likewise, neither does Lyra's supposed role as Eve, etc.The Great Battle That Never Was:Little to no tension is built up when SUDDENLY we're expected to care about this battle. However, much more time is spent in the world of the dead, where Lyra and Will free the ghosts from the hideous, Hades like underworld. However, like obedient readers, we trot along.Then, WHAM, WHAM, WHAM! Pullman, in obvious desperation and frustration, kills Asriel, Mrs. Coulter, and Metatron in a scene that disappoints on every level. You keep waiting for Mrs. Coulter to pull of one of her marvelous and wicked schemes that leaves everyone else gasping in the dust. Instead, she turns all sweet and gooshy, swearing that she loves Lyra, and ends up \`standin by her man' and expiring alongside Asriel and that stupid angel. Asriel is built up as a fascinating, amazing, cruel, brave and incredible character that ends up dying in this crappy scene. Ugh. Mrs. Coulter is completely given the shaft with this last minute redemptions that destroys her intricate character.Oh, and yeah, and God/Authority blows away. Yup. He blows away----you know how you turn a mostly empty bag of chips upside down, and the crumbs somehow end up all over your lap? Well, that's basically his end. 0 stars for this empty chip bag death scene that ultimately showcases Pullman's none too subtle message to Christians: just let God die, even he'll be happier!Basically, the whole last books craps out on everyone. Lyra isn't Eve, and the temptation never happens. The idea of Dust is explained, and the focal point becomes this epic battle against the Authority, a battle that never happens and merely is a vehicle for Pullman to spew out his trembling dislike of Christianity. Oh, and you thought that Lyra's great betrayal was betraying Roger? Nope. Pullman actually has to TELL the reader what the big betrayal is.I'm left with questions. Did this trilogy collapse because Pullman is a lousy writer, or because he let his rabid hate of Christianity muddle the story.Well, the Golden Compass seems to indicate that he can write well. However, the last two books just crumble under his attempt to show1. How idiotic Christianity is2. How smart atheists are3. How nice they are4. How Christians are easily fooled, killed by the smarter atheists, and generally, fairly easily defeated by the marvelous atheist heroes.Pullman can write well. However, he carries over crippling hatreds into his writing that just ruin the book. Frankly, if he managed to write the last two books as well as the Golden Compass, I'd simply suspend moral judgement and enjoy the books. I would disagree with his atheism---but I would enjoy the excellent writing.However, he couldn't restrain himself. He managed the Golden Compass, and for that, I am thankful. It was simply painful watching the slow, certain slide into oblivion and poor writing. It was rendered more painful by occasional glimpses of the writing skill that delighted us before. Certain characters, ideas and scenes are thrown like scraps to keep us limping on through the waste land.I am very sad. The trilogy promises much and then blows up in your face. Let's get this clear: I disagree with Pullman on many points, but was willing to forgo those points because I enjoyed his writing. However, when his writing disintegrates, those points simply grate louder.I exit, weeping."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read the trilogy three times already.

Religion, metaphysics, quantum physics, parallel universes, and fantasy are some of the realms that the author explores. Everything is brought to its proper ending without the feeling that there are &#34;loose ends&#34; but leaving the reader wanting still more. A truly fine achievement. There are, however, a couple of points worth noting. 1. I do not see this as a children's fantasy. I believe it to be too mature for children--the topics are at an adult level and are not presented in a format suited for children. Also, there is a lot of dying, some of it more graphic than a child should read. 2. If you have strong religious beliefs [particularly Catholic], the author is not kind to your belief system. He is a confirmed Atheist. However, if you can look beyond the criticism, you will find a story equal to anything written by Tolkein, Terry Brooks [The Shanara series], and, of course, J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is not a book, it is a trilogy. I decided to buy it after watching the film of \\"The Golden Compass\\", which was based on the firs book of the trilogy. All the story carries more than a bit of fantasy and poetic license, though all in all it is based on currently sound religious, phylosofic and scientific phenomena. I could think of it as a \\"sciento-phylosophic-religious fantasy\\". The author seems to have researched a bit on what he describes throughout the book, and whoever has read books like \\"The Tao of Physics (Ftitijoff Kapra), the Bible or the Tao Te King (Lao Tzu) will be familiar with at least some developments.The only reason I don't give it a 5star rating is beacause the ending seemed somewhat \\"fuzzy\\" to me - it looks like the author is intending to continue the saga."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I actually read this a couple of years ago.

But I hated the movie even more than I hated the ending."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed Harry Potter but as a story with a well visualised world behind it, The Dark materials trilogy trumps Harry. I bough it for my daughter age 9 who devoured it and I started it based on the reviews. Having grown up on Tolkien, Lewis, Carroll and Donaldson, I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised. It is a great story in and of itself, a struggle against evil with themes of loyalty, sacrifice, growing up, life and death all woven in without sinking under its own allegory.Excellent writing, not dumbed down, characters are well fleshed out and Lyra and Will are up there with Frodo, Bilbo and other great heroes who had greatness thust upon them. Now for those who like to label the book as antiCatholic, perhaps it is, but even though I am a strong Catholic, I was not offended. It is fiction and any thinking person, religious or not has considered the elements in this book, free will, predestination,good vs evil and what they are etc. So all those who probably also labelled Harry Potter as Pagan deserve pity as they are incapable of doing what Tolken wrote about when he said (more or less) that most adults have lost the ability to imagine and enjoy fairy tales.The quantum physicis elements are fascinating as any reader of Scientific American will attest too, and woven beautifully into the novel. The story is well paced and ends with what I think is a hallmark of excellent fiction - a bitter sweet ending. A great novel leaves one wondering and more importantly, caring about what will happen to its protagonists and I hope Mr Pullman follow up. It is a pity that that the remaining trilogy will porobably not make into a movie, as all the religious nonsense written about it and the fact that the film was too complex for the average critic, will mean that commercial pressures will prevail.Thank you Mr Pullman. This a story that I will reread many times."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This a good set of books.

Check it out!In Book II, Milton is describing the panorama of Hell as Satan looks upon it for the first time, and says,\\"Into this wild Abyss,/ the Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,/ of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,/ But all these in their pregnant causes mixt/ Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,/ Unless th'Almighty Maker them ordain/ His dark materials to create more Worlds,/ Into this wild Abyss the wary fiend/ Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,/ Pondering his voyage...\\" (Lines 910-919).This seems to be essentially saying that there will be unbalance, disorder, and chaos in the world (\\"causes mixt confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight\\") unless God --- or perhaps some other sentient, omnipotent being, if we were to venture outside the Judeo-Christian tradition --- were to use \\"His dark materials\\" to create new worlds in which all problems were solved.So... considering that quotation in the context of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, the books are even more impressive, not to mention thought-provoking.Interesting."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Doesnt everyone love this series if they have read it?

As a Catholic I was impressed at the way some of the topics were presented but I never once thought it was an attack on religion.

(Correction: I thought the line was talking about the Devil as at that point, as it referred to a \\"fiend\\" standing at the edge of Hell, but it looks like it's referring to God as the \\"field\\", which is even worse.) These texts should be added to the list of the Devil's subtle tools. These books are anti-God and anti-church.They say \\"God\\" is not God, just a created angel who came into being by elementary particles. The characters in the book work towards the goal of killing this \\"God\\" and succeeding where the previous rebellion (the fall of the Devil) failed. The main characters finally decide that there is no God.At no point is the Devil or his evil discussed. \\"Demons\\" are not fallen angels who serve the Devil, but instead this word is used to refer to the noble soul-animal that each human has. (Note: The book refers to daemons as the soul-animals, but never refers to the Devil's angels as demons. In the movie they will be saying \\"DEEmon\\" - a dangerous thing - you don't want your kids hoping to find demons.)The church is portrayed as a wholly evil oppressive force. Catholics are mocked. Priests are assassins. A former nun tells the children the story of how she decided there was no God and this story awakens the children to \\"wisdom\\", self-awareness, and the beginning of their love affair (as 12 year olds).There is no heaven nor hell. There is a hades-type place of suffering. The \\"heaven\\" a soul should strive for is to have itself disintegrate and become one with the nature.This book is not for children. Adults likewise should avoid it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN READ THESE BOOKS!!!

Books 1 and 2 were fine but when I got to the 3rd I could not finish it. I am a Protestant and perhaps this will turn some folks off from reading this review - perhaps it won't for others. Pullman is an admitted atheist and has advised he wrote these books to be an antithesis to C.S. Lewis' works - Chronicles of Narnia. Pullman has criticized Lewis' works (and everyone has a right to do so of any work, don't get me wrong).I was actually offended by the fact that Pullman is using children in the story to further his atheistic agenda. There is brutality against the children by the so-called church in his story, making the church out to be a bunch of crazy, evil people... These children are abused psychologically and killed by these very same people. The main character's father and mother are insane as well - not something I see as virtuous at all. Aside from that, Pullman takes the topic of God further by suggesting He is a deceitful and lying entity(I won't spoil it with a more detailed explaination for you if you so choose to read this literature).[...][...] Very disappointed in this series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"the first novel is geared to draw you in, it is the icing on the cake, it look interesting, but the second novel reveal the purpose of the trilogy: the rebellion of the dark angels against God. Of course, God is the meany and the dark angels are the \\"good guys\\". Blatant satanism in other words. The author serves the father of lies and after reading him you feel unclean."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The stories are smothered by the weight of paranoiac, iconoclastic, pompous rubbish: The British government and the Church of England are part of an evil cabal with international and inter-dimensional scope, which is dedicated to maintaining its power while repressing adolescent sexuality. The God of Christianity is senile. Jesus, a maniacal malevolent demon, plans to take over, but is thwarted by a mother-witch sociopath who arouses him, wrestles him to the ground, and roll with him over a cliff. Peaceful communities will always be destroyed by destructive entropy and spiteful beings, spiritual and otherwise. The true God who created the universe is reduced to the random movement of \\"divine particles.\\" Such ideologies wrench the plot, strangling the narratives. The implausibility of character and action increases with each book in the series, yielding not the probable impossible of good fantasy, but the improbable impossible of bad fantasy fiction. Recommended for fans of dark fantasy who enjoy episodic stories with plot complication too trite for cowboy movies of the 1940s."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Do all of you realize that the author of these books is an Atheist? He is AGAINST any Christian whether Catholic or non-Catholic. This is NOT a set of books that you want your kids to read. And I really believe that no adult should read these books either. This man Pullman does not like C.S. Lewis or any Christian for that matter. I don't see why any Christian would buy and read these books.The author is going to use the movie to pull your children in to read these anti-Christian books. I've read that the movie is not as bad as the first book is. This is to lure you in and then to buy the books and then to see the other movies if this man gets that far with the other two movies. We Christians have to stand together and boycott these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This strange series follows the journey of a new age Adam and Eve on a quest to kill God and destroy religion. Don't be fooled by the pretty package and the Hollywood film, this is a heavy dose of anti-religious propaganda aimed at young minds. I can't believe such themes could even be considered for a children's book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The books by Phillip Pullman have been described as \\"atheism for kids\\". Pullman is a militant atheist and secular humanist who despises C. S. Lewis and the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". His motivation for writing this trilogy was specifically to counteract Lewis' symbolisms of Christ that are portrayed in the Narnia series.Clearly, Pullman's main objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism. Pullman left little doubt about his intentions when he said in a 2003 interview that \\"my books are about killing God.\\" He has even stated that he wants to \\"kill God in the minds of children\\". It has been said of Pullman that he is \\"the writer the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed.\\"While \\"The Golden Compass\\" itself may seem mild and innocent, the other books are a much different story. In the trilogy, a young streetwise girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle to ultimately defeat the oppressive forces of a senile God. Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as \\"a very powerful and convincing mistake.\\" In the final book, characters representing Adam and Eve eventually kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH. Each book in the trilogy gets progressively worse regarding Pullman's hatred of Jesus Christ.Do not buy these books. I am returning the ones I ordered for my daughter."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We are asked to rate this book. There is no option for a negative to the infinity.I think this triolgy should be retitled \\"satan's instuction manuel\\" These books are clearly the work of someone who is extremely EVIL. No matter how the reviews water down these books, the end results are evident. Pullman wants GOD dead in the eyes of children. I read the books with my eyes open and can't believe what he espouses. I am deeply saddened that Nicole Kidman has appeared in the movie since I heard that she is a devout Catholic. Parents please keep your children away from the movie and books, it can only bring harm.There IS NO REDEEMING FACTOR in any of the books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman has written a series to rival both his predecessors and his contemporaries. His symbolism, character evolution and ideologies are wrapped up in a drama that attracts both the young and the young at heart.This book was recommended to me by a man in his 40s (I am in my 30s). When I saw &quot;teen&quot; written on the box, I started to worry that I would be reading other Harry Potter - entertaining and engaging, but without tremendous moral or philosophical depth. (Please don't get me wrong - I'll be first in line for the next HP installment.) As a lifetime SF/fantasy junkie, I still needed a fix. That fix led to a marathon reading of all three books over the Christmas holidays.Good and evil, right and wrong, love and duty, are all interwoven with references to theology, physics, mythology that many readers will perhaps not grasp until their university years or later. Pullman creates a world where black and white merge into all shades of grey, one where villain and hero are not as clear-cut as they may seem. Without revealing the ending, it is one that is both heart wrenching, yet morally true to Pullman's reluctance for absolutes.While you may not agree with it, HDM presents extremely interesting, even controversial viewpoints on our own tiny universe. But never forget that speculative fiction serves to expand the mind and Pullman does not disappoint. I am proud to display His Dark Materials in my library next to books from treasured authors and modern-day literati."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this or not, but after seeing how much it ... off the religious zealots out there, I knew it couldn't be all bad. Thinking that, I read all three. I wasn't disappointed in the least. Not only were they good books with good stories, they were wonderfully contemptuous of religion in general, christianity in particular. It was what I had expected and more. Definitely delivered what I wanted...."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This Series is absolutely incredible. It's unlike any other fantasy/science fiction books that i've read.

I'm glad the controversy over the movie brought these books to my attention."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Only read the first book so far. Great story. Don't let the church people stop you from reading this book. I'm sure the cloud man would not punish anybody for simply keeping an open mind. Good begining, great middle, and great ending will keep you reading all night. I'm looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing the movie."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I simply loved reading the HP series...while I was waiting for the last book, i started reading other ones like HP....Septimus Heap, Jonathan Stroud....but this one is simply superior.Has a great storyline, keeps you hooked on totally...some parts become slow and a little predictable, but definitely a great set of books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's actually been several years since I read this trilogy so my remembrance of the details is fuzzy, but I'm just here to share two overall impressions that stuck with me. First, Pullman is a gifted writer who has great mastery of the language, which I always appreciate. But by the end of the third book, I was mainly sad that someone with his talents had used them in a way that I personally found offensive. It also troubled me that these books would be a natural thing for children to pick up, and the way the offensive material builds slowly over the later books meant that they would already be into the story before it became really troubling. Parts of the third book struck me as nothing more than a sophisticated anti-God rant. That's obviously not going to bother some people, but it was enough to make me get rid of these books and not re-read them as I have with other great series that I've enjoyed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These, are the absolute best books in history. Past, present and future.I was a kid of 9 when I read these, and I disagree with ones that say they aren't suitable for us kids. But then, I'm much more mature than a lot of my classmates....Anyway. If you think you're mature enough to handle death, dying, kidnapping, cruelty, and anti-Christian wisely, then you can read these absolutly great books.Harry Potter? Too messed up.Hardy Boys? Too Primary, I always guess the bad guy at like, the middle of the book.Nancy Drew? Oh please! Don't tell me...His Dark Materials? DEFINETLY!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"[...]The trilogy starts promisingly, and I was quite happy with the first book. It reads like an allegory of our own world. I am an atheist/agnostic and have very little sympathy for the catholic church, so I found some of these themes quite appealing and interesting. But as the story progresses in the second book the characters start getting more shallow, and less interesting and the story starts getting illogical twists that just seem to make no sense in the context of the story line, the plot seems to follow the whims of the writer and not it's own inner logic that the first book promisingly build up. The third book continues this trend. Nothing makes sense anymore. And don't understand this wrongly. A fantasy story doesn't have to \\"make sense\\", but it has to follow it's own set of rules or the storyline is shattered. When the rules are broken the reader starts feeling he's being manipulated. While the world of the first book was full of life, promise, hope, wonder and achievement when the world was on the brink of a great war and children were being kidnapped, the ending of the third book is the emotional opposite - after the universe has been saved.[...]The third book is just horrible. One of the worst endings I have ever read.Not recommended reading for children. I don't mind the anti-catholicism angle, but the way the reader is manipulated and how imagination and wonder are cruelly restricted is not a message of freedom. Completely puzzled how the second and third book have generally got good reviews."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Disclaimer - All reviews, this one included, are subjective.Having said that, I came away from these three books disappointed. I was not familiar with Pullman's writing. All the hype around the recently released \\"Golden Compass\\" movie supposedly promoting atheism, prompted me to buy the trilogy. I had great expectations that were soon dashed. The movie, I might add, does not stay faithful to the ending of the first book. I will be surprised if the sequels don't wander considerably from the books as well.Atheists will laugh at all the hoopla and tell you, point blank, Pullman's trilogy hardly rings true to the core beliefs of genuine atheists. Pullman is far too moderate, allowing much in his books to suggest spiritual and metaphysical ideals. Many, if not most Gnostics will find much here they are in agreement with. Agnostics would be confused and probably find these books too spiritual for their tastes.I find it interesting that Christians appear to be highly offended by the much touted \\"killing of god\\" but the consensual sex between a 15 year old boy and a twelve year old girl (main characters in the trilogy) doesn't even earn a footnote?!I suspect that much of the \\"bad\\" pre-publicity the movie received may have been cleverly conceived by the financial backers of the movie. People are drawn to controversy. I was looking forward to more controversy. I found it to be rather bland in that respect.I am a recovering Christian so I have some bias in Pullman's favor but I think he reined himself in, perhaps not wanting to be overly controversial. This too depends on your perspective. If questioning your long held religious beliefs is new territory for you then Pullman's writing might seem highly polemic to you.One has to give Pullman credit for attempting to make the Church and even \\"god\\" the antagonists. Still, Pullman's \\"god\\" was amazingly benign after a slow build-up that ended in what I felt was a disappointing anti-climax.If this book is supposed to be for children, I don't get it and neither will they. I suppose they are entranced by fighting polar bears, animal daemons, and good witches. Adults will probably not attempt to explain the deeper implications about \\"The Church\\" to anyone under the age of 14. It doesn't take an atheist to recognize the truth's embedded here, sometimes hinted at, sometimes direct. Most of the \\"controversial\\" stuff (a thimbleful) comes in the final book and is pretty much a direct slap at the Catholic church. More than a few protestants would agree with Pullman's premise but that doesn't make them, or Pullman atheists.I don't read a lot of fiction. I just so happened to be reading Follett's Pillars of the Earth at the same time. Though fiction of different genre, Follett is clearly a better writer. Honestly I got bored in several places in the Pullman and had to struggle to finish the books. Pullman wanders about at times, including things that seem somewhat irrelevant, the elimination of which might condense the trilogy into a more manageable size.I feel the over-all climax takes far too long to develop and will probably leave some people feeling left up in the air. Pullman has his moments (arguably just enough) perhaps and there are some nice visuals (what the movie people saw) but otherwise the book just wasn't consistently gripping enough to hold my attention and completely pull me in. In my opinion this trilogy is over-rated. The 3 ranking is because 2.5 wasn't an option."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've just finished the GOLDEN COMPASS and the SUBTLE KNIFE. The new movie, is being promoted as a Narnia type story, but the books certainly are not. They are sort of the anti Narnia. I'm usually very liberal about what I read and watch. However, I would not recommend these books for kids without careful parental supervision. These books are very well written, and have an engaging adventure story. It's probably some of the best writing I've read since the Narnia books. The first book on it's own isn't overwhelmingly offensive because being the first in a series, you aren't sure what is up or down. Or, at least I wasn't sure if their quest would be the true quest of the whole story. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I'll just conclude that it draws you into a story that seems innocent enough at first glance, but is not. I would not recommend them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are amazing. If you love fantasy and science fiction you will love these books. Definitely my top rated books, right up there with Harry Potter!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"...I mean it. But fairly loosely. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's not bad.The storyline was pretty good. All but the first book. The first book was lame. I mean, I get the whole \\"save your friend or die trying\\" theory. But where's the whole \\"larger picture\\" thing? What do they call it? Destiny? He keeps mentioning it, but doesn't do much about it. Like he's trying to \\"build up suspense.\\" Dude, get on with it!The other books, however, were a lot better. You could actuallyimagine a larger picture. It was no longer this whole one-scene thing. You could actually see that it wasn't just the problems of one or two people anymore. Suddenly, loads more was at stake. I have to admit that, after reading the first book, I might not have continued if I didn't have a close friend who was crazy about it. But I've got to admit, the last two were really good. Particularly the last one. What's it called? The Amber Spyglass. Yeah, some Christians might be a little touchy about it, but I'm Christian, and I like it. People, it's a story. If you're hell-bent on hating it because of that, then get a life.Besides Will, all the other characters were a little . . . weird? Their characters were a little . . . um . . . not my type.

The books gather in pace and intrigue, and take the reader into a more \`real' magic than the very entertaining but lighter Harry Potter books. The latter stories normalise magic - spells are cast like eating breakfast cereal. Pullman's story of 12 year-old Lyra and friends takes in parallel universes and renders abstract concepts (like \`dust'!) to be potent forces in their challenge to save the universe. Like the earlier The Way of Wyrd, Pullman's books take on a journey into a magical reality as both a death-defying odyssey and a lesson in the ultimate extensions of our imaginations ."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It has been almost 5 months since I have read this trilogy and since I have read 10 or more books, but when I think of what I've read these books always stick out. I find myself thinking about them almost everyday and this absolutely wonderful tale of a pair of adolescents adventure through different worlds. These books are truly wonderful and I'd reccomend them to anyone. They kept me guessing throughout and had me jumping in bed at the twists. The Amber Spyglass was and still is the only book that has ever made me cry. These books are truly magnificent."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am a children's librarian, and I have to speak my mind. So many parents allow their children to check these books out, and then when they talk to the child about the book, they are outraged and come storming into the library. I don't blame them actually. We stock many books because of public access and free speech. If you are trying to protect your child because of religion or childhood innocence, you really need to read reviews of children's books before you allow them to read those books. Many books these days are not like the books twenty years ago. They are darker and more violent.I read hundreds of children's books every year. This series is one of the darkest series I have ever read (adult or children). The first two books aren't that bad. But you begin to get highly suspicious at the end of the second book, and in the third book your suspicions are confirmed.This series, if you are religious or even just believe in God, will shock you. It is the story of Armageddon, except God is now old and feeble and doesn't help the world, and Satan is a much more benevolent being and if he ruled the world, the world would be a much better place. The book says it is time for God to step down and let Satan rule in his place. That Satan should have won the fight at the beginning of the world. At the end of this book, a child with a knife.....well, you get picture.What amazes me is that since 85% of the population professes belief in God that these books have become so popular. Most of the world's religions - Christians, Jews, Muslims - would not agree with the philosophies of these books.If you are going to buy them anyway, despite this review, please, please read them first before giving them to a child. I deal with hundreds of children every day, and I promise you these books will impact a child a lot more than they would impact an adult. Adults discern philosophies and manage to get past them while still maintaining their basic belief system. Children and teens do not have this luxury. The books they read and the movies they watch form their foundation of beliefs and philosophies. As their guardian, parents are responsible for helping form these beliefs and philosophies toward life, moral values, and religion. Please be careful with these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Don't start reading these books. They will leave a sour taste with their anti-God screed. I read this with an open mind, thinking that much of the controversy was going to be along the lines of people thinking that the Harry Potter series was anti-Christian. While the Golden Compass does not get into this tedentious anti-God philosophy, that grows through the rest of the book, poisoning what would otherwise have been a reasonable story. Nothing to compare to Harry Potter or Narnia or Tolkien -- clearly second rate. I have no objection to stories which involve church based conspiracy theories -- one need only read a biography of Galileo to expose some of the bad things done by the Church -- but this trilogy turns into a 2-D screed against the concept of God.

Also, this set is very durable, more so than other paperbacks!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Of course, I have never read Harry Potter. So basing my comparison with the first 3 movies of HP, I would say that this goes beyond the Harry Potter genre. Almost everybody reads Harry Potter. But His Dark Materials is not for everyone. To label this as a children's book is a grieve mistake for I am sure the little ones will miss the central message of the author. But as for adventure, it is non-stop and most people from all ages will absolutely enjoy it.After watching the movie, \\"The Golden Compass\\" my sister bought the set. The movie had instilled an interest in me. The bear fight scene \\"Bears! Who is your King?\\" cheesed me out, which made me realize how OLD I am. So thinking that the book is targeted towards children, it took me a while to pick this up and finally after 4 months, I continued on with Lyra's adventure. But when I did, my whole week is automatically committed. For five days, my sister saw me flipping book after book after book.THE GOLDEN COMPASS: I decided that I would start from the beginning. It is a general agreement that the book is always better than the movie, no? Except this time, I think the movie handled some of the scenes in the book much better. The movie moved and switched some of the scenes around but it still worked. Book fans bashed the movie because it left a big chunk of the book's ending. I wouldn't worry about it though because if they included the real ending, then it'll be much more of an excruciating cliff hanger. I don't think I could wait 3 more years to see next sequel. Still, several scenes has been skipped - important scenes and that's why in retrospect, the book is still better. But to put the movie in a better light, when I imagine the daemons and dust and those flying machines, I could refer back to the movie. Nicole Kidman is the perfect Mrs. Coultier! So in essence, the movie gives us a small peek of what goes on inside Philip Pullman's head.THE AMBER SPYGLASS: Since I've watched the movie, the first book was not as exciting as the second one. The Amber Spyglass made me stay up the whole night. Lyra's new friend and another main character, Will, started off as an annoying character but proved to be as courageous, as smart, as likeable (if not more likeable) as Lyra. Looking back, this book was so jam-packed and I felt like I flew through the pages so quickly.THE SUBTLE KNIFE: Finally, I think the series' tandem faltered a tiny bit in this last installment of Pullman's epic adventure. After building up so much intrigue and mystery, I was disappointed at the sloppy ending. He easily convinced me of the existence of the imaginary worlds he created but the most human and normal twist in the story fell out flat and forced. For twelve year olds, okay...sure, it's possible...but why can't I believe it? Well, I'm not spoiling anything.Albeit the weak ending, this series will definitely one of those books I'll keep recommending throughout my lifetime."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Excellent trilogy. Once you start reading it you will not want to put them down."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The best part of this book is that it is actually all of Pullman's Dark Materials in one book. It is definitely cheaper than buying all the books separately.Adapted as a screenplay in late 2007, The Golden Compass follows Lyra through her world of Oxford and beyond as she goes on a mission to rescue her friend Roger and the other children of the country (what would be England) suddenly start disappearing by the Gobbers. Along the way, she meets and collects a collage of supporters, from families of gypsies, an armored polar bear, and an aeronaut. Their mission is to save the children and find out what is really happening to them. The book, expectedly, explains more than what the movie actually shows, including reasoning for certain events and actions, as well as scenes that never made it to the movie.The Subtle Knife starts in England, with Will finding an entrance to another world. In that new world, he encounters Lyra, and a knife that can cut through anything, including air space to make new openings to new worlds.The Amber Spyglass deals with the upcoming war between two sides over science and religion. It also describes the conflicts that Lyra must face, including fulfilling the prophecy and saving the universe and all the parallel worlds, including Lyra's and Will's.Personally, I didn't like the ending of the Amber Spyglass, but the books are a must read if you have lots of time to spare. Settle down for a long weekend. If you wait too long between readings, you can easily forget what happened when you last read. The suspense will keep you going until the last pages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story is imaginative and brilliant.

The first book was excellent, with a strong beginning, good characters and an exciting new world. It's a fun read for any adult who loves fantasy. However, the second and third books try too hard to do everything and end up being less than what they could have been. While it's interesting to see how the story wraps up, the second and third books were more obviously meant for children as opposed to a broader audience. The new characters introduced in the latter book are weak, and they end up taking away from the really strong characters developed from the first book. However, the religious/anti-religious \\"message\\" that has been protested by so many is subtle to the point that I really didn't notice it.

Some people might think this book is for children, but I don't think younger ones, maybe teenagers. There's a lot of dark material (hence the name) and interesting twists. Some reviews said it was better than Harry Potter, but I think both are in the same league but totally different messages.

The Church directed humor is funny.The Subtle Knife : I am only half way through, but it is also a good read. A bit darker than the first book of the trilogy.At church, a good friend of mine cautioned me that the third book ends with telling the kids to all go out and kill God. I doubt if that is what the book is going to say, but I intend to read it for myself and find out.Shame on those who spread rumors about good literature without reading it for themselves first.

This series is a beautiful look at the sacred qualities of life and love, and the fight for them. If religious parents and teachers don't want kids reading the books they are only contributing to what Pullman sees as a corrupted church. It is sheltering kids to only see things from the Christian point of view and not allowing them to listen to an opposing argument. If a child grows up surrounded by a certain way of thinking, and then changes their beliefs because of a series of books, it demonstrates free will, and it is a good thing. It demonstrates critical thinking, and questioning and an active mind, and it should be commended. I should state that while I am an agnostic, I am not anti-Christian, but I do oppose anyone who brings up a child not allowing them to read, watch, or listen to anything that conflicts with what they personally believe. It is mental slavery, and I find it to be a dispicable act. I would never forbid my child from reading the Bible, going to church, or finding out and becoming part of a religion, as I know that what I believe should not constitue what they do. If you religious parents and leaders believe that these books are dangerous because they may show a child a different outlook on life, you contribute to what is a great evil of much of the Church--the reliance on brainwashing and ignorance. However, most Christians that I know are not so immature, and this is only addressed to those who do behave in this manner.As far as the books go, they are truly amazing. Pullman is a master storyteller who continues Britain's history of producing awe-inspiring prose. He puts so much emotion into his writing that it is impossible to read the story without feeling a connection with the characters. He asks us to enter his world, and, as is the case with all great authors, when you reach the end you don't want to leave. I have never read a fantasy meant for children that was as eloquent, intellectual, or mature as this, which makes me wish that it would be remembered as the great fantasy of our time, though I am sure that honor will go to Harry Potter. Highly recommended for anyone mature enough for the content (probably about 12 and older)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you're thinking about exploring a new series but are hesitant for one reason or another, let this be the review that pushes you to reading these books.In the \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy, Pullman hits the literary nail right on the head. The first book, The Golden Compass, puts in motion a unique world, somewhat like our own, with an even better storyline. We follow Lyra, an untraditional protagonist, as she pieces together mysterious phenomena that surrounds children disappearing, possible parallel worlds, and fighting armored bears (to name a few.)The second book, \\"The Subtle Knife,\\" maintains the momentum of the storyline, while you savor every page in \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" the final installment.A series for all ages, His Dark Materials is some of the best innovative fantasy/fiction, and rivals the best - Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc... The story will stick with you for quite some time - no matter when you turned that final page."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'd like to dispell the notion that many have in thinking that His Dark Materials are children books. They are not. If anyone under the age of 11 was to read them, not only would the themes be too dark and too anti-Christian, but they probably wouldn't understand much of what is happening.That said, Philip Pullman has written a wonderful series that I have read three times now. Despite his \\"anti-Christian\\" messages, the story is beautifully and imaginatively written. The first book is the tamest of all three but that doesn't mean there is no controversy. Prepubescent children are in danger from the Church who wants to separate their daemons (physical forms of the people's souls) from their body so as to prevent Dust (a physical representation of Sin) from settling onto their bodies. Through the second book the Lyra's father, Lord Asriel, has started to gather an army to make war on God, or the Authority, and the Church's true side is shown as they try to murder Lyra for being prophesized as the new Eve.Where in the beginning Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter were seen as the bad, God-hating, side that Lyra was supposed to defeat, she, and the reader, turns so that we are actually rooting for Lord Asriel's war.The Christian religion is displayed very differently than how churches truly teach it. There isn't any Creator, that is a lie, there is only an angel that came first and named himself the Authority. He has become so old and decrepit that he can't rule for himself and the angel left in control, Metatron, is ready to send angels into everyday human affairs to root out the unfaithful. It would be an Inquisition.The simple fact that Lyra is an accomplished liar does not prove the story has bad themes, it shows her creativity and her imagination. In fact it saves her life many times, and gets her in trouble at one point that she understands the negative side to lying too much. The books are often compared to Harry Potter and as someone who has read both series there are nearly no similiarities I can see other than the main characters being around the same ages and the themes are fantasy. His Dark Materials have much darker themes and shouldn't be read by the same age group of 9-12, as many sites state the reading age is.This is a series that I plan to keep for my children should they wish to read it, and I will have no qualms about it"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Just wanted to put a warning out there for folks interested in reading this series: it ends with a flop!What begins as character development and an exploration of the author's perspective of coming of age and the human experience becomes a contrived soap box in the final book.The first couple of books are engaging and interesting - but the mystery of the story line is consistently put off in expectation of the books conclusion. But, unfortunately, the author seems unable to solve the mystery he created. How unfortunate that his theological views lack the mystery that is inherent in our experience! He instead tries to conclude the series with a rather dismal attempt at verbalizing his own (rather contrived, in my opinion) view points about the nature of the universe and God. And he does so very unconvincingly.What blows my mind is that, though he claims at explaining God, he never really addresses who god (the creator) is. Instead, we are given a description of satan, who was supposed to be God's imposter? The purpose of creation, explained in dust, etc... open-ended and very dissatisfying! In retrospect, I would say that Mr Pullman communicates only a distrust and antagonism to the church and religion, without providing a convincing argument to what he beieves to be the truth regarding the subject.For those people with children - save them the effort and confusion, because that's all this book will give them! The deeper subjects of the soul, god, the church, etc are very poorly addressed. You're left wishing he would stick to the subjects he started with - namely coming of age and the human experience, rather than endeavoring to address the subject of truth, God, and religion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I originally bought these books for my adolescent son, but I thoroughly enjoyed them as well."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although this series is marketed to an audience of children it is far from being children's literature. Although it is a favorite of my own children, and I have given it as gifts to my own nieces and nephews, I gift it with a disclaimer to the parents to read it first. It is described by critics as being somewhat controversial unless you read it for the simple joy of reading books that are well written and entertaining. It is filled with captivating plot(s), action, descriptive prose and has a philosophical/theological angle that is very thought provoking. Many readers describe this series as \\"anti-God\\", \\"anti-Church\\", and to \\"Beware\\". I, however, describe it as a wonderfully captivating fantasy that is a real page turner and difficult to put down. It does speak from a totally unusual point of view regarding religion but I see it as more \\"anti-authority\\" than \\"anti-God\\" (God as believed in by Christians). If you enjoy (or need) pure escape and love to be drawn into the world of fantasy, this is a wonderful story about two youngsters coming of age, witches, gypsies, armored bears, parallel worlds, physics, ancient civilizations, civilizations of unique intelligent animals, scientists, scholars, nuns and explorers. There is a significant amount of death, pain and despair but not much that is related to true life situations as we know. Although I haven't read other works by Philip Pullman, this series ranks him among my favorite authors simply due to his descriptive style of painting images in your mind along with his fantastic ideas. If you get into it, you will be sorry when you are done with the third book. It's a great mechanism for \\"escape\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Okay, having read this book, I will say this concerning the books:I really enjoyed them. I felt the story was interesting and the characters believable.Now, concerning the idea of \\"Is this book anti-christian or not.\\" Mr. Pullman wrote the series as a counter-point to CS Lewis' Narnia series. The Narnia books are biblical allegory. They suppose that the bible is correct upon all points. In order to write a counter-point to them, Mr. Pullman must necessarily take up a contrary position. So in this, the book is \\"anti-christian,\\" however the word christian is a little to broad.It is quite obvious that the church that continually surfaces as the agent of evil during the course of the novels is a monolithic entity of authority. Now, we must ask ourselves if this represents Christianity as a whole or a specific branch. To cut things short, this book is a protest against the actions of the Catholic church. Once again, this is a little broad. He is not attacking St. Peter's down the street from your house, but the larger authority of the church in Rome. If you must read this book looking for how he attacks the church, then remember that the Catholic church has undeniably hurt many people (John Paul admits as much), and continues to do so. Thus, it requires exposing and lampooning. This is one such effort.Please note, I do not believe Christianity or the Catholic Church to be evil. I believe there is much good in both, however they are human institutions of divine will, and as such there are flaws in both. Because I know some people cannot understand this, I have chosen to keep myself anonymous to avoid the flames of their anger."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After reading the reviews of this series, I was very eager to plunge into it and experience what reviewers called the \\"last great fantasy series of the 20th century.\\"The first book of the series lived up to the hype. The adventures of the main character, Lyra, which began through her overhearing a cryptic presentation by her uncle, led to a first-rate series of events that completely drew me in.Unfortunately, Mr. Pullman became overly sentimental about his characters in the second and third books. The events were so heavily foreshadowed throughout the last two thirds of the series, that there were no surprises at the end. Further, the \\"climactic\\" final confrontations were so brief and scattered that they seemed less important than the very successful and suspenseful buildup before.It seemed to me that Mr. Pullman lost steam in his writing.The same thing happened again with his very brief follow-up book Lyra's Oxford. It begins with what seems like a potential new adventure for Lyra and once again dries up (it could have been a very good opening few chapters for a greater invention, but Pullman ends it abruptly and frustratingly)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This could have been one of the great fantasy novels. Despite a great start with The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, the third book is a failure. The plot winds everywhere. The fantasy world Pullman creates makes less and less sense, as characters in what appeared to be a Victorian age in the first books are suddenly dealing with references to &quot;atomic bombs.&quot; Armies try to war against high tech weapons with gas filled zepplins. The &quot;solution&quot; to freeing the ghosts from the world of the dead is totally unsatisfying. The story just doesn't work, despite Pullman's tremendous imagination, beautiful writing style and flair for characterization.For those who feel as I do, I recommend novels such as James Stoddard's &quot;The High House,&quot; which hasn't received as much publicity, but is a far better read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a trilogy that is sure to become a fantasy classic. Pullman is a wonderful writer with very strong opinions about religion and politics. If you want great stories that make you think, this is the purchase for you. Devout Catholics will probably hate these books."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this series solely because of all the anti-religious hype created by Christians surrounding the movie \\"The Golden Compass.\\" I'm a Christian myself and believe that Christians are a fickle bunch of people who get excited about the littlest of things, so I thought I'd read this series for myself and decide if it was truly anti-religious or not.The conclusion I came to was: yes and no. The first two books barely touch religion at all. Sure, we mention the church and some of the weird and evil things the church is dabbling in. But the church scenes are few and far in between. The Golden Compass is more the story of Lyra traveling all over creation with a ton of different characters. Some people praise the first book as being very exciting and whatnot, but I find it absurd in many cases all the things Lyra does. I frankly don't care about her adventure or what she is doing at all. And the first three or four chapters of the book--entirely boring. Some people write that they were hooked within the first few pages--I don't see how that's possible. The first chapter was the worst chapter of the entire series. I would've put the book down right then and there but I kept reading, hoping to find what all the controversy was about.And I couldn't find much controversial in the first two books. Many people write that these books aren't for children. Perhaps you could argue that the violence is too much, or some of the weirder parts are too much (like the group of people that drill holes in their skulls. What's that all about?). But from a religious standpoint, there's nothing in these first two books that's going to derail a child's faith and make him or her into an atheist.The thing that bothered me the most about the first book (and all the books really) was the concept of daemons. What's the point of them? They serve no purpose at all! Pan rarely talks to Lyra, and when he does, he has nothing interesting to say. Why? Because he is Lyra! He's just an outward extention of her. Daemons rarely contribute anything in the fight scenes, they rarely do anything practical. They are simply there for cute purposes. In The Golden Compass, the kids think it's SO HORRIBLE that daemons are separated from their partners, but as a reader, I could care less. And that's bad that I don't care about daemons, because the Golden Compass is largely focused on them.[...]The second book wasn't much better than the first. Other reviewers point out Will's stoic nature and the cliched plot of sick mother, father gone left him. I must admit, though, that the subtle knife and the altheithometer are two very cool fantasy items. The amber spyglass, however, was introduced way too late in the third book and isn't that impressive at all. I could've done without it.The third book is where everybody has problems with, in a literary and religious sense. First literary. The book has too much going on at once. The angels. The intention craft. Mary's spill into another world with wheeled creatures. None of this is needed. Metatron? As somebody else said, Metatron feels more appropriate in a Japanese mecha anime.The most exciting part of the book was the land of the dead scene, which I felt was a satisfying explanation of death, but the scene was way too long. I was waiting for the church stuff to explode wide open, but it never did. Throughout the whole series we are told how bad the church is, but we never really see them taken on and attacked. Instead Pullman's church does not in any way reflect the real church of today, so it's hard to take any of his criticisms seriously.And then we get to the confrontation with the Authority. Completely anticlimatic. And it comes roughly 2/3 through the book? This is the first book I've ever read where somebody kills God, and the scene with God was only a few pages and not what I was expecting.And what happens after God dies? The story drags on and brings up unnecessary details. Daemons being separated. Will getting a daemon. Another convoluted explanation of Dust. And windows needing to be closed up. It goes on and on past the point of caring for this reader.In the end: I'm glad to have read the series, I won't sell it but I probably won't read it again. The criticism of Christianity didn't bother me because the Christianity of Pullman in no way correlates with the real Christianity of our world. If the church really was like the church in the book, then I too would become an atheist. But it's not. Parents have nothing to fear from this book. I suspect most kids will have a hard time really following the criticism of religion. In all, a substandard fantasy work that will only be remembered for being the first major fantasy work by an atheist targeted at children. I think people who praise this series are more in love with the IDEA of an atheist fantasy story than they are with the actual execution of the story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found this series to be a wonderful read for ANYone who enjoys fantasy. The way Pullman writes really makes you feel like your there. I laughed, cried, and felt everything that the characters felt.I especially like that a girl is main character, as I am partial to books with heroins, because I'm tired of the guy always being perfect. But that's a bit beside the point.This is a wonderful book. My entire family loved it. Honestly, at the end you'll find yourself wanting for more, and if your an animal lover, wanting for a daemon to call your own."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Amazingly, each book is better than the last. His characters are so rich and complex, that they almost become real. I haven't been this deeply moved by a book in a long time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Words cannot describe how amazing these books are. I can only hope the movie does them justice. I've read them 5 times over and it is still exciting each time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One of my friends really loves these books, so I finally decided to read them. Well, they weren't as horrible as I thought they would be. Just kidding, I actually liked them a lot. I may even put them on my wish list, but then again, maybe not. I didn't really like the way the author talked about God. He sort of acted like God could be destroyed, and I didn't really like that. I mean, I know it was a fantasy and all, but it made me kind of uncomfortable. But, onto its good points: the author is really original. He took some ideas from other books, but gave them a sort of twist which made the books really unique. I also liked the way he developed his characters. For example, at the beginning, Lyra was a wild little barbarian, and by the end of the Amber Spyglass, she matures into a sensitive girl who thinks about others. Overall, a pretty great book that I would recommend to ages twelve and over because of some violence and scary moments."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This man is one of the best writers I have read in years. His writing is almost as good as C.S. Lewis, and better than Tolkiens'. The first two books are pretty good--- dialogue, plot, good, evil, magic---- tailored to the literate reader. The third book kind of lost me, though. I don't particularly mind his anti-Catholicism; I suspect he was once a Catholic himself, or is related to a Catholic. Ex-Catholics are often like ex-smokers. I can forgive that. But he needn't have devoted the entire third book to the refutation of Christianity. What seems to be a personal mission on his part gets in the way of the story.And what kind of an attack on Christianity neglects to mention even once in three volumes the name or message or actions of its founder?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you want a review on the content of these books, don't look here.

I was very disappointed. Although he plainly has a creative mind, his presentation of his plot is difficult and annoying to read. His characters are suprisingly one-dimensional and hard to care about. Fans of the Harry Potter series would do better to look to up and coming authors like Garth Nix and Tamora Pierce, or to fantasy classics such as The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S. Lewis) and The Lord of the Rings (Tolkien). I would NOT reccomend these books to my friends, my parents, or the children I babysit."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First off, I want to congratulate Philip Pullman on thescope and wonder he captures in this creative romp throughmany worlds. The story of Lyra and Will and their attemptsto understand the universe and its nature is fun and gripping.Pullman's ability to evoke realistic worlds and images isamazing. His characters, on the whole, are interesting andcompelling, and his creativity is second to none. The booksattempt to deal with the great themes of philosophic and theologicalthought: the nature of evil, the nature of redemption, thepower of love, loyalty, the consequences of our actions andchoices, etc. However, the overall messageis fatally marred by what can only be described as thepersonal blind spot of the author himself.In a piece of fiction that deals with multiple worlds andmultiple species, one would expect there to be many, manyways of understanding the universe. And these would, presumably,hold similarities to each other in the way that the real world'sgreat religions are similar. That is, one would expect divergenceon rituals, mythologies, cosmological descriptions of origins, etc.,but one would universally expect to see that the ends do not justifythe means, that love, humility, charity, concern for others, etc. are extolledand taught as the greatest truths and virtues, that striving toward wisdom andcommunion with the sacred is a task we all share. And Pullman's trilogy_does_, to a certain extent, respect these great truths...withone incredible exception.It becomes clear in The Golden Compass that Pullman equatesthe Catholic Church, and Christianity in general, with thevery _essence_ of evil and power-grubbing authoritarianism. And nearthe end of the Amber Spyglass he has declared, unambiguously,that there is no God and that Christianity is a compelling buterroneous belief. He describesan institutional Church that, apparently, preaches hatred, intolerance,torture, and fananticism...really the worst caricature of the worstabuses of the Catholic church over the last two millenia. Interestinglyenough, however, every _other_ religious worldview presented (secularhumanism, Deism,Scientism, Shamanism, skepticism, Paganism, pragmatism,and a watered-down form of Buddhism)is seen as worthy. All beliefs about the world are shown to be valid andhonorable..._except_ Christianity (and Catholicism in particular).The incredible narrowness of the author's expressedhatred of Christianity may well be, as some reviewers have suggested, a personalthing. And I have no doubt that Mr. Pullman is entitled to hisbeliefs. But the very zealotry that he seems to display in his hatredof Christianity is the very _essence_ of what his protagonists profess tohate about the Catholic church...their intolerance, their inabilityto see beyond their own closely-held worldview, the \\"rightness\\" oftheir point of view versus everyone else's.I don't believe this book tries to \\"take down\\" Christianity per se,although one could argue that Pullman tries to do just that. ButI believe because of Mr. Pullman's own confused moral sense andbigotry, the books seem to show an incredibly lopsided view of what the universelooks like. Lying, cheating, killing are all fine and have no long-termconsequences, according to Pullman, if the ends are worthy enough; you don'teven have to regret the wrongs you to do others along the way (witnessthe ironically Christian-like redemption of Lyra's parents at the end of thetrilogy, despite their collective torture and killing of innocents).Morals are all relative, and all philosophies of the nature of life arefine, just as long as they aren't Catholic.Deep truths abound in these books, but they always seem just out of reachof its author, and thus, out of reach of the reader. We never seem to knowwhat the point of the journey was, unless it was just the fun of the ride.But this moral confusion and undisguised bias against all things Christiantakes what _could_ have been a great trilogy...even a saga of the magnitudeand scope of Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\", and reduces it to a moral muddle.What a shame."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first two books were very written, spetacularly written in fact. The description and plot was incredible and the characters were likable. I finally got my hands on the third one, and I was very disappointed. He managed to tie up all the loose ends and the plot, but in my opinion it was a terrible way to end the book, and the whole idea that \\"Christianity is nothing but a very powerful and convincing lie\\" was very insulting to me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't recommend these books to anyone. The first book is certainly well written, and pulls you in. It's fascinating and very interesting. Towards the end of the first book weighty matters fly thick and fast. By the end, I wondered how it had been marketed as a children's book. It is NOT for kids. The second book just dissolved into blasphemy. The third book, as has been said in other reviews, was definitely the least good of the three. Certain death scenes weren't exactly consistent with the characters involved, and the ending really could have been better. As to morals, they were sadly lacking. I didn't see much of the behavior as being terribly honorable or noteworthy, though the author tried to paint it that way. Instead of focusing on the story Philip Pullman used the books as a rant against God. That is his prerogative, of course, but I think it's good to know what one's child is reading. You know, in case it contains issues that are better suited to an older audience, as these books do (souls being ripped from children's bodies, 12 year olds having sex, etc.). If the author had focused more on the story, instead of his manifesto, the second two books might have been better, even with the blasphemous content. The books ARE well-written, and I enjoyed reading them. The author's agenda didn't exactly rock my faith, but I most definitely don't recommend them. (Side note: I was 16 when I read this series and my opinion hasn't changed in the intervening years.)I read these books several years ago, so I don't remember in exactly which book the wheel-using animals come in, but after that I just finished the series for the principle of the thing. I thought they were rather stupid. (Note: My friend, who introduced me to these books, and is much smarter than I, loved the wheel-using animals, so maybe it was just me, but I thought they were utterly idiotic.) I can't emphasize enough that these are not books for children. There is a certain image from, I believe, the second book that crops up in my mind every once in a while that still disturbs me, and, like I said, I read these books quite a while ago.These books will never darken my door if I can help it. Yes, it's just a series of children's books, but I think it is wise to know what one's child is reading. There is subject matter that warrants discussion (like God, death, sex). There are better books out there to spend money on, with rationally written ideas in them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"haha... well you should DEFINITLY get this book! the best fantasy fiction thriller i've ever read! best book i've ever read, for that matter... the characters, storyline, plot, everything is just perfect!

So I picked up the Book on CD version of The Golden Compass from the local library. When I got in the car with book on CD, my son said that he heard the book was anti-Christian. I like to think of myself as open minded so I decided to give the story a chance. I ended up listening to all 3 books. From a performance perspective, the books on CD are fantastic. The performers deserve high marks for their abilities to deliver a story.Unfortunately, there are too many downsides to the story for me to give it a better rating than 2 stars.One of the most important characteristics of any story is the ability of an author to assist the reader in suspending their disbelief. From mediacollege.com we read: In the world of fiction you are often required to believe a premise which you would never accept in the real world. Especially in genres such as fantasy and science fiction, things happen in the story which you would not believe if they were presented in a newspaper as fact. Even in more real-world genres such as action movies, the action routinely goes beyond the boundaries of what you think could really happen.Because of the author's melding of Catholicism with the fantasy world he creates, I'm of the opinion that an undue burden is placed upon the reader. As I progressed through all 3 books, I continued to find the stories difficult to believe. The main theme of the books focus on God as bad, angels that work both for and against God and the struggle to bring down God. The whole theme of the series was distracting because these topics came in direct conflict with my belief system. In this world, there is only an evil God. As I listened to the stories, I couldn't help correcting the author's false doctrine about God in my mind.I've never read a series that is so blatant in its attempt to be anti-religious. I kept asking myself why the author would write books like this. I've read many hundreds of young adult fiction books and this series is just the strangest work of fiction that I've ever read. It's just weird.Other issues: The main character is named Lyra and in her world both premarital sex and extra-marital sex are viewed neutrally and perhaps positively. There are several mentions of unwed people having sexual relations. Blend these views with a message that is anti-God, and you have a formula that could encourage youth to believe that premarital and extra-marital sex is ok. In a young adult series, there isn't a need for this type of material. The author could have easily tweaked things so there is no mention of sexual relations.Generally, the stories have a negative feel to them. Other main characters in the book are just mean and cruel. Children are killed by adults with no thought at all. It's disturbing.Taking these factors into account, I found myself asking why the author would write a book of this type. You will have to judge for yourself. I just keep shaking my head about the whole thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am so annoyed. What are these book companies thinking?

I would encourage parents to read the books before allowing their children to read them so they can decide if these messages are appropriate, and can discuss them with their children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy can hardly be called children's fiction - sure, the main two characters are children, and the book is engaging and exciting enough to keep children's attention, but the conflicts and issues Lyra and Will, the two protagonists, deal with are hardly understandable for children.The trilogy is set in a number of parallel worlds. According to Pullman, there are a million of these, and they overlap and co-exist together in harmony, although they are all quite different from each other. Take Lyra's world, for example. Every person's soul is manifested as an animal, called a daemon, which follows its master around all their life, offering advice and friendship. The books are filled with brilliant ideas like this, but what makes the books so interesting is the fact Pullman tries to explain every single detail through science and philosophy.The main plot line is pretty complicated as Lyra and Will jump from one adventure to another, but for me, the most interesting plot line was the one concerning Lyra's mysterious parents. Her mother, Mrs. Coulter, is an enigma, and possibly the most interesting character in the story. It is also through Lyra's parents how Pullman boldly attacks organized religion, which is one of the biggest messages in the trilogy. Although the story grows weaker as it progresses (\\"The Golden Compass\\" is pitch-perfect, while \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is rather slow and sometimes dull), it works as one eloquent and smart writer's big effort. It's no Harry Potter, but it is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A Fantastic Trilogy!! Made me neglect my assignments for my university stayed up nights reading!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a fantastic trillogy. The added \\"slides\\" help give more understanding while not trying to rewrite the story.The only set back is that I just kept on reading until I had finished all three in one go."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first saw the Golden Compass movie which got me interested in the fantasy universe of His Dark Materials. I certainly enjoyed the movie, but the Golden Compass book really hooked me. Lyra's adventure is full of momorable characters, and the pace never lets up. I found it terribly hard to put the book down. And this was the case for books two and three as well.While the worlds and people and \\"people\\" of Lyra's journey are all amazing, I can't say that I enjoyed the deeper meaning of the story as much as I did the pure adventure aspects. The long revealing of Lyra's fate is intense, and I was deparately curious to finally see it all played out. But, I honestly don't think the author wrapped it up that well. What seemed so logically elaborated and tightly constructed felt rushed and frayed by the conclusion. Key secrets were never explained, and the finale felt forced, presumably to invoke a particular emotional response in the reader. The ending I was anticipating would have been not only more enjoyable, but more natural and better fitted to the rest of story.Regardless, His Dark Materials was a great ride that I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Fantastic series. I just hope the 2007-08 film doesn't ruin it. You may not like the end of the series, I don't, but everyhting else makes it worth it.

The characters are memorable to say the least with depths and stories of their own that only add to the main plot.If you enjoy fantasy, this has it all: adventure, magic, love, creatures from different worlds... it truly is a master work of art!!Warning: I believe this trilogy is too advanced and violent for any child under the age of 12 or 13, and is also a WONDERFUL book for adults and fantasy lovers."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I do not believe that it is possible to better His Dark Materials as a trilogy - as anything. I have never been so engrossed and enraptured by a work of fiction as this - it is a perfect whole, many layered and complex. Intellectually challenging, stimulating and rewarding but also humanly engaging. Will and Lyra and most of all Mrs Coulter are breathtaking literary creations. Some books flare in a burst of publicity and then age and fade away, I think that these three will grow and grow - what a way to start a century! Masterful. His Dark Materials defies categorisation - to see them as childrens books or cross-over books is a nonsense. They are books for everyone and anyone. Read them and weep."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is easily the best series I have ever read. It contains battles between god and mankind, and many other elements. When I put down the third book I was sad because there was no more. A girl named Lyra is given a compass type gadget which she learns to use, it is very usefull. A Boy named Will discovers a knife which might be the coolest thing ever made in a book. This series has an amazing plot, having twist and turns and blindsiding you with the unexpected. The series has action, love, passion, and the true desire to fix the unfixable. The connection the reader has with the characters is a huge bond. This book may be a little dark for some people, so if you want to laugh all day go read Dave Barry (A very funny guy). I could not put these down, and everyone I know says the could not either. Read these, love these, and you will agree, the best book ever written can be bought on Amazon. It's definatley HIS DARK MATERIALS."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought this series for my 10 year old son. I picked it up to glance over it and ended up getting sucked into the story. It is an absolutely amazing story. I loved it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book immediatly hooked me and I loved it. The plot, the creatures, the new world, the characters.....Everything. The story kept you turning the page after page. I then went on and read the second book. I didn't like it as much as the first, but I still enjoyed it and eagerly went on to the third. I started it and never finished. I geuss that was lazy of me, but it never really got me hooked. It just had way too many sub plots that kept on switching after every page and you had trouble keeping up with it all. Also, the story drifted away from Lyra on to Will, and placed Lyra as a character on the side. And that kind of annoyed me. Maybe, since it has been a while, I would enjoy it all if I read them over again. But I would definiatly recommend you at least read the first book(which I LOVED) and then see for yourself."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"LISTEN TO YOURSELVES!!!--warning people to shield their children from a book.

The depth of characters, the intricate plot, the twists and turns, and the emotional ties I experienced with this series was incredible. I can honestly say that when I finished the last chapter of the final book that I was sad to see it end. I still want more! And the final book really struck home with me, stirring me emotionally and making me think more about and appreciate the relationships I have with others.I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys sci-fi/fantasy and has an open mind regarding religion and the universe. I really hope Pullman writes more on the characters in these epic books!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There are so many fassets to this book that will ensure that it will be as famous in 200 years as Dickens is today.The story is artfully weaved and entwined so that it is always growing bigger and more encompasing, while retaining the sense of tension and magnitude from the begginning to the end.The characters are full of life and colour so much so that you feel you know them intimately from only a few pages of their story.I could not put down any of the books and since have read them many times, absolutley incredeible, even magical. And far and away so much better than the comparitively dull and lifeless Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Oh my gosh, there arent enough words to describe how electrifying, thrilling, heart-wrenching, and wonderful these books are. I began reading them when I was 12, and now at 16, it still brings fresh tears to my eyes when I read it. (And believe me, that is a RARE occasion!) I was a bit thrown off at first by \\"The Golden Compass\\"(Book I) because there were so many new things being put into my mind, so it may require a second read for some folks, but PLEASE don't let this stop you early in the book! I know too many people who have said they \\"didn't get it\\", and put it back on the shelf. The series has a gripping and breathtaking plot, but also many deeper meanings. And its only fantasy either. As I have gotten older, I have come across more and more facts that he refers to and basis his story off of. For example, I took an astronomy class, and found out that scientists don't know what a huge bunch of outer space matter is.(They have only discovered around 10% if I am correct.) They even refer to it as \\"Dark Matter\\"! The books are also very involved with the conflict between science and christianity. Some people may be disturbed or biased against the series for this reason, but I personally loved the way it gave me new veiws and thoughts on my beliefs on creation and God. All of these things I had never found exciting before suddenly came alive with the magic of Phillip Pullmans's writing. I HIGHLY HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy, andventure and romance. When the much-anticipated \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix\\" FINALLY came out, I found it was really quite dull compared to \\"His Dark Materials\\" Trilogy. (But I still loved it anyways!!!) So Please, I'm really begging you, TRY THIS BOOK! You won't regret it! I wish everyone I knew would listen to me when I tell them to go read it. Its sure to captivate you! Enjoy the books and I hope I helped you guys out in deciding what new book to buy!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I got the first book for my birthday, because i'm a total bookworm and everybody knows it. I finished the book and went to the library the next day and got both the second and the third. The series just blew me away.It wasn't the average fantasy-elves, magicians, unicorns, etc. It was so original and had everything you wanted. Clear pictures, totally enough action, original story line, wonderful characters, suspense, just everything.It starts out with Lyra, an orphan at Jordan College, and the first book is about her adventure into the north, finding out she has parents and who they are, discovering new worlds, and new people(or bears). In the second book she meets Will, running away into the new world, trying to save his mothers most precious possession. He recieves the subtle knife (in exchange for a couple of fingers) which lets him cut into any of the millions of worlds that exist. The third book is the best of all, and takes them through lots of worlds, including the world of the dead, and then thier parting back into thier own worlds.These books, just thinking about them gets my mind racing with the fabulous adventures these two have, and all the wonderful things happening that make you want to laugh with relief as they get out of one prediciment, and then cry as they hit another. You can read them over and over again, and always discover something you missed the time before. I've read hundreds of books, and these are definitly in the top 5. If you like fiction, get these books. I guarantee 'em."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved these books! I've never written an online review before, but I felt like I had to throw my 2 cents in. First of all, what I think makes these books great is that they are completely original. Most good fantasy is written with heavy influence from other authors, Tolkien in particular. Pullman has created something that stands alone and shouldn't have to be compared to anything else. This is not classic fantasy. It's also not typical young-adult fiction. To address some of the other reviews: no, it's not funny like Harry Potter, and no, it's not religion-friendly like CS Lewis. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. If you're very religious and easily offended, expect to be offended. I personally don't think the average under-13-year-old should read these, either. However, if what you want is an involving and heartfelt story that makes you feel and think and dream, then I've never read anything better. Also recommend: Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, Lloyd Alexander, Harry Potter."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First off, I think that you should have an open mind if you decide to read His Dark Materials. Yes, Pullman does say, very plainly, \\"God does not exist.\\" Maybe not in those words, but in words like them. And that is one of the center issues of His Dark Materials. If that bothers you, then don't read these books. But you are missing out on a _wonderful_ read.In The Golden Compass, Pullman creates a world and characters that are so three-dimensional, so completely _whole_ that it is almost hard to believe that they aren't real. And although Lyra and Pantalaimon are _far_ from being perfect, that is what makes them human. Lyra might have a stubborn streak as wide as a state, but you love her all the more because of it.With The Subtle Knife, Pullman brings a new character into play, Will, and deepens the plot. A few chapters into it and things are revealed that I would have _never_ imagined.The Amber Spyglass brings everything to a _startling_ conclusion that simply amazed me. I can't say much without spoiling everything. :p It was simply. . . _amazing_.In short, I have _never_ read any books that so _profoundly_ moved me. Pullman gives a wonderful message through these about what _really_ matters in life. The _humanness_ of these characters is absolutely wonderful, many times I started to cry and other times I was shouting in joy (and recieving _very_ strange looks from other people). You probably won't _ever_ find books this well written and well-rounded. I have recomended these books to _every one_ that I know, and the people I know that have read it agree with me - His Dark Materials are the _best_ books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are absolutely astounding. Pullman is truely a talented writer. His characters are developed so throughly and his themes have such depth that I think these should be classified as adult novels. There are many mature themes, not inapropriate at all, but deep and mature concepts, including religous conflicts and quantum physics. I would reccomend these books to older children, teens, and adults. I will note, .... I highly reccomend these books to anyone who has an open mind. Also, although I love them, I think these are even better than Harry Potter, and they'll tide you over till number five!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read this trilogy at least five times. Each time I find new pieces of the story that I did not notice the first time. An instant classic, these books are an amazing feat of literature. Pullman is a genius."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had watched the Blu-ray version of The Golden Compass and liked it a lot. That prompted me to buy the original books, especially since the second and third books were not going to be made into movies. I certainly wasn't disappointed! As I said in the title, I had a hard time putting it down even though the three novels in this omnibus edition were over 1000 pages long."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an amazing collection, I originaly purchased these books after watching the movie \\"The Golden Compass\\" which is the first book in this collection. The way the movie was written is leaves you up in the air at the end of the movie wanting more so when I found out the movie was based on a book and there was a series I purchased them immediatly.I am a new mother and I do not read much but of coarse if I want my daughter to read I need to show her it is fun so I was looking for a fun and easy to read story and this is it.These books keep me turning the page, I would compair the type of story to \\"The lord of the rings\\" the writer has a great imagination. I feel like I really know the characters.The story begins in a world similar to ours but different, the largest difference is that the characters spirit or soul is not inside their body but it portraid as an animal that talks and travels with them, adults \\"demon\\" (which is what they are called in the book) stay the same but childrens demon change based upon how they feel or the circumstances. This demon like a spirit or a soul determins your personality, and if the demon hurts the person hurts.I am trying to be very careful not to tell you too much but my parents told me about the story and that is what made me so interisted.The first book is basicaly about an experiment where the seperate the demon from the child in order to maintain control of their adult behavior. I will stop there because I can go on all day.I would recomend this series to anyone adult or child with an imagination, it is easy reading and is a wonderful story, bravo to the writer he has made me LOVE reading again."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"...

But when it finally did arrive, I had a great time reading all three volumes despite not being at my teens - since then I keep getting ads getting my attention to teens' books :P"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did not think it possible to make an interesting story involving religion, String Theory, Kids saving adults, and war, but Philip Pullman has. Do not worry about the String Theory part, as he never mentions it directly and there is no math involved. However, his ability to create an imaginary, yet believable world rivals J.K Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Despite all the controversy, I enjoyed these books. The story was very imaginative and well written. I wouldn't recommend it for the easily offended or very religious for obvious reasons (***spoiler alert***) because the whole point of the last book seems to be the premise that God is dead or not really what He claims to be.. but religious themes have always been good material for writers. And there seems to be an emphasis in this series on thinking for one's self and not accepting everything you're told at face value, which is something I think we all would do well to think about in this day and age.Altogether a very good series!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I got this book over the past weekend and spent the weekend finishing it. I'm not much of a fantasy book reader although I have, through the course of my life, read Lloyd Alexander, C S Lewis, Tolkien but I've never liked anything else in the genre. Then I heard about the controversy about this series and thought I'd read it. Also heard it was the highbrow Harry Potter.Well, let me tell you, Pullman is a genius, flat out. I don't know how he managed to craft such an intricate, vibrant, riveting trilogy with such complex themes keeping you unable to take your eyes off the page. His trilogy is proof that the physical book is not dead. This is the kind of book you need to hold and read in front of a fire through day and night until the last word is read. Then you want more.Just brilliant."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Despite what the author says, I wouldn't allow too young a child to read this trilogy. That aside, it's one of the best works of fantasy I've read in a long time, definitely not pro-religious but not the work of satan that so many have called it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Someone once described \\"His Dark Materials\\" by Philip Pullman as she gets caught, she escapes, she gets caught again, she escapes again, then she gets caught, then she escapes. This may be true but the real substance of the epic is the how and why.It is the \\"how\\" that holds the story together. We are intrigued with Lyra's ability to plan and lie her way out of trouble. Eventually it is the truth that sets her free.The \\"why\\" she is being sought and the \\"why\\" she must go on brings us many conundrums that we not only face in the tale but also in our real life.Lyra must fulfill a prophecy; however if she becomes aware of her destiny, that destiny may never happen. For those readers who have read Josef Campbell you will recognize the classic Heroine's Journey where a person coming of age must sacrifice the apron strings and face the challenge of adulthood. This includes going into a dark place and confronting an unknown which usually is ones own fears and ego. From there they are reborn to become a fully functional person in society.Oh, did I forget to tell you that this is a fun read.The Creation of the World and other business: A PlayLyra's Oxford: His Dark Materials"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love reading children's novels--I read all the Harry Potter with my grandchildren. But this trilogy stands far and above the rest in its examination of the current human condition in the context of fantasy worlds.It explores honor, justice, truth, loyalty and principle and the human psyche under circumstances both fantastic and familiar at the same time.I recommend it highly for everyone. I's not for very young children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Christian fondlementalists notwithstanding, I believe anyone from their young teens to their early hundreds would enjoy this superb story. Pullman stuffed an entire Oxford education into his pipe and blew out a whopper. This isn't a science book, this is meant to be fun, so readers who understand what fantasy means will not quibble with the particle physics. The characters are outrageous and fascinating, and the worlds they live in are full of surprises. Throughout the trilogy and almost to the very end, Pullman continually adds layers to the story, making it a rich page-turner you will whip through with delight."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First I would like to say that these books are among the top SF or Fantasy books I've ever read! In reading some other readers reviews, I noticed the only bad reviews were the ones that were worried about the religious implications. I am whole heartedly a christian, what these other people are forgetting is THIS IS A FANTASY STORY. IT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE PLACE IN OUR UNIVERSE!!! Pullman has the right to create whatever type of universe he wants. (even a hypothetical one where the Almighty ruler is not good at all)So for those of you who may be easily offended about your spiritual beliefs, remember: This book is not about OUR God, or our angels or even the Satan we are all familiar with.With that said, Pullman is what every writer should inspire to be like. Incredibly imaginitive and willing to take risks."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My then 10-year-old son introduced me to the trilogy, saying Gloden Compass and Subtle Knife were \\"the best books I've ever read,\\" and that I had to read them. They sat by our bed for two years, and then I took Golden Compass on a trip, was hooked, and couldn't put them down. These aren't just great young adult novels. They're great novels in general. I like the Harry Potter books and eagerly read the next installments, but Potter's characters look like cartoon characters compared to those of Pullman. What I love about Pullman is that people are morally complex. They aren't just good or bad. Good people end up doing destructive things, sometimes for good motives. Bad people, in fact chillingly bad people, sometimes act couragely. But qualities like honor, generosity, loyalty, caring and ravery still matter. It's a much more realistic guide to a messy world.Pullman also raises other challenging issues, like what we're doing to the environment. Without revealing too much of the plot, the image of intelligent bears fleeing the Arctic as their world melts in the face of global warming created by human arrogance will stick with me forever--as a metaphor for what we're doing to our world.One other note. A number of readers have been troubled by Pullman's seeming anti-clericalism. Indeed religious theocracy comes off very badly in the book. But when I heard Pullman speak, he mentioned that there was no figure more morally influential in his life than his uncle, an Episcopal priest, and this made sense to me. I don't see Pullman as anti-religion. In fact the book makes as eloquent a statement for humane faith-based values that I've seen. Rather, it attacks, and rightfully so, a religion that is not a religion of love, but one that is mean-spirited, controlling, and enchanted with its own power. His depictions made me think of the Taliban, or some of America's own bigoted fundamentalists, like Jerry Fallwell and Pat Robertson saying Sept 11 happened because of civil liberties groups, feminists and homosexuals.From my take, these are profoundly moral books, in the best sense, with lessons for young adults and not so young alike, with characters you care about and wrapped in an amazingly imaginative page-turning story.Paul LoebAuthor Soul of a Citizen: Living With Conviction in a Cynical Time...PS--I also think that among the few comparable books are Ursula K Le Guin's wonderful Earthsea fantasies."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found this series to be a well written, exciting fantasy experience. I urge readers to give it a chance and remember that it is fiction, taking place in an imaginary world."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read and re-read these books many times and each time I discover something I had not seen before; a new meaning, a new message. These are very well written books that tell a very well structured tale. Highly recommended, definitely a must read for fantasy lovers out there."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To describe this book in less than the 1,000 words (the maximum for reviews) would be impossible. These books are perfect. They have everything that a good book should have only 20 times better. Mystery, sci-fi, fantasty, love, all of it. Pullman takes you into other worlds and on great adventures. Lyra is the main character and as you read on you see not only her, but all the characters change and you will grow to love them. Each time that I finished a chapter I couldn't stop reading. The books went by so fast I was horribly sad when I was done. The reason I am not telling you much about the story line or the plot is because there is to much to it, and like i said before, I can't describe it in 1,000 words. I'll leave you with that.

Continuing with The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass, books that are written for teenagers will blow your mind with questions of quantum physics and the fabric of the universe. The characters are rich, complicated, and incredibly unpredictable. The trilogy is an epic masterpiece, a true classic for the ages."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I recently received the boxed set as a gift and quickly devoured it. An amazing little triad about two youngsters stuck in an epic battle between the good of wisdom and the evil of willful ignorance. And if you ever wanted an answer for the problem of evil, here it is in a nutshell. In fact, Pullman's god is probably more consistent with reality than any pseudo-god of the Bible. Christians will be left wondering: but if there's no \\"God,\\" what's there to hope for, how can I live my life, how can I make sense of anything? And that's exactly the point of the books: reality is big and complicated, and the only thing we have to count on is reality itself. For parents, these books will provide many hours of stimulating conversation about religion, ethics, and so much more. They will prove valuable, too, in tying in the horrors of the mythical church in its pages to the long, sordid history of Christian destruction in this real world (and current day scandals). So too can the books lead to an appreciation of the good some believers have done in this world in things like art and literature (Milton is, after all, the source of the series title!). For children, it will be a wonderful fantasy full of magical creatures and powers and cool adventures. It will make Narnia seem like a drab Saturday morning cartoon (sorry Mr. Tumnus). One warning though: the books are more suited for teenagers and precocious pre-teens. Some of the writing and vocabulary can become dense and there's plenty of violence."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series has been ridiculed by the ridiculous right, lauded by the loony left and, as usual, ignored by the lukewarm middle. These books are well written, have a strong moral and ethical message, and encourage free thought. And let us not also forget, they are a work of pure FANTASY! Whether or not the author had some hidden agenda is not important. The fact that the trilogy relates a fun and original story is what is important. Not suppositions based on the authors faith or lack there of.The guy is no Lewis, Jordan, Salvatore, or Tolkien, but its a good series. Have fun reading it!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first novel in this series, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" is an exciting, intriguing, awesomely inventive adventure story that I would not hesitate to award five stars. It will leave you dying to know more about the world Philip Pullman has created, and for most of its relatively brief length, \\"The Subtle Knife\\" is a worthy continuation.Unfortunately, the plot starts to unravel toward the end of the second book, and by the third, the author's anti-religion preaching takes center stage, leaving the plot and characters to tailspin out of control. Pullman doesn't seem to know (or even really care) how to resolve the many story threads he's been juggling, and the trilogy limps to a contrived, anticlimactic, unsatisfying ending. He writes himself into several corners, and the series' internal logic goes out the window as arbitrary new rules are created and characters behave in completely nonsensical ways just to keep the story going.\\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is so muddled and disappointing, you'd be better off skipping it and just imagining your own ending to Lyra and Will's story. Maybe if the author had been more concerned with maintaining the momentum and creativity of \\"The Golden Compass\\" instead of hammering home his condescending Christians-are-ignorant-sheep message, the rest of the trilogy might have lived up to the amazing first book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Loved all three books! Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are absolutely amazing. I only wish I'd have read them years ago as a child. Whatever the case, the message still holds strong. The characters are riveting, the action is immense. There was simply no way for me to put the book down. I think what drew me into \\"His Dark Materials\\" was without a doubt the messages. What Pullman was writing is nothing new, yet it was so refreshing to read the approach he took to it. I recommend the trilogy to everyone I know and ask them to read with an open mind. To allow themselves to become absorbed in the story - because it truly is a beautiful one.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are awesome, and all three must be read. The are definitely not children's books. They inspire, and even demand, a great deal of thought on the part of the reader. Most worth while."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an absolutely phenomenal trilogy. I had wanted to read \\"The Golden Compass\\" before seeing the film, and once I started I could not stop. These books are an easy read, but they are incredibly worth it, full of content and imagery and really intelligent ideas. I knew I wanted to read these when I read an interview with Phillip Pullman, in which he was amused that JK Rowling's work has been criticized for being \\"subversive towards Christian values\\" while his work has flown under the radar without any press coverage, and it is explicitly subversive and forces you to think. This trilogy ius not sacrilegious for the sake of being sacrilegious - it merely is an attempt (and an amazing one at that) to disrupt some of the Christian hegemony force-fed to the younger generation. These books were written in a direct response to overtly Christian works such as \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" by Christian theologian CS Lewis. These books are smart - they are not trying to be shocking or gratuitous, but rather exemplifying that children need to learn how to think, especially about the big issues, on their own. Pullman's incredible, amazingly detailed and intricate child protagonists do this well, and the large cast of \\"supporting characters\\" is amazing as well. Every character is painfully three dimensional, even when it would be easier for them to be monotonously simple.The long and short of it is this: This trilogy is great, for kids and adults alike. It captivates the attention and really provokes independent thought and curiosity. I have bought it for two people since I finished reading it, and recommended it to numerous others.Finally, if you saw the film version of \\"The Golden Compass,\\" well these books are immeasurably better. That is a horribly truncated and sanitized/neutered version that lacks so much of the strength the book and the entire trilogy offers."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I admit, I watched the movie before I bought the book.I wanted to see how much it differed from the book. Differ, it did. I liked the ending the book had much better - it was more cohesive and made more sense.In reading the subsequent volumes, I am looking forward to the progression in film - though I worry about the religious whack-jobs getting their two cents in out of their own fear.If faith is strong, nothing will sway a person from it. This is a S-T-O-R-Y not suggestions in life paths.... but I digress, this is about the book, not current events.All in all, the story was very engaging and a real page turner from the beginning of the Golden Compass - to the end of the Amber Spy Glass!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm not really a fan of this genre, but after hearing all of the controversy about why we shouldn't allow our children to read the book or see the movie, I thought I'd find out the facts for myself.Once I got into the first novel, I couldn't put it down. I loved the entire story. I enjoyed Pullman's writing style and looked forward to finding out what would happen next. This is not a story that I will have my children read any time soon, but only because I don't think they will be fully able to follow the plot and appreciate the trilogy for a few more years.It's not anti-God or anti-church as some have said (unless you worship a God who is a little old guy kept in a crystal box), but it does have a strong moral tale to tell. Good vs. evil, keeping promises, betrayals, loyalty, courage - all are present in this story.I want to see the film version of the Golden Compass, but I am also a little worried about doing so - I fear that the film adaptation will never live up to the written version, and I will end up disappointed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First off, as a Christian I too am concerned about Christians who deplore this trilogy and the first film without ever reading it, and warning all to avoid simply because it is anti-church. I disagree with them on these matters.It is well done fantasy writing, especially the first book. For this reviewer it truly lost its collective steam in the third and final book. The author there chooses to openly, without any literary or fantasy devices to attack his views of Christianity. This is mentioned not just to my own personal bias on theology, but just from a literary point. C.S. Lewis does no such thing. It also is so weak in its portrayal of God as ancient of days being carried around on litter with psalms being sung, and only such a brief appearance and then gone. It also left me lacking in its ending, with going back to separate universes to live lives with no real meaning, other than glorification of matter which is eternal and nothing else. That seems to be Pullman's worldview, which if so, not sure many others of us truly want to buy into. This ending coldness should be wake up call for many.Not sure at all what level a child could and should be reading this. Found that some young teenagers cannot engage with Narnia books, so not sure they would with this, but will leave that up to experts, children themselves and their parents. They too will have to make decisions about allowing children to read this series. Not up until the final work is there disputable things.Tony Watkins has provided wonderful resource (his book:Shedding Light on Philip Pullman's Trilogy) for the interested delving into possible motivators for Pullman's thrust, i.e. as his own father being taken at early age, interest in parallel universes, literary influences, etc. By the way, Tony is a fan of reading this trilogy! His website is also good and balanced perspective on such: Damaris Trust. Also, some might want to check out the interview with Tony on Issues, Etc.'s website, searching their archives for such.Informed readers will also see that Pullman adds material to his quote from Genesis 3, as well as takes liberties with describing Christian faith in way that most Christians will not relate to, i.e. that church wants to control all behavior, rather than followers of Christ.Interesting to see if this film series will continue, given the poor showing thus far of The Golden Compass. Compare this with excitement over upcoming Prince Caspian release."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I picked up this up at book store and after reading a few pages decided to buy it. Its not common without anybody's reccomendation to simply pick up a great book, but this time it absolutely happened. It is definitely the best fantasy I've ever read. The story is unpredictable with deep and complex characters. I would agree with some of the other reviews that despite the fact that the story's two main protagonists are pre-teens, the book is no Harry Potter and seems to be aimed at older audiences."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The books are very well written, the story very engaging, and it's a breath of fresh air to read the books with an open mind and not be afraid of anything, but to enjoy it for what it is, fantasy and a very wonderful story!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I took the three books on a trip to China and the Philppines. On Boracay,a beautiful tropical island, I got a really bad sunburn because I had my nose in a book and didn't pay attention to the increasing redness of my skin.There were so many fascinating ideas and points of view among the pages that I had to frequently stop to let my mind catch up. Was that a problem? Not at all! Intellectual stimulation can only make me a better person..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I thought I would review these three books as a group instead of bothering to review them one at a time. You have already read the plots on other reviews at this site I won't bother repeating them; I will just give my opinion.The first two books are BRILLIANT!! They have become my new favorite fantasy books. I wish I could give them ten stars. They are in my opinion, some of the best fantasy/adventure litariture ever written. I reccommend them whole heartedly for fans of either genre. The third book I reccomend, as well, with a few reservations. About two-thirds of it is as brilliant as the other two but the other third really craps out. I especially didn't like these things:-Father Gomez- a one-note villian, twirling his long black mustache.Pullman is capable of creating interesting multi-facetec villians (lookat Lyra's parents), but this guy was just shallow and uninteresting. Hecould be cut out of new editions of the book and no one would miss him-Mary Malone's humanistic atheistic \\"preaching\\" at the end of the novel.Talk about heavy handed! I am an agnostic so I was not offended butI'll bet a lot of readers with theistic beliefs will be..Being provoctive and challenging your readers cherished beliefs are fine butit's obvious that pullman added Malone's ending speeches just toirritate theist readers especially christians. Again, not needed forstory-The love story was very moving, and yet somewhat creepy. These kids areyounger than Romeo and Juliet! I wish the author had found a way to ageWill and Lyra somehow.I hope no one is turned off by my minor complaints about the third book. These books are my favorite fantasy novels and I highly recommend them. Also, if you like them, check out the short sequel; Lyra's Oxford."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There are many books in the world which are profoundly disrespectful of other people's dearly held points of view, but that doesn't make them any less valuable or worthwhile - even parts of the Bible come into this category. The complaint here seems to be the conscious direction of this \\"subversive\\" material at impressionable teenaged minds.Well, a liberal education will tell you that Christian teaching might be seen in certain quarters as similarly subversive (for example, to people who aren't Christian), but you don't hear too many people calling for PG ratings to be slapped on the Good Book.The point is that this is clearly a work of fantasy fiction: sure, it borrows from Christian fable, but by the same token it heavily modifies it. Several of the events upon which Pullman invites the reader's ethical judgment do not (to my knowledge) appear anywhere in actual Christian legend. Pullman made them up, so as slings and arrows against the real religion (which I don't believe Pullman intends them to be), they have no force at all.To the extent this trilogy counsels young adults to question the world view they get from organised religion - this is, I suspect, what really sticks in the craw - it seems to me to be a wholly worthwhile enterprise. I gather Pullman is not religious, but His Dark Materials is obviously informed by Blake and Milton, and fondly so, and I didn't find this an especially anti-Christian read (then again, I read as someone who is culturally but not intellectually Christian, so am probably less inclined than some to take offence)As for the content of the story, I think comparisons with Harry Potter are unfair; it's much better than that: His Dark Materials deserves to be held up against CS Lewis and JRR Tolkien; the best JK Rowling can say is that, with The Goblet of Fire and The Order Of The Phoenix, she's catching up - but as yet she has a lot of development as a writer to do.What's so nice about His Dark Materials is how imaginative it all is. Whereas Harry Potter, from Hogwarts down, is wholly derivative, Pullman treats us to new ideas: the daemon is a classic example. And his characterisations are rich indeed: Lyra is a delightfully sketched snotty-nosed urchin; Mrs Coulter is no ham-fisted villain, but a sophisticated, deceitful, agenda-pursuing adversary.I think the story gets the better of Pullman as he goes on: Northern Lights is a fairly tightly constructed tale; the Subtle Knife introduces more characters (and ditches one or two) and becomes a bit more of a yarn; by the time The Amber Spyglass is into full swing you're into a fullblown shaggy-dog story with so many different plot strands it's difficult to keep up with who's doing what to whom and why, especially as many of the characters are quite duplicitous anyway.As a result, it is impossible to cleanly tie all the plot lines up and, in the same way that Tolkien was, Pullman is obliged to provide a number of false summits before we reach the final conclusion, and when it arrives it is a little bit of a let down.The baroqueness of the plot is a flaw, but there's no denying that this is a really classy, challenging, provocative tale even for us adults."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I can't recommend this trilogy enough for freethinking and humanist teens and adults. I purchased this set after reading the series twice, I'm reading it now for the third time and enjoying it just as much as the 1st two times.If you have seen the movie based an the 1st book, please don't judge the books based on that. The movie was watered down a lot, presumably to try to appeal to a more diverse audience. Like I said, these books are for freethinkers and humanists. And perhaps those interested in humanism, that are skeptical of their faith. The overall message(without being too overbearing about it) is anti-organized religion and dogma. Pullman uses a fantasy theme to do this, with a bit of sci-fi and steampunk thrown in. In a way, it's the anti-thesis to \\"The Chronicles Of Narnia\\", which I also adore, but for different reasons."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love these books and I got them in perfect condition. These are a must-read for children,teens or young adults!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Although not normally a fan of fantasy, I loved this trilogy (conveniently contained in one thick volume) about a girl with a golden compass, a boy with a subtle knife, a woman with an amber spyglass, parenthood, childhood, the church and, most interestingly to me...death. You could write a book about this 900-plus-pages-long novel (and someone probably has). I began my experience with the story by ordering the CDs from the library and listening to the author himself perform the part of narrator (along with a group of talented persons playing the characters) while driving my car. But it got to the point where I felt compelled to read the dusty copy that had taken up a wide spot on my bookshelf for so long when I was unable to listen. Ultimately, I ended up reading most of the first part of the trilogy through to the end before listening (a second time through) to the audio version of the second and third books. The first story is that of a 12-year-old girl named Lyra, who, given an alethiometer, is able to obtain answers to any question, befriends a bear, and learns a dark secret about her mother, as well as makes friends with a boy from another world. It was my favorite of the three. The middle third follows the acquisition of the subtle life, and more about other worlds, dust, evil, and friendship. In the third installment, the plot becomes increasingly complicated (and harder, for me at least, to follow) with the introduction of even more characters and worlds and not surprising revelations about Lyra. Action, suspense and amazing, fantastic characters and concepts too numerous to count fill the story.Having learned less than 100 pages in that several bookworm friends were unwilling to read the book, I was determined to find out what the supposed anti-Christian stuff was all about. Turns out they were right; the author takes on, smacks around, and throws down (none too gently) the Church before the dust settles. As an open-minded person, I enjoyed reading something so imaginative and complex as much as I like reading stories by authors such as C.S. Lewis, who takes an entirely different tack when it comes to religion. In summary, an imaginative, complex, fantastical story about the triumph of good over evil...or is it evil over good. Also excellent: Watership Down by Richard Adams, The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien and The Great Divorce by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book was somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. The second book was sorry, maybe two or three stars. It was just a transition to get to the third book. The third book was just better than three stars. Harry Potter ended with a grand crescendo, a major event, the fight with Voldemort, that tied up all the pieces. This series tied up some of the pieces, but the bigger question of what the new order is was never broached. In book three Pullman was too spent too much time not so subtly taking jabs at the Catholic Church and Christianity by giving his story a biblical content instead of telling a good story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first read this series in high school and six years later I'm still feeling its impact. Honestly, few books have such a powerful place in my heart. The plot is absolutely riveting throughout all three books! Even when I reread them, I plow through them at breakneck speed because I'm so tense about what is to come. I could go on and on about the high fantasy and adventure of it all- the witches, the ice bears, the evil organizations, the sea-faring gyptians, the aeronauts, the battles, the jumping between worlds, the terrible North, the fantastic creatures, the narrow escapes...the list goes on.But as exciting as all that is- and it is UNBELIEVABLY so- the strength of the characters and their emotional journeys is really what connects me to it. Lyra is one of the most well realized protagonists ever written. Even though she's only half my age, she is a constant source of strength and inspiration for me. While these books would be thoroughly enjoyable for any person, of any age (12+) or gender, I especially recommend them to adolescent girls. The way society is today, wit all the pressures that young women face, there is an ever pressing need for strong, female role models and Lyra fits the bill 100%. She's comparable to Hermione of the more popular Harry Potter series- but she brings a different kind of strength to the table. Instead of being a hero's sidekick, this is HER story which makes her even more powerful of a heroine.She is truly one of the fiercest, cheekiest, bravest, cleverest, most compassionate, most PASSIONATE and most incredible female characters ever created. She's a real person, who is sometimes rude and sometimes impulsive and rash but is always driven by a genuine desire to do the right thing at all costs. She has a strength that scarcely seems possible for an eleven year old girl, but Pullman writes her in a way that is 100% believable.Watching her exciting, trying, sometimes heartbreaking journey from an innocent child who loves running wild in her Oxford home, wreaking havoc and stirring up mischief around every corner, into a wise young woman who has known life, death, love and tragedy is an experience I can't even properly express in words, though I wish I could. She grows so much, experiences so much and finds so much strength within herself. It is truly one of the most beautiful fictional journeys ever written.Aside from Lyra, there are an array of other fascinating characters. I've been rambling on for far too long to really get into it, but this story is filled to the brim with complex, fascinating, multi-layered characters. Mrs. Coulter, for example- you're left guessing about her right until the very end.These books take place in fantastical worlds with creatures and events that would never happen in our own, but they have an extraordinary ability to instill strength, bravery and self-belief in readers and I cannot possibly give them higher praise."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman does not underestimate his reader. His Dark Materials is one of those few fantasy series that is actually completely worthy of the adjective \\"epic.\\" Zeppelins, witches, and talking polar bears are just the colorful trappings of these thoughtful, fun, and refreshingly unique books. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a young adult series by an author who doesn't think \\"young adult fiction\\" translates to \\"dumbed down fiction.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I did enjoy reading these three books and they kept my interest thruout. I read them one after the other in a span of about two weeks. The first book was really involved and had a complete feeling to it as did the second. But the final book just left me wondering and feeling as if it was hurredly done and not thought thru well. These are not children's books in my estimation. I would not encourage a child under 11 to read them. They are quite dark and dramatic and scary at times."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A lot has been said about this trilogy, a collection of these stories: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass.It's all true. The adventures. The religion-bashing. Parallel universes. The stimulation of the imagination.You will find yourself pausing, and just thinking about the story you've just read.This particular volume is an economical collection of the entire tale. It's a thick book for carrying around (almost 1000 pages), and the soft-bound edition probably will not take a lot of abuse in backpacks. Nevertheless, it will be a classic in the young adult fantasy genre.At one time, Lyra and Will are in a conversation with a scientist, Mary, who finds a way to communicate with Shadows. Will asks her if she believed the Shadows really were angels, as they claimed.\\"'Ah, but I knew about them. I used to be a nun, you see. I thought physics could be done to the glory of God, till I saw that there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway.

It hasn't so far."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"books arrived early and in perfect condition. i recommend these to anyone who likes sifi/fantasy. story is similar to The Chronicles of Narnia, even though Lewis was a professed Christian and Pullman is a professed atheist the stories have a similar feel to them.

It's beautiful cover and quality thick paper do complete justice to the magical content it contains."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy while seemingly running along the same line as harry potter and other sci-fi/fantasy books, runs it own course. The deeper implications and philosophical questions which start to fully materialize in the second book, only place pullman's work to where it belongs; along-side caro, rowling, and tolkein."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought this series because it was recommended for Harry Potter fans and I was having trouble finding books that I really enjoyed after rereading Harry Potter so often. I really didn't want to read another \\"children's\\" book. This series I really got into and found it hard to put down. I was a little disappointed in the last book. It was still a great book but the story line in the first two was much stronger."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A friend recommended \\"His Dark Materials\\" to me during a discussion of books we loved as children and teenagers -- the ones that we still enjoy. So far I've read them twice and given them as gifts to several more friends. Pullman has an astounding imagination and is a very, very gifted writer. If I were a writer, this is the kind of book I'd want to write. By the end of the third book, I felt the characters were close personal friends whose company I was about to lose -- so I went back and immersed myself in their world again.I'm not sure I would recommend this series for children; it's intelligent and enthralling, and the main characters are pre-teens (just), but some kids are going to find it too much. I think it depends very much on the individual child; my brothers read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" around age nine, while I didn't get into it until adolescence, and this might require the same kind of judgement call. But kids who are ready are going to be swept away -- there are no punches pulled, no dumbing down, and the young protagonists are fully fleshed-out and incredibly vivid people.I am a fan of SF and fantasy, but I'm not sure you have to be to like these books; the issues they deal with are much more complex and transcendent."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'd forgotten that books can be this exhilarating and enjoyable. Philip Pullman has done some wonderfully imaginative things with the worlds he creates in the His Dark Materials trilogy. Particularly cool are the armored bears, great intelligent polar bears who craft semi-magical armor for themselves and live in a roughly ordered society. His conception of daemons as magical creatures that each and every human possesses, that are able to shapeshift until their human partner reaches puberty, is also a stroke of genius. There were other elements of the books that impressed me deeply, but I won't go into them for fear of ruining a pleasant surprise for anyone who decides to read them.It's been a long time since a book kept me up reading until 4 AM, but these three books all gripped my imagination with such intensity that I plowed through them as quickly as I could.These books were first recommended to me as being on par with the Harry Potter series, but I've found Pullman's work here to be far superior to Rowling's. It's more richly detailed, more imaginative, more deeply thought-out, is stocked with more interesting and well-realized characters, and is more compelling and entertaining at all turns. Clearly Pullman was writing for a more mature audience than Rowling, but he still stands head and shoulders higher as a writer and world-maker.If there were any justice in the world, Philip Pullman would also be an insufferably famous multimedia star."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A wonderfully complex series of books that keeps the action rolling and makes the reader think. Fast paced and very unique. Nothing reminds me of any other book I've ever read. A superb work for young and old alike."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was searching for the boxed set and not a lot of places had them. I had to buy them individualy, and they werent cheap that way. But when I searched for them on amazon they had the set and it was well worth my money."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is one of my favorites of all time; up there with Harry Potter and Madeline L'Engle's works. The world Pullman creates is rich and full of life, and the characters pop out. These books are not light, fluffy reads, however. There is darkness, death, war, and some pretty heavy philosophical and theological themes throughout. It can be read and understood by children, but I would recommend parents read them first and decide if they feel their children can handle some of the book's themes. I would say 10 is around the age that children might truly begin to appreciate this series.Many people seem to feel these books are anti-God, and if one reads the series, it becomes quickly apparent where that opinion comes from. However, these books are NOT anti-God or anti-afterlife... they are ANTI-RELIGION. Some may feel that these are one and the same, but they are not. The \\"God\\" featured in the book is not actually God, but a tyrant who was the first created, and CLAIMED to be God to those who came after. It is a commentary on the controlling and sometimes cruel nature of religion; not of God. In order to appreciate this theme, one must look beyond the surface of what appears and find the metaphor buried within. Really, the reality of God is left open to interpretation by the reader. There is also a predominant theme throughout the series of an obsession with \\"loss of innocence\\" (attaining puberty) and \\"sin\\" by the religious figures in the book. This is another commentary on religion's control over the masses.Truly, Pullman has created a beautiful fantasy world and a thrilling tale which happens to be wrapped around a thread of philosophy. If nothing else, it is worth discussing and thinking about, even if one does not agree with the ideas being presented. The characters are varied and deep, each with a culture and background of their own. There is Iorek, the armoured bear... Lee, the sharpshooter from Texas... tiny warriors who ride dragonflies, live only 7-10 years and attack with poison spurs on their heels... witches, gypsies, and so many more. It is a little science fiction meets fantasy, with strange and wonderful creatures. It is a very real story (excusing the fantasy elements, of course). Life isn't fair and there aren't always picture-perfect endings... such is reality. The story is fairly dark, but there is strength and obstacles overcome and overwhelming love, as well."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Anyone who enjoys well written fantasy will be pulled into these books by the dazzling invention and tight plotting. You'll stay up late turning pages to find out what happens next. But the first protaganist is unlikable, the characterization in general is weak, and in the third book it dawned on me why: Pullman is more concerned with his polemic against what he perceives the beliefs of the Christian church to be, than with his characters or his story. The two male \\"angels\\" who are desperately in love with each other are such a self-conscious anti-stereotype that I realized the author was more concerned with scoring points against his understanding of Christian belief than with story-telling. That's fine--I'm a committed Christian, yet I don't mind being asked to think. But it's the difference between this trilogy and The Lord of the Rings (grand in a way this cannot be), or the Harry Potter books (less inventive but more charming), which are vastly different from each other, and from His Dark Materials. Story comes first in those books, despite obvious parallels to the \\"real\\" world. Pullman has written an allegory, which Tolkien and Rowling did not. It's still a great read--don't worry about the fact that you don't care about the characters, and enjoy Pullman's imagination. Not for children, though! It has moments of real horror."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Its a great Book, and it has this section called Lantern Slides, that are some pages after each book that narrate a few facts that the author did not include in the book..it wonderful !"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am usually not a fictional reader.

You can't ask for more in a story.A small complaint I had was that The Golden Compass had a little star in the corner of the cover that said \\"Motion Picture coming in 2007\\". I would have preferred that my book not have that, and the picture in the Amazon description didn't show it. But just a minor complaint."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Mr. pullman has created a believable world where young and old can escape. I am so glad that I bought the entire set so that I did not have to wait to go from one book to the next.

I find myself imagining what my daemon would have been."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These are beautiful, original stories. Some people were put off by the athiest message, but that's part of what I found so refreshing about it. (Nobody complained about the stifling religion in madeline l'engle's work) If you would have paid attention, however, you would have seen that the message was a powerful and positive one: Live life to its upmost and love it. That the most important place is where you are. That ordinary human beings (Lyra was meant to be ordinary- she is an anyone Girl) have the capability of doing great things.Live life so that you'll have a great story to tell once you meet \\"the after-death harpies\\", as it is. The other part I found refreshing and lovely about the dark material books is just the story in itself. The daemons, the pansebjorns- it was all just wonderful. And for a time I was really there. Not to even be compared with harry potter. These far surpass those stories in literary merit. These are beautiful books, Pullman!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I LOVE this trilogy! i recomend it to anyone who likes Harry Potter but wants more complicated things! its amazing! its so COOL! its so intellecual!

I beleive these are the greatest books I have read, and probably everwill have read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I see a number of people comparing this series to the Harry Potter books, when in fact they are not at all alike. Where Potter falls into the 'shallow adventure' category, the Pullman books harken back to when children's literature had a great deal to say. One reader referred to it as 'a polemic against the church,' and I leave it to you to determine if this is the case - I certainly found my breath taken away as the scale and scope of the story was revealed in the third book. His Dark Materials has an awful lot to say, and certainly isn't the candy-coated drivel so much of children's literature is today. It does have larger goals, and you may not agree with what's being said, but isn't that what literature is supposed to be about?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I can't believe how amazing these books are!! They are writen for young adults but everyone can appricate these books. They are so compleate; the setting, characters and plot are believable while compleatly unique and imaginitive. This is not the kind of series that you can read just one of; they fit together almost like one book. If anyone tells you it ends too sad, don't believe it. the ending is satisfing because nobody can live happily ever after."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Bought this after seeing the previews for the movie. I was looking for something to read at lunch and this sounded quite interesting. Too bad once i finished Golden Compass I had no desire to read Subtle Knife. Nothing really happens in the story to draw you in and make a connection with the characters. Everything that happens is either over explained or not explained at all. But the idea behind the story is interesting, so I won't say \\"do not buy\\". Some people obviously like Pullman's writing style, I am just not one of them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Full disclosure: I am adult reader who is a fan of \\"pre-teen\\" literature. While the Potter series satisfies with plot, action and descriptive prose, this one satisfies at a deeper level. It has a philosophical/theological angle that is thought provoking, and while some might say anti-church I would say more like anti-authority. There are still plenty of spiritual ideas to ponder."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is the closest thing to a \\"Rowling meets Tolkien\\" epic I have found. Pullman takes us on a thrilling ride, seen through the eyes and world(s) of young Lyra. Her quest to find out the truth about her parents and to help her father quickly turns into a life-and-death encounter with countless \\"baddies\\" and many new friends. Her far-reaching adventures are sure to please readers fascinated by intertwined worlds, witches, magical gadgets, pseudo-science, and retro-tech visions of zeppeliners in combat with talking bears. Pullman's concept of daemons - basically souls incarnate as animal companions - is brilliantly executed and plays a central role in the story.But thankfully, Pullman wants to do more than just entertain with some fancy antics in a fantasy world. The underlying plot is about budding adolescense and the ensuing loss of innonence (and beginning of responsibility), the fundamental conflicts between good and evil, faith and facts, sin and free will, and as he moves towards the conclusion of the trilogy, Pullmans's rooting in classic english literature as well as his courageous ambition to make a controversial point becomes clear. The series quite successfully raises questions about authority, power and destiny, and the fact that the story sheds light on the hypocrisy and dubious morals of the church and questions the value of dogmatic religion may well rattle some parents and unprepared readers alike.Beware, people get maimed and die, children are orphaned and scared, the good turn out bad and it's all quite a bit more realistic (for want of a better word) and nuanced than in the world of Harry Potter. On the other hand, there is less of Tolkien's (in some people's opinion) long-winded poetry, and the resulting balance is sure to please many."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you want to read the most amazing book ever written, buy this series. If you love fantasy, buy it. If you hate fantasy, buy it. Atheists should read it for the most incredible experience ever. Christians should read it, even if it is \\"anti-God\\". If you are a Christian, then you should buy this series and read it. Your morals may be questioned, but you will think as you have never thought before. Read these books. Please."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It has been years now since I've read this wonderful trilogy. I recentally noticed them on my little brothers bookshelf and picked them up.I am just starting to read again and remember. I can probably say without a doubt that His Dark Materials has influenced me more heavily than any other story since. After finishing The Amber Spyglass, I cried. It was too good to be over. I distinctly remember telling my mother I would never read another book again--that it was too painful.Regardless of how popular this book is in the future, I will keep it around to give to my children.I recommend this to everyone."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this when I was 14, and was brainwashed by Pullman's Anti-Religion theme. Oh... wait... sorry, no I was already Atheist, never mind then.While other's may have you belive that these books are dangerous to children, I must pose the question, are religous beliefs so fragile that a childhood of going to ceremonies, performing various rituals, reading Holdy texts, and being schooled in your religion so easily washed away by a fictional novel? Why are you threatened by such harmless fantasty? Indeed, it is almost self fulfilling how religous response to Pullman's books have the very dark, controlling, characteristics as \\"The Authority\\" (or God) in Pullman's books.Further more, is it right to limit the reading of your children to books only you think are appropriate?Who's doing the brainwashing now?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't read much fantasy or sci-fi anymore but was intrigued when I saw the movie poster recently. I thought perhaps I could read it with my son but quickly realized the child-snatching plot in the first book is too fearful for kids under 10 or 12. The second book sets up the great conflict that is resolved in the third, final book. I enjoyed this trilogy very much. I did find some of the character dialog a little stiff (for my tastes) and the two protagonists, Lyra and Will, mature beyond belief. The closing chapters devoted to tying up the loose ends got too maudlin for me. Overall, though, this was a \\"ripping good\\" yarn.Many other reviewers have pointed out Pullman's anti-religion basis for this story. I would also warn off anyone for whom belief in God, original Sin, heaven-and-hell as the Afterlife, etc. is essential to their spirituality. This story negates all of that. There is no doubt that the \\"Church\\" antagonist is the Catholic church. But Pullman also devotes as much to the idea that Love is the greatest power, that Knowledge can be used as much to help people as it is used to keep people in fear and want. Add to that the themes of heroism and sacrifice and I have to say that there is much more to these books than being \\"anti-religion\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This beautifully written trilogy is a fantastic telling of how a young girl and boy come of age in a realm full of mystery, magic and danger.Pullman intelligently borrows from history and quantum physics to portray a universe which is inherently conscious, intelligent and benevolent. At the same time, he exposes organized religion as a repressive force which distorts the true nature of God and places limits on human spiritual development. In so doing, he introduces us to the folly of core Judeo/Christian religious beliefs that include the notion that man is basically evil and in need of salvation.Pullman returns the kingdom of God to it's rightful heirs -- the children -- who are born innocent, corrupted only by the distorted beliefs of self-righteous adults.For me, this was not only a beautifully written, fantastic tale full of interesting plot twists and courageous protagonists, it was an excellent introduction to destructive religious thinking. For those of us who's desire it is to raise children who trust their own divine nature and believe in their own innate goodness, His Dark Materials is a wonderful expose of organized religion's most corrupt and virulent beliefs. By far better than two weeks of summer bible school!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is the closest thing to a \\"Rowling meets Tolkien\\" epic I have found.

Chew on that for a bit."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's trilogy seemed to me a hodge-podge of scattered bits of oversimplified popular 'theoretical physics' and something that vaguely resembles theosophy. They periodically pop up but don't linger long enough to enlighten the narrative nor to captivate the young reader. The off-handed references to complex theories in quantum mechanics, for instance, take an unsuspecting reader by surprise and are fillers at best. At worst they are simply pretentious.The books are not very well written and are full of violence and 'action.' The author never takes his time to allow the narrative its natural flow.The moral relativism that prevails in the books is useful for young people to reflect on but Pullman takes it to a radical extreme and ironically turns it into a sort of absolutism by stripping the characters' moral choices almost entirely of any context other than that of 'the epic war.'As to the Tatars, they are the peoples of the Steppe of Asia and used to roam in the present territories of Mongolia and the former Soviet Republics such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. They were dependent on their cattle and never settled at the North Pole."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am agnostic and not a religious person. However, these three novels are anti-christian and anti-catholic in particular. They substitute another religion in place of Christianity. They deal with organized religion as an absolute evil.The stories are not nearly as well written as the Harry Potter novels. The universes they portray are dark ones. The title of the trilogy: \\"His Dark Materials\\" is a fitting one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These are really great books, and you should ignore all the \\" not for kids \\" nonsense.Will kids really understand the full meaning?I really recommend these.I wish Philip Pullman had added more to the series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I slogged through the first two books and kept hoping for some more character development. By book three, I was worn out. I couldn't get beyond the first paragraph of book three. The writing is a perfect entry for one of those horrible writing contests; \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"... style."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I must say, I saw the preview for the first book in this series and was completely taken with it. It looked like exactly the type of thing I love. But I did some digging first, because I heard my sister make a comment about the series that piqued my curiosity (and foreboding) about the author, not just the book. Among other things, I discovered that Mr. Pullman is an atheist (okay, fine, it's a free world, right?) and that in these books, to an increasing extent, he shrouds an attempted rebuttal of religion, faith, and God Himself with some spewings about how \\"it's just how he perceived God for the story,\\" and so on and so forth. Most of us know that.It is possible for Christians to support and love fantasy, even \\"secular fantasy\\" (which arguably is the home of the wonderful, outstanding Harry Potter series), unless it's not fantasy, but rather one man's degrading and absolutely off-center portrayal of many things that believers profess. No doubt to erase questions in his own mind, Pullman, like others, has insisted that the portrayal of God and the Church (what an original \\"fantasy\\" subname for the real church, eh?) is a completely generalized treatise on religion. Again, if that were the case, fine. Religion is as manmade as a microwave. God, and faith, however are NOT, and this seems to be something Pullman believes he has tapped into. Indeed, he has dabbled in something deep (which I think he will regret at some point, either in this life or the next) but it has nothing to do with truth. Rather, escapism. That's where the fantasy comes in for people like him.But the whole point of this review is to caution other Christians or even others who hold to no particular faith but want to avoid the occassional grotesque offering of children's literature. As an example: Most of us, Christian or not, can find something about C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia to cherish. For most of us, it's a wonderful tale (but not a story, in this respect) that speaks to us on a spiritual level, as well as a delightfully engrossing, humorous, and entertaining read. And even non-Christians usually agree with the latter. They're just good books. In more ways than one. However, Pullman disagrees. This quote of his, among others, was enough for me to chuckle to myself and decide that Pullman's work will never intentionally be read or seen by me:\\"But there is no doubt in the public mind that what matters is the Narnia cycle, and that is where the puzzle comes, because there is no doubt in my mind that it is one of the most ugly and poisonous things I've ever read.\\"I sense poison indeed, but it's coming from another direction entirely than Lewis."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I purchased this set for my cousin for Christmas. He loves the books, but when he was about 20 pages into the first book, it skipped to page 100. All the pages are there, but they were not in order and some of them are bound upside down. He does love the books, but finding the pages has been somewhat challenging."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ordered this product on a Saturday and it was delivered on Tuesday even with normal delivery.....very satisfied"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It was after the whole BBC's \\"The Big Read\\" that the Dark Materials trilogy came to my attension (it being in the top five finalistss). I saw the first book in a shop the week after and bought it, and eventually read all three novels.I must admitt that the way that Pullman adresses the ideas of religeon in this controversal way is fun to read. I also can't deny that Pullman has one of the greatest imaginative brains that I have come across in an author. But I found it quite dull really - it never reallly held me as well as much as most other books have."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Absolutly one of the best fantasy series I have ever read. The characters are vivid and real and the plot sucks you in so fast you'll find yourself reading into all hours of the night. Absolutly fantastic, a must read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy by Philip Pullman is absolutely enthralling. I read all three books, during my week-long Christmas break from work. I highly recomment these books to anyone interested in other similar books such as the Harry Potter series, The Chronicles of Narnia, etc. They are like chocolate cake for the imagination!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"What could say in such a short space about a work so complex, rich and beautifully crafted? On the surface, the story is superb and fast-moving, the characters are enthralling and solid, and Mr. Pullman's imagination cobbles together elements that have never before been juxtaposed -- magic, physics, religion, animalism, society. I know that these books have layer upon layer of allegory -- how to start to tease them apart I do not know -- but I cannot wait to read them again, to try to get at that kernel that is contained in such an intricate work! If I could give this work 6 stars, I would not hesitate to do so."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The amazing trilogy, His Dark Materials kicks off with The Golden Compass, where in a strange world with winged daemons as companions and the elusive Dust which has the power to unite universes, a girl named Lyra begins her quest to find her friend Roger. She travels far and wide to the snow ridden landscapes of the North. Lyra finds her twisted mother to be in charge of an experimental post on children in the North. The story unravels as Lyra, joined by Will in the Subtle Knife, tries to save the universe from her destructive mother and father.All three books grab your attention from start to finish, even if you don't like fantasy that much, the pure adventure will take you away. But, not suitable for anyone under ten years old due to the odd scary moment."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I didn't think there was another fantasy series that could compare with ones like Narnia or Harry Potter, but I was very impressed with these books and couldn't put them down. They're great because the fantasy world is convincing and you fall in love with the characters. Lyra is one of the strongest little-girl characters I've ever heard of, which is reason enough for little girls to read it, I suppose. (and everyone else!)The Golden Compass is my favourite of the trilogy, but thank goodness there was more to read! The Amber Spyglass wraps up the trilogy in a moving way.I would reccomend picking up the first book and seeing if you get hooked!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Enjoyed this series. Wasn't as easy for me to read as some other books, but the stories are great."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book takes you on a wonderful journey through worlds so rich and fantastical that you will wish they really existed.

I was hesitant to read it beucuase the summary on the back was misleading but i decided that i would give it a try and im glad i did.Telling an excellent fantasy through the eyes of two teenagers is great when a teenager wants to read it.Phillip pullman has in his books new kinds of fantasy like for example their animal companions. He tells it in such a good way that no one will ever be able to copy it.All im trying to say is that if you need a new book to read (and i know i say this on most of my reviews) then pick this up!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phenomenal. These books grab you and will not let you go. Pullman's characters are believable and moving, with a fantastic plot line. I am a big fan of The Lord of the Rings, but His Dark Materials honestly surpasses Tolkien's epic. I won't ruin the plot for you, but this is one trilogy that you must read! Another terrific fantasy, but definitely one for older readers, is King and Straub's The Talisman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"WOW! These have to be the best books I ever read, aside form Lord of the Rings. These books are way better than Harry Potter. They are much more origanl and will keep you on the edge of your seat with many questions. There are a lot of twists and turns as well. I know that I will read these books more than once. If you love Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, or if you are just a Fantasy/Science-Fiction fan (like me), or even if you just like a good book now and then, then these books will leave you more than satisfied."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is my absolute favorite trilogy ever. I love Lord of the Rings, which I read previous to 'His Dark Materials'. Of course the Rings are a classic. The basis for most fantasy books. However, there is something truly unique about this particular fantasy trilogy. It's very postmodern. A book where you can't quite distinguish whether it should be for children or adults. But, in a good way. It is a wonderful combination of a fantasy that is brillantly whimsical and childlike, but it is not condescending to a young person's understanding of life. It is a wonderful coming of age trilogy. Great for age 11 and up. It is a MUST read, whether you agree with the criticisms or not. It is something that you have just got to read for yourself. It is heartbreakingly beautiful. My husband even cried at the end. I did too, but I can't figure if it was because of the story, or because it had to end!P.S. PLEASE ignore the previous review that makes comentary on christianity. They were burning Harry Potter books in parts of the world because they though that the \\"magic\\" was satanic. If you are going to read a fantasy, understand it is a FANTASY. We need to enjoy ourselves and not read so much into whether an author meant to make a commentary on religion or not. Books are to enjoy and you certainly will enjoy this one. Let your imagination run wild! It's a great one!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love this trilogy and have gotten all of my friends who read to read it to. It must say something that there are already 150 reviews on this book!! I think his opinion of religion is right on. Just look at what has happened historically. I disagree with some though I think the main protagonist is great, she is brave, thoughful, caring and tough. I wonder if she was a man if people would not like her more. I am hooked on reading all of his works right now. Interesing review this month in Vanity Fair on him, and he was covered in BBC all month. Very though provoking. With the violence on television that is prevalent I see no harm in a mature child reading this trilogy. Enjoy!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is one of my favorite series, along with Madeleine L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time Series, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series, Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern series, and Tolkien's books; but do not compare them, they are all very different, and written for different audiences. Having spoken to an acquaintance of the author's, I believe (from his comments) that these books were written for an older audience- adults, even, though you would not guess it from the beautifully illustrated covers. The stories become progressively darker and more complicated, and I believe there is quite a bit of symbolism. Before writing these books off as anti-religious, I would read them with a \\"Great Books\\" view- why did he use this... or have this character say or do... . I would really be interested in hearing Philip Pullman discuss these books. I have read the series three times, and have enjoyed the books more each time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many young readers will, I'm sure, move from the simple action-based stories of Harry Potter to this more complicated and subtle fantasy trilogy. A beautifully written and well-thought out series, it is contemporary fiction at its best: it enchants while it encourages thought and debate. Do your kids (and yourself) a favor: get these books and read them together."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"these books were fabulous! i got the first one for christmas when it first came out, and read it about a dozen times waiting for the next two books. i read the other two, and was just as delighted. as usual, with most of my books, i got some friends hooked on them too. unfortunately, we think the third cuts off too soon, and are going to write to mr. pullman to ask him for aanother installation....at least one more book. otherwise, they were great!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read a lot of Phillip Pullman's books, but this series is by far the best. My favorite book in the series was the first one, the Golden Compass, but I was not disapointed at all by the rest of the books. Some people think the series critisizes the Catholic church. You're not supposed to take it that seriously-that's why they're called fantasy books. This series is extremely good, and I reccomend it to everyone except those who absolutely hate fantasy or science fiction books (although I cannot imagine someone like that)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are one word: amazing. I just picked up the book one day and before long I couldn't stop reading! I rushed through The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and the Amber Spyglass in a month, and I was heartbroken to see the last page. These characters (especially Lyra and Will) are very realistic and you wish (and feel) that you are there with them.One thing that concerns a lot of people is religion. Pullman is NOT anti Christian in any way, shape, or form and you are just crazy if you think so. I have one more thing to say: stop what you are reading now and pick up a copy of The Golden Compass and start reading!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After becoming a fan of Harry Potter at the age of 24, I thought I'd try some more young adult fantasy and see what it was like. I stumbled upon these books on this website and found them at my local grocery store and couldn't put them down. I was desperate for the third book because the third wasn't in the grocery store. The books are fascinating reads. The creativity is immense, possibly more so than Rowling's because of the breadth of the stories. And Pullman's actions and descriptions are so detailed that I feel like I'm right there. They're wonderful!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One of my friends suggested this book to me because I told him I wanted a book like Harry Potter but a little more. After I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down. After I finished the Golden Compass I just HAD to read the other two. These books will make you laugh and cry. My personal favorite, the Amber Spyglass, was truly breathtaking! Even though these are one of my favorite books I wouldn't recommend any of Pullman's other books. I'm 12 and I would recommend this to people 11 and up because of the way Pullman \\"graphics\\" some of his scenes. I felt sick at times.Well, I don't think I would even be reading without these books. I would hate it if I went through life without reading this. I felt like a changed person hen I finished this series"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I first started reading the first book I was reading until 12:00PM! Then my mom told me to go to bed. I kept thinking about the book all night. It was such a good book that I began to beleive that I was Lyra, the main character. I cried at some parts of the book and at some parts I burst out laughing for no reason at all. I highly reccomend this book and I hope my information will help you. Philip Pullman is a fantastic author and I would so much love to meet him. Before I read his books my favourites were Harry Potter and any Jacqueline Wilson books. I just hoped the story could go on forever..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series is really cool. I read it when I was 10-11 and I didn't quite get it. Maybe that was a good thing. I just read it, was like \\"Ok, that's cool.\\" and went off doing my own thing. Now I just reread it and had no idea how much I was missing, and I'm no dummy. I still think that I don't understand it all still. I would recommend this to adults with an open mind.(...)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books, all 3, are really captivating. I admit, to me, the first in the series (the golden compass) isn't as great as the rest. You have to be totally focussed on the reading, because the plot twists and the developments can confuse you otherwise.Favorite series for life!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is my favorite fantasy series of all time. Incredibly engrossing and inventive, it's an easy read while still having very deep ideas and valuable meaning."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found the first book in the trilogy very difficult to get into, with it being set in an alternate universe. The reader made to accept a lot of strange ideas and concepts which do not get fully explained until later on in the book. Devotees of the fantasy genre may absorb the narrative a lot easier than I did. The story of Lyra is a dark one and is richly explored as she makes her way through her world to the North Pole and the end of the story.The second book was much more conventional in its story-telling and I found it easier to follow. The character of Will is introduced (who appears to come from our universe) and joins Lyra in her adventure. The appearance of Will allows questions to be asked from our perspective and the two children are given some freedom from adult characters introduced in the first book. By the end of the book, plot lines are being weaved through lots of different universes and Will's character is firmly established as an important part of the story to come.The Amber Spyglass is, again, completely different to the preceeding book. The story matures with the main characters, Lyra & Will, and explores emotional and spritual concepts to dramatic end. Complex issues relating to religion, life and death are examined rationally and not without reason. Ultimately the story is thought-provoking, which is what a good book should do.Overall, I found the trilogy incredibly \\"thoughtful\\". It's remarkably complex, yet very readable at the same time. I would advise parents to read this trilogy before their children, in preparation for the avalanche of questions that will arise from its reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ok, i've read through many of the reviews and in a few there is an obvious dislike of this trilogy for reasons of literary \\"flaws.\\" I agree that there is a lacking of information in some areas and a general lacking of characterizations and explainations of complicated events, yet to me, literature of this sort is a means of sparking ideas into the readers and open their imaginations to new planes of thought. When you read with your mind open and your heart too, everything flows quite wonderfully, and Pullman paints a wonderfully brilliant world full of life and movement at every turn. Personally i think the plot is golden and very very BIG...perhaps that is why Pullman was unable to tie together every loose end he had created, but that is no reason to shun such a wonderful and explosive novel. Yes, i would have liked to see a few different things happen in the third book, yet I would still recommend this trilogy to anyone. This is one of the most exciting and profound fantasy/sci-fi series i've read since i don't know when. OH and just a message to all you conservative people, Loosen UP! People who reject this book because of it's theme and message really didn't understand it at all, read it yourself...And i DO think this is an excellent read for both adults AND kids alike. (especially teens.)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read about 60-70 Sf and Fantasy books per year, and these books blew my mind. Mr. Pullman has created one of the first new fantasy concepts that I have come across in the last 10 years. While these are technically children's books, they are definitely not as \\"cutesy\\" as Harry Potter or other, similar, works. These books are a truly engrossing read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is definitely one to read. All the books are very fast-paced and interesting."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In short, this was absolutely the best series of books I have ever read. Philip Pullman manages to create a world that you feel a part of equipped with a cast of characters that you will love and cherish. The series can at times seem heart-wrenchingly sad, hopeful, or deeply philosophical. Although I do not recommend this series for children under the age of 13, I do think that teenagers and adults alike will adore the adventures of Lyra, the ever-endearing Pantalaimon, Will, and many more. And at a great bargain like this, you should definitely buy this now!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It has surprised me that this book can even be compared to Harry Potter. I have been a huge fan of His Dark Materials series since i first laid my hands on the Golden Compass. This has everything a reader could want, magic, suspense, cunning, love and leaves the reader basking in wonder. What can possibly happen to the characters next? The aggravation I went through waiting for the Amber Spyglass, imagine waiting for years for this amazing novel to finally arrive. These three books are at the very top of my list and i recommend them to anyone who does not mind spending sleepless nights completely glued to them. Philip Pullman is an amazing storyteller and you will never know what to expect next. Consider yourself lucky to have the full collection all at once."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is one of the best books i have ever read, it is better than Harry Potter and anyone who compares the two is mad, Pullman creates an exiting new world and shows it through the eyes of caracters so amazing you will fall in love with them, Lyra, Will, Iorek, and the rest of the gang will blow your mind, it was funny, exiting, and even heartbreaking, i do recomend that this book be considerd for teens mostly because at some point it may be confusing, but it has nothing to do with the opinion of others who say it is '' questioning gods existence'' , that is not true after all its only fiction, i recomend this book to anyone it is a great pice of literature."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read this book because of the movie publicity and out of curiosity due to all the hype about it being anti-religious. Not only was it not really anti-religious, it was also not good. It is really poor writing. Nothing really makes any sense, the characters kind of come and go with no closure, the ending - well there is no real ending. When religion is mentioned, it isn't negative, it just makes no sense. The book is a waste of time. It's almost a decent adventure story but because it has no point and no ending it just left me mad that I had wasted my time reading it. I won't be reading any of the others."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Keep in mind that even though a parent can tell a child not to do, say, read or listen to anything, most certainly their child's friends have parents that do let their children do those same things. Their friends will share these books with your child and they WILL read them.I am a devout Christian believing in what the Bible teaches, and the Bible clearly teaches that all God's children (young & old) have the freedom to choose for themselves in all things. It would be much better to be involved with everything your child does, including what they are reading. There is no better education for a child's future than to face what the future may hold together.All the other books mentioned, such as, The Hobbit series, Harry Potter, etc. are listed as Science Fiction and Fantasy (nowhere are they listed as non-fiction) the same as the Philip Pullman series. What we do, as well as, many of my friends is to let our children know that these books are works of fiction and fantasy before they read them or watch the movies. We also explain what fiction and fantasy are. We also read the books and generally find them entertaining and imaginative. We in no way read them as a guide for life, they are just for entertainment and explain this to our children as well. We can then have an educated discussion with our children and answer any questions that may be generated by the books with credibility.An example -- Harry Potter has been deemed not worthy by many of my Christian friends and did not let their children read or watch any of the movies, even though they had never read the books themselves. Unfortunately, one of my friend's two boys went to a friend's birthday party and all the children watched a Harry Potter movie. My friends were not prepared to talk with their boys when they had questions. My friends decided they needed to watch the movies, and in doing so, found they were very entertaining and imaginative. After that, they found it easy to explain to their boys that it was all make-believe and nothing to be afraid of.Another example - Friend's of mine had explained to their 2 year old that Harry Potter was just make-believe, that their was no such thing as magic, etc. And that the movie was just for fun. We were watching the movie at a holiday gathering when the little boy thought an adult was scared by the movie. He went over to the adult and very seriously told him, \\"Don't be afraid, it's just make-believe, there's no such thing as magic\\".Imagination, open discussion and the freedom to choose is what makes our world go round. Without it, what a boring world we would live in. I believe that is also called a \\"dictatorship\\".The amount of stars I gave has no bearing because I have not yet read these books, I just wanted to give an alternative option."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the entire harry potter series very much, but phillip pullman's his dark materials is even better!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Read The Golden Compass and if you really like it, then read The Subtle Knife. But don't bother with The Amber Spyglass. It does not supply a satisfying conclusion to the series and doesn't hold together as a story, but hops from one character and universe to another with no apparent point to several of the plot lines."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a 3 book series of some fantastically written fiction about life in made-up, intermingling worlds different than our own, but with many similarities. The first book of the trilogy, Northern lights, was so good I got the second book as soon as I finished it. The second book, The Subtle Knife, hinted at the books main plot and because it was a very twisted view of some very real beliefs I was hoping the author was going to redeem himself by the end of the 3rd book and not continue in what he seemed to be implying. He could have, he's a brillant writer, but he didn't. 30 pages into the 3rd book, The Amber Spyglass, and I was ready to put the book down. It was rather disappoining that he was going down the road he was, but I was too curious, I really had enjoyed it up until this point. I still hoped he could make it all right by the end, though it seemed improbable. Maybe I was just fooling myself trying to justify why I was still reading it. Whatever the reason, I continued reading. However, because the thrill was gone the book became laborious to read, too many violent killings happening too many times; too many detailed descriptions of too many scenes. Still I finished it and the ending was sweet. BUT, the end doesn't justify the means, the author had an agenda and I felt like it was a sneaky, underhanded way of imposing it on his readers, or at least, this reader. That part was not fiction, it was quite clear that the author hates the church in general and God specifically. He made evil good and God a liar and humanism, no matter what you have to do to achieve it, the most important. Of course, if you don't believe in God, if you don't love him, it doesn't matter, enjoy the book. I'm one who loves the Lord and Pullmans agenda ruined the whole series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you're only interested in the 'story' aspect of fiction, go for it. Be aware that the premise beneath, is Material Atheism. His style is not as fluid as Rowling, but it's a good story. The logic that only those things we can prove to exist, actually exist, though... Well if that's the case, the world really was flat before Galileo. For those who believe in the big bang, and believe it's proven by science... well, all the necessary elements for the creation of a sand castle are present in hurricanes. Funny, I've never gone to the beach and found that in the winds of nature a castle was set into place, not even after Hurricane Andrew. If you sit on the beach and throw sand in the air, how long do you think it will take to form a perfectly working castle? Hmm... might take you more than time to prove that theory. Guess Material Atheists aren't that scientific after all.The following is from an interview of Pullman. \\"Those who are committed materialists (as I claim to be myself) have to account for the existence of consciousness, or else, like the behaviourists such as Watson and Skinner, deny that it exists at all.\\"(Phillip Pullman, in an interview. [...]By the way, shouldn't a writer correct their spelling before putting something into print? \\"behaviourists\\" was his own misspelling; I copied and pasted this quote. I'm not a perfect speller, but I watch for red dots or squiggles beneath my words; even \\"gmail\\" warns of errors now."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book was the best of the 3, but you definitely need to read them all in order to get the full picture.

I have to read this book for school, and i am making myself read this. I usually don't have to do that with books. The book throws names at you and doesn't even explain what it is one bit. I would not reccomend this book for anyone, except a kid with alot of time on his hands."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First the good news: these books are imaginative. And the first two are well written. Not so the third.The rest is bad news: these books are not for children. The author even says in interviews he is not writing for a particular audience. Yet, these books are marketed as books for children. Most parents would be surprised at some of the content of these books. I don't have the space here to give all of the many examples but the fact that the heroine's main talent is that she is an accomplished liar is a start.And then there are the themes! You could say that this is \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" for kids. I doubt that Christian parents would want their children to read these books. There are themes here that are anti-God, anti-church, and anti-Christianity in particular. In a 2000 interview by Dave Weich, Philip Pullman had the following to saw about the books of C.S. Lewis: \\"I thought they were loathsome, full of bullying and sneering, propaganda, basically, on behalf of a religion whose main creed seemed to be to despise and hate people unlike yourself.\\" In a 2000 speech after the publication of the last book in his series he said, \\"We're used to the kingdom of heaven; but you can tell from the general thrust of the book that I'm of the devil's party, like Milton. And I think it's time we thought about a republic of heaven instead of the kingdom of heaven. The king is dead. That's to say I believe that the king is dead. I'm an atheist.\\" His views are certainly reflected in the trilogy's themes.Even if you don't mind this content being in your child's reading material, I think the trilogy fails because of the poor writing in the third book. An overall disappointment."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't know how I missed this series growing up but after just finishing the first novel in the trilogy I can happily say that this series is so engrossing and so complex that I didn't want the first book to end- and then couldn't wait to start the second. It is SO beautifully written and keeps you guessing till the very end- I wish more young people were reading things like this instead of empty literature like Twilight. Two thumbs WAY up from me!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A thrilling adventure with sinister villains, heartbreaking separations, and plenty of action.

They are a great value."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought the trilogy looking for an opportunity for my imagination to take wing.

Amazing accomplishment by Philip Pullman. To describe these as children's books does not to them justice, as they are written at a very sophisticated level. His prose is delectable, the story moves at a fast and never lagging pace. Yes there are children as protagonists, but I am an adult with no children and read these eagerly for myself alone. HIs scope is staggering and the overall story inventive and original. I've read the Harry Potter series and this trilogy is FAR SUPERIOR in my opinion, mainly because the writing is so much better and more complicated (though not to detract from JK Rowling). I really had no idea where the story would end so my attention was held to the last page. This series of books is really of the highest order of fiction and deserves a place among the great adventure fiction that has been written to date."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's books are great - fantastic adventure and wonderful narrative.

I was really impressed with the stories - the themes of freedom, adventure, innocence/experience, stewardship, friendship - it was an amazing trilogy. I recommend it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This post is to encourage wary religious parents to allow their children to read \\"His Dark Materials.\\"I first read \\"His Dark Materials\\" when I was about 12 years old. I thought the first book was great, the second book all right, and the third book too long and kind of weird. I understood that the main characters killed God, and opened up the underworld, but I couldn't understand its implications - to me, Pullman had just chosen a god-like figure to be Voldemort in his story - a god-like figure which bore little resembalence to the God I learned about it Sunday School. All I saw was a great adventure story that got a little preachy towards the end.But these are not children's books. I re-read them at the age of 20, and found to my delight that they were a richly fascited re-telling of Genesis, the implications of which only become clear after lengthy explanations in the third book. Pullman offers an interesting critique of the Christian ideals of obedience to God, restrained living and the value of eternal life against the backdrop of a richly embroidered world.For the religious, like me, some of these conclusions are disturbing. Pullman posits that in his alternative universe, which contains higher beings like angels and God himself, humans are still the best judges of morality - a stark contrast to Christianity, Islam and other major religions.However, the good news is parents is that your son or daughter will not be able to pick up on these themes until they are at least fifteen, and have had a decent literature class - something most kids don't have until college. I'm sure your children are bright, and excellent readers. It doesn't matter. These books are dense, and most kids simply won't be able to pick up on implications of Lyra's first kiss, or the sexual innuendo in the third book.Instead, religious parents should let their kids read these books, and more liberal parents should give these books to their teenagers to offer them an interesting, and unusually lucid critique of religion."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I know that the release of the movie must have aroused your interest in theese books.

It also contains child sexuality and homosexuality.Book one is also a movie. The movie was far more tame than the book. The series is well written to draw the reader in and then you realize his agenda. The second book introduces the plan to kill God who the series claims is actually an angel but since he was the first one formed he tried to control all of the others. There is sexuality in the series as well. Two important angel characters are homosexual and it mentions multiple times how in love they are (in books 2 & 3) and then in book 3 the two children mature and begin making out and fondling etc. Their love making saves the planet they are on at the time by creating more \\"Dust\\" the particles with intelligence. Watching the movie with fuzzy bears did not represent what these books are really about. I am so glad I got them from the library and read them first. My young kids will not be reading them. This series is for older teens & adults (and only those who are secure in their beliefs). Gifted youngsters who read at higher levels should avoid this book series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Not very good. Poor characterization, for one thing. Characters barely introduced suddenly become everyone's best friend and tears shed when they die.Pretty boring plot line, I kept hoping something would happen but it never did.If you are really bored, try it, you might feel better."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"You know the verse.\\"And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and your daemons shall assume their true forms, and ye shall be as gods; knowing good and evil.\\"Not quite how you remembered it?The biblical quote was tweaked by children's author Phillip Pullman, whose fantasies are set to revisit the world December 7th, as New Line Cinema releases their version of Pullman's celebrated novel, The Golden Compass. In an alternate England where Church is State and every human is attended by an animal counterpart, or daemon, the film tells of an orphan girl who travels from Oxford to the North in search of a kidnapped friend. Along the way she discovers comrades among the oppressed and enemies among the oppressors.A common storyline. What is everyone so upset about? According to Catholics, Pullman might have been a bit nicer to the Church (they're his villains), but isn't it just make-believe? Perhaps.For hundreds of years, make-believe places--Heorot to Middle Earth--have given us a clearer view of our own world. Readers set aside everyday life to peer onto another stage, where right and wrong are played out unequivocally, and when the curtains close, we love good all the more having known men like Aragon, and despise evil worse than ever having confronted murderers like the Nine. Young imaginations are especially receptive of supposals, as Jesus recognized when he told followers to receive the kingdom of God as little children.But what if a writer, harnessing fantasy's power, invited kids to suspend traditional beliefs about God, authority and growing up, for completely new assumptions? Just as the serpent whispered, Ye shall not surely die, the stories of such an author could circulate a new paradigm where a loving, omnipotent God and an afterlife in heaven were cruel lies. Consequently, man's rebellion against God would be revealed as a liberation from Him, with Eve becoming a heroine who rejected blind obedience for the sake of curiosity and an inquiring mind. That writer is Phillip Pullman.The Golden Compass is his auspicious opening of an increasingly didactic trilogy geared toward young readers. The engaging plot, action and colorful characters hook children, but Pullman's conclusion recasts truth and fails to deliver. Promising adventures turn into the disposal of a pathetic Ancient of Days, the exposure of the myths of heaven and hell, and the establishment of a society for mortals to utopianize until their atoms pass on to flowers and trees. Pullman may twist classic lines, but his additions don't enhance anything. Instead, young readers are left with a world devoid of hope and happy endings, where nothing is eternal except the present delight.Filmmakers are adamant that their production of The Golden Compass dilutes Pullman's hostile representation of the Church. In making their film more kid-friendly, they also removed the disturbing death portrayed in the novel's final scene. While these decisions may yield a PG rating [UPDATE: the MPAA has rated The Golden Compass PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence] and fewer offended churchgoers, children whose imaginations are stirred by the cinema will certainly devour Pullman's trilogy, where they'll learn \\"the Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" Heroes will assure them, \\"We shouldn't live as if [heaven] mattered more than this life in this world.\\" Pullman's Great Supposal stamps pliable minds with secular humanism.Practiced Christians who read the trilogy face little danger--Pullman's inversions ring hollow because they're not true forms. Thanks to God's unchanging Word, we know good and evil. We know that when the term is over, the holidays begin. But via Phillip Pullman, countless young people are discovering that religion is a ridiculous lie. The alternative His Dark Materials offers is the alternative these children embrace: \\"build the Republic of Heaven where [you] are, because for us there is no elsewhere.\\" We're all the gods this world will ever know, Pullman concludes, and today is our only time on stage. Shouldn't Christians call out, \\"Cut!\\"?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are sick! Killing God in the eyes of children is disturbing to say the least."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am an educator and a Christian. I ordered and read the books with an open mind. They are very well written and the author has obvious writing talent. My concern is the subtle way that he attempts to put down the church by making it into a big brother image, the changing of scripture which appears to be quoted from the Bible, and the connection of deamons attached to people to the real life use of Spirit Guides (a demonic practice). As an educator, I do not often take a stand that children should not read different types of literature with different values and view points. In the case of the Dark Materials Trilogy, however, I think it is not a set of books that children should read. The title \\"Dark Materials\\" pretty much explains what I mean."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"How could this be a book for fifth graders? I have worked with fifth graders and after reading this book, I would have to say that it is NOT for fifth graders. For instance, the book seems to attack authority and especially religion. It also suggests some homosexuality in the book and that it is fine, like a normal way of life, especailly between the two angels, Balthamos and Baurch. In the Bible, homosexuality is not welcomed and is considered a sin. Besides, would you want your child to be homosexual? Then, it suggests that Will and Lyra are more than friends and had a sexual relationship. But Will and Lyra are just children! Would you like your child to have a sexual relationship with another child? I know if I had a child, I would not. I think overall, that it is ok for a child to read this book as far as the fantasy is concerned, but with the issues I mentioned above, if I had a child, I would not let them read this book and I would find it a disgrace if they did."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've been a junior high teacher for many years, and I am disturbed by the dark messages that this trilogy teaches. The books are twisted and disturbing in its message-and it twists the concept of evil vs. good, with the evil depicted as the good. The author, Phillip Pullman, said in a 2003 interview that \\"My books are about killing God.\\"I'm sickened that they are making a \\"mild version\\" of his book into a movie to ignite interest in his books.In a society where children are already being bombarded with violent and dark messages, we don't want our youth reading books that are geared towards teaching them that \\"evil is good.\\"Please read this message from another reader:\\" He's an atheist and his objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism...he has made remarks that he wants to kill God in the minds of children, and that's what his books are all about. He despises C.S. Lewis and Narnia, etc. An article written about him said \\"this is the most dangerous author in Britain\\" and that Pullman would be the writer \\"the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed.\\" Pullman said he doesn't think it is possible that there is a God and he has great difficulty understanding the words \\"spiritual\\" and \\"spirituality.\\" What I thought was important to communicate is what part of the agenda is for making this picture. This movie is a watered down version of the first book, which is the least offensive of the three books. The second book of the trilogy is THE SUBTLE KNIFE and the third book is THE AMBER SPYGLASS. Each book gets worse and worse regarding Pullman's hatred of God. In the trilogy, a young girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle against a nefarious Church known as the Magisterium. Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as \\"a very powerful and convincing mistake.\\" As I understand it, in the last book, a boy and girl are depicted representing Adam and Eve and they kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH (which is definitely not Allah). Since the movie would seem mild if you viewed it, that's been done on purpose.They are hoping that unsuspecting parents will take their children to See the movie, that they will enjoy the movie and then the children will want the books for Christmas. That's the hook. Pullman says he wants the children to read the books and decide against God.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Yuck.

And this was just fiction, although i do believe that pullman was trying to make a point, a very strong point in writing these books. and i don't think he necessarily wanted to turn people off from jesus. perhaps he was just voicing some of his own thoughts and doubts. and he was doing it SO WELL, in the first two books, he had SUCH great ideas, but i' afraid he failed to make good use of them. most of his sttory lines just hopelessly trailed off, like for example the idea about mary being the tempter, and building the magnificent spyglass (it does nothing, believe me).second, the characters were sometimes very undeveloped, i found that especially with Will. Lyra was a great character, and pullman created a very convincing little girl. but will...i thought too much depended on his mother - like the strongest weapon in the world breaking because will loved his mother too much. father gomez - i think pullman was desperate in the end and used him to get rid of balthamos (my favourite character in the book - unfortunately gay)what the hell? but in general, characterisation wasn't too badthirdly, the plot. a bit too many ideas, phil. make no mistake, they were great, but the reader had to stop and re-read certain paragraphs in order to understand what the whole trilogy was trying to say. and Dust? there was SO much to-do about it throught all three books, but we never understood why it clung to adults, or whether it was good or bad. once again i mention mary malone, a very strange and out of place character whose place in the story we didn't quite understand. also who is on whose side - we never understand.a few really weak moments, like when God, the ultimate authority of all the universes dies in about 3 lines description. very weak. also there is only a couple of weeks between the second and third books, yet Will and Lyra SUDDENLY see the Spectres.not to mention the ending - emotionaly, but made no impact, you never felt any different, you never had the feeling of \\"yes, finished. \\" it was all just a mangle of feeling betwen Will and Lyra that never got preperly resolved.But in general, like i say, Very Good Ideas, and i congratuale phillip on them. Maybe a bit better craftsmenship at writing would have made them perfect, but its not to be.i look forward to any other books by pullman.p.s. read Juliet Marillier the Sevenwaters Trilogy.

Not unlike Ayn Rand and the way she uses fiction to disguise her propaganda. Just be warned; if your kids read this they may become anti-religion bores! :) I also found the \\"good guys\\" to be questionable (not the kids, but Asriel and his forces) That said, I did enjoy them as stories."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I absolutely loved this trilogy, and the books hold a very special place in my heart. It's epic, fresh, dark, and completely marvelous.I got this boxed set as a gift a while back and I had never read it before, but hearing so many good things about it online, I took a chance and asked for them. As I started on the first book, I must admit, I was slightly bored, waiting for something to happen, nothing really fitting together and making sense. But as it went on, and I became familiar with Lyra's world; I really became hooked. It is not as dark as I thought it would be, and although it isn't light and happy either it's certainly NOT your usual Tolkien-derived/-stolen fantasy, thank goodness.It has religious--or possibly even anti-religious, depending on how you look at it--elements, and I'm sure a lot of organized religionists (Christians, seeing as this is the religion most closely identifiable with the one in HDM) out there probably want these books burned, but to me--and lots of other lovers of HDM--this book IS spiritual, and it doesn't go against spirituality at all. I see it as more going against using religion for the wrong purposes. Whatever your stance, read this trilogy and judge it for yourself.Sure, it might be \\"for kids\\" but I can't see why it's for kids: it might be a little too dark than what they're able to handle. I honestly feel that older readers get the most out of the series, or should I say, experience.I cannot even begin to summarize it; it is original, it is unique, it is moving, it is fantastic, it is simply beautiful. All I can and must say is, \\"Read this book. You will not be disappointed.\\" And as I was, you might even be moved to look at things in life in a much different light. I'm almost saddened that no one I know has ever heard of HDM...this is a trilogy that everyone should give a chance."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't consider myslef a fan of fantasy. Understandaby, I was very skeptical about this trilogy at first; 'Dust' being the key to all truth? Daemons? But to my surprise, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass\\" and finished it within a few hours, and promptly did the same with the subsequent two books. The Fantasy is first rate, the characters are well-developed and the read is fun and fast. It's very enjoyable save a few problems.1. It takes awhile to get into the series. This isn't always a bad thing: take Lord of the Rings, for instance. However, the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is not only an amazing fantastical epic, but do well as individual stand-alone novels. the \\"His Dark Materials\\" Trilogy works quite well- as an epic trilogy, but the second novel follows the first so closely, that I got the impression that the subsequent two books would be very difficult to understand as stand-alone novels.2. The author pulls you into his world immediately. Some authors do an incredible job with this (Tolkien, for example). But in this case, it's just confusing. He doesn't explain the little nuances of his universe until much later in the novel; I found myself wanting to go back and reread the first book just for clarification's sake.3. It's not entirely clear who the bad/good guys are. This is not really a complaint; actually I quite enjoyed this aspect of the books. But for someone who is looking for an easy, uncomplicated read, this trilogy requires way too much concentration.So...if you're looking for something to read that you don't have to think about, do not pick up this series. But if youre looking for a series with a highly detailed Universe (s), and one that goes into great depth and requires a much higher level of concentration than most pleasure novels, this is a great trilogy to read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Fascinating book inappropriately marketed to children.Pro:Philip Pullman shows glimmers of brilliance as a writer. His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.Con:Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill children when necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book. I wasn't surprised by what I learned.Mr. Pullman:- Is a self-described atheist.- Is listed as a member of the British Humanist Association (the goal of which is \\"an end to the privileged position of religion in law, education, broadcasting and wherever else it occurs\\")- Is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (The society campaigns for: 1) the disestablishment of the Church of England, 2) the withdrawal of state subsidies to religious schools, 3) the end of tax exemptions for churches, 4) the abolition of the blasphemy law, 5) an end to the public funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and the armed services)Is His Dark Materials simply the anti-Narnia tome that Pullman says he set out to write? Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience. An audience better served listening to another voice."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Had picked up a paperback from Walmart when the movie was releasing. never touched it beyond the first 100 or so pages .... until last week. every book has an agenda. those who refuse to believe in it are either liars or idiots. the difference in Pullman's is that he has something against a very pervasive concept, namely, the religion of Christianity. The first 2 volumes are really very good. The part about the mulefa or whatever was really stretched beyond imagination. only in the negative sense. i fell asleep every night when I got to that part (i cannot afford more than a couple of hrs everyday) when he was in the mulefa world. the character building for Marisa, Asriel, Metatron etc were in my opinion very weak (even if this was intentional, I don't see the point of it). In comparison, even the gyptian characters were better. Gomez was a joke. That event with the tualapa or whatever and his night visit are a waste of the reader's time. Mary Malone, apart from doing the 'tempting' very well, didn't do much and i am angry that I have wasted so much time in that world that I cannot get back. Still, 4 stars because the first 2 volumes are excellent."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have only had time to read the first novel, \\"The Golden Compass\\". This is a great start to a fantasy trilogy. Great fun for young readers and adult readers as well. I can hardly wait to get through the next two books and see where Pullman goes with this epic story. A must read for fantasy enthusiasts!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I don't write a title like that lightly. I read these books when I was little, but didn't appreciate their complexity until I re-read them earlier this year. They're incredibly imagined and written, and - at least in my opinion - never predictable."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Please read these books!Really, really, really give yourself the time with these books and relish the journey you will take with them.You may have heard all the comments about how these books contain a storyline designed to undermine the organized churches as we know them today but those comments take the story out of its context. Like so many novels, an opportunity is taken, is created, to teach us something important. This is a beatiful, hopeful fable, one which as childrens stories usually have, contains a moral tale for the adults too.People who wish to take parts of the story as attacks on their faith should take the opportunity to study their faith being shaken, see which leaves fall off and be proud of the branches that remain sturdy.For everybody in general, this is an excellent tale and the end is the best. For that you will have to read the book!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While the book definitely had some enjoyable elements, I didn't feel it was as \\"epic\\" or \\"grand\\" as it was built up to be. I felt the author does beat you over the head a little with his distaste for organized religion and a couple of the characters aren't consistently written through each of the books.It was enjoyable enough, but definitely not a \\"desert island\\" book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" triology are the kind of books that you simply must read if you are a science fiction fan, or if you just like well-written books... You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy them, but you need to have a big imagination in order to thoroughly enjoy them. If that is the case, go on reading this review...The \\"Dark Materials\\" triology takes place in a world similar to our own, that is at the same time very different. In that world, each person's soul can be seen, is called a \\"daemon\\" and takes the form of an animal. The daemons of children change their appearance constantly, but once the children become adults, their daemons choose only one form. Pullman's alternate world has other differences, too, for example the fact that it has different kinds of magic, and that witches and armored bears coexist with human beings. The result is that the world he builds is exotic, strange but at the same time familiar.On the negative side, the writer also plays with an institution we are familiar with, the Church, using its name but leaving behind its essence, in order to talk about a world ruled by tyrannical ecclesiastical authorities. I didn't like that, and probably you won't like it either, but keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, and as such, its purpose is to entertain, not to be taken seriously. All the same, if you think your sensibilities will be offended, or that you won't be able to separate reality from fiction, don't buy this book. You will be losing a lot, though.Regarding the plot of these books, the main character is an orphan girl named Lyra, that lives in the Jordan College of Oxford. Her life involves no more responsabilities than playing in the grounds (and roofs!) of the College, and making mischief with her friend Roger and her daemon, Pantalaimon. But all changes when Lyra hides in a closet and hears her uncle, Lord Asriel, talk about some weird things that are happening in the North Pole to some scholars. Lyra wants to go there with him, but is not allowed to do so. However, soon afterwards her dear friend Roger and many other children disappear, and when all clues point out to the North Pole, Lyra will start a journey to rescue them. That journey will take her to many places, allow her to meet lots of different people, and help her to discover new things about herself and others. If you want to share all that with Lyra and Pantalaimon, just read this book :)After reading \\"The Golden compass\\", I thought that the triology was promising. However, it was only when I finished the last book in the \\"Dark Materials\\" series that I realized why this triology has such a reputation as a masterpiece of science fiction. On the whole, I think that this box set is a treat teenagers and adults will enjoy, but I believe it may be too complicated and somber at times for young children. Provided you take that opinion and my previous comments into account, recommended...Belen AlcatPS: A film based on the first book of this triology is to be released in late 2007. It is directed by Chris Weitz, and stars Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. So... you better start reading now, if you want to read the books before watching the movie :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is written at a young adult level, but the theme is rather complex. They say this will be a movie, and it does at times remind one of the next Harry Potter. But I wonder how they will make a politically correct movie out of a trilogy whose central theme is the effort to destroy God and tear down the gates of Heaven, and whose ending involves young teens (13? or less..) evidently having sex. Its complexity and daring in both regards will have more meaning to adults than kids or teens. The first book in the trilogy (introducing Lyra's endearing character) is superb. The middle book (as middle books and movies often do...) lags a bit as the complexities of the plot are interwoven, but no conclusions or resolutions are reached. I think the first book is vastly superior to anything that follows, but perhaps the single best part of the entire series is the truly heartrending conclusion, as the heroes battle with their obligations and hearts. The conclusion, again, has overtones and layers that adults may appreciate more than kids. On the whole, the series is very well done, even if the plot complexities seem sometimes meandering, unexplained and/or often unnecessary (the Mulefa? Mary?)."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I can't begin to express what these books mean to me. These are not merely books of fantasy and, though they can be enjoyed by the young, they are not children's literature. In fact, most people under the age of twelve probably won't fully comprehend what we're talking about here. What we're talking about is a kind of genius and depth, power and passion that haunts you well after the final page of the third novel. We are not just talking about kids who set out to save other kids and have funny talking animals for friends. We aren't just talking about a great adventure that is brilliantly imagined and evoked. What we are dealing with here is an examination of a human's relation to its soul, and what, when all is said and done, truly makes us human.Sadly, whenever I tell people about these books, I meet with vacant smiles and slight interest (after all, we can't take a children's fantasy too seriously.) It isn't until I explain that these books are a retelling of Paradise Lost (and they most certainly are, an exquisite rendering) that I see that spark of real interest and pleasure. Oh, so we're talking about LITERATURE. Coming to my point: these books need to be taken out of the science fiction and children's sections in bookstores and placed on the shelves under literature. That's the only proper place for these works.Onward with the story. Unfortunately, here's the truth. I can't tell you. It's not that I want to surprise you, it's that I really can't. There's too much to explain, to have you understand. The best I can do is this: Lyra is a young girl living with her daemon (a physical extension of her soul; everyone has one) in Oxford. Lyra lives in a different universe from ours. She enjoys a happy, carefree life until circumstances force her to leave and eventually to run for her life. The major problem: Dust. Not normal dust, but a capitalized 'dust', one that may be the very secret to growing up, changing, and the key to the beginning and the continuation of the universe. Lyra is entangled in a strange prophecy relating to Dust, as is young Will, a boy from our universe who enters into hers. The two join forces and embark on a magnificent journey across time and space, meeting armored polar bears, a hot air balloon flying Texan, priest assassins, angels, ghosts, harpies, witches and on and on. There's too much to fit in here.The books are titled 'The Golden Compass', 'The Subtle Knife', and 'The Amber Spyglass.' Each title refers to a magical object that proves invaluable in the quest. The compass is an 'alethiometer', a truth-telling device that can answer any question in the world. The knife is a way to cut holes from one universe into another. The spyglass is something that allows a person to actually see Dust, which is in the air all around us. In the end, Lyra and Will must protect the Dust, and in turn the universe. They will also be forced to make an unbearable sacrifice to ensure the safety of all places and peoples.I haven't even scratched the surface of what we are dealing with here. We have characters that are so real you laugh when something wonderful happens to them, and cry when tragedy strikes. I had to put the second book down when I was halfway through to allow myself to sit on my bed and just sob. I won't say what happened, but if you become invested in these characters, you'll recognize the moment I'm talking about.This review is maddening to me, because I'll never be able to explain why this is wonderful, why this is precious and why this is absolute genius. You need to read these books and discover for yourself what exactly I'm struggling to tell you. Pullman has crafted something that is so heartbreakingly pure and original it actually, honestly hurts me to think about it and to remember the state of wonder I was constantly in while reading. These books have everything. Humor, drama, mystery, fantasy, romance, action, trust, betrayal, friendship, pitch-perfect dialogue, gorgeous imagery, and the most intense originality I have seen in any book in a long time. As much as I love Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings', I feel Pullman is the first writer who might, in time, nudge the 'Rings' trilogy out of its niche and secure the 'His Dark Materials' trilogy's place in true literature. Pullman creates a world you've never imagined, and he does it while fleshing out each and every one of his characters until you feel as if you know them, you feel for them and understand the decisions and sacrifices they make. These books are really, really that good.I can't begin to explain the genius at work here. It's something you must experience for yourself. Do yourself a favor and read these books. Don't deny yourself this incredible pleasure."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"...This is a powerful trilogy, all the more gripping because it tackles head-on some of the most difficult philosophical aspects of human existence and self-awareness. Harry Potter is merely a flirtation with the imagination compared to the ambitious intensity of the golden compass trilogy. It's mesmerizing but also hard-hitting; you can't walk away from the story without feeling eaten away, as if you'd left part of yourself in that other world.The closest thing I could compare this series to would be the Wizard of Earthsea trilogy by Ursula Le Guin, also a fantastic and somewhat dark exploration into the spirit nature of man. However, Pullman is far more focused on religious metaphors--specifically Christian metaphors--and is certainly overt in his anti-Christian sentiments. Pre-adolescents (under 12) might have a difficult time appreciating the philosophical ramifications of the story, and conservative Christians will find the content somewhat challenging, to say the least."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To start, these three books are great. I'm a Christian and was not offended by the book, it's fiction so I take it with a grain of salt. Besides,the books are so well written that I respect the author regardless of his views.Again, these books are very good because the author Phillip Pullman is an exceptional writer. This format (3 books in one giant volume) is very nicely done. The book is solid & it has style. I own all three as separate novels also.I would recommend this volume. The Trilogy is great."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To start with, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was imaginative, interesting and hard to put down. I do however resent how the publishers in the United states think that people are so stupid as to not publish the book as it was originally written. At the time I purchased the book I was not aware of this, next time I would try and find a proper version."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"All you children around the campfire listen well, for I shall tell you a story about the dark days before the emergence of Harry Potter. These were hard times for young folk who chased magic and science through stories. But there was one beacon of light in this darkness, one safe haven. It was called \\"His Dark Materials.\\"An adventure of legendary proportions, taken on by children not much older than yourselves-though one was from another world than our own. Two children, older than their years (though not at all wiser) driven together by chance or destiny and given an impossible task. Save the universes-all of them.Our heroes had help of course, as all heroes must. Tools to shows the way and aid them in their quest. Loyal friends to guard them and fight their enemies. New allies who add their own skills to this great fight.But even with all their tools, their friends, their allies-these children were very much on their own. Traveling through fantastic lands and facing down danger they attempt to discover what they should do next, all the while unknowing the key to their great task is so much closer than they think it is.In the beginning, there was dark. Out of that darkness came a light.This is a wonderfully, wonderfully written trilogy which straddles the generation gap perfectly. An adult will get just as much enjoyment out of this as a young adult would. I read trilogy for the first time ten years ago back when I was a young adult and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. Maybe more so because the theology, philosophy and science of the book is easier to follow with a little higher education.Before Harry Potter there was this. And it was, is, and always will be one of the most amazing works of science fiction/fantasy ever written.Five stars."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I got the three volume paperback set in a simple slipcase with The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass. After you have read the books, you will see just how silly the critics are regarding Pullman's so-called attack against religion. This three volume set explores the adventures of Lyra and Will as she attempts to thwart her uncle, Lord Asrael's vision of a world without a Heaven. But not the heaven as we know it, but of a heaven that is run by a bad guy. But I digress.Briefly:**The Golden Compass introduces us to Lyra, the girl who is a bit of a brat, who lives in a pampered existence with her uncle. She overhears rumors of Dust and an experiment in the Arctic. Soon, her playmates start disappearing! Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra under her wing, but she is much more than she seems. The book is much better than the movie, Golden Compass, so don't confuse the two!**The Subtle Knife: Great characterization in Lyra, the little girl lost, who meets a boy and a gang in a very unlikely dimensional hole in search of her uncle and discovering more about Dust and what it has to do with life.The Subtle Knife is an instrument that can cut between dimensions. However, there has been a lot of \\"cutting\\" in the last century or two and this is having a destabilizing influence on the worlds affected.I like Lyra in these stories. Phillip Pullman has been criticized for his apparent anti-Church themes, but I'm inclined to believe that those who accuse him of that have not read the book and are only reading the criticisms.Pullman paints a dark Church in a dimension similar to ours, that's true. They are attempting to suppress the knowledge of other dimensions and those who can survive without daemons (animal familiars). Mrs. Coulter, unlike the first book, Golden Compass, plays a bit of a last minute heroine.Overall, entertaining, moves at a good pace.**The Amber Spyglass: Will and Lyra continue their journey into the unknown. This book was fun because we have a spyglass that can spot Dust, we have the return of the Bear clan with kind Byrnison and we have Lyra's uncle on a quest to conquer God with his minions of angels and other armies.At the risk of a spoiler, Lyra discovers a place where ghosts dwell, where a purgatory of sorts is, the draining of the spirit. And she finds love and that she's older and wiser because of it.The subplots and the complexity of the story is what makes it fun.**Check it out!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We read these books to learn for ourselves why they stirred up so much conflict. Never people to just accept what others are saying about the Church, or to believe everything that's taught, we are thinking and reasoning believers in God. These stories, while definately fiction, have great moral lessons. In the end, you're left to decide for yourself who's the good guy and who's the bad. And if you are like us in questioning those who expect unreasoning obedience, these will pique your intellect. These stories definately demonstrate that absolute power corrupts absolutely, even when \\"they\\" believe they're doing the right thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman has truly created an epic fantasy masterpiece. Many may not agree but I believe that the three books that may up \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy will shine as a beacon in the literary world by joining other masterpieces like \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". Reading these books transports you into another world that is once similar to our own and magically different. Merely labeling these books for \\"children\\" or \\"young adults\\" can create a stigma that other learned readers may turn away from. Yet thee books are unique in that they are accessible to children and interesting for an adult reader. Children can enjoy the action packed story and adults can follow along and spot the numerous references to classical literature. Pullman borrows from Milton and Dante to Blake and Homer. Those concerned with these books as anti religious I feel are looking to hard into the book. It is fantasy and while religion is included in the novels it in no way detracts from the novels. Someone secure in their religious beliefs should not be shaken by something they read. Do yourself a favor and read these books, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Very imaginative and adventurous. Not only is the setting of the story very well described, but the transformation of characters is very adventurous."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I like the way Pullman is expressed.Its very interesting how he describes the soul of people as animals with the characteristics of those people.If daemons existed, I would wonder which was mine.I even wonder it now!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read this series I think four times now (just finished it again). I can confidently say that it's right up there as one of the best books/series I've ever encountered. The characters, universe(s), theme, story arc and writing style are all amazing. It's written in a clear, easy to follow, engaging and simple manner that really draws you into the story. The characters are loveable and flawed in their own ways and behave like real people would when presented with their situation. The theme is controversial, and doesn't really become obvious until the second book. Pullman takes issue with organized religion and it shows; especially when it comes to dogmatism and using religion as a tool of power over the lives of others. Many here and elsewhere seem to take a lot of issue with that. I would argue that anyone, of any religion, should read these books because they bring up a lot of good points that can be intelligently discussed. It is doing what C.S. Lewis did in the Narnia books, just for a different world view that isn't the normal. I argue that everyone, especially members of organized religion, should read these books because they are challenging. Everyone should entertain and think about ideas outside of their own belief system. How can we truly grow if we stay blind and uninformed to all challenges to our beliefs? That's what this book (or these books) do, challenge the commonly held belief system in the western world while being entertaining."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the move of the first book so much that I bought the book series. The additional information interspersed was helpful to fill in some of the background material. The ending was"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series came out when I was in the 6th grade. The contents made to barely fit in between the cover sheets had to have been magic itself as it is simply uncontainable. Not merely a fantasy world but worlds between worlds, uncountable worlds in which the different layers of ourselves are either more hidden or blatantly tangible and the impossible has never been more of an easy task to accomplish. Elements of many different lore, mythology, and unique imaginative creation come together to bring us a story of heroism, sacrifice, and adventure."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read only a bit of book one of Harry Potter until a few years ago, before the last two films came out, when my daughter said the 5th book was amazing. I picked it up and devoured it, then read H.P. books# 6,#7,within a week as they were so good, then I read books #4,#3,#2,in that order, with great pleasure, but I still cannot get into book #1. However, I missed JKR's books so much that I felt a void had to be filled! Then I remembered the film, The Golden Compass, and my daughter also told me The Subtle Knife by Phillip Pullman was amazing, so I read it cover to cover in a couple days, and promptly devoured The Amber Spyglass and found them to be fascinating books, with scientific and philosophical ideas, fast-paced plots, intriguing characters, and beautiful writing. I then read The Sally Lockhart Series,also by Pullman,in chronological order for the young heroine,Sally, which began with the Ruby in the Smoke. This is a sort of Nancy Drew story, but MUCH better, and the following books get better and better! The last one I read called The Tin Princess I thought would be silly, because it featured a silly character from the previous novels as the book's heroine. I was pleasantly surprised as this young person rose to the occasion time after time and developed into a truly admirable character. The Sally Lockhart series is less intellectual, but lots of fun to read. The price of these paper back books is worth it on Amazon just to get a close look at the beautiful front covers, too. If you miss Rowling's beautiful writing style, Pullman's books will fill the void! By the way, I have heard criticisms from very religious people that his writing is offensively iconoclastic, and I would say this is not true! His ideas are well thought out,subtle, provoking,brilliant and would not be not offensive to anyone, even a member of a strong religious group who would, for example, admire Thomas Aquinas. They are a joy to read and ponder! I hope they make a movie of the Subtle Knife soon. And when I re-watched The Golden Compass film, I saw even MORE there than when I first saw it a few years ago. I would NOW rank this film up with the original Narnia,which was A+ in my mind. I have mentioned this to some friends who agree after watching The Golden Compass a second time they would rate it much higher and are hoping for the Subtle knife to be a movie also.So buy this set of books for fun and pleasure if you like adventure,fantasy,science fiction, strong characters, discussions of good and evil and all the shades of grey! I am a doctor by trade and right now I am too busy doing medical charts to edit this much,(sorry!) but I wanted to get this review out to anyone who craves this type of enjoyment!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm 16 and really love these books. I think they're well-written and interesting, and would recommend to many people. Honestly, I'm not into fantasy (don't like Harry Potter, wizards and magic, annoyingly long fantasy names, etc.) but thought these books were awesome. Once in a while I find a fantasy series that really pulls me in and holds my attention, and this trilogy did that.Anyways.. if you've read any other reviews, you know what the books are about. :P I'll just talk about the set.I ordered this boxed set because I liked the cover art much more than that of others editions. It's very pretty and nice.Also, each book has extra \\"files\\" from a character in the back. the first book has some of Lord Asriel's files, second has Dr. Grumman's, and third has Mary Malone's. These files are hand written notes and drawings, which are a pretty cool addition. They give some insight into the characters.So yeah, it's a very nice set. If you're careful with the paperbacks, the covers won't bend too easily (I'm careful about messing up the covers.) The box is nice as well, with some cool artwork. It isn't as large as I thought it was going to be (but I guess I just didn't know the thickness of the three books.)And.. To those complaining about the message and themes in the books (about religion and god) your faith must be paper thin to be swayed by a work of FICTION. Although I don't consider my self a Christian, my family is Lutheran, and even my parents understand that it's fiction and aren't bothered by it.The only reason why I wouldn't recommend these to young kids is because they may not understand everything, or like the writing style. Most people say \\"10 and up\\" but I know that when I was 10, I wouldn't have enjoyed them or appreciated them. But I think that kids should still be able to at least TRY them, and be able to read what they want, without their parents choosing for them. How are kids supposed to know what they like to read when their parents try to filter their choices?ANYWAY. I love this set and these books. Very nice."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Absolutely fantastic. I wish they would do all the movies of the series. The last book gives an incredible closing to the whole saga and the way they explain the need and history of religion is amazing. Loved the whole set."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I had just finished reading Chronicles of Narnia, and had just watched the Golden Compass on TV to realize that there was a series of these books. Knowing that I would not see a 2nd or 3rd movie made in this series, I had to read the book. It's quite good. Interesting source of fantasy and thought that has not been explored in this fashion. While I did find some holes towards the end of the Golden Compass book that left me wanting, I look forward to continued reading and finding those gaps filled by the next two books. Great book for teenagers and young adults (of all ages), but a little harsh for young children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'll go ahead and admit my bias - I'm not a great reader of epics or sci-fi, so this series must be pretty great for me to have finished it at all. I loved Pullman's descriptions of the worlds he creates and of the minds of the pre-teen protagonists. However, I felt it was exceedingly dark during Lyra's time in the land of the dead and I just skimmed and skimmed until she could get through. I liked that the ending was not a comfortable wrap up of all the loose ends of the story, but some of this I found just too weird and dark for my taste. I guess that I read to escape and would have liked less of a real world experience and more of a naive fictional one."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"To express what I feel about this book series cannot be typed into words. His Dark Materials Trilogy appeared to me while browsing in my middle school's library for something romantic to read. I found The Subtle Knife, and my librarian suggested The Golden Compass to me, saying I should read it first. I did, and I found it to be the best book ever written. I cried at the end because it was so good. Then I read The Subtle Knife, and loved it, but had to wait for EIGHT MONTHS to read The Amber Spyglass! I just recently read it, and I cried so hard at the end that my cheeks literally stung. I absolutely INHALED the last book! You will never find any trilogy so full of lush characters, plot lines and deep-lying meanings to life. It is a fantasy realism, so real almost, my friends and I talk about daemons as if they were sitting on our shoulder or flying overhead. I never stop talking about His Dark Materials, and reccomend it to anyone who wants to read something finally that actually has meaning. I think that if anyone can cram that much amazing, rich storyline into only three books, he must have talent beyond imagination. The Harry Potter books are a wonderful series for the younger reader, and I read them in sixth grade absolutely obsessed with them, but His Dark Materials passes those books by a million times because of the depth and richness they possess all on their own without all of the publicity. It is a different kind of magic but guaranteed to please young adult and adult reader forever! And as Philip Pullman said, and my own writing mantra: \\"Read like a butterfly, write like a bee.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'm a huge fan of Pullman's work, and as such, it saddens me that so many of the reviews on this page find themselves overly preoccupied with Pullman's stance on religion, because this book is not entirely - or even in the main - about religion. Certainly religion plays a large role in these books, but they are not anti-christian as many claim. They do criticize some aspects of dogma, but they do not criticize a belief in any kind of god or gods. In fact, they are not even really about the death of god as many claim - if you examine the story more closely, you will see that what many people view as the true god - that is the Creator, the loving and forgiving god, as opposed to the Destroyer - is actually strengthened within the course of these books. When it comes down, you don't have to be Christian, Buddhist, Atheist, Agnostic, Jewish, or of any specific denomination/belief to enjoy these books - you just have to have an open mind.That having been said, while I didn't think any parts of the books were really inappropriate for children, I do think that plenty of it would go straight over plenty of childrens' heads! Obviously there are some references placed into the book specifically for older readers, but I still think that it would be difficult for a young mind to fully grasp the scientific and philosophical implications of this work. That's what this book is really about - it's about consciousness, kindness, adolescence, love (not in the romantic sense, necessarily), and acceptance. Really, the true measure of what the book is \\"about\\" morally is to look at which values it praises, and which it criticizes (as Pullman himself has argued). It praises bravery, selflessness, love, and acceptance while criticizing close-mindedness, oppression, and hate. Who can say that that's immoral?"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I checked out this series from the public library and wanted a set for myself, but I decided instead to buy the set for my daughter for Christmas. The set was exactly as described and I know she will be thrilled come Christmas morning."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I like to think of myself as a person who can read something from a point of view that differs greatly from my own, and still find the merit in it. This is not one of those phony concepts such as \\"celebrating diversity\\"; rather I like to think this is what \\"free thinking\\" is all about. Perhaps I'm still naive enough to believe that a person can be of any creed or religion or lack thereof, and still be a free thinker (and likewise, also prone to deceit).\\"His Dark Materials\\" has all the elements of a great story. Engaging characters, underlying themes, tension, and mystery are but a few of the beautifully combined features of the series. Pullman has a rare gift of being able to make an unconventional character, such as a 12 year old boy who has been evading shadowy stalkers much of his life, plausible and entertaining. His manner of weaving the mundane world we know into the realm of fantasy, and tying in ancient ideas of alchemy with modern physics, works on a literary level without the need for massive suspension of disbelief. As a fantasy author, he trumps almost every effort that preceded him, and most of his colleagues as well.I interpret Pullman's theme a bit differently than many others. I don't see it as anti God or anti religious, despite my knowledge that Pullman is a devout secular humanist. I rather interpret his theme as promoting the self reliance of humankind. Pullman's actual message is very uplifting if one can look past the exterior and see the form. It's a positive affirmation that human beings are capable of creating a heavenly republic if they choose to do so. If my analysis is true to the author's intent, I couldn't see how either the devoutly religious or the firmly atheistic could disagree with the message.Nevertheless, no book is perfect, and especially, the Amber Spyglass begins to degenerate. I can only guess that Pullman was either racing a deadline with this volume, or got careless in his zest to promote a personal conviction. It is reasonably entertaining, but here is where Pullman's devices begin to get rusty and defective. This book is the culmination of much of his own personal philosophy, which I respect despite its differences with my own.Unfortunately, Pullman does something of a hackneyed job delivering the mantra of numerous characters, relatively undeveloped previous to this volume. Assumptions characters make to describe their motivations lack the most basic axiomatic justification, making the reader feel as if Pullman is simply spewing rhetoric at them. I don't want to spoil anything with this review, so I will leave this as a warning to the reader that things do get somewhat feeble near the end. It is truly a shame, because Pullman is capable of masterful character growth. Amber Spyglass is still a good story and HDM is delightful to read, so it comes with the highest recommendations despite the few slipshod ipse dixits interstitially woven into the text. Take the books for all the good their worth, and enjoy the read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Some of the reviews I have seen have made comparisons to Harry Portter. Do not be fooled. These are VERY different books. I bought them expecting the same warm and fuzzy feeling that the Harry books left me with but warm and fuzzy is not what Pullman writes about. These books have a dark intensity that Harry does not and are clearly for an older more sophisticated audience. Please don't buy these for an eight year old. Buy them for your 28 year old. Death, gore, fear and pain are all treated as part of life in a way that most children won't understand and a parent might not want to explain. There is also love, loyalty, sacrifice and compassion in equal measure to the darkness. The books explore the idea of soul, of religion, of god. Very, very adult. I read all three in a week and found them immensely gripping and moving. I recommend them to anyone over 12."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I cannot paraphrase the story in any way that would do it justice. Pullman is beyond me; the story was too rich, too powerful, too complex and subtle and ambitious, and it had to be to be equal to what I now sit here wishing I could convey to you.You must read it, and if you have read it already, then perhaps together, here and now, we can experience words, and maybe even create a bit of Dust.The most inspired time of my life, as I remember, was during my tour of Europe three summers ago. I remember pieces of what I felt; the richness of human creation surrounding me, not just when I was among the amazing architecture of so many ages, but also when I gazed at the endless miles of soft, rolling hills in Switzerland, Austria, Holland, immaculately tilled and maintained. Something was so compelling; it shook me violently for many days, although my body never moved, but a crucial part of me was indeed shaking. Thoughts poured into my mind, making me on several occasions dizzy and alive at the same time, and at one point, when I thought I couldn't handle the strange consciousness anymore, I sat down, and out of what seemed to be frantic desperation I began writing a letter to a certain Stanford professor who did not know me, whom I had never talked to, but whom I had heard much about.I wrote nearly a page, but it wasn't nearly finished, and I never did finish it; time passed too quickly, and my mind didn't stay in that amazing and different and wonderful grace for long enough. But since that summer, I named it aesthetics; I had discovered it sometime during freshman year, and that was when I started calling it aesthetics, but it had never shook me so violently for so long of continuous time until that summer.And these days, just when I thought I have lost all but hope that I can relive and re-understand what I had known, I read Pullman's tale, and it was absolutely spot-on.When I finished the last book on the train, my mind drifted into an open calm for a long time, and there it rediscovered what it had known and had forgotten, but has always known. Pullman calls it intention, and I had called it aesthetics, but I think they really mean the same thing, both unequivocally human and unequivocally conscious. Pullman gave intention, or aesthetics, the form of Dust, and he made Dust beautiful, and in that open calm I remembered that I have always known Dust and that it has always been beautiful, and vast and the most meaningful thing there is.It wraps around us, glowing, whenever we write or speak or engage with another; whenever we feel, empathize, or understand; or whenever we instill our intentions (or aesthetics) in anything we make or design or build or hope for. I think every person will experience it in his own way, and some level of his consciousness will know what I mean, because Dust is just the beauty of our assertive wakefulness, of our open minds, our thirst to learn and to create. It is unfortunate that we do not have a name for it, a single word in which one listen would allow us to experience the thousand page story of Pullman's tale, in an instant.And lastly, a final thought occurred to me as I walked home from the train stop. I think when someone is sad or depressed, when someone has a sickness of the spirit, maybe the best medicine for him would be simply to learn something new about the world. To be inspired again. Because I think that is what we have been made for."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Don't believe teh other reviews - these books are NOTHING like Harry Potter.Based on John Milton's poem _Paradise Lost_, the _His Dark Materials_ trilogy tells the story of a young girl, Lyra Belaqua. Orphaned after her parents were murdered, she is raised by the professor's at Oxford, under the sponsorship of her Uncle, the distant and troubling Lord Asriel. Lyra loves her life at Oxford, she, her daemon Pantalaimon or \\"Pan\\" for short, and her best friend Roger run wild, tormenting the kitchen staff, waking the ghosts of deceased Oxford dons, and warring with the gypsy children.Then, the children of Oxford begin to disappear. Rumors of \\"Gobblers\\" begin to circulate, and Lyra and her friend Roger are both veryfrightened, but also intent on soving the mystery. But with each answer found, more questions spring up: who are the \\"Gobblers\\"? and what of these \\"severed children\\" Uncle Asriel talked about? And why are the oxford Dons trying to do away with Asriel? Lyra and Roger dedicate themselves to tracking down these answers, until the \\"Gobblers\\" reach Oxford - and one of their own goes missing.Then it's a race to the North. Asriel is taken prisoner by the Panzerbjorn - yes, that's \\"Armored Bear\\" - but how much he has them prisoner is uncertain. Lyra is taken under the wing of the lovely Mrs. Coulter, but then runs away when she finds out that Mrs.Coulter is not as lovely as she seems. She and Roger pair up with the gypsies, accompanied by a witch clan from the north, and they meet Iorek Byrnnison, dethroned monarch of the Panzerbjorn. It's one adventure after the next after the next . . .and that's only half way through the first book.My heart never stopped racing reading these books. Lyra is a character wholely unlike any that I have met in any fantasy novel. It is so rare to come across a young heroine who has such an unconquerable, adventurous spirit; a girl, who though she finds any excuse to get out of her studies, is as smart as a whip, who cares so deeply for people and yet has such an insatiable sense of vengeance, whose curioisity never ends, and who can find trouble around any corner, and save the day at the last minute (I think that was a whole lot of mixed metaphors there, but you get the message.)And there are other amazing characters as well - the fierce Panzerbjorn with their armor of Sky iron, and the witch clans, who can cross into different worlds at will. The Gallavespians were by far my favorite - tiny blue bings no bigger than a hand, who ride on dragonflies and can fit into the smallest cranny to spy on anything, but who are burdened by a lifespan of only ten years.These books are incredibly complex, beautiful works of fantasy,a dn though they are kept often in teh YA section of bookstores, may be frightening for children younger than 12. I've read them through three or four times, and I never tire of them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Oh, dear! It seems the arbitors of religous morality have really got it in for Pullman!! Reading through the other reviews I am once again wont to ponder why some members of the religious right don't invest their considerable energy in doing good in the world rather than waste their time in slagging off an author who holds a contrary opinion.My criticisms of this book are literary not religious - though I feel I must tip a nod in the direction of the reviewer who suggested I might be \\"shocked\\" by the \\"Gay\\" Angels. What? Shocked that an Angel could be gay and good and heroic? (Hello!! And welcome to the 21st Century!!) I was not shocked. Neither was I particularly impressed given that the main \\"Gay Angel\\" conforms to the prissy queen sterotype.Book three failed. And it failed dismally. And most dramatically in the form of continuity. I spent all of book one and two hoping that Mrs Coulter would get her just deserts. And what happens in book three?!?! Is it the same character??? The through line is completely lost! And the resolution struck me as totally unsatisfactory.I would recommend Harry Potter. I wouldn't recommend this."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While Christian zealots have unfairly condemned Philip Pullman as an athesist from this series, I find that Philip Pullman have created a book of the millenium. Not only capturing and nuturing the interest and passion of young readers and adults, he also addressed some problems that'll never be accepted in children's book, but should be discussed with children.Note ***** If you are only looking for a quick review, skip the following paragraph **********Take his view on christianity for example, while god has always been \\"the father of all\\", the \\"savior of mankind\\", and the church been the holy sacred temple for him, we always see Chrisitianity as 'good', 'pure'. But how often have we seen the bad side of Chrisitianity (especially children) ? The oppression of women, the burning of witches, the tortures they used, the lid they shut on science (Galelio)....and countless more. Children, especially those of Christian familes are drilled with the so called 'goodness' of the church, but never seemed to learn the 'not so good' side of it. Shouldn't they be able to know the good/bad side of Christianity, to take a pick?? That's why this series is so good, it does not directly insults Christianity, but instead holds an open and philosophical view of Christianity.In conclusion, the series was written very very very well, with a touching and powerful ending. For young readers, children for example, this is a good story book, one which nurtures their imagination; For young adults, this book is something to think about, to discuss the view on Adam, Eve, Garden of Eden, and Sin.By the way, I'm a 14 year old student who is writing this book, so my view of this book is a view of a YOUNG ADULT, not a mom's or dad's."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I wrote a review of The Golden Compass, I swore I would stay away from the religious issues raised by these books, but with so many reviews decrying them as dangerous and subversive, I feel a need to defend them. I am sick to death of wonderful books, such as these, being pushed aside by people whose delicate sensibilities are offended by any viewpoint that contradicts their own.Are these books anti-Christian? Yes. Blatantly so, especially in the third. Are they a dangerous read for impressionable young children? Well, if you are a Christian parent, I wouldn't recommend reading this as a bedtime story to your 7-year-old, but I wouldn't suggest these books for any 7-year-old, religious or otherwise. There is darkness. There is violence. There are ethical and philosophical questions completely out of reach for a child that young. A twelve-year-old, however, should be old enough to be presented with an idea without necessarily accepting it, especially when that idea comes in the form of a fantasy novel. Because that's what it is: Fantasy. And the truth is, children understand fantasy better than most adults. Far too many adults seem to fear fantasy, because they've forgotten how to keep the pretend separate from the real. Kids don't have that problem. To suggest that these books, all on their own, will drive your twelve-year-old child away from the church is almost as ridiculous as suggesting that the Harry Potter books promote witchcraft (which, by the way, is a valid, peaceful religion that in no way involves Satan worship).Yes, if you are devoutly religious, you will be offended by Pullman's portrayal of God and religion. However, if you are an open-minded person, you will be able to appreciate the fabulous imagination that went into creating the worlds and characters of these books, not to mention Pullman's incredible skill in descriptive writing. Then you can put the books back on your shelf and go back to church, knowing full well that it was Just A Story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman's \\"Dark Materials\\" triology is the kind of story that you simply must read if you are a science fiction fan, or if you just like well-written books... You don't have to be a teenager to enjoy it, but you need to have a big imagination in order to thoroughly do so. If that is the case, go on reading this review...The \\"Dark Materials\\" triology takes place in a world similar to our own, that is at the same time very different. In that world, each person's soul can be seen, is called a \\"daemon\\" and takes the form of an animal. The daemons of children change their appearance constantly, but once the children become adults, their daemons choose only one form. Pullman's alternate world has other differences, too, for example the fact that it has different kinds of magic, and that witches and armored bears coexist with human beings. The result is that the world he builds is exotic, strange but at the same time familiar.On the negative side, the writer also plays with an institution we are familiar with, the Church, using its name but leaving behind its essence, in order to talk about a world ruled by tyrannical ecclesiastical authorities. I didn't like that, and probably you won't like it either, but keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, and as such, its purpose is to entertain, not to be taken seriously. All the same, if you think your sensibilities will be offended, or that you won't be able to separate reality from fiction, don't buy this book. You will be losing a lot, though.Regarding the plot of the books included in this omnibus edition, the main character is an orphan girl named Lyra, that lives in the Jordan College of Oxford. Her life involves no more responsabilities than playing in the grounds (and roofs!) of the College, and making mischief with her friend Roger and her daemon, Pantalaimon. But all changes when Lyra hides in a closet and hears her uncle, Lord Asriel, talk about some weird things that are happening in the North Pole to some scholars. Lyra wants to go there with him, but is not allowed to do so. However, soon afterwards her dear friend Roger and many other children disappear, and when all clues point out to the North Pole, Lyra will start a journey to rescue them. That journey will take her to many places, allow her to meet lots of different people, and help her to discover new things about herself and others. If you want to share all that with Lyra and Pantalaimon, just read this book :)After reading \\"The Golden compass\\" (first book of three included in this edition), I thought that the triology was promising. However, it was only when I finished the last book in the \\"Dark Materials\\" triology that I realized why it has such a reputation as a masterpiece of science fiction. On the whole, I think that this box set is a treat teenagers and adults will enjoy, but I believe it may be too complicated and somber at times for young children. Provided you take that opinion and my previous comments into account, recommended...Belen AlcatPS: A film based on the first book of this triology is to be released in late 2007. It is directed by Chris Weitz, and stars Dakota Blue Richards, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. So... if you want to read the books before watching the movie, you better start reading now :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Much like the classic \\"A Wrinkle in Time,\\" this three-part adventure is an exotic blend of both genres. It's sci-fi because of the main themes (traveling between universes), but it's fantasy in supporting themes (the dmons, talking animals, etc. are all fantasy related things.)But just because these amazing books cannot be fairly placed into a category doesn't rule them as bad books. In fact, this is one of my favorite series I have ever read, and to me they compete strongly with the Harry Potter series.There are so many lessons taught in this book that it makes me realize why they had always been destined for young adults. These ages (between 11-14) are ages of extreme importance in life, where you are not yet a teenager but not a kid, either. You are stuck in this middle-place where you have to learn your own lessons, develop your own views, devise right from wrong, and ultamitely find out \\"who you are.\\"Which is why these books helped me so much. You've got it all here: you learn about guilt and its effects, about risk-taking, about loyalties, about betrayal, about anger, and vengeance, and love, and friendship, and trust, and decison-making, and family. On our adventures with Lyra Belacqua through the tundra of the North, we watch her lose her naveness of childhood and watch her gain some adult attributes. Every mistake she makes, every blunder, we see: we are there to see her try to fix it and watch her pay the price. Book One was a fun-filled, enthralling ride that couldn't be put down. More and more mysteries and answers begged to be answered so the reader has no choice but to read.Book Two is much the same. It's very thrilling, and exciting, and we watch Lyra develop and mature and grow even more. It is in this book where she loses her \\"the world is so cruel, I have to conquer it and find my father\\" attitude, and instead has a more determined but smart view on life, basically realizing she must end the craziness in her life but also realizes that there are other important aspects of living. She learns about companionship when the outspoken Will Parry crosses her path, and he, too, is a young and eager human who also is seeking something.Book Three is my personal favorite, only because of the evolvment of the caracters and the quality of the writing. Will and Lyra are determined as ever to finish what they started. More characters enter; loyalties strengthen; Lyra is almost an adult. She is intelligent and brave and is fighting a hard battle and is constantly forced to make hard decisions. Pullman's skills are at its greatest here; never before had the characters seemed so real, never before had I felt so much for them, never before had each and every question been answered. Everything, from the strange Dust to Lyra's past, is revealed. The suspense dies down. In a strange way, the evil characters don't seem so evil and the good characters don't seem so good, but it seems now that Pullman is done explaining, done identifying, done describing his world. By book Three, the world is complete and vivid with its \\"realness\\" that his work is done and no more books need to be written. The story is told and is finished. Lyra and Will's lives, post the Amber Spyglass, are left unknown. don't want to reveal everything, since the books are so good and the ending is so touching that I'd ruin it by revealing any more details.Botom line, a unique story, great character development, and great plot. Pullman's dmons are simply the most intersting and lovely things every created (I wanted one quite badly after Book One.) This series is one that will appeal to nearly everyone and even adults can appreciate the great story Philip Pullman writes."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an extraordinarily subtle and complex exploration of the journey from childhood to adult. The themes of the modern world (science run amok, put to evil ends, environmentalism, religious fanaticism etc.) are skilfully interwoven with stories as old as the Illiad (the journey, the search for home, the loss of innocence, the meaning of death).Yes it is anti-religious, or at least anti the formal human interpretation of religion: Pope John Calvin, indeed ;-). But it is also a profoundly spiritual book about the great journeys we make in life: from innocence to knowledge, from life to death, to a recognition that we are all mixes of good and evil. It's about first love, and losing first love.The background is Milton's 'Paradise Lost'.It resonates with all of us because this is the journey each of us took to go from childhood to adolescence to adulthood: learning that people change, that good people can do bad things, that sometimes we are those good people doing bad things, learning the wonders (and perils) of making love, that we gain lovers, and lose them, that people will love very much will be lost to us through death.It is a wonderful book for a teenager, struggling with all that stuff, and for us, as adults, who have made that journey and are probably still a little confused by it.Probably of all the 'children's' fiction I have read, only Lord of the Rings had the same sense of wonder and also the same taste of the bittersweet."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is incredible, no doubt about it, with well developed and dynamic characters, amazing action and incredible world development. It is everything I look for in a fantasy. For me it gets five stars hands down, but I just want to caution other readers that there is some heavily religious subject matter and some readers may find it upsetting or unsettling. Also, I would not read this to a six year old as a bedtime story. Some of the events in the trilogy might disturb younger children so I would keep it strictly young adult to adult, even if your little one is capable of reading at this level. Still, it is a wonderful read and I am looking forward to seeing how it plays out in film."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I was a child (and even now) I was always a great fan of C.S. Lewis's Narnia books. So, the thought of reading a vigorous response to those classics struck me as a brilliant idea. Like many others, I was more than impressed with the first book of this trilogy. \\"The Golden Compass\\" struck me as an instant classic when I first read it back in high school. Alas, I didn't follow the books after the first one and, truth be told, I sort of forgot them.Now, ten years later, I have recently finished the whole trilogy and, much like in high school, I felt the first book was superb. What's more, being a little older and better read, I understand the allusions to Kaballah, Gnosticism, neo-platonism, and Milton far better than I did when I was a teenager which makes it all the more enjoyable.However, after the first book things begin to deteriorate (if not rapidly, then certainly noticeably). The story begins to fracture and meander, the characters become more and more like plot points rather than actors who make their mark on things. The most glaring example of this is Dr. Mary Malone who at one point, just because she is tired, begins to expound upon her team's discovery of \\"shadow particles\\" to a perfect stranger just because one of the book's maguffins told her she would. This is a general problem with fantasies that deal in prophecies and the like: nobody in the end except for the vast machines of fate seem to choose anything. Thus, the outcome is never in doubt.In its mythological structure, the books enact a rather literal version of the gnostic revolt against the tyrannical demiurge. This literalism kind of drags (the original gnostic visions were often far more complex)and forces Pullman to make some (to my mind) untenable metaphysical and psychological conclusions.The most disagreeable thing about the last two books, especially the \\"Amber Spyglass\\" is the moral pass Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are given for being on the \\"right\\" side, despite the crimes that both callously committed. I won't spoil things but the complex sense of admiration and distaste we have for Lord Asriel is completely spoiled by the end, not to mention the real and palpable disgust for the venomous Mrs. Coulter (who in the beginning is probably the darkest character ever found in Young Adult fantasy).Still, I do recommend reading all three because of the surplus of great ideas, the occasionally fine prose, and their serious moral purpose. It's a shame that, in the end, a series of books that seek to be an answer to the incipient racism, christian propagandizing, and Eurocentric vision of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien must stand below them in terms of aesthetic achievement."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"There are two major results in modern Cosmology: First, we can only observe less tha 10% of the Universe. The rest is dark matter, still unaccounted for. Second, theories predict that, just as our Solar System is not the only one in our Galaxy, and our Galaxy is not the only one in the Universe, there can also be other Universes, inaccessible to us. Philip Pullman uses these results as the basis for his Trilogy \\"His Dark Materials\\". Starting in a parallel World, or Universe, in a parallel Oxford, Lyra Belaqua, an 11 year old girl gets into fantastic adventures. These are related to the existence of a certain Dust, which is dark matter, and which no one can see, except under very special circumstances. The \\"Church\\" of her world keeps the existence of Dust secret, and those who talk about it are considered heretics. This is the basis for a struggle, which deals not so much with good vs. evil, as in usual children's stories, but with wisdom and consciousness vs. ignorance and stupidity. The plot thickens throughout the three books, introducing a major character in the second book; Will Parry, slightly older than Lyra, who comes from our own world, and who will team up with Lyra in her future adventures, both of them looking for persons they have lost, and which they care about dearly. Along the story, several interesting characters are introduced; inhabitants from several different worlds. Some of them familiar in Western mythology, such as angels, witches and spectres, as well as new ones which come out of Pulman's imagination. In his plot, he explores daring ideas about organised religion, particularly Christianism and Catholisism, that he extends to question the very existence of God, and that religious people will find outright heretical. Specially the ending of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is to be replaced by the Republic of Heaven. However, organised religion should think twice before condemning the trilogy to bonfire, since that is precisely the kind of attitude that has lead Pullman to make his denunciation in the first place. A more rational approach to the story should be advised. Along each of the three books, we are introduced to three mysterious devices: a compass which can tell the truth and provide advice, a knife so strong than can cut through almost anything, including windows into different worlds, and a spyglass which humans can use to observe Dust. The story leaves compelling cliff hangers at the end of the first and second books, and becomes more interesting as it advances. I personally found the third book the best by all means. Its ending is absolutely heartbreaking, and it can take days to reflect on it and assimilate it. Although the reader is left with the feeling that a sequel is needed in order to fix things up, she (he) eventually realises that it is the best possible ending. Although profoundly sad and traumatic, it leaves an open window to optimism.Overall, Pullman shows great artistry in the command of the English Language, which by itself makes the Trilogy captivating. At some points, we are left with the impression that more work should have been devoted by the author, in the development of some of the episodes. Although it is clear that it is a fantasy story, there is a minimum credibility to be expected from fantasy. Also, there are a few but important loose ends, which could have been easily tied up by the author, with minor changes in some of the dialogues. Still, the story is extremely good, and the trilogy highly recommendable.A final word of caution should be cast: Although His Dark Materials has been classified as a children's book, it requires a minimum maturity to understand some of the issues it deals with, so \\"parental guidance\\" is strongly recommended. Furthermore, religious families may be offended by some of the concepts, which as I mentioned earlier, are outright heretical on the face of Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths. However, open minded religious people will recognise that many of the main ideas fostered by Pullman, such as loyalty, fidelity sense of duty and compassion, are in line with religious values. There is, of course, no compatibility with his doubt on the existence of God. In any case, it is just a story, not a manifesto. On the other hand, by the end, some readers may be left with the idea that what Pullman actually did is to rediscover the existence of God in the omnipresent Dust, although he will probably not recognise it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Thank you, \\"Borealis\\" - - I echo your thoughts. Being a teacher, I have survived the \\"Harry Potter\\" storm and I suppose this one will pass, as well. To my knowledge, not one child from the legions of students who have read Harry Potter is currently sporting the broomstick as their primary mode of transportation, nor have evil spells been cast on parents. I am ashamed to say that while I loathe all censorship, I didn't see \\"Harry\\" as worth fighting for. The books remained on my shelves, despite parent protests, but I didn't take the intiative to make a real case for the series unless I was personally approached and asked to do so. These books are different, as they are infinitely more well-written and, in my humble opinion, are a more important contribution to the fantasy genre. I question why this fervent upheaval did not exist 15+ years ago when these beautifully written books were first published, and I believe I know the answer: Those who attempt to squelch all ideas save their own tend not to READ. Please consider reading a book and forming your own opinion before attempting the ultimate form of censorship...banning. As a sidenote, I feel compelled to mention that I am a devout Catholic and was not the slightest bit offended by the content of these books. Don't believe everything you read and take my word for it...dare to crack the binding and see for yourself."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a teacher and a lover of good books, I have conflicting opinions of \\"His Dark Materials.\\" For pure \\"good read\\" value, I would consider this series on par with the Harry Potter series: not great literature, but well-crafted and compelling. Unlike the Potter series, which borrows heavily from many different existing characters and works, \\"His Dark Materials\\" is pure and original in its imaginative scope. Characters are very realistic, each possessing the same mixture of good and bad qualites we all possess. The plot twists and turns in a manner that is completely unpredictable. For these and many other reasons, the series is remarkably realistic for a fantasy piece, but this is where my problem with the series begins.Like Judy Blume before him, Mr. Pullman and his publishers have decided to market very controversial material to minors without providing warning to parents as to just what the books contain. While Blume's books contain realistic and often graphic depictions of teen and pre-teen sexuality and other controversial topics of interest to young people, Mr. Pullman has decided to use this blending of realistic and fantasy elements to take on religion.I am not a religious person myself, but even I was shocked by the lack of respect and even contempt for anything resembling organized religion that Mr. Pullman displays in this trilogy (except Shamanism, with which he doesn't seem to have a problem). Ironically, the knife Mr. Pullman uses to skewer religion is anything but subtle. I could cite multiple instances of his treatment, but to do so would ruin a good story for those interested in reading it. Let it suffice to say that anti-religious sentiments pervade the series to the point that religion itself is the \\"dark force in the universe.\\" I found this premise fascinating, but then I am a thirty-something year old man who can enjoy a story without automatically accepting its underlying premise. I worry that many of the young people who read and enjoy \\"His Dark Materials\\" will find this literary Trojan horse so compelling that they actually rush to embrace the Greeks as they appear from within. Parents struggling to provide religious and moral training for their children are done a disservice when authors like Mr. Pullman write a book the purpose of which is to undermine those very efforts. For the record, I am not assuming Mr. Pullman's intent with regards to the intentions of his trilogy. I actually saw an interview with him on television in which he spelled out the anti-religious underpinnings of \\"His Dark Materials.\\"To sum it all up, I'm not for censoring anything. The story is a good one. I really enjoyed it. I just don't think it should be marketed to young people. It should, instead, be marketed to adults who bring some additional wisdom and perspective to the work.I understand that a movie version of \\"His Dark Materials\\" is already in the works. If you think the protests of the super-conservative religious types were loud when the Potter craze began, wait until the vast numbers of religious moderates join the fray when they find out what their children have been learning about God and religion in Mr. Pullman's wildly popular books. Let's hope the film industry is responsible enough not to market this film adaptation directly to children. Okay, I know I'm not being realistic. It won't be long before we see the assassin priest, decrepit God, and gay angel couple action figures in our local stores along with the picket signs of many good people whom Mr. Pullman purposely intended to insult and offend. They, of course, will look like narrow-minded, intolerant idiots and Mr. Pullman will become the media's latest downtrodden first amendment crusader. He will also be a multi-millionaire.Well played, Mr. Pullman."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman takes on a huge, complicated set of ideas and concepts in this work. He has been compared to Tolkien, and certainly there are some similarities. Like Tolkien, he takes on epic ideas that fork into multiple ideas and sub-threads. Like Tolkien, the first book was written as an introduction to the characters and main themes, and one gets the sense that Pullman himself did not fully understand the scope his work would eventually take by the third book. However, unlike Tolkien, Pullman's work is so vast that it actually gets away from him - the themes and major ideas he wishes to convey are closed, but the ideas are so diverse that the tie-ins seem contrived and stretched.The first book introduces us to the idea of infinite parallel worlds, connected by something called \\"Dust\\". In one particular world, the soul is a physical extension from the body, a reflection of a person's true nature that takes animal forms called \\"daemons\\". The girl Lyra is caught in the middle of a struggle between opposing forces, each of which seem to be evil. Lyra's true path lies tied to both, and Pullman let's his imagination run wild, keeping the themes relatively simple - the concept of Dust, the concept of Daemons, and really neat ideas like armored talking bears and beautiful long-lived witches.The second book introduces us to a second protagonist, Will, who learns to wield a knife that can cut windows between worlds. However, now we learn that the war of opposing forces is really a war between God and Reason, with Dust (which we learn are particles of dark matter that \\"are\\" consciousness) the constant between worlds. We gain the full measure of how evil Lyra's mother is, how ambitious her Father is, and are introduced to angels and vampire-like specters.The third book takes off, with concepts of death, souls, ghosts, angels, the true nature of God, particle physics, existence, Love, and the end of the battle between God/church and Reason. These are huge concepts, and Pullman has a very hard time keeping them all in line while maintaining all the characters. Certainly the concepts themselves are incredible, but half-way through the third book Pullman stops developing lesser themes, concentrating on the battle between God and Reason, Good and Bad, and Life, Death, and the sum parts of consciousness (Body, Soul, Ghost).Overall, Pullman's writing style is excellent, he has an incredible imagination, the works are dark and very deep, and he tackles ideas most writers would never dare tackle (and those who have tried usually fare much much worse). Had he been able to successfully tie everything together, these would be masterful epics, worthy of comparison to Tolkien or Lewis. As they stand they are very good, far deeper and richer than the oft-compared Potter series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's fun going through and reading all the different reviews for these books. There is a group of reviews, each consisting of one or two sentences, which all say basically \\"Pullman is an atheist, beware of your children getting their hands on these books or seeing the movie coming out on December 7th.\\" These people all give the books one star, although they've obviously never read the books, and I can only guess that their priest or minister has asked them to campaign against these books and the movie (coming out on December 7th).There is another group of reviewers, much more clever and cunning, who pretend to have read the books, or at least pretend to have started reading them, who claim that the books are badly written, the plot is difficult to follow, the main characters are unlikeable, and the books are just, well, STUPID. These reviewers often claim to be very open-minded, and that they just loved Harry Potter, Tolkien, Lewis, etc. If I was reading these reviews to see if I might want to buy this series, these are the types of reviews which may cause me to think twice, much more than the ones stating the Pullman is an evil atheist with an agenda.But as someone who has read this series twice over the past decade, let me assure you, these books are great. They are filled with complex, but very loveable, characters. There is adventure and danger, bravery against great evil, and the writing is anything but stupid or boring.I would recommend this series to any smart kids or adults."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass was good enough as a \\"young adult\\" adventure story, a bit similar to LeGuin's A Wizard of Earthsea in the way it feels. There is another book/series that it reminded me of, but I can't think of what it is (possibly Robert Jordan's seemingly-endless Wheel of Time series); it just seemed very familiar. The Subtle Knife was okay, the writing was good enough to allow me to overlook some plot holes. But The Amber Spyglass just didn't cut it, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth for the whole series. Several times in the second and third books, I felt like I was reading a children's version of the two Endymion books with a bit of Ilium and Olympos thrown in (all by Dan Simmons).I personally like the idea of anti-religious children's books, but Pullman messed this one up. Instead of attacking a religion (or religion in general) head on, he set up the Authority, which is very much a \\"straw man\\" (or straw god?). Instead of rational protagonists, he gave us New Age mumbo-jumbo mixed with Eastern mysticism. Pullman created what had to be one of the greatest villians ever, in Mrs. Coulter, but then ruined the character in the later books. The final explanation for the Dust was just plain stupid, and requires us to overlook some pretty major chicken-egg issues. And in the end, defeating the Authority didn't really matter, because the problems were man-made! Even accepting it as a children's book, this series had too many problems for me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I loved the first story more than the third, but like potato chips, you can't have just one..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am not at all ashamed to admitt that I am a 27 year old person, and I absolutly LOVED all of these books. The author, Pullman, gives such colorful and imaginative explinations that I would actually find it HARD not to fall in love with the main character, Lyra, and her friend, Will. Not to mention the scores of other colorful characters that fit into Lyra and Wills' adventures. I found myself so atatched to Lyra and the other characters in this book that I actually shed a tear MORE THAN ONCE during my readings. I highly recommend this seris of books not only for familys or the newly independent readers, but also for adults who like fantasy fiction books. I have found myself thinking about these books and these characters long after I retired them to my library."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After finishing all of the His Dark Materials trilogy, I have to say that I was not impressed with Pullman's writing style. As an Adult reader, I felt that there was quite a bit lacking in terms of scenery and in terms of characterization, and there were so many parts that droned on and on. And yet, at the end of all three books, there was a sense of a hurriedness that made the books feel really incomplete, especially in the first book (which was the best out of all of them). While the book was not bad enough for me to give up reading on it, I really abhorred the non-climactic ending of the trilogy. I am too spoiled by Tolkien's Hobbit and C.S. Lewis Narnia.As for children though, I would say they will probably eat it up and it's a good book for them to read if you don't mind the Anti-Church themes that begin to permeate around the middle of the first book. This hate for the dogmatism of religion culminates in the end of the third book as \\"'Christianity is a powerful and convincing mistake...'\\" which I am quoting directly from the Amber Spyglass. So parents beware if words like these frighten you. I am Christian myself, and was not offended because I see what Pullman is REALLY attacking, and it is religious zealots, but children may not be wise enough to understand.I will not be picking up anything by Pullman again because he simply bores me after a while."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I saw a trailer for a new movie called \\"The Golden Compass\\" and was intrigued.

You don't know who's trustworthy and who isn't. I recommend this story to all who are interested in good reading, especially fantasy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials Trilogy is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy or fairy tales. They're the sort of books that move quickly with an engaging plot, but have substance to back up the excitement. I often find Lyra, the main character, a bit too bold to be entirely believable, but her character is consistent through out the books and grows as events change her. These are books which provide as much enjoyment from a 3rd or 5th read as they do the 1st time through."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a longtime devotee of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was eager to read Pullman's books after a review in Tne New Yorker hailed theHis Dark Materials trilogy as its successor. I can see why; Pullman adds the dimension of time travel to his plot; there are the strange beasts, the heroic small people (children in this case, not hobbits or dwarves), and some concerns - child abuse and rotten parenting being the main ones - that were not issues in Tolkien.But the sweeping philosophical and historical background of Lord of the Rings is just absent in His Dark Materials, and therefore much of the characters' motivations doesn't make sense. Sure, you've got your \\"good-vs.-evil,\\" but the evil seems arbitrary; Lyra's parents are just not nice people, and there's no backstory that would explain why. Her mother's blithe murder of children, and possible willingness to do the same to Lyra, doesn't sit well with the indication toward the end of the last book that there was maternal love there after all.Nope, I think Tolkien has nothing to fear from Philip Pullman. He's still the King."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We started this trilogy with the audio version of The Golden Compass, stopping it here and there to discuss the Skraelings or to grab a map--especially National Geographic's old Peoples of the Arctic map. The story is shaded, layered, inventive, and wholly delightful right up until that ghastly sacrifice. I had some secret hope the book would end better. It doesn't.Book Two, The Subtle Knife, is neither sharp nor subtle. Instead of layers of story with ever-shifting tensions, it has clashing images that leave the more thoughtful readers saying \\"Wait, what?\\" Lyra is a different and much less interesting girl in this book. A boy named Will takes the lead in the story. Will has no mischief in his soul, and his grim outlook smothers any chance of Lyra finding a bit of amusement. This whole book should have been twenty to fifty pages long. My sons are gluttonous readers. Only one of them finally struggled through this book, saying he hoped #3 would be better.Book Three, The Amber Spyglass, has some haunting images but on the whole is impossible to enjoy. A new character named Mary is really no more than a plot device; if I were the editor, her entire contribution to this story would have taken up less than three full pages. Worse, the author used this book to hammer his atheist agenda down the reader's throat. The children find that the souls of the dead are imprisoned and tormented, and that every religion preaching otherwise is simply a lie. I don't mind children being exposed to alternative paradigms of reality, and I think teens should be exposed to a variety of religious outlooks. This book does not open doors to other ways, however; what it does is slam doors by saying that religion is only for deluded fools and the tyrants who control them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Phillip Pullman creates a wonderful story full of vivid characters. You easily fall for Lyra and the premise of the story and its parallel worlds is fascinating. He touches some serious questions and concepts; religion and social responsibility among them, while blurring lines between what we have been trained to see as good and evil in a way that you can easily follow. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I felt that the last installment, The Amber Spyglass may have been a bit rushed. Maybe I just didn't want it to end...? Overall I am thrilled that I finally found this series! One my favorite series!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman created a masterpiece that will be tresured fo generations!I love this trilogy so much!

All fantasy lovers will want to check these books out."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I started reading this book after picking it up many times at the bookstore. This first one was good, but defintly over my girls head who happens to be a very good reader. I started talking to people about the series and told them I was enjoying this book, and they said just watch our for the 2nd and 3rd. Ok, fiction is fiction right? I love sci-fi, and I am a born again believer and I would also say we are potter heads and were up till mid-night waiting for the new book. So I don't go along with what a lot of people think in this area. However, after reading these books (all three) I see what they meant. It makes me wonder, why he hates the cathlic church so much. What happened to him that he is so angry. It is amazing that he is at the same place that greats like Lewis and Toliken came from. I think that would be a great converasation to watch between the three if they were still alive. So ok for me as an adult how is not going to go ooh maybe Pullman is right. It is a work of fiction that is why I gave it 2 stars. Be careful with your kids."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought \\"His Dark Materials\\" book set because I saw it in a bookstore announced as fantastic literature, for children. It was sold beside Harry Potter and other famous children books. It is the kind of literature I find resting after a week at work.So it was extremely disappointing to find out that Mr Pullman's work is actually pseudo-children literature. More precisely, it is nothing more than cheap materialistic/atheistic propaganda disguised as book for kids.Mr Pullman obviously hates religions in general, Christianism in particular. To the point that his criticism becomes really pathetical. The bottom line is that God is bad, sin is good, matter and spirit are the same thing, our minds are nothing more than amplifiers of \\"conscious\\" cosmic energy, there are gay angels and wisdom and universal freedom are achieved by the satisfaction or your most base instincts (to put it mildly).The problem of \\"His dark materials\\" series is that the first book, \\"The golden compass\\", is really thrilling. Mr Pullman's has good ideas for the plot and his biases are yet not apparent; you see only a couple of out-of-place attacks to the church, but nothing to the point to feel there is really an issue there. This will be clearer in the second book, and blatantly obvious in the third one - by the way, the worst of the series: considering strictly the artistic merits, it is complicated, badly resolved, full of \\"out of the blue\\" escapes, and boring. I confess I just went to the end because I was sure that such a heap of nonsenses would have a powerful turn. \\"He cannot be saying this and that; of course all of this will be clarified and come to a good end\\", I kept thinking. Well, I was completely wrong.I am a professional chemist. As a scientist I cannot understand what Mr. Pullman finds so relieving in thinking that the atoms of our bodies will wander around the universe after our deaths, trying to find the atoms of our beloved. It is much easier to believe in God. Mr Pullman not only does not know anything about human spirituality. He lacks some scientific base as well.And poor ex-nun dr. Malone... because she found out that she got hormones, God does not exist. She wastes her time trying to talk to energetic \\"particles\\" (dust, shadow, whatever), and this is framed as legitimate scientific research. It is not a surprise her laboratory was going to be sacked and her grants cut off.So, if you are looking for good books for your children, may I suggest Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Harry Potter and Michael Ende (The Neverending Story is wonderful).Of course, this comment has a meaning only if you care about philosophy, scientific method and religion. And kids. I sincerely hope Mr Pullman's kids have not had that kind of \\"liberating\\" experience at the age of 13 that he seems to find so fundamental to achieve wisdom."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I found this series mildly entertaining primarily due to the author's use of alternate worlds and the adventures encountered by the witches, wizards, bad guys, gypsies and the other assortment of characters. Unfortunately the primary character, 11 year-old Lyra, is dreadfully difficult to care about. She is unfailingly rude, disobedient and unpleasant. The few forays into an attempt to show her vulnerable, agreeable side are handled clumsily and in some cases outside the realm of logic. The author insists on making her ally exclusively herself with boys rather than other girls, perhaps to emphasize that she is a tomboy. Adding fuel to the male-good, female-bad fire is the fact that her mother is portrayed as Satan herself and many of the adult male characters are drawn as heroic and self-sacrificing. The plot also veers a bit, people appear and leave, sometimes forever, without explanation. Quests become interrupted or foiled and are never reattempted or concluded. Finally, unlike Harry Potter, there is an amazing lack of racial diversity in these books. Except for some northern dwellers who may or may not be Inuit, everyone is described as white.It seems with this author whatever world you happen to find yourself color will be confined to sunsets and the northern lights."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was expecting to be blown away, what with all the great reviews. Sadly so, I was very disappointed. Well, not at first. The first book was okay. I would have rated it about 4 stars, had it not been for the second book, which then I would've rated 3 stars. And then the third book, well, it was such an effort to read. Add to that the blasphemous theme regarding the Authority (God). (If you believe in God like I do, this book could be offensive.) Moreover, the writing was not spontaneous, it felt contrived. The plot was often predictable. The characters, too, lacked substance. They were not very likeable nor at all convincing, not even Lyra, the main character, to me. Probably the only character I took to would be Iorek Byrnison, the armored bear king.I do agree with one reviewer who said that once you get into the first book, you probably should finish the rest, if only to find out what the ending is. And if you haven't read it at all but you're curious about the hype, you should probably read this trilogy, too, just to figure out what it's about. It's not that bad, really, it's just not that good either. (Well, the ending was pretty bad.) I just didn't enjoy this as much as I did Eragon and Eldest."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I'd like to identify myself as a liberal Christian. I scoffed at the Religious Right demanding that Harry Potter be banned because it advocated witchcraft. I walked proudly through the picketers to see Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ, and I found it to be a profound spiritual experience. But I can not stomach Pullman's work.I was given this boxed set as a gift because I enjoy fantasy novels. I'm glad I didn't spend my money to support these works.The first novel seems only to attack the Catholic church. While this is not exactly my cup of tea (I have respect for all denominations), it's not that unusual. Certainly some actions of the Catholic church (from the Inquisition to the recent sex abuse scandal) are reprehensible, although the Catholic beliefs themselves are filled with beauty and spiritual strength.However, by the end of the second book, when it became clear that these books were hate-filled attacks on God, I became repelled and sickened. In case you haven't heard these are not attacks on a god, but God. The Judeo-Christian God. The God that 90% of Americans in polls say they believe in.In my opinion, it's no use bringing up Milton or Blake. Both loved God. Milton was a Puritan, for heaven's sake, and Blake, although a Romantic rebel through and through, loved God and hated the abuses of organized religion. But Pullman hates God! And he has written a book for children that presents this hatred in an exciting, well-written story. This is seductive, sickening, and, yes, evil.I admit that I stopped reading after barely beginning the third book, since it was clear to me where it was going. I suspect that he wraps himself in the tired mantle of \\"I'm truly spiritual, not religious.\\" But make no mistake, any set of books that attacks the basic belief in a Judeo-Christian God is not spiritual in any sense. Hatred and bigotry are an attack on all spiritual beliefs. Be warned."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"While this series is well-written and engaging, as a parent and educator I wish to caution parents and teachers alike that Pullman's expressed aim in writing this series is &#34;to undermine the basis of Christian belief.&#34; This is not clearly realized until the second or third book when the reader is already engaged in the story line. It is not merely an anti-Christian book, it is an anti-GOD book and buyers should be aware of this. I read the series and enjoyed it immensely, but when I understood the basis of the story, I felt like I had been manipulated by this author and the publishers' agenda. To have this available to kids in some school districts could cause trouble from parents. As a teacher, I would definitely get parents' informed consent before allowing students to read this in class.Philip Pullman quote: &#34;We're used to the kingdom of heaven; but you can tell from the general thrust of the book that I'm of the devil's party, like Milton...The king is dead. That's to say I believe that the king is dead. I'm an atheist.&#34; &#60;http://observer.guardian.co.uk&#62;"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Unfortunately, Pullman lets his personal anti-Catholic prejudice ruin his storytelling. If you're going to attack Catholicism, that's fine, but do it openly, don't pretend to be writing a children's book.Beyond the atheism, the books just weren't fantastic, and the series ran out of air as it progressed, coming to a very bad ending in The Amber Spyglass.The first book was pretty good, if a bit unbelievable. Lyra as a character is fairly interesting, and the idea behind the book is intriguing. I especially enjoyed the idea of daemons- as a child I pretended something similar. Pullman describes this parallel reality beautifully. As a Catholic, however, I was slightly offended by the idea of an evil Magisterium. It could happen, of course, since humans are fallible, but I thought it was pretty lame.By The Subtle Knife, Pullman is losing steam. The plot was confusing, and Will, grown-up and responsible didn't seem to have the same pull and sparkle as Lyra. Again, the premise of a knife that cuts through the boundaries between worlds is interesting, but falls flat towards the end.The Amber Spyglass is dead. It's poorly-concealed atheism (they go to hell, liberate the poor suffering souls, and then go make war on heaven. Then they kill God, who turns out to be this weak little puppeteer.) The book, even once you get past the anti-Catholic rhetoric that simply drips from the pages, is fairly bad. Weak characters, flat dialogue.And this is to be compared to C. S. Lewis's beautiful stories of love or Tolkien's sweeping epics? Pathetic. Pullman has forgotten that a story is a story, not a sermon, and an author's first job is to tell it, not to preach. Lewis preached, but he told a good story as well. Pullman does only the first, and fairly badly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The book had the potential to be a great story but the writer failed to have any characters with any character.

The book is so well written that my husband procrastinated over correcting his undergrad students papers to finish reading the Volume 1. And we both agreed that our reading of \\"His dark Material\\" enlightened our understanding of Milton's Paradise Lost. But much more important, what Philip Pullman is doing is opening a window for fresh air, to freeing the thinking of younger readers upon the grand question of the existence or non-existence of God, the definitions of Hell, Heaven, goodness; and of the not less important questions related to the appropriateness of churches and religions; and by extension of what it means to be a plain good human being.

Personally I prefer the original title of the first book - The Northern Lights, but that is neither here nor there."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My only comment for it is&quot;The first book I ever cried for... hoping not to read the ending...&quot;And for Philip Pullman. He was the best story-teller ever...He pulled my dream out to the visibility of the truly best writer.And I owe British Council the greatest thanks of my timeless life. These 3 books would never have come to my hand if I didn't find the first book in this trilogy at the British Council's library.Please pass this on to anybody who love reading the story fulfilled with unlimited fantasy based on the quantum physics theory and the colorful fondness, and the perfect plot living by the trustfully strong, spiritual characters in the story ever written in the human history"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am reading this book right now, nearly done with the Golden Compass (the first of the trilogy). Unfortunately, this has resulted in some late nights the past several days, and my wife and daughter have begun to give hints that they are feeling neglected. It is that good!I started to read it to my daughter, who is five... however I stopped after the first page or two. There was talk of poisoning and killing, and other subjects I decided were too adult for her. I am glad I stopped reading to her: this can be a very dark book. HOWEVER, it is amazing and delightful, filled with amazing scenes and intrigue and danger. I can't wait for the movie!My suggestion is to pick this volume up. The trilogy has some of the same characters in it, and details their ongoing adventures in their world and others. Additionally, Pullman apparently has written material at the end of each book explaining things. As I wrote earlier, I haven't finished the first book as of yet so I can't tell you the quality of the additional materials. Either way the first story alone is worth the purchase price.Update 08-25-07: I am nearly done with the third book in the trilogy. It is the most amazing thing that I have ever read. Whew! I read somewhere that Niccole Kidman and the new James Bond (I can never remember his name) have signed on for the movie versions of the final two books in this series. I would like to see how Hollywood does with Pullman's incredible work. But, you may have some reservations after reading the rest of my review below.SPOILER ALERT: And a warning...The one gripe that I have is this: Besides the murder of children, and all the other dark stuff (I still can't believe this is a kid's book!) which I find terrible, it is really not kind to what I consider my core beliefs, which is God and Christ, and the Catholic church. The Catholic Church isn't mentioned by name (they call it The Church), but there are priests and angels and a war against The Authority which they also call God / I AM, Yaweigh, etc.The theory behind this book is that God didn't make the universe. He came after and basically took credit. All the terrible things out there are his creation, and the first rebellion were good angels who were fed up with His ruling. The church is bad. They send a murderous priest after the children/ heroes. The church is also behind the murders of other children. They are doing terrible things in the name of God.The funny thing about it is the other side, the side that's fighting against the Authority, really isn't all that nice either. In fact, they are also doing terrible things!Everything is building up to one knock down drag out fight for the ages. It honestly makes Harry Potter sound like a bad barroom brawl.So, there you have it... as a parent, is this something you want your children to be exposed to? Do you want to expose yourself to this? I think I'll wait several years until my daughter is able to understand the weighty and controversial words that Pullman has written. And in the meantime, I'll continue reading."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I received this trilogy by accident through one of my book clubs (I had forgotten to cancel the monthly selection)... I was too lazy to send it back, so I picked up the first book and began reading it. Within a few paragraphs, I was hooked; I devoured the first one and plunged right into the next... and then the last... and they are still three of my favorite books.The first book is set in a fantasy world that is kind of like a version of our world in the past, if the Catholic church had gone a different course; the main character is Lyra, an adventurous tomboy... the second book is set in our world, or one very similar, and features as it's main character Will, a quietly heroic young boy who is looking out for his mother in the midst of some very strange events... and the last book brings the two worlds and heros together seamlessly.The characters are extraordinarily dynamic, the writing descriptive, and the plot fantastic. The story sucks you in and keeps you moving right along with the characters.For adults, this novel offers an elegantly written, fast paced adventure with political undertones and commentary on the role of organized religion in modern society. There is also romantic tension, and the particular stirrings of love that can only be felt by children about to lose their innocence by entering puberty -- tottering on that fine line between childhood and not-quite-a-child/not-quite-an-adult. Pullman captures these emotions better than any other children's writer I've found.For kids, this is pure fantasy and adventure at it's finest. My 5 year old has listened to these stories on audiobook with us and loved them, and has begun reading the books with me at bedtime. Although a lot of the heavier ideas behind the plotline escape him, he still enjoys the adventure and the thrill of hiding in closets... jumping across rooftops... and joining Gypsies on their riverboats... not to mention everything else that goes on!I highly recommend this set! I wish there was more to read bout these characters."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are the best books that I've ever read. They are also the saddest. I cried for two days and still can't get those books out of my mind. The main character of atleast the first book (other big characters are there too) is a girl of about 11 or 12. She's stuck in the middle of this war between worlds (this book's more of a philosiphical book than a fantasy or sci-fi though it's sort of like both of these kinds of books.) I have a friend who read these books too, they're about her favorite ever. If you don't read these books I truely feel sorry for you. You aren't a true human being until you read these books. I am thirteen and it's really hard to get me to like a book. I read at least one or two books every two months and I know I'm a good reader but it's hard to get me to enjoy a book. I loved these books! They're the best books ever, though they will affect you a lot. Beware, they aren't just blah-blah-blah every day books. They're fun, exciting, page turning books also, though. Thanks for reading my review."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I would not expect to see this fantasy series on a recommended reading list put out by the Catholic Church. He is clearly not a fan of heroically/autocratic religious organizations.The book chronicles the actions and adventures of a young girl and her friends against a corrupted, power hungry \\"church\\". The characters are well developed and seem \\"alive\\" in every sense, including the non-human ones. The book holds together well. There is a lot of action, good dialog, suspense, etc., everything that makes for a good read.I would have given the series a 5 star rating, but I was not satisfied with the ending, although some may disagree.All humans in Phillip Pullman' universe have a \\"daemon\\" spiritually attached to them, that is a reflection of that humans soul. The daemon can take many shapes when the human is young, but as the human matures into an adult, the daemon takes its permanent form."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I first was introduced to this trilogy by a friend that had the audiobooks. It was a fantastic story that kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters are full of life and the story is jam packed full of excitement. If you want a story that will take you to other worlds and draw you into them, check this one out!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story line is interesting but by the third book it becomes a little incoherant. We saw far too much of irritating characters and too little of intriguing ones. Much has been made of the anti Christian aspects of the story line. Even those while seeming to develop in The Golden Compass have deteriated to incomprehensibility by the third book The Amber Spyglass. For a childrens book series it is remarkably devoid of hope."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have to rate this book right up there with Harry Potter and Eragon. Its an \\"easy-read\\", classified for young adults, but at the age of 40-something, I enjoyed it, cover to cover. I even read it slower as I got closer to the end, so I wouldn't be done so soon."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"What Phillip Pullman has managed to do is create an enticing first book which leads you into the second and third without fully understanding what his views are. As a non-Catholic Christian, I find much of Pullman's ideas plain wrong or illogical. The books are interesting, but pretty much just a sounding board for Pullman's anti-Christian Views."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman's trilogy is excellent. A friend had been trying to convince me for two years to read the series. I finally got around to it and am sorry that it took so long to finally do this. The books are excellent. Each are well written and flow right into the next. Some people have told me they felt the third book was the weakest in the series, but I disagree. To me they were all equally strong. Each book flows excellently into the next. Mr. Pullman crafted a fine epic tale."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Harry Potter books were amusing, but they don't even begin to be in the same league as these books.Although not a big fan of Pullman's other stuff, I must nevertheless state that these books defy description. It was like discovering the magic of reading all over again."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book was great. The phsycology behind the children specialy Lira was well develop. I totaly loved the talking polar bears and the shape shiftting companions daemons. It was very imaginative. When I started reading the second book I tought it was going to be as good as the first, mistake from my part. The second book left in a tangent and a book I originaly tought it will be great for kids became a scientific flop, with ideas that for my opinion are to abstract for a child of any age could possibly understand. As my frustration went on, the third book got worst. The children all of a suden started acting like adults I could not pinpoint the ages of Lira and Will. They were acting like 30 year olds instead of pre-teens. It was like reading something writen at the last minute. Every book I buy my nices and nephews, I have to read first, and I will not let them read this set until they are in college and have some undertanding of particle physics, energy, chemistry, and some theology classes because I do not want them thinking this have any bearing besides being a fictional piece of work."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have been a SF fan for 40 years. I am an open-minded Christian who is not easily offended, but it is clear there is an agenda here. This is well above average young-adult SF but some of the most virulent anti-Christian propaganda I have ever read. Read it before introducing it to your kids. If you chose to, then read it with your older kids and discuss it with them. It may lead to some interesting discussions if they have reached the age to start questioning their faith. I hope that was the author's intent, but I think not."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy came highly recommended, so i dove right in. The first book caught me up in Lyra's world immediately, she is a great character. And ultimately, that's became my problem with these books. Some of the other characters are not as well drawn, especially Lyra's parents. I never felt her parents were completely believable parts of Lyra's story. They seemed to belong to some place other than Lyra's world, and maybe the writer should have left them there.Pullman has created a very special world(s), and for that i thank him for the introduction."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I thought this series was wonderful...until I got to the end and was so thoroughly disappointed I would not recommend it to anyone. What a waste of time. The first book was awesome. The second book was even better. The third was a chore getting through. The whole series was so original and inventive it was a great disappointment that he ended it on such a sappy love story. I didn't care at all in the end."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Oh my god. Where do I begin? These books are some of the best books EVER written!!! After even the first few pages you're hooked. The story is GREAT. The characters are wonderful. It has a GREAT and interesting plot. These books aren't like normal books. The story is really different from other books. I recommend these books to ANYONE!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman is a master of story telling and imagery. The subject matter, however, is not appropriate for children despite the book's cover which recommends the book for ages 10 and up. My objections? The heroine, Lyra, sets off to rescue her dear friend who has been kidnapped and is horrified when she learns that he was kidnapped for a religious experiment in which children are surgically separated from their daemons (external manifestations of their souls) which either kills the children or leaves them in a perpetual zombie-like state. The experiment has been performed countless times under the direction of . . . Lyra's mother. Lyra views her father with a mixture of admiration and fear.This is a book that will teach children to be fearful, not hopeful. It will teach them that they are alone, not part of a family or community. It will teach them to distrust the adults in their lives, not turn to them for advice or assistance. Because the imagery is fabulous, the lessons are more readily learned."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read the whole trilogy straight-through after reading a glowing review by Christopher Hitchens in Vanity Fair. The books were on-par with The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. And there is the rub. The Dark Materials books were written in part as an atheist's response to the Narnia books. Pullman can barely disguise his contempt for Lewis, who is a hero of mine. The Narnia books have long been a staple for the education of Christian children, and bring to life for children the concepts of sin and grace. Tolkien too was a devout Catholic, whose books brim with Christianity. I will give Pullman his due. His books are beautifully written and are a thoughtful, though scathing, critique of Christianity. These books should be read by mature Christians, but to put them into the hands of immature minds who cannot yet read critically is not wise. Stick to Tolkien and Lewis for the children, and read these books yourself."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Thank you for the speedy delivery of this item, the box set is a treasurable item that i will have for life.

If I can count on what I read, Pullman has said he doesn't like labelling books as this category and that group, however you ARE most likely to find this on the \\"Fantasy\\" shelf of any bookstore. The very intense \\"theme\\" is as far from fantasy as possible, this story goes fathoms beyond its label.I cannot stress enough how important it is for everyone to read this book! If your house catches fire, I HOPE these will become the books that you decide to throw out the window first, but even if you let them burn, Pullman is brilliant and this story is changing, you will come away from it different and better for having read and experienced it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think that this trilogy of books is one of the best series I have ever read. I enjoy some fantasy, but I am often dismayed by the way fantasy books tend to rely on clich&eacute;s, making the books less engaging for me. These are not that kind of books!!Although the books are supposedly for children, they deal with philosophical themes that kids might not understand, although the story is engaging enough. I would definitely recommend it to adults who are willing to look at traditional religious stories from a new perspective."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First of all to those people who think this book is blasphemous,it's just a BOOK! It's not going to HURT anyone.Besides that, I think these books are so amazingly great. Some of the characters are difficult to place on the good or the bad side, and I like that. Most characters in books are so obviously good or bad that you get bored. And to those who say the books are depressing, well, so is life sometimes! As another reviewer said, you have to take the bad with the good. These books are very different than other books I've read, butI found that they were different in a good way, and so I would definitely reccomend these books!Go and get them!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Just wanted to say that my copy of this trilogy is all but falling apart because I have read it so many times.

The characterisation is beatiful and the story has brilliant continuity. People have made a big deal about this book because it glamourises anti christian ideas or something like that. IGNORE THEM reading this book is like a breath of fresh air, if this is anti catholic then so is Paradise Lost."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Finally, a set of children's fantasy books that goes a bit against the grain and addresses serious issues that will cause children to think. If you want to brainwash your kids into following your imperfect footsteps, by all means boycott these books. If you want your children to learn, think, and make their own path by their own free will, these books are a great compass."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's excellent style of writing, mixed with his provocative ideas lead to the most magnificent fantasy series since \\"The Lord of the Rings\\".brilliantly written, and not at all childish.NOTHING LIKE HARRT POTTER!!

How wrong was I. When I took my mom's suggestion to read \\"His Dark Materials\\" I became entranced within the first chapter. I was amazed at how the books kept my attention throughout the entire story. Pullman's vocabulary and imagination was excellent as well.In the story the main character, a girl named Lyra is drawn into an epic quest far greater and important than she could imagine. During her adventures and struggles she faces Gobblers and stolen children, witch clans and armored bears and later, in the second book befriends a boy named Will. Together Lyra, Will and a host of other characters fight for freedom, for life and humanity. The endings are the last things you could ever expect and much, much more.My recommendation is to read these books! Read them, read them, read them. Don't hesitate. Go out there and by them right now! You won't regret it!!Here are some other great fantasy books for those who do and don't like these ones:-The Lord of the Rings [books] - by J.R.R.

These are the best books I have read since The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings(also must read and see the movie, extremely good). If you are of any age or reading level, you must read these books, no matter how long it takes you.

About a month ago, desperate for something I could loose myself in, I picked up \\"The Golden Compass.\\" It was in the \\"young - mature\\" or some-such section of the bookstore, and I was put off until I read the frontpiece. It seems to me any book that begins with a (truly frightening) quote from \\"Paradise Lost\\" deserves a much broader placement than \\"young - mature.\\"I raced through the trilogy, glad the only wait I had to experience between volumes was the time it took to catch my breath.\\"His Dark Materials,\\" is a deep climb into myth and archetype that is the hero's journey, a critique of organized religion, a travelogue of alternate worlds, and a breathtaking adventure. Philip Pullman has pulled together a cast of characters that seems to touch on the entire diversity of Western mythology, including the wild-western; as well as every dark bedroom fear of childhood. The trilogy is grounded in the coming-of-age story of his protagonists (Lyra and Will), and flies into fantasy with the telling of a new age in the universe.As a writer Mr. Pullman works a dynamic that races with gore and violence, gentles in natural idyll, provokes with psychology, philosophy, theology, and what some would call \\"heresy,\\" and compels with deft plotting, and well crafted characters.I'm glad I read this series as an adult, wish I had read it as a 12 year old, would recommend it to the mature young reader with no hesitation, and to the older reader who has not lost his or her sense of wonder."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is a remarkably ambitious and carefully constructed fantasy, and it's highly readable: as they say, a rattling good yarn. Still, big claims have been made for it by many readers, and Pullman himself makes his ambitions as a mythologist and cosmographer clear, with his fondness for epigraphs from Milton's _Paradise Lost_ and from Blake's Prophetic Books. Perhaps as a response I find myself strangely disappointed with the series, since the incredibly rich fantasy world of the books ends up squashed between, on the one hand, a standard-issue the-fate-of-the-universe-is-hanging-by-a-thread adventure story, and on the other, a fair bit of preachiness.I suppose I can't complain at how much of-its-time the books seem now, even though they were written so recently, in the 1990s. The series' preoccupations and themes include: quantum physics; chaos theory; many-universes theories; panpsychism; global warming and pollution; traditional healing and herbology; shamanism; mental illness and depression; witches as wise and benificent rather than evil figures; angels (gay angels, even); a virulent hostility to organized religion (with the church portrayed as an insanely self-righteous, authoritarian institution, with a particular fondness for abusing children while claiming to do them good); a matching suspicion of technology and science as embodying power without concern for ethics. Still, Pullman can be very crude and schematic in the exposition of these themes: e.g. here's a sample bit of dialogue (admittedly an untypically bad passage):\\"When I first saw you, in your Oxford,\\" Lyra said, \\"you said one of the reasons you became a scientist was that you wouldn't have to think about good and evil. Did you think about them when you were a nun?\\"\\"Hmm. No. But I knew what I _should_ think: it was whatever the Church taught me to think. And when I did science, I had to think about other things altogether. So I never had to think about them for myself at all.\\"&c;The other problem is that Pullman's inventiveness as a fantasist - marvellous things like the carefully worked out idea of a world where everyone has a \\"daemon\\" (animal-shaped familiar), like an embodied soul; or the eerie wraith-haunted cite of Citagazze - is not matched by an inventiveness in plotting. The novels are far too reliant on a quick succession of cliffhangers, and there's a distressing tendency to have another character step in unannounced at the last second to save the heroes or otherwise advance the plot. A lot of the dependence on fortunate coincidence and eleventh-hour rescues is papered over by the implication that much of the action is directed by Fate, but it's hard not to feel this is a nice way of giving weight to what's really the novelist's convenience. (Similarly for Pullman's habit of killing off characters the moment their function in the plot is done: there's a particularly bloody pileup at the end of book 2, _The Subtle Knife_.) There are also some weak points in the plotting: e.g. in book 3, the inexplicable stupidity of the powerful angelic Regent Metatron.But ultimately the most serious problem is that, between the pellmell plotting and overarching \\"serious\\" concerns, the characters are pancake-flat. The most interesting is surely Mrs Coulter, who is genuinely evil and yet turns out curiously sympathetic (presumably this is in part Pullman's homage to Milton's portrait of Satan). But Lyra and especially Will don't have much depth: both of them are given a slightly one-noted fixation on a loved one (Lyra's friend Roger, & Will's mother) and are likeable enough, but they're otherwise generic examples of pluckiness & determination. You'd have thought that Pullman would have noticed that one of the significant achievements of his beloved Milton was the delineation of character: Satan, the various rebel angels, and Eve.None of this is to say the series isn't a success on its own terms: as an adventure and as a delineation of a fantasy world it's excellent. But I was hoping for more."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"PHILIP PULLMAN CRAFTS an engrossing epic riddled with inconsistencies and absurdities, infuriating the thinking reader. I was enticed across the thousand plus pages with great rapidity, from one ridiculosity to the next, longing to see just how much Pullman expects his audience to swallow.Essentially, I came for the steampunk, and stayed to gain the authority to write a bad review. The aesthetic of Northern Lights, especially the charming portrayal of the children of Oxford and the thrilling journey to the far North, met my expectations (the most beautiful scene, though, is in the opening chapters of The Amber Spyglass). But even here the yawning seams of the narrative begin to tear under the tiniest pull.His Dark Materials is one of the most anti-child novel I have ever read. Though Pullman does not so narrate outright, his trilogy has an amazing phobia of children. Dust does not gather around them--what else do you need to know? That Pullman uses the same Botanical Gardens that inspired parts of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is pure sacrilege. He belittles the intense purposiveness of children, ignores their unique powers of imagination, and sidelines the \\"unconscious grace\\" he barely admits that they have. According to his predictable Planned Parenthood style of reasoning, children are less human than teens and even the mulefa.Pullman makes much use of the facile method of attributing the crimes of one's own side to the enemy. If you want to see lethal child cutting, the place to go is the city abortion clinic. Pullman portrays the Church in the zaniest of ways to achieve the desired resonance with an audience of kneejerk iconoclasts (and he attacks the Catholic Church by name; he is at least wise enough to pass over the C of E and confront the only Christian church in his country). The Magisterium is portrayed as Manichean; Pullman knows better. There is even a Silas lookalike, only sans the paleness and a full-fledged priest rather than an \\"Opus Dei monk\\".As for those Christians who have endorsed the work for its moral message...well, we finally have confirmation that Rowan Williams is not a Christian.One of the strengths of His Dark Materials is the treatment of technology, by way of the subtle knife, a metaphor for science. However, Pullman carefully separates wariness of the knife from the Magisterium's wariness of Lord Asriel's research, making for a schizophrenic treatment of both. Of course, if Pullman did connect the two, his own narrative would undermine his obligatory atheistic belief that scientific progress is always good.His Dark Materials is not a waste of time, and is at times exciting. But those who seek an epic that intelligently touches on the fundamental questions of human life, look elsewhere. And insofar as it does so threaten to be mistaken, few works more richly deserve a fate in the hearthfire."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was reccomended this by a friend, and reading it has been one of the greatest accomplisments of my life, okay perhaps exaggerating a bit but these books are really awesome. Pullman manages to construct several worlds all of which have many similar and interestingly different attributes. He describes each world, character, and idea masterfully, but not overly as to make it dull. He also manages to create his own religion, which may disturb some younger children or those who don't understand that it's just a story. Never draggy, always gripping, can't say enough good things about it! It's one of those books that makes you laugh, think, cry and leaves you aching for more."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In my life I have read a good amount of books and book series, this is the only series that I have read more than once, and every time I read it, I discover something new. The first time I read it I was probably in about 6th or 7th grade. I was hooked by the deep story and plot twists. The Second time was in eight grade, at this time the religious part of the book hit me and I was once again hooked. Finaly was in tenth grade, and I was really sucked into to theories on physics and even more deeper into the religious aspect. When I read it again I am sure I will once again become enthralled with the story and ideas, it is a book that fills you up so much while reading it, then when you finish it you feel like youv'e been cheated, robbed, of a beautiful thing that is once again over. To say I recomend this book is an understatement, I think it should be required reading, to the point that my teachers friends who haven't read it I badger repeatedly until they do read it. In a sentence, read it, love it, learn from it, and think about it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Many people have complained about the \\"atheist\\" or \\"agnostic\\" theme of these books. I say that they are wrong... there clearly IS a God in this book, he's just not a good guy. Instead, this book is a good way to introduce your child to early Christian thought, including that of the Gnostics, who seem to agree more with this book than atheists.As far as the book is concerned, I always found it a little difficult to read, and the concepts were a bit slow going. If your kid doesn't like to be challenged, then he or she should not read this book. However, if you're willing to put a little bit of effort into reading, I think the payback is worth it. Children don't renounce their religion because of a book, not if they've been raised correctly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I first read this book it was for a quick read. I picked up The Golden Compass for a trip I had to make. I thought it would be a good read. Boy was I pleased. The characters are beliveable and likable.I've heard other people say don't let children read this because it will upset their faith. But I don't think that is true. I know a lot of children who've read this book but still are faithful. I mean if you have so little faith in you children teach about the religion and stop protesting books. I personally liked the story about The Authority and the Angels."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is literature at its best. Never before I have been so deeply into books like this. I have read a wide variety of children's book, and this surpasses all of them. The plot and characters draw you in like a starving man to food. It is much superior to Harry Potter in many, many ways.Those who dislike this book because of the anti-religious view on life are truly missing the point and an excellent book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials is the best series of books I have read. I'm a huge fan of young adult fantasy literature, and this is the best out there.This book is not sugar-coated like Harry Potter or C.S. Lewis, and it's not full of 20-page long poetry like Tolkien. Granted, I like those books a lot, but His Dark Materials, it just, seems real, and alive. Another series with this quality is the Sabriel/Lirael/Abhorsen sequence (highly recommended).Don't listen to the negative reviews based on moral content and religion. I'll admit, Pullman's ideas are very present and very obvious in the story. Whether you agree or disagree, don't let that detract from your enjoyment of an incredible story.These books are amazing literature, and an incredible read. The concepts and depth of the worlds that Pullman creates are incredible. Throughout the three books, I've seen characters change and grow so much that I feel like I know them. It's amazing how moving and interesting these books are. I highly recommend them.other recommended authors: Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Tolkien (the silmarillion especially), and Madeline L'Engle"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The His Dark Materials trilogy was my second attempt to find a series to keep me busy between Potter books (the first being Tolkein), and I have to say, it was extremely rewarding. The comparisons to Harry Potter should stop at the fact that both series include children as main characters, fall into the Fantasy realm, and have British authors. HDM is a darker series with a much more controversial storyline. In the books, Lyra, a girl raised by a college of professors in an alternate-universe kind of Oxford, and Will, a boy with a haunted mother and a missing father, journey through their world and other worlds to save the world's children from one man's plan to cut them from their daemons (the outward manifestation of the soul). To say that this is a complex story is an understatement, yet Pullman creates more than one beautiful world with grace and apparent ease.The books have been released both as young-adult trade paperbacks and as mass-market paperbacks geared to attract adult science fiction/fantasy readers, and I think the latter audience is the more likely sell. This is a fabulous series for adults and older children, particularly if they can read it together and discuss its points."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is amazing!! I was immediately hooked, right from the beginning of the first one. It was so good that after finishing it I went to the library as soon as I could to see if there were the other two. You can imagine my disappointment when I found that they were not there! But I was so hooked up by the series that I had to go to the nearest book shop and see if it had them! Luckily for me it did and I have never been so addicted to a trilogy like this. While reading it I was continually wishing that I would get to the end and see how it would end (I also had homework to do) but at the same time I wished that the books were never ending! Unfortunately they are not infinite but they're so good that I'm sure that no matter how many times I read them I will never get bored of them! The trilogy is a very good combination of fantasy and quantum physics!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a captivating story of a young girl who is to save the universe.I read this book because one of my best friends was reading in on a ski trip we went together over Xmas break. Bored, I picked up the first book in the series and could not stop reading, until 4 days later I finished the triology.I then gave the book to my ten year old sister, and though it took her 2 months to read the series, she too loved it.Pullman does a great job of creating a fantasy world and brings it to life.Not only is this book a great book for the story, but on a analysis level, it is deep and can be interpretted on many different levels.I highly recommend this book, no matter what age you are, you will love it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"One day. I was walking around in a bookstore. My friend and I were doing a swap read: I decided to read the book she was so mad about as she decided to read a book I was mad about. After reading that book, I thought nothing would be able to follow it up. But how I was wrong...Strolling through the shelves, I scoured the bookshelves for a writer called Pullman, and a book called Northern Lights(in Australia the Golden Compass is called Northern Lights). Finally I found it, wedged between the fantasy books. Suspicious as ever, I decided that I would sample the first chapter because my friend doesn't always agree with my taste of books...But this time, I was proven wrong. The first chapter alone was a pageturner, and brought up many mysterious questions. I couldn't fight my curiosity, and in the end I had no choice but to buy the book.But once I had finished Northern Lights, I would not stop there, buying the other two books.Had I been sure of this book, I could have saved myself a lot of money by buying the boxed set, and I beg you not to make the same mistake now.

After reading the series I discovered that I was wrong. It left me with an uncomfortable feeling, my spirit had been wounded. It wasn't a good feeling like I had in Harry Potter where my spirit felt uplifted and I wanted more.In reading The Golden Compus you get caught up in the adventure of Lyra and all those who assist her in fulfilling her prophetic destiny. It was the best out of the three and If you're going to read the series I'd advise stopping there. In order to discover the whole of her prophetic destiny you need to continue with The Subtle Knife and The Amber Spyglass for they bring this prophetic destiny into view and it's not what you think as you're reading the first volume. The storys main charactors fight to bring about the distruction of the kingdom of Heaven and the death of God. Lyra's destiny is to bring about a new republic, a republic of Heaven, where God does not exist.I felt a great dissapointment in the theme of the books and the publicity it is getting as a bestseller. It's as if the story is being told by an anti Christ and it's message shows God and the Kingdom of Heaven and all those who support him as evil and all those who fight to destroy him and his kingdom as good.I'm going to send the set I purchased for my grandson back for a refund."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a book that is being marketed to 8-12 year olds.

The book is about a girl investigating the disappearance of some friends. She discovers that her parents are involved in the kidnap, torture and murder of school age children."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"As a Protestant Christian, I decided to read these books because I wanted to have an educated opinion of them and all the controversy surrounding them. The result was that I came away with an odd mixture of opinions.First of all, for all parents out there (especially Christian ones) these are NOT books for young children to read. They contain scenes of graphic violence, they encourage lying and rebellion. They glorify preadolescent, and extramarital sex, even if it is in a very subtle way. For those who care, they are the most anti-Christian, anti-faith story books I have ever read. Philip Pullman is an atheist/agnostic and makes it abundantly clear in his trilogy.Secondly and from a purely literary point of view, Pullman is a very gifted writer. He knows how to weave a fascinating story. He makes one care about his characters and the fate of his worlds. The correlation to \\"Paradise Lost\\" is brilliant. Sadly, he has thrown away his potential to write about truly great things by choosing to ruminate on his own hatred of \\"organized religion' i.e. Christianity. It is very pointedly Christianity he writes against and not just any organized religion. He makes no comparisons at all in the books to Islamic jihads or other religions which have spawned blood baths. I also find it interesting that he makes no allegorical allusions to any kind of non-Christian political party which uses its power to oppress people. The communist party is responsible for millions of deaths and its leaders are comprised almost solely of atheists. Would have been interesting if he had mentioned them.He uses his books to drive home his own agenda and believe me he DOES have an agenda. As opposed to the relatively harmless Harry Potter books, it is impossible to read these stories and deny any ulterior motives. Pullman himself has stated that his intention in writing these books was to influence children toward atheism. This is a direct quote from \\"The Amber Spyglass\\": \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\" How in the world do people argue that these books are not anti-Christian?A third conclusion I drew from these books is that Pullman has a terrible, terrible understanding of Christianity itself. I mean he really does not get it. (I suppose this is true of all atheists) His experience with the Christian faith is only that of the politics, rules and corruption of the Catholic Church. He has no grasp whatsoever of true faith in the God of the Bible. He knows the Bible but he does not understand it. He views sin as \\"natural pleasures\\" and depicts resistance to it as \\"repression\\". He also seems to suffer from the delusion that Christianity discourages any kind of sexual pleasure. This is a gross misconception. God strongly encourages it as long as it is within the bonds of marriage. (Read \\"The Song of Solomon\\".)I was both disgusted and amused at Pullman's depiction of \\"God\\" as a feeble and geriatric being. I assume that this character is a fantasized version of what he thinks God is really like. The last book especially is overflowing with the relief he would evidently feel if the world were to discover that God was simply a fraud. Poor man. If his \\"God\\" were truly the one running the world it would be in a much worse state than it actually is. I suspect that, contrary to Pullman's claims that he is an atheist or agnostic (he can't seem to make up his mind which) he is in reality a misotheist (one who hates God). If he were simply indifferent to God and to Christianity, then I don't see the reason for him to basically write a three-book rant against the two, ending with \\"God\\" being killed. There's definitely some kind of negative feeling going on there.The end result is a confusing and morally ambiguous world view. I don't envy him it. His books are populated by broken families and separated loved ones. His explanation about death is basically lifted from the hindu religion. I could not figure out what his heroin's great \\"choice\\" was supposed to have done for the universe. There is a definite flavor of nihilism and anarchy by the end of the third book. He tries to reconcile it all with a neat little moral admonition, which I suppose is his version of the meaning of life; basically to be good and learn a lot and work for grace, but it falls flat. (Incidentally both of these concepts are directly contradictory to Christianity; we are told that we cannot work for grace, it is freely given and that \\"All our righteousness (being good) is like filthy rags.\\" Isaiah 64 4-9)The whole time I was reading HDM, a verse from the Bible kept popping into my mind: \\"For the message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved it is the power of God.\\" I Corinthians 1:18) Poor Philip Pullman is a shining example of the first part of that verse.In ending, I would actually encourage people (older people) to read these books. They are a fascinating insight into an atheist's faith system, not to mention ripping good stories. (If you can stomach all the polemic.) When you're done with these, I challenge you to go read the Bible cover-to-cover and compare it against Pullman's personal gospel. I know which one I'm sticking with.I would only rate \\"His Dark Materials\\" with one star except that I have to tack on an extra one simply as a nod to Pullman's writing talent. [...][...]"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Having enjoyed The Golden Compass to the point of calling it the single greatest adventure story I've ever read, I was severely disappointed by The Subtle Knife. While I am from the generation that was supposedly desensitized to violence, I found the depictions of violence and sexual innuendo to be in poor taste and unnecessary to the plot, which was almost nonexistent. This book is completely inappropriate for children (and some squeamish adults) and parents should be aware of the content before handing it to anyone under 17. The richness and wonder of the first novel in the His Dark Materials trilogy was not present here, and even favorite characters became annoying and one-dimensional. The entire book was just poorly written. I found myself reading the plot summary on Wikipedia just so I could avoid wasting any more time reading The Subtle Knife and move on to The Amber Spyglass. At this point, I do not trust Mr. Pullman with his own characters and am hopeful that Book 3 redeems him."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Until tonight, I was insulated completely from the whole debate on religion, so that hasn't been a factor (I'm woefully deficient in reading Hollywood gossip and watching sensationalist news programs, it seems). I bought the first book at least 4 years ago and have made at least 3 attempts at reading it, most recently after moving and finding the thing in a box. It's just no good--I can't manage to hack through it. The prose is thick and the plot so well-hidden I haven't managed yet to discern what the book is supposed to be about or which direction it's heading. I'm 40-some, childless, and a big fan of Tolkien, Asimov, Clarke, CJ Cherryh, Frank Herbert, Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. LeGuin, Piers Anthony, Poul Anderson, etc. etc. so I've read a fair few SF/Fantasy works. I just haven't read this one...and it's not for lack of trying."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Please be advised to research this author, his personal comments and beliefs before you have your children exposed to these books. Also beware of the movie based on the first book coming out in Dec. They have watered the content down, but the over all anti-christian/established religion message is still there."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This review is for Northern Lights/Golden Compass only -- I have enough to say on the first book before getting through the other two. I'm reading the 'adult edition' but have already read the standard 'non-adult' one. The only difference I can see so far is the adult one gives Pullman more room to throw around his explanations of Vatican/Magisterium (Vagisterium?) details and the science of the world. The former is boring and better said elsewhere, and the latter just forced me to look up 'anbaric' on Google.I'll get this out of the way: I'm neither atheist nor Christian by practice. I like Paradise Lost, Thus Spake Zarathustra, Narnia, The Bible itself (really, it is a work of literature) and Salman Rushdie (particularly Satanic Verses, which had nothing to do with 'Satan') equally. Not a big fantasy fan anymore but I figured I'd check these books out, given that I find the concepts intriguing. In short, I'm less a believer than a thinker and interpreter, which makes me a prime target for Pullman's agenda, right?A shame his writing just can't support the claims. Here's the long-and-short: his writing is at turns sluggish, self-involved and unhelpful; the characters are inconsistent; and the plot is just too convenient to get Lyra where Pullman wants her to be plausible.Firstly, the writing. Is this a children's book? Another reviewer has quoted Pullman saying 'I don't write children's books, I write books children read'. Personally I find this distinction redundant -- if he's aware that children read his books, then it follows that he's going to write them (or edit them) with children in mind (although not exclusively, of course). So if it is written with children in mind, then we can excuse some of the bad writing, the clich&eacute;s, etc. But if he's going for literature (and by the material, pardon the pun, he appears to be), Pullman's a far cry short of the likes of Ishiguro, Rushdie and Atwood -- who, for all their pretension, are 'modern' literary writers with more than a slight dipping towards Sci-Fi or Fantasy.A minor nitpick: Pullman's also erratic with the accents, particularly in regards to the 'gyptians'. Now and then they'll put 'a' before their words, but when they're doing lengthy explanations, somehow this miraculously disappears and the gyptian speaker is as fluent and coherent as any of Jordan's scholars.Let's look at Lyra for a sec. She's spoiled, arrogant and crass. These are, however, all pretty forgivable if you consider some of the great protagonists in literature. What is not forgivable is the inconsistency: one moment she's behaving like a 'savage' street urchin drinking (experimentally but 'liking it') and smoking, the next she's intrigued with the scholarly talk of 'Dust', then she's a young lady interested in perfume and Coulter's world, then she's starting to act like a 'gyptian' after living with them a few weeks, and THEN she's able to use some highly esoteric device that has baffled or eluded the scholars. Sure, you ride the story out assuming the author is going to explain these sooner or later, but I'd already lost faith in this author's ability to do so quite early. Only the idea that these books are an easy read kept me going (further proof that they're not literature -- literature that you don't like demands to be put down, because it's work that's not paying off).The manner in which the adults spoil and coddle Lyra, protect and groom her is less plausible than the notion that the girl is just a quirky Mary Sue for Pullman, who (true to his atheist proclamations) seems to reward Lyra's 'amoral' behaviour by giving her a slew of guardians and a wonderful quest to go on, etc. Another inconsistency? The book starts with her thwarting an attempt to murder her uncle by the Master of Jordan. Fair enough. But the next time she is summoned by that Master, she shows absolutely no hesitation when he offers to get her some soft drink. It's almost as if Pullman can't tell the difference between 'amoral' and 'amnesiac'. The result is less a prepubescent illustration of whim and willfulness and more an example of ad hoc character decisions to suit the story Pullman wants to tell...Such a rant, and I haven't even mentioned any of the other characters yet. Don't worry, I won't. My lack of faith in Lyra as a believable protagonist reduces the peripheral characters to precisely that: flat cut-out figures with no agenda beyond the telling of Lyra's story. They are facilitators of her quest, either as benefactors or malefactors.Which leads me into the plot. It seems almost moot to examine the plot when I've already dismissed the validity of the main character, but I just have to say: 'Uncle' being her father (oh-gosh-what-a-surprise) and Coulter being her mother (ditto!) was just awful. It's not enough that this little obnoxious twerp had the staff of the University watching out for her, she simply had to be the direct kin of the two most powerful players in the book. It's a tired trope in most cases but tired tropes alone don't make a book bad. The combination of obvious authorial intention (I don't even have to go into that), inconsistent characters (particular the protagonist) and a lack of plausible plot (we shouldn't be seeing Deus Ex Machina as early as the first book!)...PLUS tired tropes...'bad' seems appropriate if you consider all those as factors of a book.I'd love to recommend Northern Lights/Golden Compass, but I'd have no idea who to recommend it to.--For kids there are simply better fantasies out there to be read (and if atheist parents want their kids questioning religion, there are better ways to initiate that too)--For teenagers, I think the same applies, but if His Dark Materials has a target, it'd be teenagers. They'd enjoy Lyra's rebelliousness and her apparent superiority to adults, not to mention the adults bowing to her desires. Still, whatever a teenager might seek in His Dark Materials, they're apt to find a better example of it elsewhere--For adults? The writing can be a bit infantile and the author's appeal to lenience in reader disbelief (Willing Suspension of Disbelief) is just too much--Parents, regardless of their religious inclinations, should be aware that the protagonist engages in behaviour that would be punished in our world by the morals that might have roots in Christianity but endure through common sense (willful damage of property being an obvious example). Lyra is not at all reprimanded for these (in fact, everyone has a good old laugh when she thinks she's getting in trouble for her assault on the gyptian boat). Keep in mind that 'protagonist' in this context means 'hero' -- is Lyra a heroic example for your kids?--For Christians? Heh, not even worth mentioning--For atheists? They should be bothered that such a clumsy, heavy-handed writer is championing their cause. Douglas Adams, just to name one author, did it far better.And for people like me, who are open-minded as long as the words are doing their thing and the story's believable as a story? I could recommend more books than you could read in a lifetime more worth your while than this, some of which I haven't even read yet but have enough weight behind them historically to sit higher on your reading list than Pullman's disappointing His Dark Materials.Milton went to great pains to illustrate both Hell and Heaven, but it's always the quotes about the great Romantic Satan that stick. Don't let your possible fascination with demons and pandemonium and the 'great war in Heaven' delude you into thinking this book has anything in common with Paradise Lost.Oh, and if you want an aesthetically beautiful book where 'God' is absolutely trashed, crapped upon (literally) and defaced, check outMaldoror and the Complete Works of the Comte de Lautr&eacute;amont. Now *that* book deserves the controversy this lack-luster, overly-ambitious effort by Pullman has garnered....I better say something nice in closing. Armoured bears are kinda cool!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've read some of the reviews, and I agree with the widely-held opinion that the first book was fantastic, the second was fair to good, and the third was terrible. I don't care too much what the author's personal opinions about religion are - although I think what he says is totally ridiculous - but his writing turns into just a prolonged ranting, and that I can't stand. Also, there are a lot of loose ends and a lot of things left unexplained (especially the climax and the resolution, which one would expect to be the parts best explained), making the entire third book very disapointing. Oh, and yes, this book is NOT, I repeat, NOT for kids.All of that has been said already. The only thing I'd like to add is that the morals of the story (other than that organized religion is the source of all evil) are very confusing. Lyra hates her uncle (leader of the anti-God group, representing Satan) and looks at him as an evil man, one who will sacrifice children for his own goals. Yet the rest of the story makes him out to be the hero! [And doesn't that show that the church is NOT the source of all evil? Yet the book's conclusion leaves little doubt that \\"the church is evil\\" is the main theme!?] I hear that Pullman said in an interview that he basically agrees with Lyra's uncle. So, in other words, he agrees with sacrificing kids so as to fight people who sacrifice kids? All in all, very confusing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I think of the top tier of fantasy Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia come to mind. These are complex books that work on many levels, tell mulitple stories and are suitable for kids of all ages. Adults will especially enjoy rereading them (I know I did) years after having read them as a child. In short, they stand at the top of the fanasty world.Below them on the second tier you have books like Donaldson's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant The Unbeliever, Hobb's Farseer Trilogy or Williams's War of the Flowers. All excellent works that have detailed, believable characters, rich plots, imaginative worlds and a wonderful sense of mythos. However, these authors aren't quite as talented as your first tier authors nor do their stories work on as many levels. Still they are all worth a place on your book shelf.Now we get to the third tier books. It is here that Rowling and Pullman belong. And before you get too angry hear me out. The Harry Potter books are interesting and a fun read, but that is it. There really isn't much of a deeper meaning to them. Additionally, some of the characters seem one dimensional at times and the plot can be predictable at points. Not the details mind you but the story line, i.e. the hero is in trouble, the hero must make a choice, the hero narrowly saves the day, etc. The Harry Potter books are very good reads but they lack depth. I enjoy them but they don't move me the way something by Donaldson does. I explained all of that to help you understand my reasoning behind my ratings.Now we get to Pullman. I thought his first book, The Golden Compass, was excellent. Good plotline, diverse characters and a marvellous world fully sucks the reader in. The main characters aren't very believable for 12 year olds but you tend to ignore that and just go with the flow of the novel. However, by the time you get to the end of the first book you still really have no idea what is going on. In fact, the first book doesn't really prepare you at all for the second book, The Subtle Knife.In the second book you realize that a main character is trying to make war on Heaven and challenge God. That is a little out of left field isn't it? My response when I found out was \\"wow, didn't see that coming\\" and I have a feeling I am not alone in those sentiments. Now, for an adult who already has an informed opinion about the issues of hell, heaven, angles, demons, God and the like this book might be an interesting and stimulating read. For a 13 year old kid this book is a bit much. And it is even more annoying because no real hint of this was given in the first book.Yet in spite of all of that the second book is still fairly good. Not as good as the first but that is due to the author's personal beliefs beginning to shine through a bit more than is needed. Some people might feel that I am being hypocritical in praising Tolkien for incorporating his Christian beliefs but criticizing Pullman for his atheistic beliefs. Let me try and explain the difference between the two authors. Tolkien creates figures and events that look similar to Biblical ideas. Things such as a Christ-like figure or God's creation of the earth and man. In reading Tolkien you can see the parallels but they don't distract from the story. Pullman however seems to be preaching his ideas to us, especially by the third book. Tolkien never mentions anything about Christianity directly and as a result even atheists can enjoy his book. Not so with Pullman. By the time you have gotten to the Amber Spyglass most Christians will be highly offended. Yet you feed the need to push on so you can at last figure out how everything ends. As a result you finsih the book with a bad taste in your mouth. This series would have been excellent if Pullman had left out the anti-religous dogma and focused on the characters instead. Sadly for us he didn't, choosing rather to hammer Christianity to pieces by the trilogy's end.ConclusionIf you are a devout Christian or one who is offended when overt religous material makes its way into a book then this trilogy isn't for you. If, however, you appreciate the writing without being too annoyed with the author then I would mildly recomend this book to you. Also, this is NOT a book for young children. The main characters may be children but after the first book this becomes a series strictly for adults."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass book and movie were both beautiful, but with an underlying dark message that quickly evolves into absolutely nonsensical confused trash.

Then it gets thicker, and as I read into the third book, I was sure these books are not something I would recommend for children at all. in fact the minimum age for these is probably the teen years. There is a lot of frankly anti-religious boilerplate going on here. Whole portions of the third book I felt were rants about religion and the authors personal take on it. Not any religion in particular. God is old, useless and has been supplanted by another being who has only the worst in mind, and this is the resolution. I would want my children to read something that won't capitulate them into the hopelessness that permeates the outlook here. There is so much excellent literature, \\"Harry Potter\\" included, that is so much fresher, better written and lacking venomous screeds."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We can't evolve if we are close minded. Those whose hearts and minds remain closed to alternate ways of viewing the universe are a danger to themselves and others because they are intolerant. The Christ warned against zealotry and narrow mindedness."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Having viewed many reviews which comment, positively or negatively, on Pullman's anti-theistic intent or the heavy-handed allegory, I find myself puzzled -- puzzled because so many people are taking so poorly plotted a series seriously. If the man could write, I might take delight whatever notion of the cosmos he was inclined to offer, especially since his fantasy offered a pre-adolescent girl at its center -- just the sort of item to appeal to my own daughter.I enjoyed the movie. I opened the first book, and found myself somewhat taken by Lyra and pleasantly amused by Pullman's fantasy world. Then he began concocting his plot -- evidently by adding a new world, a new invention, or a new type of character at every whim or every onset of writer's block. Thus perils without evident cause and rescues from without (the literary flaw known as the 'Deus ex Machina')abound, compound, and multiply.There happens to be an armoured bear ... who happens to be rightful king of the bears ... there happens to be a balloonist ... Ms. Coulter happens to show up at the precise moment to rescue Lyra from seperation. All these coincidences appeared in the first book, and I forgave them as I forgave them in the movie.Then I reached the second book with the coincidences multiplying in the fashion of tribbles in heat. As Will met Lyra in the universe of the conveniently dead, I stopped reading -- hurling recriminations at the author. I picked up the book again, a few days later, and completed the series -- I wanted to read what happened.When I reached the third book's anti-climactic arrival and death of the churchly assassin, I managed nothing more than a slight shake of the head. By this time I knew well that resolution would always come from the author's intervening hand.I won't comment on the disappointing ending, except to note that it was in one fashion foreshadowed -- by that time I was fully cognizant that Pullman would resort to at least five illogical and unanticipated twists to offer his final point.It is a shame that a writer who could fashion such an interesting character as Lyra should prove incapable of walking her across the street without revealing his own hand thumping across his keyboard. After the movie, I was hoping for much more. I was hoping for a series worth the time my daughter is devoting to her reading of it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are amazing.

The first book lived up to the hype, but from the midpoint of The Subtle Knife through the end of Amber Spyglass I became increasingly disappointed. I finished the trilogy only because I'd already invested so much time, and hoped for improvement. Pullman is a master of imagery and phrase, but certainly not of plot development. There seems to be no internal consistency or coherence to the story, and at the end I'm left wondering why they were written: there is a battle, yes, but for what? The resolution of the conflict leads the characters back to where they were at the start of the story, with no real change in their lives. I get the impression that Pullman set out to rival Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings and Lewis' Narnia Chronicles. He fails miserably."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It's pretty interesting...Pullman has great imagination, with daemons and dust and all, but the story just don't seem to get to me. All the books seem to end tragically, the last ends pretty abruptly, and all the characters are all pretty twisted. It's kind of depressing, like there's almost no good people in the world anymore."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It came in perfect condition, both individually wrapped and a sealed box. I saved almost $10 shopping on Amazon. :)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I enjoyed the movie so I bought the book. Movie mostly true to the book. Enjoyed the added detail of the book. However, I was a bit disappointed in the trilogy as a whole. The characters are great!! Ideas for the compass and knife are great. But the plot doesn't quite fit in total. The actions of Lyra's parents are inconsistent especially at the end. Have no idea why the back cover says its a story about growing up."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was longing for a good series of fantasy books ever since I finished Stephen King's \\"The Black Tower\\" series. Peter Pullman created a beautiful and very believable alternate reality and was able to sew the whole plot together without any big glitches (feat that King fell short with \\"The Black Tower\\"). I would dare say it's almost as good as Tolkien's \\"The Lord of The Rings\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read a lot, but this trilogy was by far the best I have ever read. Mt first attempt to read the Golden Compass wasn't very successful. I gave up after 10 pages because I was bored. Big Mistake. Once you pass the 2nd chapter, you can't stop anymore. It is absolutely amazing. An original idea in a reading that you can call as good as it gets. I was disappointed with the 2nd book. It was like a transition to the Amber Spyglass. However, it was an enjoyable weekend reading as well. The last book was very good. But I would say that it is oriented to a more mature audience than teenagers.. Whatever your ages is, I am sure you will pick up the appropriate information for yourself and spend the next couple of weeks reading something very interesting and well written. Don't hesitate to buy it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Absolutely three of the best books I have ever read. They are filled with love, sorrow, justice, courage, wisdom, and strength. I can relate to these outstanding books on so many levels. The love story is so breath taking and the whole scientific outlook is fascinating. The world that Pullman creates is so convincing that you are drawn into it like it is a reality. His messages are so powerful and the images are dazzling. I am not one big on religion and you defiantly have to have a very, VERY open mind on religion to read these books. They have touched me very deeply. They have given me much to think about and I feel they are filled with much wisdom. Though I feel these books are for more mature children. Due to some violence and matured theories. I recommend 12 & up."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Few writers can weave force, imagination and conviction so well as Pullman has done in this trilogy. His gift for suspense is extraordinary, and also for vivid description and fierce poignancy--in re-reading, I found myself dissolved in tears again, time after time. But I think that some of the secondary characters are best of all. Serafina Pekkala and Iorek Byrnison seem to be already immortal (consulting Google), and then Lee Scoresby and the extraordinary Hester, No-Name the harpy--and Mrs. Coulter, all by herself, is phenomenal.I'm rather sorry that there are movie plans for this trilogy; I'm not sure the movies are up to it. But the good news is that Pullman plans another book about \\"some of the characters.\\" Because I am an adult, I would love this to be an adult novel, exploring some of the themes at the end of the third book, but I can see that this might be a marketing mistake. In any case, I can't wait to read it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Philip Pullman pulls off a triumph of style and substance to bring us one of the most thought-provoking trilogies of the last decade. The characters are well-developed, grabbing the attention and emotions of the reader in a thrilling way.Those previous posters who think that Pullman is disrespectful in his vision of 'God' as a weak and ultimately killable character would do well to look up Gnosticism and pay particular attention to the concept of the Demiurge."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is probably one of the best series I've ever read. This trilogoy has adventure, romance, comedy, and tragidy tide in together. It took about a week to read, which is long for me, but it was worth the wait. When I arrived on the last page of the Amber Spyglass, I was very disapointed it was over. I'm now a very big fan of Philip Pullman and I wish he would write more to this series. I still haven't got over how much these books affected me. Literaly, I never thought that I would actually like any other book series as much as the Harry Potter ones. Way to go, Pullman!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have for many years been looking for a fantasy story that does something new. I recently found just that. Mr. Pullman writes in a wonderful style and is wildly imaginative in creating a rich tapestry of parallel worlds through which the characters of this trilogy travel. A book many think is for adolescents, I highly recommend this book to readers of any age who are looking for something captivating, and unique."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"When I first started this triology I was blown away with the authors ability to trasfer us to a world so much like ours and yet in some ways entirely different. As the triloy progressed and I learned more about the characters and the twisted lives they live it started to make me think how someone can overcome an obstical with such completeness that she can save the world; or in fact all the worlds. Throughout the books you not only see the plot unfold between your very eyes but you also have the chance to see the two main characters, Lyra and Will, grow up. The way the author presents the theroy of different worlds not only makes you think that we may not be alone but it also leaves you with a sense that we are all connecteted. I recomend this trilogy to anyone who likes fantasy and who isn't afraid of something new, and different."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Following in the literary tradition of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, Philip Pullman creates an alternate reality in the His Dark Materials trilogy composed of The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass. Pullman reveals this world through the eyes of Lyra, a young child with a very serious role to play in the battle between good and evil that threatens to destroy her world and others. In Lyra's world Calvin became Pope, other universes exist on the other side of the Northern Lights, and the search for the cause of original sin leads her on a life and world-changing journey. Pullman's crisp, evocative writing style, precise attention to detail, and regard for the great philosophical mysteries of our world combine to give this \\"children's\\" trilogy universal appeal.In The Golden Compass, Lyra's life changes forever when she eavesdrops on a conversation between Oxford scholars and her uncle, Lord Asriel. She embarks on a series of adventures that not only reveals the true identity of her parents, but take her to lands she never dreamed existed. The second book, The Subtle Knife, introduces us to Will who will become Lyra's friend and companion for the rest of the series. Will's search for his long-missing father leads both children closer to understanding their part in the battle between Good and Evil. The third book in the series, the Amber Spyglass, not only lived on the UK bestseller's list for months, but nabbed the coveted Whitbread Book of the Year in 2001, the only children's book ever to receive such accolade. The action carefully set up in the first two books plays out in this, the finest book of the three.If you're tired of waiting for Book Five of Harry Potter, want to consider the intricacies of Original Sin and the human condition, or are just looking for a beautifully-written and action-packed saga, read Pullman's His Dark Materials. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think that even if you hate the genre of fantasy or science fiction, or how ever you feel that this book should be catergorized, that you should go and buy the whole series right now. Philip Pullman spins a remerkable web of characters and events that will make your head spin. I think that I have never read a book so many times or a whole series for that matter. This book is amazing from the idea of daemons, to dust, to Lira and Will which are the best characters in any literature I have ever read. If you can group characters as 3-D, 2-D and so on. I think that Mr. Pullman has effectively created a new dimension of depth and perspective. I feel like I have known these characters all my life. This is not an ordinary series that will deal with things already talked about, no this series enters uncharted places. It doesn't matter if you are just learning to read, 80, 20, 10, or anywhere in between. Read this book or you will be missing out on something extraordinary. Do yourself this favor."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This book does not even compare with Harry Potter. It's much better. In a world of many different realities and strange worlds, one girl must save everything. It is obviuos that lots of time went into the creating of the setting of this story. The characters are also extremly complex.By the end of the trilogy the author has asked questions about society, theology, and the development of our culture. Not only does this book have an engrossing plot, it has interesting and daring conflicts with higher beings. The book comes to a glorios finally in which Lyra must take on the kingdom of the Angels. i recommend this book to everybody. It is a classic and an amazing trilogy."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First of all, it blows my mind that this is considered a children's series at all. I read it in my 20s, beginning shortly after college, where I majored in English and minored in Religious Studies, and I was deeply moved by this series as a collection of fantastical fantasy stories as well as a surprisingly profound and complex religious allegory.This is the one series I know of where people commonly only read the first book, perhaps because it's the one that has a movie based on it. But that is a waste of time. The first book is fun, and certainly good enough to keep you hooked for another round. But the series builds upon itself in the kind of way that prevents you from saying the last book is necessarily the *best*, because they're all inseparable, but certainly by the end you'll find yourself far more moved and invested than you would have seen coming when you began, or at least in a very different way.The series is fascinating, immensely joyous, heartbreaking, and gripping. I would recommend it to most anyone. I can certainly imagine that many Christians (and perhaps some other very religious people as well) will be hugely turned off by the series, especially The Amber Spyglass. And I certainly wouldn't get the books for young children... I imagine much of the story would be pretty frightening for them.I found myself longing for the stories to never end, and wanting to know more about the characters and places within; I hope Pullman puts out even more post-HDM supplements than the teasers (such as Lyra's Oxford) he's already provided.Also, for the record, the \\"boxed set\\" (it appears to actually be three books in one binding) pictured is not the version I have, but I could not find my exact boxed set on Amazon.com, and the stories are the important part."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am extremely picky about the books that I read. I love fantasy, but I find that many books of all genres are unable to keep my attention. I read The Golden Compass in two days. I read during lunch at work. It is extremely clever, the writing is sublime. I ordered the second and third book immediately. I am a huge Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings fan. I find it difficult to find fantasy books that are even comparatively well-done. This series is absolutely sensational. I look forward to the other installments."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After buying and loving the Golden Compass DVD we heard from a friend there were a trilogy of books, so we went to Amazon and found this nice set. The books are an enjoyable read and much more in depth. Really look forward to seeing the whole series made into movies.This is a great fantasy!!! The writer, director and actors are all using their creative natures to create magical pieces. Thanks and we want more....more.....more!!!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books were actually very good. For people who say that they're anti-christian they are incorrect. If you pay attention then you notice that the \\"Church\\" in the book has very little to do with relgion they just use it as an excuse. And you only see the \\"Anti-relgious stuff if you're looking for it. Everyone that I've talked to who didn't know that people were saying that it was anit-christian didn't realize that.I'm a christian but I love these books. They have excellent writing and it sin't the typical farmer/slave/appritece finds out that he is going to save the world story. And it is nice to have a strong girl as a main character instead of the sidekick. And for people who get upset about the daemons well the daemons are basically who you really are good or bad. Overall they were good books"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"It is a great story that keeps you wondering: \\"what else could happen?\\" It is both a good fantasy and an interesting hard-core critic to the fanaticism that is sometimes part of many religions. The mixture between both fantasy (or rather, fantastic elements) with science makes it a great story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books are well-written. The action moves fast. While they are supposedly children's books, they are definitely for mature children, and adults will find them very exciting. Some people have religious issues with the books, but this was not a problem for me."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"We've bought this trilogy from our 12 y/o son's Christmas wish list. He is Harry Potter fan and LOVED these books. He rereading it over and over and still finds the stories entertaining. As far as a parent's concern - great buy!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Couldn't put these books down. Love the ideas, and the writing behind them. I was disappointed that they were finished."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Besides receiving my books in perfect shape and quickly, the story itself was fascinating to a science buff who also happens to love science fiction. Mixing the two always lets me revisit scenarios I have pondered in the past and left as \\"possibles.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is an absoltely wonderful trilogy that pulls the reader in once you get started. I was eager to read this entire book in one evening and when i happened to be reading the last few chapters, i found myslef slowing down, for I was upset that my great adventure was ending. This story follows the adventures of a young girl called Lyra and all of the places she goes and people she meets, and danger that she encounters, as she searches for this thing called Dust. She really doesn't know what it is and is on a personal mission to find out. Is this Dust the reason why so many children are taken and never seen again? Do the Gobblers and Dust have a link? And Why does this Dust only surround the grown ups? Lyra goes against her father's wishes although she doesn't realize it at first and she also fights against her mother, although she doesn't recognize her mother for who she is in the beginning either. Lyra takes us to meet many new people from all over the world, and from many different worlds as well.Buying this book in its trilogy format was great for me because I found after one book ended i needed to find out what happened next. I couldn't put it down. This trilogy received 4 stars from me only because I was pulled in after the second or third chapter. Other books have succeeded in grabing me from page one. After the first few chapters however, this book is climax after climax. I highly reccomend this book. Although however I should note this... I'm sure other's reveiws have been read before this, but i want to reiterate that any hardcore Christians would be highly upset at the main subject matter of this book. This is a trilogy to be read by those who have an open mind, or those who can read the work of another who's viewpoint is definately not mainstream, and not get upset. That now out of the way, what are you waiting for, buy this trilogy!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series was designed to cast doubt in a person's faith in God. It also contains child sexuality and homosexuality.Book one is also a movie. The movie was far more tame than the book. The series is well written to draw the reader in and then you realize his agenda. The second book introduces the plan to kill God who the series claims is actually an angel but since he was the first one formed he tried to control all of the others. There is sexuality in the series as well. Two important angel characters are homosexual and it mentions multiple times how in love they are (in books 2 & 3) and then in book 3 the two children mature and begin making out and fondling etc. Their love making saves the planet they are on at the time by creating more \\"Dust\\" the particles with intelligence. Watching the movie with fuzzy bears did not represent what these books are really about. I am so glad I got them from the library and read them first. My young kids will not be reading them. This series is for older teens & adults (and only those who are secure in their beliefs). Gifted youngsters who read at higher levels should avoid this book series."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"First, let me say that fantasy is a favorite in my house, including Harry Potter, but after reading this, I will not be reading it to my children.Please be aware of what this book is really about before you let your children read it.The author, Phillip Pullman, is an avowed atheist who said himself in a 2003 interview in the The Sydney Morning Herald that \\"My books are about killing God.\\" An ex-nun in the books describes Christianity as \\"a very powerful and convincing mistake\\", and another character says \\"Every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling.\\"If you believe there is a God, any God, then these books will thoroughly seek to undermine that belief in your children.If you do buy the book, PLEASE read it yourself before you give it to your child."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I hated this book so much. Yes it was well written and yes the ideas were good, but it offended me in many ways. Reallly the first book wasent nearly as bad the second and third, even though they where all just a tool for Mr. Pulllman's anti-god rant. This would have been a MUCH better book if wasent so anti-religous. I'm copletely fine with Mr. Pullman belifes, but you don't see me criticizing his belifes, so why is he criticizing christains! In september I will have a nice or nephew, I Will do all that's in my power to keep them from reading these books. This book will never darken my door step again and to my fellow christains, I hope it never darkens yours.P.S. this is to philip pullman: WHAT PART OF 'IF YOU DONT HAVE ANYTHING NICE TO SAY THEN DON'T SAY IT ATALL' DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A film called \\"The Golden Compass\\" opens December 7. It is based on the first book of a trilogy titled His Dark Materials. The author of this children's fantasy is Philip Pullman, a noted English atheist. It is his objective to bash Christianity and promote atheism. To kids. \\"The Golden Compass\\" is a film version of the book by that name, and it is being toned down so that Catholics, as well as Protestants, are not enraged.The second book of the trilogy, The Subtle Knife, is more overt in its hatred of Christianity than the first book, and the third entry, The Amber Spyglass, is even more blatant. Because \\"The Golden Compass\\" is based on the least offensive of the three books, and because it is being further watered down for the big screen, some might wonder why parents should be wary of the film.The Catholic League wants Christians to stay away from this movie precisely because it knows that the film is bait for the books: unsuspecting parents who take their children to see the movie may be impelled to buy the three books as a Christmas present. And no parent who wants to bring their children up in the faith will want any part of these books.\\"The Golden Compass: Agenda Unmasked\\" is the Catholic League's response. It provides information about the film, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" and details what book reviewers have said about Pullman's books; a synopsis of his trilogy is also included."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy is indeed diabolical. The temptation- a captivating, nicely written story- but beware of the message- the world view that the book is advocating is that God is really an evil angel that is just pretending to be the Creator. The devil's revolt was actually the work of good angels. God only does bad things. The enemies of God also do bad things (like intentionally killing children) but they should be forgiven because they are working for the good cause of killing God. There is absolutely no discussion or attempt to show a different viewpoint. The evils of the church are the evils of God. Period!I guess that a lot of people missed these points because they are skillfully camouflaged in a truly imaginative story! But be carefull! Messages work on your subconscious reasoning if you don't think about them rationally. Analyze the message carefully!I read to the very end hoping that there was going to be some discussion or debate, but no. This is a bigoted, narrow-minded, hateful worldview that is pretending to be humanistic. It is presenting half-truth in order to make the rational plausible. All the bad things people have done in the name of God was God's fault and the good things they have done are not even mentioned!If you think this is just a bit of harmless fun and should not be taken seriously, be careful. The story is indeed very imaginative and captivating, which makes it even more evil. If you hate God this is the book for you.P.s., it is really \\"funny\\" to see religious people making such a fuss over Harry Potter, which is a truly moral story, when there are abominations like this one around. This book openly preaches God Hatred! (Which is different from just not believing in God- This book states God exists but he is evil)I don't believe in banning any books but I am very, very sorry I spent my money on this book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I've been a junior high English teacher for several years, and I am disturbed by the dark messages that this book teaches. Pullman's trilogy is twisted and disturbing in its message--twisting the concept of evil vs. good, with the evil depicted as the good. The author, Phillip Pullman, said in a 2003 interview that \\"My books are about killing God.\\"I'm sickened that they are making a \\"mild version\\" of his book into a movie to ignite interest in his books.In a society where children are already being bombarded with violent and dark messages, we don't want our youth reading books that are geared towards teaching them that \\"evil is good.\\"Please read this message from another reader:\\" He's an atheist and his objective is to bash Christianity and promote atheism...he has made remarks that he wants to kill God in the minds of children, and that's what his books are all about. He despises C.S. Lewis and Narnia, etc. An article written about him said \\"this is the most dangerous author in Britain\\" and that Pullman would be the writer \\"the atheists would be praying for, if atheists prayed.\\" Pullman said he doesn't think it is possible that there is a God and he has great difficulty understanding the words \\"spiritual\\" and \\"spirituality.\\" What I thought was important to communicate is what part of the agenda is for making this picture. This movie is a watered down version of the first book, which is the least offensive of the three books. The second book of the trilogy is THE SUBTLE KNIFE and the third book is THE AMBER SPYGLASS. Each book gets worse and worse regarding Pullman's hatred of God. In the trilogy, a young girl becomes enmeshed in an epic struggle against a nefarious Church known as the Magisterium. Another character, an ex-nun, describes Christianity as \\"a very powerful and convincing mistake.\\" As I understand it, in the last book, a boy and girl are depicted representing Adam and Eve and they kill God, who at times is called YAHWEH (which is definitely not Allah). Since the movie would seem mild if you viewed it, that's been done on purpose.They are hoping that unsuspecting parents will take their children to See the movie, that they will enjoy the movie and then the children will want the books for Christmas. That's the hook. Pullman says he wants the children to read the books and decide against God.\\""},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Pure drivel, just like 98% of everything else that makes it to the bestseller list these days.

As parent to an eight year old who has read the Harry Potter series, I would not give these to her just yet. Phillip Pullman is a storyteller, first and foremost, and the story he weaves is compelling. I review this as a whole - not three separate books. Personally, one cannot exist without the others.Mr. Pullman's characters are memorable (Mrs. Coulter continues to show up in my nightmares), and very, very human. Yes, he takes quite a swipe at organized religion, and yes, I agree with his assesment that the Narnia series is both bigoted and sexist, (although, a product of its time) making His Dark Materials more enjoyable to me.Phillip Pullman is referred to by the media as an aethist, but I see his books as carrying quite a Buddhist message, also. (a very similar view of death - as well as his approach to living life here and now.)I thoroughly enjoyed the books, although I did space out reading them over a few months. As a bereaved parent, I found the parts written about the land of the dead extremely difficult to read - it hurt, but I read them through.I've read many comments about the unsatisfying ending -- there aren't always happy endings. Personally, I found the ending very right for the books, very fitting.I plan to give these books to my daughter in two years or so - not for just their tremendous story, but for their world view of religion. What I don't understand, is why the conservative churches in my area continue to burn Harry Potter and pass completely over these books, lol...Thank you, Mr. Pullman, for sharing Lyra's world with us. Your books have affected me..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I was curious about His Dark Materials after seeing the Golden Compass movie. However, I was hesitant in purchasing a set, despite its very attractive price, because a non-trivial number of reviewers believed Pullman let his ideology dominate his role of a story teller, especially in the third book of the trilogy, the Amber Spyglass.I personally enjoyed His Dark Materials (HDM) more than either the Harry Potter or CS Lewis' Narnia series. I think HDM is more imaginative than either. HP is about school life sprinkled with everything magic, but is essentially earth bound. HDM looks beyond our material world, personified souls as dmons, a separate yet attached animal self that gives the term \\"soul-mate\\" and the phrase \\"know thyself\\" interesting meanings.As for the ideologies expressed, I find that they are minor and subtle compared with those in CS Lewis' Narnia series, and are needed for the story. Some reviewers believed SF should not be burdened with ideologies of this world such as Christianity and Darwinism. I have to disagree. The books are written by humans read by humans, and we are creatures with believes."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like the Harry Potter series, this trilogy is aimed at the teenage reader, however will be enjoyed equally by adults. It is a \\"messiah\\" story, where an often unaware person is earmarked by prophecy to save the world. Set in parallel universes, the story has our heroine embarking on adventures that are amazing and surprisingly believable, With the help of her friends, she undergoes and survives trials and comes through to a surprising conclusion. The trilogy explores relationships with parents, the nature of friendship, religion (missing from the film) ,the nature of the soul, death and first love.

It's a book for all the family not just for children!I had never read it before and i love it! I will read it to my nephews. Very recommended reading!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass is by far the best of the three, we're introduced to young Lyra, we get to see her world and how it differs from ours. The story is very intelligently written and expressed in very vivid detail. The storyline is grand and suspenseful, and (especially if you saw the movie first) the ending is quite a bit different than expected. the characters are vividly drawn, and rich in detail and resonance. I did see the movie first which inspired me to start reading the series, but the more I read the books I find the cast was expertly cast. Sam Elliot was perfect for the role of Lee Scorsby and Dakota Blue Richards' portrayal of Lyra was spot-on. but this is a review of the book not the movie. I found this one hard to put down,and if read as a fantasy epic adventure it works flawlessly. On the subject of religion, which is where most of the criticism comes from, there are times I agree with the portrayal, and other times I found myself wondering what was the purpose behind how it was portrayed. But, there are a few points in the overall story that didn't seem to pan out for me. But, again, overall it's a great series and an excellent addition to my book collection. I loved the relationships between the characters and the way the author had of showing each character's true nature. It all centers around Lyra, and it seems by their reactions to her, they tend to be defined. Much like your enjoyment of this series is how well you relate to or understand the central heroine. Fortunately she's not one dimensional like so many other child characters in books these days. She has many facets and many personal changes throughout the course of the series. I keep seeing this series compared to Lord of the Rings or the Chronicles of Narnia, while I can see that to some degree, this series stands on its own. Like Lord of the Rings Pullman gives rich full details on the characters and the enviroment. You find yourself immersed in this little universe as if it were your very own. Sometimes he tends to give us too much detail, but that's fine. It never takes away from the overall story or mood. But whereas The Chronicles of Narnia was replete with Christian imagery and allegory, this one is the opposite. I am not sure if it's anti-church or anti-God (as it's been accused of being) but rather a distancing from all the things that interfere with the lives and journeys of the individual. You get the feeling he is saying that heaven is within us, good or bad is within us, you don't need to look for internal sources to govern your lives look inside of yoursel. Religion has been known to get in the way of clear thinking. There are occasions when the chuch seems to stray from it's intent and message, and there are times when people spend too much time preparing for or thinking about the afterlife that very little thought is given to the life we have now, and if there is an overall theme to the series it might be that, the greatest journeys are the ones we take within ourselves. That this life, this time we are in now, is the most precious. But, regardless of the religious or anti-religous overtones and underpinnings this is a great story with great characters and surprising events. This is a great way to start the series.The Subtle Knife is my second favorite, and introducds Will to the story arch. While I like Will and find his character well though out, it bothers me that Lyra, who up until now was braver and stronger and more clever than any adult she knew male or female, was suddenly helpless (at times) and needed to be saved/rescued or helped by the male character. The reason this bothers me is there are so few strong female characters out there, and even less who are created by men, who are totally self-sufficient and strong. Why would Lyra all of a sudden play second stringer to a boy when her own actions and plans worked so well for her in the past? It just makes me feel as if they are saying that it's better if the man makes the decisions and protects the girl. It's a little too old fashioned for me. But, the saving grace is the relationship that develops between the two, as Lyra is getting older her thoughts are changing along with her body, she's becoming aware of herself as a woman, albeit a young woman, and that is juxtapositioned against this backdrop of saving the universe, or the multiverse and herself as well. I find the relationship between them to be real, they only know each other a short while, but their experiences together, and the fact that they are about the same age, helps them to bond, and children of that age are more trusting, but at the same time selective about their friends, but when they do find a friend, they tend to be loyal and caring. this opens up a whole new world for Lyra, while she's always had help, now she has an equal. the side story of Mary Malone though never quite does anything for me, and while it seems like there is a buildup, it never actually delivers. But overall a great book, and a page turner.The Amber Spyglass is my least favorite, but that isn't to say it's bad, or unreadable, but just like the Last Battle in the Narnia Series, it leaves you feeling a little unsettled as if some of the pieces aren't actually fitting together as nicely as they should. While the story is grand in scope and still strongly sculpting the character and the story arch. There are times, you are left wondering: What was the point in that? The whole war with the Autority and the demise of the God-like Creature seems a little anti-climactic. A lot of people might lose interest here simply because of what it seems to be implying about God and religion. But, I feel that if you are strong in your faith and truly believe in what you believe then no fictional story, no matter what the intent was behind the metaphors, should be threatening to you. It simply should be read as an epic fantasy story, and not be taken so seriously. Like I stated though I found myself asking, what was that all about more? than actually getting offended or discusted by the metaphorical references. full disclosure, I am a firm believer in God but not a fan of organized religion but I do not criticize anyone who finds solace in the chuch. But at this point in the story, you already know there is a bit of an anti-authority vibe flowing through the story, and it's simply part of the mood/plot. I did wonder what it was Mary was supposed to do or say that was to be the temptation that Lyra was supposed to either give into or spurn. They were portraying her as the new EVE, and that Mary was the serpent in the garden but I never quite figured out what it was that she was supposed to do. And again it seemed like the plot was building up to something at the end of the story but it just seemed to go on for a long time without actually going anywhere (much like the Last Battle) But the tale of self-sacrifice and parting of friends and lovers more than makes up for the misfires I would like to see what happens to Lyra when she gets older and wouldn't mind seeing a reunion of sorts with all the characters. The bond between Lyra and Iorek is a pretty interesting one, and I feel that it wouldn't lessen due to time. So that would be interesting to see. I didn't like the fact that Lyra lost the ability to use the alethiometer after she had finished her mission, it was something that made her special, and it's like sad to see her lose the ability and now she has to relearn it, I guess it shows character development as it shows that originally she was a smart girl but wasn't very keen on learning, yet she was wise in other ways. But now she is shown the importance of learning and the benefits and rewards of studying. Overall I'm very happy to have found this series, and look forward to the chance to read more. So hopefully that will happen sometime soon."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is a true fantasy series. However unlike many fantasy series it rejects the spiritual in a lot of ways and the protagonists are in conflict with the representatives of the spiritual rather than being subtly backed by \\"godlike forces\\". I read a lot of fantasy and I find it helpful to place this series in terms of maturity, content and detail, between Harry Potter and Narnia (on the low end) and Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time on the high end. Note: That is not a ranking of enjoy-ability. The books are highly enjoyable and one of my favorite series of all time."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This is the series that sold me on Philip Pullman's writing! He he easy to read, clear, concise, and just generally a very talented writer. Pullman created a masterpiece in this trilogy that covers fantasy, politics, religion, and can be seen also as a social commentary on the corruption from those who hold the power in society. This trilogy may be found in the youth section of many bookstores, but it is anything but juvenile! In fact it is my opinion that it will be enjoyed even more as a person becomes older and has more life experience that allows them to relate on multiple levels to the characters. it is not evil, demonic, or a sin to read, but it does not favor putting the church in a positive light either. It is simply a story that is soaked in complexities and makes it an irresistible treat for anybody who can have an open mind about science, society, politics, religion, the soul, and of course armored bears LOL. BTW I love love love the witches and gypsies in this story."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Somehow I haven't written about one of my all-time favorite book series. It's one of those books that I like to go back to every so often-usually after I've finished a long, serious book-when I want something familiar and of excellent quality. I first came across this series in college, thanks to a college course Adolescent Literature: Grimm to Voldemort (I know, sounds awesome right?) and am eternally greatful to Professor Flesch for assigning it. It is the only book series to ever make me cry and, as my friends can tell you, I don't cry easily or often. And I cry every time I read it (and even discover new reasons to cry each time). Pullman has the ability to really get the heartrending emotions being experienced by the characters onto the page in a way that I've yet to find another author able to do.You may remember when the movie came out for the Golden Compass, the first book in the series. There was the usual controversy over something that went against the Church (even though the first book actually has very little of this and it is the latter part of the series that really shows the anti-religion plot). And then there's the issue of talking animals on screen. It just doesn't work, they always look goofy and unnatural (because of course it is unnatural and therefore requires computer animation). But in the book it works perfectly and you can't help but love the daemons and the witches and the armored bears and every other fantastical people that Pullman invented.The series starts off with Lyra, a young girl who has spent her life running around Oxford College with little care for anything beyond her curiosity and sense of adventure. But when her best friend Roger is kidnapped (in a series of kidnappings rumored to be done by \\"the Gobblers\\") she vows to rescue him. And so begins her journey, with a number of set backs and adventures along the way. But it turns out that freeing Roger is only the first of many things to come. The witches have a prophecy about her, one which says her decisions can change the course of the future. Lyra, together with her daemon Pantalaimon (a daemon is an external part of the human being that takes the form of an animal), and equipped with the altheiometer (a golden compass that she can ask questions and get the truth) set out on a long journey.Book two, the Subtle Knife, begins with Will, a boy from our world whose mother is mentally ill. He discovers another world where he meets Lyra. While trying to find out more about what is happening, they meet Dr. Mary Malone who is working on dark matter experiments in our version of Oxford. Will gains possession of a powerful weapon, the Subtle Knife. The knife and the altheiometer are important instruments that are highly coveted, leading the two into more danger. At the end of book two, Lyra is kidnapped and Will sets out to save her.Finally, in the Amber Spyglass, Will finds Lyra and together they set out for the land of the dead where part of their true purpose becomes clear. But a war is looming, can they survive?Considering that this is a children's series, the plot is anything but simple. In fact, it is possibly one of the most complex books I have ever read, full of big ideas and questions that always keep you thinking and guessing. In fact, it is the type of book you need to read multiple times because reading reveals new layers of understanding.If there was ever a book series that you should read, I would suggest this one. In fact, I did just that to a friend of mine who did not enjoy reading. I told her to try this book because there was no chance she wouldn't like it. Sure enough, she read the entire series and has since begun reading other things."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The first book is definitely great reading. But the trilogy does get rather long towards the end."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The story kept me intrigued, as many do, but the overall effect didn't wow me. Oh, the whole series is worth the reading, if you've already gone through some of the better ones out there.I even liked newcomer Brian S. Pratt's The Unsuspecting Mage better. It has wars, magic, secret passages all the while a solid story line keeps it flowing smoothly and logically. If you like epic fantasy try this one. It's a bit rough it being his frist ever novel, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My sister had gotten me the series as a Christmas gift, and in a lull between other books I actively wanted to read, I picked this up with no expectations whatsoever. I agree with most reviewers here that the first in the series was written quite well, with an imaginitive storyline, a foreboding plot, and well developed characters about whom one could care. The second in the series was less consistent, and at times I could pick up on Mr. Pullman's personality; I felt less like I was reading a great story, and more like Mr. Pullman was trying to teach me his world view. I was therefore less than stunned when the last 200 pages of the third installment basically devolved into an anti-Christian diatribe: when Mary, one of the major characters, says \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all,\\" one gets the sense that it is actually Mr. Pullman speaking directly to the reader. It is a shame that the series deteriorates in this fashion. I could not help but feel that Mr. Pulman saw the success of the initial books in the series, and saw it as an opportunity to use the third novel in a heavy-handed attempt to espouse his world view of secular humanism, at the expense of any of his readers who actually subscribe to notions of organized religion; Christianity or otherwise."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Touching, inciteful, trilling. An all around a wonderful fantasy. Thank you Philip Pullman for filling my days with your marvelous stories."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My 14 year old son received this book set for Christmas. If you enjoy Harry Potter type books, then you'll love this."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I greatly enjoyed this trilogy, although at times I found myself feeling mildly disturbed by the anti-religious sentiment that strongly resonates through the stories.Pullman masterfully entwines reality with fantasy, melding two worlds that are so very similar and yet so completely different, taking the stories of the two main child characters and interweaving them into one monumental adventure/quest.The first book The Golden Compass (known as Northern Lights in Australia) introduces us to Lyra, and the world of people and daemons (creatures that are inextricably joined to their human counterparts). The second, The Subtle Knife, introduces Will, who comes from a world where the daemons of Lyra's world are not physically manifested. The third book, The Amber Spyglass, brings everything that was set up in the first two books to a spectacular and dramatic conclusion, dealing with the potential destruction of both worlds.The books are very much a worthwhile read, and Pullman writes in a cohesive and engaging style, with plenty of fascinating characters, and weird and wonderful places. If you can ignore the overtones, it is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This and the other His Dark Materials novels rank among the best in the genre, alongside Lord of the Rings, the Gormenghast novels, and others of that stature. You can be sure they'll stand the test of time, and railing against them for their ideas is no less foolish than attempting to hide knowledge in all its forms from your children. Anyone who has read and understood Milton's great Paradise Lost (one of the author's key inspirations) should grasp that folly. Use it as a teaching tool, if you like, but don't give it one star just because your private morality is threatened by its ideas. Of course that's the very kind of zealotry that doesn't fare well in these novels. If there's any reason these novels may not be suitable for younger children, it's only because the second and third novels get progressively more metaphysical and complex--somewhat challenging even for adults. By the way, Amazon sells a gorgeous edition of Paradise Lost annotated by Pullman. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These novels are wonderful: an astonishing concept, utterly believable characters, great plot-lines, and beautifully written.What is particularly impressive is that for books which have been attacked by the sillier end of fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity for being Satanic (which is rubbish, unless you redefine everything that isn't fundamentalist Evangelical Christianity as Satanic -- which they probably do!), they are deeply spiritual.I'm about to buy \\"Lyra's Oxford\\" and, with many thousands of others, am eagerly awaiting \\"The Book of Dust\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I bought this trilogy after it kept coming up in my Amazon recommendations. So many people had written rave reviews; I thought I'd really enjoy the series. Instead, I got a rambling mess, with overtones of Piers Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, Richard Adams' Shardik, Lord of the Flies, folklore, Stephen Jay Gould, Stephen Hawking, and every sub-par parallel worlds episode that Star Trek ever made. The characters aren't consistent from one book to the next. Plotlines are abandoned without a trace. And the writing is dull and unevocative. I'll give it two stars for a few interesting ideas and the fact that I managed to get through it, but I certainbly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. You'll be seeing my set on [website] soon."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read the last book in the series, THE AMBER SPYGLASS two years ago and I'm STILL thinking about it.From a literary perspective, these books are gold. They're in more of an adult style than the Harry Potter books. In fact, these books, in more ways than one, defy all comparison with Harry Potter. They are completely and utterly different. These books succeed on more than just the way that they are written. If the muse who dreamt up the Harry Potter books had gone to someone other than JK Rowling, then the Potter books would have failed miserably.Now that we have that out of the way, we have the plot. The good? Pullman has dreamt up more amazing locales, intriguing and loveable characters (human and otherwise) and plot twists than many, many other writers could possibly attempt. Pullman has a gift for showing the reader a setting without bogging them down with too many details. Surprisingly enough, the only even slightly-clich&eacute;d characters is the main one, Lyra Silvertongue (she starts out the adventure with a different name but I cant spell it form memory). Lyra is the token female rebel who refuses to wear dresses and runs about with boys. Thankfully Pullman has given us Pan to counterbalance her attitude, and their chemistry is wonderful.The bad? In the second half of the series (from about halfway through THE SUBTLE KNIFE onwards) the plot becomes a battle between humans and God. By the middle of book three, Pullman has completely erased the meaning of good and evil. Witches are good, (some) angels are bad. God is a weak, frail old angel, and humans were not created but were born out of \\"Dust\\".Parents-you should definitely read this over before letting your children read this ones, especially if they are young. The book openly denies the existence of God and even goes so far as to have him be killed. If you are religious at all, you definitely want to review this book first. Even if you aren't, the lines between good and evil are seriously blurred here, not a good example for young children. If you're Christian, Harry Potter is nothing compared to this.Otherwise, the story is wonderful. The characters are real, and you actually care about them. In every way a superior read to Harry Potter. But if you're even remotely religious, you'll probably want to forget HIS DARK MATERIALS."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After coming across online discussions about how this set of books was a kick in the pants to Christianity, and how secular humanists were carrying these books as their banner in the culture war against fundamentalists, I didn't really want to wade into that quagmire. So often, books touted in a culture war read like a manifesto. But I was trying my hand writing at an \\"alter-earth\\" fantasy myself, and Pullman's trilogy seemed to be succeeeding where I was failing. So I thought I would give it a chance.I have heard other people say that \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy was the finest piece of fantasy since \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" I have also heard it called a humanist alternative to \\"The Chronicles of Narnia.\\" Needless to say, I was dubious. No one since Le Guin has managed to craft a thick fantasy for young adults, and I was growing comfortable with the thought that the genre had been mined. But, after reading this trilogy, I am now convinced that Tolkien, Lewis, and Le Guin were just hacking at the stone.Thankfully, \\"His Dark Materials\\" was not a polemic against religion, nor was it an allegory or manifesto. It was a truly baroque piece of writing, damn near perfect. Naturally, I can now see why a few feverish fundamentalists would be horrified--God is a minor character, which I suppose would be as offensive to Xtians as a drawing of Mohammed is to Mooslims--not that I really care what religious nuts necessarily opine.That Phillip Pullman drew on \\"Paradise Lost\\" for inspiration and foundation is a thought-provoking thesis, happily neglected when the tale gets underway. Rather than pedantically preaching, Pullman works his craft: breathing life into his characters, making their dramas and conflicts real and imperative, and painting it all in language just barely within reach of the highly literate young adult. It is the reader's job to build and defend her own beliefs. In the end, I prefer to think that Pullman wishes to be as major an English writer as Milton was--or else that he wanted to remind us that High Fantasy was invented during the British Rennaissance. That's as far as the controversy goes for me.One ot the best things about the three novels, I believe, is a chiascuro worthy of Rembrandt. He blurs the edges of things, and puts shapes in the dark shadows at the hazy periphery. He suggest millions and millions of parallel worlds, populates maybe four, and yet you can almost feel the weight of all those universes pressing your hands as they hold open the pages. He only suggests a marvelous history for many of the secondary characters, and then your imagination unwinds their own novellas in your reveries. His talent for description makes reading a participatory process, rather than a receptive one. The result is a holographic oevre, alive and growing in the reader's imagination.There really is nothing like this trilogy. It is astonishing, marvelous, original, and thoroughly entertaining--much like the main character. The heroine, Lyra, is such a novel hero. She starts the story as an almost Dickensian urchin, then undergoes a tempering of character, forged in the fires of conflict and machination, and undergoes a tragic, orphean fall. Oh, how I wanted to change her fate! But what happens to her is as necessary as all the tribulation most very character meets.\\"His Dark Materials\\" outshines \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Earthsea.\\" There is nothing like it, and I suspect, nothing else will eclipse it for at least a century. It is a masterpiece of English literature, and I feel blessed to have finished it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Words of warning - 'The Golden Compass' (1st in the series) and 'The Amber Spyglass' (3rd) are nowhere near as good as 'The Subtle Knife' (2nd). In 'The Golden Compass' we are stuck with Lyra, a dim-witted, uncharismatic girl with no personality. Though Lyra is supposed to be the hero, she posseses none of the qualities that would suggest so. She is not brave, noble or cunning. The more exciting parts of this book do not even involve Lyra. She, in fact, runs away as a reaction to tough situations. Her one redeeming quality is that she quickly learns how to read the alethiometer, an ancient device shaped like a pocket watch that helps her answer difficult questions and sometimes predict the future. Lyra's travel companion, Iorek Byrson, the talking armored polar bear, is a much more interesting character. It is he who is involved in the most exciting part of the book - a high stakes fight with another armored bear.But even with Lyra's shortcomings as a hero, she still garners sympathy merely because she is a kid who has would-be assassins tailing her everywhere she goes. Also, she finds out who her parents are and with sketchy evidence she can't figure out which one is sending out minions to kill her. In the 2nd book 'The Subtle Knife,' it was with great relief to me that Lyra became more or less of a sidekick to the ever-compelling and mysterious Will Parry. With Will cutting openings from one world to another with the instrument called the Subtle Knife, there is no shortage of heart-pounding twists and turns.I have often heard His Dark Materials being compared to Harry Potter, but Philip Pullman is not as consistent as J.K. Rowling is with Harry Potter. While Rowling has continually exceeded expectations with each Harry Potter book (each book being better than the one before it), Philip Pullman is horribly disappointing with the 3rd book, 'The Amber Spyglass.' At 500+ pages, 'The Amber Spyglass' could've used a lot of editing. The action doesn't really get going until at least 300 pages into it. It doesn't help that many of the longest chapters are centered around Dr. Mary Malone and her useless trek into a land where she befriends some mysterious beasts. I thought Lyra was uncharismatic, but Mary Malone is a thousand times worse. Even the enigmatic Will Parry could not save the slow plot. In one last ditch effort to soften readers up to Lyra, Pullman brings back a few of her travel companions from the first book, who by this time have been separated from her and now wish to find and protect her. Though Lee Scoresby and Iorek Byrnson both express to others that they love Lyra as a daughter, the two showed no affection of this sort while they were with her in the first book. This just seems odd and ill-placed. At the end of 'The Amber Spyglass' I felt like I'd been tricked into reading three anti-Christianity books disguised as an adventure series for children. Of course the first two books in the series end without a final resolution, but when it happened at the end of the third book, I was disappointed to say the least."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I love the one star reviewers of the Dark Materials books. To a man thay lambast Mr Pullman's religious views - of which they know precisely nothing. Can his views be inferred from the books? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Just having a thought that's \\"anti-Christian\\" ( whatever THAT means ) does not mean you hold that thought as your dogmatic world view. The intolerant can never understand this point because to them, the thought and the action are the same thing. That comes from that stupid \\"committed adultery in his heart\\" line from the Bible.This logic leads inexorably to checking your citizenry's reading habits - \\"just to be on the safe side\\".Great writers have always railed against authority figures. And now in our more frightening world of entrenched religious camps, its a good thing to call attention to fanaticism and to say \\"hold on, perhaps our side isn't always on the side of the angels\\" ( pun intended ).And as for those people who simply resort to saying \\"he can't write\\", check out the prizes Mr Pullamn has won. Heck \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was in the running for the Booker prize in the UK - that country's most prestigious literary prize.These books are darkly subversive and so are excellent books for kids.Because if they don't learn to kick against authority when they are young, they'll just end up as the people in town hall meetings who say \\"I love you as my President\\"."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"With the movie in the cinemas I think that interest in this trilogy will be renewed...The first book is inspired and a very good read. I could hardly lay it aside before I was through. The world which Pullman conjures up is exciting strange and believable in a mix of familiar and fantastic aspects of his creation. The adventure which follows a thrilling and mysterious start in Pullman's Oxford is colorful, daring and full of surprises.Then I read the second book or rather fought my way through it. To me Pullman went overboard with badly formulated concepts which cross over into blasphemy. A friend of mine who loved the first novel never got through the second. The narrative looses in intensity and the seemingly blasphemous aspects of the expanded multiverse The Subtle Knife opens up to the reader can further discourage.The Amber Spyglass does realign with the captivating style of The Golden Compass while not fully coming up to the same quality. The plot regains pace and the reader can be drawn into Pullman's world again if he did not leave it during the second novel. What reeked of blasphemy in the second novel is slowly explained away and the story arc left unfinished in the second novel comes to an end.I greatly enjoyed The Golden Compass, fought through the confusion of The (all too) Subtle Knife and gained a new perspective of the whole trilogy by looking through The Amber Spyglass.If one is willing to go through a hard time with the second novel, the whole trilogy comes still out all right but expectations should not be set too high. Do not judge the whole trilogy against the charm of The Golden Compass and you will be able to enjoy it."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"words cannot express how these books make me feel. i can't even try. needless to say, i am always recommending them to friends and random strangers, and rave about them constantly.what i particularly like about this edition of the books is that they included the original illustrations drawn by phillip pullman, and not all copies have them."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"The Golden Compass was very enjoyable with great characters, good and evil, and an immensely interesting story. The parallel world is well imagined and believable; and if the protagonist, Lyra, is a bit of brat with an unearned super-ability and remarkable aplomb for an 11-year-old, her story is so well written that you can suspend your disbelief if it occurs. The cliff-hanger ending which turns Lyra's mission on its head is the perfect lead-in for the second act. Too bad that it doesn't follow through with the initial promise.The Silver Knife immediately started to water down the original brilliance and slides rapidly into a splintered morass in the third book, The Amber Spyglass. The new characters introduced to the plot are not as interesting as the originals. Such as Will, another child with amazing abilities. He also gets an object which enables him to quickly assume hero status, like Lyra, which stretches credulity, especially as he is rather dull in his awesomeness, unlike Lyra. But Lyra's fire begins to leech away, once she joins forces with Will, and she becomes as colorless as the universe ends up by the third book.Formerly evil characters begin to reveal an unsuspected sweet side and by the end commit such a selfless act (and wrapped up in such cliched tripe, especially considering how the characters were initially drawn, that I gagged over the dialogue) that I actually felt the characters had been betrayed by their author.Mary, the supposed all-important catalyst, simply tells a story near the end of Spyglass that somehow leads Lyra and Will to the near-instantaneous saving of the universe (and Dust?). The method of that saving is just . . . poorly thought out, nonsensical, and utterly wastes the promise shown in The Golden Compass.All the effort and heroics lead to a bleak universe and nobody ends happily. And for no real good reason except the author said so, even if it contradicts what has been outlined in the previous books.Collectively, the trilogy would get 3 1/2 starts. Read the first book, then resist the urge, no matter how powerful, to finish the series.

Don't forget to read them too!), but when I read these, they seemed to be tossed out the window.About 10 of my ex-favorite books were taken out the bookshelf, put on my desk, and the space filled by these extremely great books. VERY original idea! No boring parts, just interesting stuff. If you're looking for a good book with imagination. These, are the ones for you. Like action? Try these!The only thing I'm very confused about is the trilogy title. \\"HIS Dark Materials\\"??? But isn't Lyra the MAIN character??? Isn't Lyra a girl? I mean, yeah, at first she's a tom-boy, but she turns more lady-like later on.But whoever has read these books, I believe are wishing, like me, for it not to be a trilogy, but a whole series. Don't push yourself, Phillip, just WISHING. To anyone who HASN'T read these, I really encourage you to read them.THEY ARE THE BEST!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Like many others, I read Pullman's trilogy and thought it was well-written and imaginatively conceived - but unlike anyone else, seemingly, I was amazed by the misogyny represented by Mrs. \\"sleep-my-way-to-the-top\\" Coulter and, worse, the way Lyra defers timidly to Will as soon as he shows up - in HER world, no less - in The Subtle Knife. What gives, Philip? How is poor C.S. Lewis' sexism of the '50s worse than yours now? Your sexism is much harder to defend.I know Mr Pullman always loudly despises any British children's writer who is more popular than he is (who is also dead and can't defend themselves), but really... asking kids today to read Swallows and Amazons? Talk about dry and dated! His crude criticisms of Blyton only make Pullman look small.As for JK Rowling, sneering at Blyton for not having sexuality in her '40s books for children is just plain dumb. You can't be superior about it when NO ONE would have put sex in a children's book back then! And as far as I'm concerned, it wasn't a change for the better. Kids today have enough to deal with without growing up too fast in their fairy tale/adventure stories too."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I almost never read fantasy, as real life is fantastic enough. But this trilogy is capital-L Literature, and I was absorbed by every word; the days flew by as I read it. This is not exactly a children's book, though intelligent, questing teens will adore it. As a devout Secular Humanist the anti-Catholic and anti-religious elements didn't bother me at all. It's a good question to ask who the primary audience for the book is. I can only say that it seemed to be written for me. The super-devout should not give it to their children; they might grow up to be self-reliant, intelligently skeptical, unreceptive to dogma, and able to think rationally for themselves."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I have read all three books just for leisure and didn't really try to analyze it to capability that it probably should have been done.I have my own mixed feelings about these books, but I will not share them because I believe literature is a form of art/expression and should be interpreted by the audience how they'd like because everyone has their own life experiences and beliefs, which is what makes ONE book get scores from 1 to 5(stars).I've read some reviews on this book, mostly the ones that gave it a 1 star, and why they felt that way.I've come to the conclusion that this book SHOULD indeed be read by everyone of the family. Well, not everyone... it markets itself as a children's book but I would hold of giving it to my children to read until they are pre-teens or teenagers. But this why I think everyone should read this book, especially families....This book opens up such a discussion that it's refreshing to see. So much thought and feelings comes from reading this(these) book(s). Parents are always at a lost as to how communicate with their children, but I feel this book could really open up lines of communication because call it what you want... this book is sure to get people thinking. Not only thinking but feeling... just look at all the passionate reviews from just this trilogy. And it's a timeless discussion... religion. Pullman writes it in such a way that doesn't seem too religious(if that makes sense). He mixes it in with fantasy and adventure, so children will not easily deter from reading his book.Like it or hate it... I think families will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"My daughter has told me three times now how much she enjoys the books. She is in the middle of book two. Now she does not miss the second movie as much."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This series has been one of my all time favorites and I highly recommend it to anyone with an active imagination."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"If you like fantasy then these stories are just the thing for you. Great writing and a story that keeps you turning the page. The spiritual twist is fascinating. Our young people may save our world and in this story the young girls is a powerful figure of just how brave we can be and do the right thing."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"These books have to be some of my favorite books of all times. Those that gave it bad reviews likely had a negative reaction to the anti-Christian message of the trilogy. I have to admit that there are times when I almost felt bad reading it- essentially killing God is not on the list of things I would have thought I'd like to read about. However, in the end, I felt that it was actually a mind-opening experience. I would absolutely recommend these books to anyone who loves fantasy (especially those Harry Potter lovers!!). Plus, the books are pretty well written which is more than I can say for many other books on the market these days..."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"A friend recommended these to me when I told her I had been trying to keep up with younger reader materials (Lord of the Rings, Eragon, Twilight, Harry Potter, Narnia, etc). She could not have done me a bigger favor. While the other series listed are very entertaining and I am so happy to see a revival of reading, I did not find many of them to be as well written or engaging as this series. The His Dark Material trilogy is a fascinating fantasy that has a quick moving, quirky plot that keeps younger readers turning the pages, but it also provides a good bit of mental stimulation for older readers. Combining entertainment, moral dilemmas, building empathy and philosophical dynamics, this book has opened up so many discussions across the ages. It is such a great way to bring the family together for reading and discussion. My only caution is gauge what subject matter is appropriate for younger readers because some parts can get a little scary. Pullman is not too shy with death, separation or his suspenseful imagination."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am very pleased with my order. The books were in excellent condition and were swiftly delivered.Thanks!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"His Dark Materials Trilogy (The Golden Compass; The Subtle Knife; The Amber Spyglass) (His Dark Materials)"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"... These books have profoundly moral points...These books are among the best young adult fantasy, and fantasy generally speaking, in existance. A profoundly good story coupled with excellent characters and vibrant imagination. One of the best works of 20th century fantasy. The only simlar books which come to mind are 'the last unicorn,' The earthsea books and perhaps 'the unlikely ones.'Buy these books in the hope that more like it are made."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Am a big fan of Harry Potter, The Trilogy: The Golden Compass/the Subtle Knife/the Amber Spyglass were even harder to put down! I read them in 2.5 days! A fantastic read just wish the books didn't end"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"to express how great these books are. These books have everything to love in them. READ THEM. Don't read them in a continuous string though. It really is better to read them over the course of a year. And to thouroughly understand them, it really pays off to read each book twice before going on to the next one. The only thing wrong with this three paperback set are the covers. The publishers, for some reason, thought that it would be good to make these extraordinary novels look exactly like many of the cheap science fiction novels that are all too present in the world of books these days. If you want the best versions of these great books, I would recommend getting the Knopf Paperback editions. The ones with the red and black and white spines. They are easy to hold, convenient for carting around, and they have some of the best covers. you'll have to wait for the Amber spyGlass to come out in this type of softcover though, but it's still worth the wait."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"In the trilogy of His Dark Materials Pullman guides readers through a fantastic and thrilling epic adventure. The Golden Compass is the most innocent of the three books, whereas the second, and especially third book, take on a more mature status. These are books that never lose their touch, no matter how many times you read them. A rollercoaster of emotions lends feeling, and all the characters have amazing depth. Though these books may not be for the die hard christian, they should be read with an open heart and mind. They will have you wishing you had a daemon too.(a personification of the soul in the form of an animal) If you are anything like me, you won't be able to put them down."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I am am eight grader and when I read this book back in the 7th grade, it flew right over my head. I did not understand this and I did not get as much out of this book as more mature people may have. Even though I am only a year older, I may understand it more. It was very good and a great piece of liturature, but I recommend it for 8th, but probably 9th or older."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Ever since I've read these books I can't get them off my mind. I'm a girl about the same age as Lyra and now I want to be just like her!! These books are about a girl and(in the second and third books) a boy who try to help the battle between worlds. As a frquent reader I can tell you I've never read anything quite like it. For anyone who loves to be sucked into a book with action, adventure, love, hate, mystery, and much,much more, get your hands on these books PRONTO!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"This trilogy was absolutely amazing. I could never put it down! The way Pullman writes makes you get really attached to the characters.The endings were totally amazing! I honestly found Harry Potter really boring compared to this trilogy and everyone has to read these books!!! I have read many books since these ones and none of them have kept me in suspense as much as this trilogy!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"All three books are excellent. You don't want the books to end."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After demolishing the Harry Potter series, i was left empty and longing for the fifth book. I was given the Pullman trilogy by a friend to help me combat my \\"Potter Blues\\", and i was impressed!Imagery that was exquisite with a story line to die for, and a new view on the way things could be... for all we know! very brave of Pullman to write a tirlogy such as this and direct it at the younger age group. This is on par with, if not better than, the likes of Narnia, Dickens, Rowling, Robert Lewis Stevenson etc. This is story for all ages and a real eye opener. Mr Pullman... MORE PLEASE"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I think this is a great book. Its adventurous and very interesting. There is journeys, interesting creatures, and also interesting people."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"After reading the reviews by Leigh A. Hubbard and Kim A. Johnson, I am DEFINITELY buying this book. Any book that promotes the idea that, \\"The worse thing you can ever do, the series implies, is to keep the truth from people.\\" and that can show the bankruptcy in religion sounds AWESOME. AND it's like Harry Potter??? Too good to be true!!!"},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"I read all 3 books in the series recently (didn't buy it, but borrowed it), because I was curious about all the publicity it has received with the Golden Compass movie's release. The first book was somewhat enjoyable because the story seemed interesting, though I didn't like the ending (how an innocent child was sacrificed by a \\"good guy\\" to somehow open a window up in a parallel universe). The 2nd novel I found to be too dark and sinister, though with still an interesting story, but the 3rd novel I detested not just because of the dark, sinister nature, but because of its pervasive anti-God and anti-Christian message. The first 2 books also have that message, but it doesn't become really blatant until the 3rd book. I don't have a problem with an author using, as a story theme, an attack on the misuse of religion (or any other belief system) as a means of tyranny over people, but I do have a problem with the author attacking Christianity in and of itself, and basically all monothestic religions for that matter. I would caution parents that they be aware of this before buying this series for their children. Aside from the religious angle, there is also material in there which is, in my view, not suitable for pre-teens, such as the violent, dark themes presented in the 2nd and 3rd novels. I would not purchase it myself nor recommend it to anyone else. Children's minds are more malleable than adult's and so they might be influenced by the subtle and blatant messages in the series. The author invited this kind of criticism by injecting blatant criticism of Christianity into these books. If he had left that out, they might have been pretty decent novels which could have been judged solely on their artistic merit, as he does show considerable literary talent and an ability to create good fantasy. I can't give it more stars than one because of this."},{"Title":"His Dark Materials Trilogy","review":"Parents considering this book for their children should be warned of the author's strong anti-religous views, which come through clearly as a core element of the work.Pullman believes that throughout human history religion has acted as a brutal force for evil, repressing human freedom, creativity and intellectual progress. This comes through clearly in the book, in which God, the Church and religion in general are presented as the villians, without compassion, mercy or any redeeming qualities and routinely committing the most barbarous and hateful atrocities.In the key line of the plot, the two heroic children, Lyra and Will, ally themselves with rebel angels to kill God, so that humans (free of repression by or in the name of the divine) can create their own paradise on earth.If this appeals to you, go for it - the first amendment gives you that right. If you find this worldview and value system repugnant, be warned. This will be a big movie this Christmas season (could that be a deliberate slap at Christians by Hollywood? - what a surprise) and will be heavily hyped by the usual suspects. Don't buy in without knowing what you're getting.As an aside, I'll note that Pullman falls into one of the classic traps to which so many athiests fall victim. Even though he clearly wants to kill God, he's unable to resist the temptation to replace Him with another supernatural agency of his own devising. In this case, it's \\"Dust\\" - the \\"dark particles\\" that are somehow both the cause and result of consciousness and self-awareness and which are themselves conscious (they speak to one of the characters through a computer, and to Lyra through another device). Of course, this construct - central to the book - undermines and subverts the main plot line, and in the end only substitutes another \\"divinity\\" that will in all liklihood in time generate its own church and its own brand of repression - for example,even in these early days, we see murders justified as necessary to \\"protect\\" and \\"preserve\\" the Dust.I think it's pretty clear that (reservations about the anti-religous content aside) the intellectual coherence of the books has been vastly overrated by many reviewers and prize awarding bodies. I wonder whether the books would have received the praise they have if the attack on religion had not resonated so strongly with the biases of many of our secular liberal elites."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},L={key:1};function j(s,e,n,c,r,i){const y=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),b(y,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const E=u(A,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-2266c522"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/12.md","filePath":"guide/12.md"}'),W={name:"guide/12.md"},O=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{B as __pageData,O as default};
