It was wonderful to have on my drives to work and other places."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillian is a work completed and published posthumously by Tolkien's son, Christopher. It is the bible of Middle Earth and contains a much abbreviated taste of several other tales and books of Middle Earth, including: The Children of Hurin and The Lord of The Rings. This is where you'll find the legend of Beren Erchamion and L&uacute;thien Tin&uacute;viel, family trees, and the relationships of the free peoples of Middle Earth. It begins at the beginning of the birth of Middle Earth, Elves, Dwarves, and Men, of good and of evil. Must reading for the Tolkien scholar, informative reading for the Tolkien fan, and entertaining reading for the passive listener."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Great book to delve into after reading the Lord of the Rings series so long ago. I am happy that his son enjoyed his passion enough to give this particular edition a revision. Although the text is always confusing at the start, it is great to keep reading to get through the necessary history and into the story all the same."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you enjoy the Silmarillion, then you are a special type of Tolkien fan. I must say that, if you are that special Tolkien follower, you will have a strong idea for yourself of how things are pronounced, how voices sound, etc. The Silm. audio book and it's narrator will probably jar you slightly from your expectations, but in the end I believe you will enjoy the piece, and consider it an important addition to your Tolkien library."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book fleshes out some of the characters in the Lord of the Rings. Especially the Elves. It can be kind of heavy (this is Tolkien, after all), but a good read if you wanted to know how Sauron rose to power, why Dwarves don't like Elves or what the Undying Lands are.I found it to be more like a history book than a novel. It really helps the world of Middle Earth feel more real. Almost as if you could get on a boat and travel there for your next vacation.I liked it, but it took a while to read it because I had to take breaks from it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was in the same series of printing and I am so glad that I found it. Not many people know about it and this will be my favorite read of the year I am sure!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is an incredible look at Middle-Earth from its creation to the end of the Second Age. Be warned that much of this book reads like a history textbook, giving only brief sketches of names and events. However, even these sections of the book are rewarding and entertaining. Just don't expect true prose throughout the book. There are some moments when the pace slows down and takes on more of a narrative feel. These dynamics are obviously due to the posthumous nature of the work and the fact that Tolkien intended this to be the skeleton on which he would put flesh in LOTR. Highly recommended for all who enjoyed LOTR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is really a great book, it's basiclly a book full of short stories but all of them add up to what Middle Earth is leaving right at the beggining of The Lord Of The Rings.In this item you find out where elves, men, dwarves and orcs and many creatures, and of course Sauron, come from and how and why, plus this new version comes with very well illustrated drawings.I've really enjoyed reading this book,well that's why I bought it, and every time I read it my imagination just takes over and sometimes it's almost unbelievable how creative Tolkien is,it's as if he's lived in Middle Earth, the customs,traditions,songs,poems,odes,descriptions of places actions and how he portrays the beauty of things so simple and yet so overwhelming.In conclusion, this book is great as it is fantastical,I highly recommend it cause you will most likely enjoy it as much as any Tolkien fan,rather new to it or just curious."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Delivery was prompt, and the book was packaged well for protection. It arrived in pristine condition and every bit the product as advertised."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Of course The Silmarillion lives up to its difficult & fascinating history of the beginnings of the world and I highly reccomend the book to any lover of Tolkien. However I have some problems with this particular book.The map image of Beleriand is cut off on the edges, neglecting site of the remainder of the Ered Luin and some of the Dwarvish cities. Not to mention how the map was clipped on the south and the north as well. Perhaps I've become spoiled with Houghton Mifflin's 50th Anniversary Edition of the LOTR?The printing was often mottled within the text. There were places where letters were half missing. Other places where several lines of text had a crinkled line running though it; where it looked as if someone made a poor photocopy of the text by using a wrinkled original.The registering of the text on each page was off from being parallel with the top edge of the paper which skewed the entire block of text at the slightest angle.J.R.R. Tolkien's content itself is excellent!This printing is not!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am perplexed by the reviews calling this book a great read. It is not. It is a convoluted maze of disconnected vignettes mixing moments of high drama with long stretches of sheer pedantry. It is also a curious jumble of epic phrasing and reference information. This must be the first book I have ever read that falls into the brand new genre of Dramatic Encyclopaedia.This book probably garners its high reviews because it follows up one of the most beloved creations of the twentieth century. Lord of the Rings is the kind of writing that haunts one for life. The world of Middle Earth is so richly textured that Tolkien himself felt the need to further clarify his world through the inclusion of a series of appendices to the main story. The Silmarillion should have been another collection of appendices. Instead, it was turned into a self-conscious, puffed-up, precious tome: an accountant in epic costume.I don't know about the reading public these days, but I still demand minimal standards from my books. Things like consistency, coherency, connected narrative, and clarity still matter. These are some of the things that made Lord of the Rings such a magical experience. By no means the only things, but they were indispensable, and Tolkien delivered.The Silmarillion does not.I struggled with this rating. As a reference work, it is an interesting addition to any Tolkien aficionado's library. But as a dramatic work, it is deplorable. Averaging out three stars and one yields two."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of lose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those that live there. We learn many things as what different names of beings and places mean. This helps add a dimension to the stories that take place there.I would say that it would help to read Lord of the Rings first because it is more comfortable when getting to know the area and characters. Then we can see where they came form; relationships are better understood.Much of The Silmarillion can be taken in small bits and then sit back and contemplate how it could have been.One does not just cut through any cultural history book for light reading and just shelving it. This is a cultural history book and will require rereading.When people talk about the war I think back to which one they are talking about. Or are they just referring to one of the many orc skirmishes.You do not have to be a Tolkien fan to find interest in this collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I love each and every word of \\"The Silmarillion\\"; no Tolkien education is complete without it and no reading of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is possibly as rich without it (those who think otherwise delude themselves). BUT--this Martin Shaw presentation is DREADFUL: so lifeless, so passionless. The mispronunciations (accepting JRR's own readings as canon) are galling! Now: for a beautiful, emotional, *emotive* reading--do try Christopher Tolkien's own readings. His \\"Of Beren and L&uacute;thien\\" is simply not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What bothered me most about the overal theme(s) of this book is that the chosen children of god are doomed, over and over, through the course of several thousand years, to wage brutal and deadly war upon each other and against evil with a capital E. The mystical, peace-loving elves trace back history to quite a bloody and evil past, and while they are blessed with immortality (unless slain), they rarely learn from their own errors. How many benevolent leaders who have ruled their people for thousands of years in relative utopia, could throw it all away from a slight influence of a couple of outsiders? Not very well thought through character development through the huge expanse of history, and I would have expected at least SOME growth in the elves, dwarves and men over the thousands of years they have inhabited the middle earth.Of course, this book cannot be compared with LOTR or with The Hobbit because it is not a finished work, but rather a rough structure of the basic tales that formed the prehistory of Tolkien's world. I delved into it as a way of furthering my understanding of the world of Middle Earth. Unfortunately my further understanding can be summed up in \\"We have always done stupid things and will continue to do so ad infinitum.\\" I prefer to have a bit more optimistic outlook on the future of human kind, and had especially hoped for a more clear and progressive growth in at least the Elves, otherwise how can they have become the peaceful and content, quiet and unassuming folk we love so much in the LOTR? Perhaps Tolkien would have addressed some of these issues had he fleshed out these stories, but as it stands the Cliff Notes of The Silmarillion would have provided me with any back story I ever really needed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is definatly not what i expected. the first 100 pages are a grueling history of the gods of middle earth and it took me a commited effort to read through them. There were several times i thought the phone book would be a more interesting reading. after that it lightens up a little bit but i still had flash backs of sitting in church as a child being forced to listen to the preacher without falling asleep. I am dedicated to finishing the book, like it or not. In my opinion, this is not the Tolkien we all now and love. this is something totally different. It's not the same style or interesting story as the hobit or LOTR.

I think I bummed it from my parents when I got married, 5 years ago.Days spent reading it: 5 days.Why I read it: I liked The Lord of the Rings (who doesn't?), and my parents had this lying around the house. So I snagged it and figured I would read it one day.Brief review: This is a difficult book to review. For starters, it is not a novel. It is more in line with ancient epic mythologies. Think Homer or Ovid. So reading it was a beast. Not that exciting. But it is a comprehensive overview of the complex world that Tolkien created. This book tells the tale of the world from its creation up through the events recorded in the LOTR.The problem is that each tale is told in a very archaic language (thee, thou, etc.). I mean it really feels like you've broken open the 1611 King James Bible, only it is about elves and dwarves. It is hard to explain, but Tolkien makes you think you have picked up a classical tale of the olden days. Too bad it is told as dry as toast.Plenty is written through the internet about The Silmarillion. It was published by Tolkien's death by his son Christopher. It is probably very different than Tolkien intended, because he died before he completed it. It has received shaky reviews ever since. People cannot seem to agree--is it a work of genius or is it a bloated mess? I would say somewhere in between.There are glimpses of wonder in this compilation of stories. I loved some of the last tales in the book. The tale of Beren and Luthien was one of my favorites. But other chapters are just plain dull. The problems are numerous. In a work this ambitious, you never really get to know some of the key players in a satisfactory way. Also, for whatever reason, Tolkien gave many of the important (and related) characters similar names. For example, in one of the major families that is used, we have Fingolfin, Finarfin, Finrod, and Feanor. That gets very confusing when you are introduced to all of them in about 10 pages. I never kept them straight in my head and had to constantly refer to the family chart in the back of the book. Thankfully there is a comprehensive index of names and places that gives a brief synopsis of who or what they are. Ye olde englishe doth not helpeth the causeth either.I would not recommend this book to just anyone. And even of Tolkien fans, I would only submit this book to the die-hard fans. There were some good pieces in it, but you had to dig through a whole lot. Not for the faint of heart.Favorite quote: Long was he at work, and slow at first and barren was his labour. But he that sows lies in the end shall not lack of a harvest, and soon he may rest from toil indeed while others reap and sow in his stead.Stars: 3 out of 5.Final Word: Dry."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"... that this book is quite a brilliant book.

I hesitated and almost didn't purchase it. What a mistake that would have been! I loved the book and didn't want to put it down. It is truly a page turner and even if your new to reading Tolkien like I am, you will still love it.I have read the Holy Bible many times and unlike what some of the reviews said, this book \\"does not\\" read like the Old Testament.

It is a whole world essentially created by Tolkien. It is a very difficult book to read, and I had to read it almost three times before I knew who everybody was and how they were related to the other guy. It is a world that is so like our own that we can see the similarities, yet on the other side it is so unlike our own world that it gives it a mysterious air. I would recommend this book to anybody that has any interest in the works of Tolkien.

I'm not sure if this even makes sense as I've never discussed book construction before, but beware of this $11 hardcover if you have any care for aesthetic quality.

However, there is no dialogue, no action, and the plot never really develops, because the story is chopped into little tiny pieces that are related in an encyclopedia-like tone. I only got three-quarters of the way through before boredom got the best of me. Worst of all, the whole book is so preachy, it makes you feel guilty for being human.In fact, the work is so un-story-like and unfinished, I got the feeling Tolkien never really intended for this work to be published -- it appears to have been a place for him to organize and document his thoughts for his other fabulous work.

It was obviously not meant to be published. Tolkien even writes that he had little or no hope that this would ever be published, that it was primarily linguistic in inspiration, and that he used it so that he could acurately document the history of Middle Earth other than that which appears in LOTR. Why then was this published?Along with most of the other disappointing \\"extras\\" to Tolkien's masterpiece, the only reason this book is in print is because Tolkien's son went through after his death and published all of his little tidbits. I mean, this isn't even a proper story! Its a collection of random shorts in almost chronological order. Sure there were a couple ones that were interesting, but those were the ones that were alluded to in LOTR, like the story of Beren and Luthien and that of Earendil.I agree with other readers that expressed in better words than mine the history book-like nature of this book. It IS boring and it IS monotonous, and it IS preachy and prosy and old-fashioned, but its still Tolkien.

Well, the Silmarillion answered my wish. All the characters and legends I wanted to know more about were here (with the sad exception of Tom Bombadil) and more. I would caution those who are only midly interested in Tolkien that this work is somewhat more difficult to read.

That, added to the fact that the atmosphere is nowhere near of joy and happiness (unlike many times during &quot;The Hobbit and &quot;LOTR&quot;), sum it up for a special book.And intense and poetic reading worth any time you spend with it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had the grand fortune of reading this classic within a year of its first release in 1977. Though I was yet a child I remember the awe that filled me as I read each page. Each tale in the book is lovingly written, and masterfully fashioned in epic prose that few have mastered before or since. The stories are captivating, moving, at once tragic and uplifting. I have read this book at least once a year for 22 years, now, and the awe still remains, and each tale re-read unfolds something magical that previously had been hid. I recommend the book to any serious reader, not just as a mainstay of classic fantasy, but as a classic in fine literature, as worthy as Shakespeare or Dickens or Greek tragedy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In 1917, with WWI howling about him, JRR Tolkien began to conceive of several stories which later came to form the backbone of Middle-earth. These stories he worked on, developed, and edited again and again throughout his life; he never finished them -- not to his satisfaction.The stories in 'The Silmarillion' tell mostly of the First Age of Middle-earth: of its creation, of the coming of the Elves and the forging of the Silmarili, of the theft of those jewels and the bitter, doomed war waged to win them back.Here we see, more clearly than in any of his other writings, the enduring themes of loss, redemption, beauty, and folly. But loss most of all: the loss of the purity of Arda (Earth), the loss of the Silmarili, the enstrangement of Elves and Men, and much else. We see the pride and folly of Feanor, who thought that he, or even the whole of the Eldar, could vie successfully against Morgoth. We are told of the wonderous cities and fortresses of the Elves in Middle-earth, and the great works the Elves wrought there, only to see them, one by one, fall through pride or folly or treachery to Morgoth. Each song, each battle, each glorious stand is made more poignant and magnificent precisely because it was doomed, and, often enough, those making these gestures knew it was doomed but did it anyway.Yes, this book a thick and difficult, with many names of people and places thrown at you without much letup. There is little dialog, and not everything is explained to the reader. This is not a flaw, but a source of strength, because once the reader masters the names, once he or she has gained a sufficient understanding of the whole scope of events, then everything seems changed and the real beauty and wonderment comes out. Read the book a second time -- even a third -- and the subtlties and greatness of the work will come out and shine for you like a Silmaril."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion, in my view, is one of Tolkiens greatest books. It is not because of a great plot,as the book is only loosely linked together. Rather its greatness comes from the view that it presents of the earliest times of Middle Earth, and how it sets the stage for the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. Before the Elves learned wisdom, they were arrogant; before they learned self-control, they were over-zealous, anxious to prove what they could do. The crucible of the events of the First and Second Ages tried them and tested them, making them wise beyond any others, having learned wisdom from sorrow. Also, the story of Beren and Luthien, like a gleaming jewel set in a dark setting, stands as one of the greatest love stories I have ever encountered. Tolkien is a master wordsmith and he makes you feel his world. In my view, the Silmarillion provides the essential understanding and background for the LOTR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book deserves to be read for so many reasons, the beauty of the language alone being enough for all five stars. The Silmarillion is professor Tolkiens masterpiece and his main work. Not the Hobbit, nor the Lord of the Rings, but the Silmarillion. In a style reminiscent of (and probably inspired by) the powerful prose of the ancient Norse sagas, but more beautiful by far, Tolkien tells the tales of the creation of the World and of the eldest days.This book is THE central piece of fiction in all of the fantasy genre, filled with love and hatred, hope and despair, glory and tragedy. The phrase \\"epic\\" is used way too often in connection with works of fiction, but this is truly an ephos, unequalled and unsurpassed. Oh, and by the way, get \\"Unfinished Tales\\" as well for the entire story of Turin Turambar and Glaurung, and of Tuor and his coming to Gondolin!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The first time I read Silmarillion I didn't rate it nowhere near as highly as LoTR, there were too many names and events, but though I still haven't read LoTR the 2nd time, I have gone through S. several times, and enjoy it more every time. The stories are short, the number of personalities are countless, but the true depth of Tolkien's vision is always evident. It is very different from the LoTR in style, and therefore many who loved that one will not like S. as much. But I still recommend The Silmarillion deeply."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion can be likened to the lighthouse in my private sea of fiction. I may roam far and wide, visit strange shores; I sometimes stay in one place for a while, savoring the local flavors, before moving on to new experiences. Through it all, I somehow always return to Tolkien's books and to the Silmarillion. I think I know no piece of storytelling quite like it.Oh, there are writers with better characterizations, more intricate plots, more clever dialogue, more originality, and so on. Yet, I have never been so moved by the feel of a fictional world, by the reality of it, by the momentous feeling of greatness lost, of sadness for beauty and glory no longer around us.Somehow, Tolkien conjures up in Silmarillion a world which should have been. He does it with barely any dialogue, and surprisingly few words. The book is not short, it is rather that the enormous sweep of the story told leaves you puzzled that it can somehow be kept within the covers of one book.The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit are really necessary to get full value from The Silmarillion. The book is the Bible of Middle Earth, detailing as it does, the beginning of the world, the creation of the races, and the long, glorious, and immensely sad story of the Firstborn - the elves - and their rise and fall.Like our Bible, it is filled with names and stories concentrated to such an extent that you are unlikely to fully appreciate it the first or second time you read it. Tolkien has stolen ideas with arms and legs from various mythologies (the Tale of Turin Turambar is really the Finnish story of Kullervo), but breathes such life into his world that I have, frankly, never been exposed to its like. It is pure storytelling, a diamond of such nostalgia and sadness it can break your heart, if you let it.Soren Rasmussen"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book, mostly written by Tolkien, with large parts edited and written by his son, is an excellent read for Tolkien lovers and purists, but if you are not one of those two, you will have trouble getting through this book. I had read Lord of the Rings twice when I tried reading this for the first time, and it took me three tries to be able to make it through the entire thing. Once I did, I was satisfyed and will most likly read it again every few years(as I do with the Lord of the Rings). Still, the language in this is not nearly as fluid, well-mastered, or as beautiful as in LOTR. And while it provides great amounts of interesting back story, and I appreciate the LOTR and the other books in Middle-Earth because of it, this was not required reading, nor was it as entertaining or thrilling as LOTR. All and all, a worthy read if you can get through it, but that may be a daunting obsticle indeed for most casual readers."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I received this over christmas even though I already own the first edition copy of a tattered Silmarillion. I put it on my wishlist because I had perused it at a bookstore and fell in love with Nasmith's illustrations. For this reason I believe, this is the authoritative edition of the Silmarillion. I am now re-reading yet again this wonderful book but now I lovingly pause over each of the many color illustrations. I treasure this book and I hope to one day see something similar for the LotR by Ted Nasmith, which I'll certainly buy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Few authors have so successfully created a universe as JRR Tolkien. Best known for \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" that work is only one isolated literary cycle in a mythological, linguistic, philosophic, and sociological scholia that is both vast and profound in its scope.As is well known, Tolkien's universe began with his invention of the Elvish languages (he was a philologist, and linguistics was both his passion and his bread and butter), but rapidly branched from there to stories-- he maintained (quite correctly) that a language cannot stand or maintain its integrity without stories behind it-- and thence to the creation, development, and honing of the literally thousands of minute details that make up a world's history, cultures, geography, politics, spirituality, and philosophy.The Silmarillion, potential readers should be aware, is not a single saga in novel form, like \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It is a collection of myths, legends, and 'historical' essays, most of them either prose adaptations of epic poems or condensed versions of long short-stories which were in some measure left unfinished or incomplete at Tolkien's death. They were edited to their current complete form by Christopher Tolkien, his father's literary executor: he seems to have been the Tolkien child most interested in the elder Tolkien's writing, and followed his father's footsteps into the academia of language and literature. The resulting collection is something of a two-edged sword. It is more remote in feeling than \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" less immediate, and less character-driven. However, that very removal and lack of immediacy contributes to a feeling of antiquity, of stories passed down from immeasurably long ago. There have been frequent comparisons of The Silmarillion to the Norse Eddas, the Bible, the Mabinogion, or other ancient collections of epic myths, and they are not undue comparisons. I am aware of no other single author's work which has so totally achieved the similitude of mythica verita: it is not in any way overstatement to say that should a reasonable, educated person, unaware of Tolkien's existance, read The Silmarillion without being told its nature, that reader would most likely believe it to be an actual legendaria of some ancient or premodern culture previously unknown to him.Beginning at the beginning, The Silmarillion gives us the myths of Tolkien's world from the Creation (in perhaps the most beautiful Creation story since the Navajo's Holy People and the Four Worlds, or that other popular one...you know, Genesis...), through the primordial adventures of the Valar (angels/minor gods/holy people), to the great legends of the Elves, to the beginnings of the myths of early Men. As Tolkien was fond of pointing out, one of the things that distinguishes The Silmarillion legends is that they are not primarily concerned with mortal Men, being rather centered on Elves, their cultures, their problems, their histories. It is a fascinating viewpoint, and not to be passed by.In truth, there really is no other literary work to compare with The Silmarillion. It is unique in its completeness, its authentic ring, and its status as a perfectly preserved mythos for cultures that never existed. But aside from that, it is singularly beautiful. What makes \\"Lord of the Rings\\" so much more than the usual epic fantasy novel is the depth and complexity of the rich world it portrays. The Silmarillion is like brandy to \\"Lord of the Rings'\\" wine, the same rich depth purified to its ultimate extent: heady, potent, and occasionally intoxicating in its elegance. The language is incomparable, both Tolkien's English prose, which shines with polished gravitas, and the words of his invented languages, which are dense and lush and sweet (a refreshing change from the harsh deadness of other invented tongues such as Esperanto). The heroes and villains are everything one could wish from epic mythology. The legend of Beren and Luthien remains, to my mind, one of the few truly perfect stories of romantic love; his world's Lucifer, Melkor called Morgoth, is such a paragon of the fallen angel that Milton would be proud; the Story of the Children of Hurin is a tale of valor and sorrow to equal \\"The Iliad\\" in splendor if not in length.The Silmarillion, worth owning for its beauty alone, is also an exemplary study of ars gratia artis: published posthumously, it made Tolkien no money; politely panned by the dull literary critics he showed it to, he continued working on it for his own pleasure; a deeply Catholic man, Tolkien nonetheless produced a work that while influenced by Christianity was not Catholic nor any other kind of religious allegory, but its own thought entirely; a passionately English man, Tolkien nonetheless created a work readily understood and loved by those not English. He wrote for love of the words, the work, the world he envisioned, and perhaps that is what makes his art so different from the rest of the 'fantasy fiction' out there."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is another ingenious work of the great J.R.R. Tolkien. This book has it all; deception, war, greed, jealousy, and all those other real world emotions which most of us can relate to. While the book does have Elves, Dwarves, Magic, Dragons, and the like, it does carry with it an extremely serious tone. One thing that might turn some people off is the length of it. It is a whopping 480 pages! If you have the patience however, it is worth a try.The beginning of the book starts out with a god-like entity who is referred to as Iluvatar. And from the head of Iluvatar sprang a bunch of angelic creatures known as the Valar. While that sounds like something written by someone who has spent too much time at a Grateful Dead concert, it all fits in with the story. After \`creating' the Valar, Iluvatar then makes a world for them to shape any way they see fit. One Valar by the name of Melkor however, doesn't just want to help create this world; he wants to dominate it. So he goes about creating fortresses and causes problems for the others by destroying everything they create. This seriously upsets Iluvatar, because he planned to create new creatures to inhabit the world they were making. So after a long war with Melkor, the Valar finally subdue him and chain him up, only to have him rise again when the new creatures are created and attempt to control them. The rest of the book deals with the struggles the new creatures of the world have with Melkor.It is a very compelling overall story, however the way it is put together may make most readers shy away from it. It has a very old English style of writing to it, which makes it seem like it was taken from The Bible or a history book. While that adds an authentic feel to the story, it may be tough for normal readers to get in to. I had to constantly re-read sentences that have old phrases and words that we no longer use. For instance when Iluvatar is informing a certain Valar of Melkor's misdoings, it reads \\"Seest thou not how here in this little realm in the Deeps of Time Melkor hath made war upon thy province?\\" While this style of writing is interesting, it is a little difficult to comprehend.For those of you who enjoy finding ways to relate stories to real life, you could relate this book to a real world event that happened around the time Tolkien started writing the Lord of the Rings; WWII. The main evil in this book, Melkor, could easily be related to Hitler, and his orc pawns could be related to the Germans that Hitler had brainwashed. The Elves and other races could represent the Allies: how they had their differences with each other, and yet all came together in the end and united to stop the one thing threatening their freedom. That's of course just my view, and I'm sure you, the reader, could find different ways to relate it to different events.I recommend this book to anyone who is a big Lord of the Rings fan and insists on knowing every little detail, like me. Also, anyone who is a fan of fantasy in general (and has a lot of patience) would most likely find this book an interesting read. Though it is hard to get into, it is worth the effort. This is, in my opinion, one of Tolkien's greatest works, and answers all those questions left from The Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Several friends warned me that trying to listen to The Silmarillion while driving could be asking to fall asleep at the wheel. On the contrary, I found Martin Shaw's reading of this classic to be a very pleasant way to experience Tolkien's unabridged work. Shaw has a powerful, engaging voice and since there is very little dialogue in The Silmarillion, he doesn't need to adopt many different personalities in his delivery. Many other reviewers have covered this title from the perspective of its greatness in a literary sense so I won't bother adding to that. But as far as the quality of this audio book edition, I give it full marks."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the ultimate in world creation. In order to write his other novels, Tolkien first created his background and started from scratch. Literally, this is \\"In the beginning...\\" kind of stuff!Now I read the reviews by those who feel it's too complex or involved and I can see how that could be. I read the Silmarillion on a several day bus trip when I was 12 or so. It was pretty heavy reading and I think I missed some bits. It was definitely a good read, but it wasn't until some time later, after a second and third re-reading that I felt I understood what was going on well enough to be comfortable discussing the stories with other afficionados.So, if you don't \\"get it\\" the first time and yet you love the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, I suggest you give it some time and read the Silmarillion again. It's as good as there is when it comes to fantasy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"You really have to be in the right mood for The Silmarillion. I love it, but I realize it's not for everyone. This is the &quot;big story&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien worked on all his life, but never completed. His son, Christopher Tolkien, does an admirable job of assembling this collection of myths into a coherent whole. What is Middle-Earth? Where did it come from? Where did the Elves come from? What happened in the First Age? How did N&uacute;menor fall? There are so many questions answered in this book, as well as basic questions, like how the world was created (by music! awesome!), that are just fun to read. However, the early part of The Silmarillion is a tragedy.Imagine, if you will, two glorious trees, one with silver leaves and one with gold, that shine with their own inner light and illuminate the city of the gods. An elf, Feanor, uses the skills he has learned from the Valar (gods) to enshrine some of the light of these two trees into three brilliant jewels called the Silmarils. The dark lord (Morgoth) steals the jewels and heads off to Middle-Earth. The rest of the book entails the wars and tragedies that result as the Elves try to recover the Silmarils by force. This is high mythology, with heavy, dark content. At the time I read it, The Silmarillion was unlike anything I had ever read. Quite frankly, I haven't found any other fantasy series nearly so captivating (I am a science fiction fan, by disposition). This is not just swords and sorcery fare; Tolkien has some serious moral points to make, and he makes them subtly while telling you a grand tale, akin to the Odyssey.This is not a happy book. There is much sorrow in it and many tales of loss. But you cannot have loss without having gained something first, and Tolkien conjures up amazing images of faerie cities and uncountable riches. When those riches are lost, it is only through the moral weakness of those who possess them. You won't get much of that in Conan. The success of modern fantasy is owed in no small part to the success of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; but before LOTR, in Tolkien's mind, there was The Silmarillion; and this is the real story he wanted to tell. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I disagree with a lot of the other reviewers about the beginning of The Simarillion. In my opinion, the story of the creation of Middle Earth is well-written. Certainly there are a lot of names introduced, but it is unnecessary to remember them all. The first part of this book really reveals Tolkien's weaving of European, Judeo-Christian, Greek, and Roman mythology with his own fantasy. There is even an Old Testament feel to the diction that conveys the grand religious mood of the opening. Read it and decide for yourself.The only negative review I could possibly give this book is that it made the events of Lord of the Rings seem small in comparison. Sauron is, after all, only a lieutenant of Morgoth."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In writing \\"The Silmarillion\\", J. R. R. Tolkien set out to create a mythological prehistory for the War of the Ring chronicled in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, devoting much of his adult life towards this ambitious work. Left unpublished at the time of his death, it was subsequently edited and published by his son Christopher in the mid 1970's, and remains an essential part of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle Earth sagas. Here is the origin of \\"Middle Earth\\" and the various tales chronicling the major events of the First Age, starting with the origins of the elves, dwarves and humanity. At the heart of these tales are the wars and battles fought for the possession of the Silmarils, fantastic jewels made by elves and subsequently seized by Morgoth, the original Dark Lord of Middle Earth. These tales are splendid introductions to Elrond and Galadriel and Sauron, Morgoth's chief lieutenant, who are major protagonists in the epic War of the Ring. And there are spellbinding accounts on the rise and fall of the human kingdom Numenor and the tragic love affair between the human Beren and the elf Luthien. All of this is told in Tolkien's graceful, lyrical prose. I concur with others who recommend reading \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" prior to \\"The Silmarillion\\", yet those entranced by Tolkien's Middle Earth will find \\"The Silmarillion\\" well worth waiting for."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a book to drown yourself in. It IS heavy reading, but well-worth delving into, even if only in small doses at a time. It is actually more like a whole library on the subject of middle earth and gives readers alot of insight into how Tolkien worked out &quot;the Hobbit&quot; and &quot;the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; Trilogy later in his writing life.If you have a wanna-be writer in your life who has been inspired by &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, etc. Give them this book. They will go crazy first reading it, and thank you later.Take it from one writer who did."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Contrary to popular belief, the Silmarillion is Tolkien's true masterpiece. It is a culmination of the man's life-long love of mythology, poetry, and language. The Lord of the Rings cannot be truly understood nor fully appreciated without a deep reading of the Silmarillion.Read the Lord of the Rings, then read the Silmarillion. Then read Lord of the Rings again, and then re-read the Silmarillion. You will be amazed at how intricately the plots are woven together, piecing together the elaborate tales from the beginning of time through the adventures of Frodo in Return of the King. An absolute masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's more than slightly staggering to consider the epic fantasy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; to be the tail end of Tolkien's invented history. The &quot;Bible&quot; of Middle-Earth, the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the Rings of Power; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; if you are fond of Hobbits or Dwarves, you will not find as much here. For those, you should check some of the other &quot;lost&quot; books of prior writings. It will also answer some questions that &quot;Hobbit&quot; and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made.Be forewarned: The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to LOTR. It's more formal and archaic in tone, Tolkien did not get as &quot;into&quot; the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.It's evident, while reading this, that Tolkien's passion for his invented history. Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened. And in an age of shallow, cliched fantasy, Tolkien's coherent, carefully-written backstory is truly unique.If you can take the formal prose and mythical style, this is a treasure, and a must-read for anyone who loved LOTR or &quot;Hobbit.&quot; Only after reading this can readers truly appreciate Tolkien's literary accomplishments, and the full scope of the Middle-Earth that we glimpse in his more famous books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you liked Lord of the Ring's and want to know more about this world then this is Well Worth a Read."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I used this book for a college class and it served me well.

It's difficult to illustrate a book like \\"The Silmarillion\\", but Ted Nasmith has done a great job.Under the dust cover there is a blue fabric cover, it makes the book very sturdy.I recommend anyone this book. It's a great addition to any bookcase, and it comes for a great price!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I really do believe that to truly appreciate the stories of The Hobbit as well as the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, one must read The Simarillion. The breadth and scope of Tolkien's creativity truly begins to be seen within the Simarillion. I heard or read somewhere that Tolkien thought of his writings and such as a creation within creation, that he was most glorifying God when he was being as creative as possible, in effect creating a world just as God had.Well, I think the fact that any man could have such breadth of vision and conceptualization as is evident in the Simarillion, that fact in and of itself, brings glory to God. And I think the fact that Tolkien painted the unfolding history of his world in the colors of not only love, trust and triumph (as well as many other 'virtues'), but greed, selfishness, pride, and many more aspects of a fallen nature is reflective of the Bible in many respects, for Tolkien does not seem to be trying to tell us a story as we want to hear it, but rather just acting as a purveyor of events that were.At times I found myself dragging through sections, through certain stories. And at other points I found myself reading pages breathlessly, impatient to know and experience what was to come next. But, overall, I found that my pace reading this book was akin to the pace I take reading through a non-fiction book - Tolkien's writing is so rich, and his style so strong that I couldn't just consume it as I do other non-fiction works.So do I recommend it? Absolutely - but don't expect a Robert Jordan, Stephen Lawhead, Anne McCaffrey or the like. Tolkien's books have been proven by time, not by the bestsellers list. This is different - this is what most fantasy writers of the present are striving to approach."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is the spellbinding compilation of JRR Tolkien's tales of the Elder Days of Middle Earth, the History of the Elves, and the Shapping of Arda.

For fans of any of Tolien's other writings, such as The Hobbit, or The Lord of The Rings, the Silmarillion is a must read.

The reading by Martin Shaw (who was terrific as Capt. R. F. Scott in THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH) has just the right sobriety and weight for this material. Even the (occasional) music isn't offensive.

I've come to respect Tolkien more through reading it and come to understand that this was a prolific man and a genius in is own way. The Silmarillion reads a little like Greek mythology and a little like poetry. It's a definite must have for lord of the rings fans and gives a lot of background info on the rings of power and of Gandalf and Sauron and the elves. Excellent book and for fantasy fans, addictive reading!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's impossible to see how anyone could give this masterpiece less than a five...unless they don't understand it. It is not meant to be a novel per se; it is more of an anthology, doubly removed from the reader. The stories that make up the Silmarillion are considered history to Frodo and Sam, so to the reader they seem like biblical text. However, in this relatively short book are assembled some of the most powerful stories of all time.The story of Turin Turambar interweaves some of the greatest story lines into a lyrical tour de force. He is the classic tragic hero, reminiscent of Oedipus in more ways than one. The elves-men dynamic also allows for great romance and poignancy, as in the story of Beren and Luthien.Possibly the greatest aspect of the Silmarillion is that it can portray classic gods, pitched battles between good and evil, as well as many other cliches, yet still maintain an undeniable believablity. All the small stories are just abridged sagas of equal breadth to LOTR that will surely delight both new readers and diehard Tolkien fans alike."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Only read this if you love Tolkien and want to fully understand the history of Middle Earth. I only really began to understand and enjoy this on my third reading (the first was 15 years before the second however). This book is a great and rich history of Middle Earth that starts from the beginning of time up until the end of the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien basically worked on this from his time in the trenches during the Battle of the Somme until his death and changed it a lot over time. What you will read is the edited version by his son that uses a lot of unfinished notes, I don't think this distracts from the overall product."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"To hear Tolkien's words spoken so gloriously! The Silmarillion is such a masterful piece of work. Whether you read it and then listen, read along, or just listen, these audio CDs are a delight.

The Hobbit obviously has a very light style; the 3 LOTR books have a much more serious, epic tone; and the Silmarillion is told in a much more abbrieviated, academic style that requires you to pay attention.Contrary to the horror stories you've heard, the Silmarillion is not nearly as convoluted and heavy as the old testament. I mean, come on, man, it's got a talking dog in it! Well, then again, the old testment had a guest appearance by a talking SHRUB, for crying out loud. But nevermind that. The point is this: if you were all busted up when our Nine Fingered friend and his buddies went sailing off to the Grey Havens and you'd like spend a little more time with that world without it becoming a full-time hobby, then, yeah, you'll want to read this. It acts as the foundation of the other 4 books-- why stop now?"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"From the master of fantasy comes this jewel of jewels. The Silmarillion is the story of the Silmarils, the most precious gems ever crafted. In telling the story of these treasures he presents the tale of the creation of middle-earth -- a sort of mythological beginning which involves a hierarchy of greater and lesser gods and later brings the creation of the elves. It also tells the story of Morgoth, the first great dark lord under whom Sauron was only a lieutenant.As the elves divide, multiply, and spread upon middle-earth, changes gradually take place, and strife appears. Soon men are created, and the dwarves come out of the east. Wars rage and Morgoth wreaks havoc upon the land with his army of balrogs and dragons. This, then, is the story of the first age of middle-earth.Along with the tale of the Silmarils comes a story of Numenor, the ancient land where men dwelt and from whence came the lord of Gondor. Also included is a tale of the forging of the rings of power, and an account of the first defeat of Sauron. Altogether, this book encompasses the first and second ages, as well as a sketch of the events of the third.For true Tolkien fans, this will be a wonderful addition to The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's writing style is beautiful, and the story is very well written. Any fantasy fan will enjoy this book greatly. It should be remembered, however, that this book has more of a mythological base, and there is less attention to detail and much less dialogue than the Lord of the Rings. Instead it is told as a sort of epic history, given as an overview rather than a detailed account."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"These are composite versions of the tales that caught C.S. Lewis up in wonder in the decade prior to the Second World War, and where LOTR travels through valleys and mountains and wastes, here the forests are darker and more terrible, the peaks more glacial, the darkness colder and the light more piercing.\\"For Hurin stood in despair before the silent cliffs of the Echoriath, and the westering sun, piercing the cloluds, stained his white hair with red.

O Turgon, will you not hear in your hidden halls?' But there was no sound save the wind in the dry grsases. 'Even so they hissed in Serech at the sunset,' he said; and as he spoke the sun went behind the Mountains of Shadow, and a darkness fell about him, and the wind ceased, and there was silence in the waste. - Yet there were ears that heard the words that Hurin spoke, and report of all came soon to the Dark Throne in the north; and Morgoth smiled, for he knew now clearly in what region Turgon dwelt, though because of the eagles no spy of his could yet come within sight of the land behind the Encircling Mountains. This was the first evil that the freedom of Hurin achieved.\\"Despite his lack of affinity for 20th century writing, the severe style (and sentiment) comes closer to Hemingway than it does to the heroic cadences of the 19th century, except Tolkien's language is less self-conscious than his, since his reading tastes stopped well short of the 17th century.Despite the perpetual presence of LOTR high on the list of 20th century classics, some readers and critics still profess to find Tolkien a juvenile writer, stuck in adolescence. \\"The Silmarillion\\" would, or should, dispel any doubts and please anyone who loves the stark beauty of the English tongue and the English imagination, in these pages perhaps in their last clear blaze."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The audio CD boxed set of The Silmarillion, which contains the entire, unabridged text of the book over thirteen discs, is a real treat to listen to. Martin Shaw's narration captures Tolkien's vatic voice flawlessly, with excellent pacing, tone, and the correct pronunciation of those tricky Elvish words. Shaw is, however, less effective when he changes his voice to speak as specific characters like E&ouml;nw, Morgoth, Thingol, or various female characters. Tolkien's use of language is such that it rewards repeated listening, which makes this boxed set an excellent investment, even if, like me, you own a copy of The Silmarillion that has been just about read to pieces, and know the words a little too well for your own good."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book was a fantastic guide and a fantastic story involving the beggining and early ages of Tolkien's magnificant universe. I have read this after completing the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and couldn't possibly imagine reading this before finishing those. You must familiarize yourself with Tolkien's diverse languages and races of Arda and Middle-Earth. To someone who doesn't know what Arda is, please READ LOTR FIRST. This was all in all an EXCELLENT book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This review is for the hardcover edition, illustrated by Ted Nasmith. I'm going to pretend that everyone reading this already knows what the Silmarillion is about and is familiar with the tales within. Yes, it's a five-star book; I have a dog-eared paperback version that has quite a few combat scars to prove it. I wanted a hardcover book with pretty pictures, a snazzy looking tome to put on an end table. This is it.There are 18 full-page, full color illustrations in this book, plus the front and back of the dustjacket. Unfortunately, I'm one of those people who wanted lots of pictures of Elves doing Elvish things. What the book offers is half pictures of Elves, half pictures of Elven places. Personally, I would have preferred more pictures of the characters in the book, not just the forest glens and oceans and gardens that were instead included. Granted, Nasmith has great talent, and while some of these illustrations are truly gorgeous, I would have liked to see some more warrior-like beings I've seen in his Tolkien calendars. Nasmith did, in fact, also do this year's (2000) calendar.It's a handsome book. Underneath the beautiful glossy dustjacket of Maglor casting a Silmaril into the sea, the book is clothbound in black and embossed in silver.The illustrations are: Maglor Casts a Silmaril Into the Sea, Beren and Luthien are Carried to Safety, The Sea, The Lamp of the Valar, At Lake Cuivienen, The Light of Valinor on the Western Sea, Fingolfin Leads the Host Across the Helcaraxe, The First Dawn of the Sun, Maedhros's Rescue from Thangorodrim, Eol Welcomes Aredhel, Felagund Among Beor's Men, By Moonlight in Neldoreth Forest, Luthien Escapes upon Huan, Morgoth Punishes Hurin, Turin and his Band are Led to Amon Rudh, Finduilas is Led Past Turin at the Sack of Nargothrond, Ulmo Appears before Tuor, Earendil the Mariner, The Eagles of Manwe, The Ships of the Faithful.This book is beautiful, I highly recommend it. It would make a great gift too, even for a non-fan."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I thought the Silmarillion was the perfect companion to the Lord of the Rings. It details everything before the Third Age, and even some in the Third Age itself. I especially like the parts that talk about Numenor and the great kings there. It explains Sauron even more and all of the First Age, formation of Orcs and Balrogs, and other interesting facts."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Enchanting tales of old including the five battles of Beleriand (best battles of all in my opinion) and the story of the Valar and the coming of men elves and dwarves, truly a magnificent piece by Tolkien, Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is for die-hard Tolkien fans, there's no doubt about it. It reads much like a Bible for Middle-Earth, but can help create an in-depth understanding of the background of Middle-Earth. Though there's few names you'd recognize from the Rings trilogy itself, (Elrond and Galadriel are probably the ones you would readily recognize) you can understand a lot more of the trilogy itself if you read this.You can get a better grasp on many of the poems and expressions used, such as in the first book, the Fellowship, Elrond says something to the effect of \\"Though you sit among Turin or Beren, you would be honored among them.\\" or some of the poetry regarding Beren and Luthien.It's actually tough reading, and at times boring, but overall it's kind of fun."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The time and craft with which Tolkien created his world never ceases to amaze me, and in the Silmarillion, this world comes through in all of its glory. I am absolutely enthralled by the depth and scope of this work, and the endless spaces of Tolkien's imagination it reveals. But I must echo the sentiments of other reviewers and caution that this workis not for all readers. It requires a fervent interest in the minutiae of Tolkien and a measure of patience. Tolkien created middle-earth partially because he wanted to resurrect the role of ancient mythology in the zeitgeist of the world, and the Silmarillion must be read with the goal of mythology in mind. I would particularly recommend this work to those people who enjoy both the complexities of history and the wonder of fantasy. I found that I enjoyed this work largely because it presented a &quot;history of fantasy.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I used to wonder who this Elbereth/Githoniel person was and why only the high elves spoke of her. I used to wonder who Shelob really was and where she came from. But after reading the Silmarilion, all my questions about the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were answered."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion (and the Lord of the Rings, for that matter) is a collection of stories about fighting over jewelry and the resultant hand injuries. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This novel is the best Tolkien novel and one of the best works of literature I have read. The Silmarillion is the best tradgedy, better than Shakespeare, that I have read. The Silmarillion lacks the same tone as the Lord of the Rings since the novel was compiled by JRR Tolkien's son. His son, however, still did a masterful job. The Silmarillion is the history of Middle Earth.The adventures take place when Sauron is but a servant of one more powerful and more evil. In the beginning there was one who created the Ainur. Of the Ainur, Melker was the greatest, but he fell from his high position. Then some of the Ainur came to Middle Earth to shape the creator's vision. Melker seduced some of the Ainur to his side and was at strife with the others, the Vala. The Vala chained Melker to protect the Elves. Then there was bliss until Melkor was released. Feanor was the greatest of all the Elves, and created the three Simarils. These Melker stole, and the tragedies that befell the Nolder (Feanor's race) make the Silmarillion.In addition to the wonderful stories, this illustrated hardback copy is very nice. I already owned the first edition hardback, but I also bought this version. Tolkien was an awesome author, and this novel does him tribute."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I find it very interesting that based on all the reviews I've read on this site, the sole body of criticism surrounding the Silmarilion comes down to the indictment &quot;This is too confusing!&quot;. No, in fact, it is not too confusing- it is simply possessed of a depth that most fantasy fans will find challenging. I can't blame them- if the sum total of my reading experiences were Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks with a helping of Dragonlance novels, I would find Tolkien's work obtuse as well. As it happens, I didn't, so I don't. Tolkien set out to create a piece of cosmological distinction, deeper and more complex than any works of fantasy before or after his time. In setting out on this task he didn't pull any punches; the man wrote for his own pleasure, and in doing so created a world satisfactory to his own level of linguistic genius. To the less enlightened, educated and intelligent observer, which I am, it is most daunting indeed. To those who possess even less acumen than myself, this book must read like a Pinter play translated into Swahili. Whil Tolkien may challenge the reader, it is by NO MEANS that reader's right to criticize the work simply because he or she cannot rise to the level of requisite inteligence Tolkien's prose demands. If you hated this book, I have only this to say: Either you didn't Get It, or you're not sharp enough to get it in the first place. If the latter is true, don't feel bad- it probably isn't your fault(unless you sniffed too much rubber cement in Grade School). To the former, you sell short your own opportunities by blaming the work for your own sloppy reading. Tolkien is transcendent, but then again so is Buddhism. Some people will see the world, or in this case the book, for the beauty it contains and internalize this revelation. Some will shut their eyes and continue to live in the world of dust, or to carry on the book metaphor, just pick up the next Jordan book. I have no time for either one, and neither did Tolkien. His books will retain their majesty long after this site and its parent company have gone the way of the dodo, and long after I have been laid in the ground. The books speak for themselves, as Tolkien no doubt intended. Ai na vedui dunedain."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What makes Tolkien great is that he understands that modernity is a lie; that there was a better world inside of man long ago, and if there wasn't, well then there should have been.It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien in The Silmarillion showed the true love and effort he poured into creating the Lord of the Rings and Middle Earth. Not just a story set in a slapdash setting, he created Middle Earth literally from nothing. Paralleling the Bible in more ways than one, the Silmarillion begins with Middle Earth being created by one all powerful God, Iluvatar. Among his servants is Morgoth, he who turned to evil out of jealousy of Iluvatar and sought to sow discord in the harmony of Iluvatar's creations. So sets the stage for the creation of the world in which the Lord of the Rings would be set. Not just the planet and its various creatures created by Iluvatar's loyal servants, the Valar, but also the creation of all the monsters and hateful things which Morgoth created or perverted from things already existing. Serving as the foil not just of the Valar but also the beings created by them to rule the world, the Elves and their lesser cousins the Dwarves and Humans, Morgoth epitomizes the devil, even spending many centuries lurking in underground realms of his own creation and creating his dark armies and fomenting dissent and deceit among the Elves and Men and Dwarves.Specifically, the book contains the creation of the world, the tale of the Silmarils, jewels of unmatched beauty but carrying a curse, stolen by Morgoth and held by him for ages. The jewels bring ruin to all those who hold or seek them. Spanning centuries, they lead to the downfall of the Elf civilization on Middle Earth, forcing the bulk of the Elves to depart for the West long before the Rings were created. The following tale is of Sauron, chief lieutenant of Morgoth, who corrupts the Numenoreans from their peaceful coexistence with the Elves of the West, and leads them to their own ruin by turning to worship of Morgoth. Finally comes the tale of Sauron creating the Rings and the background to the Lord of the Rings is completed.The book is not possessed of a true plot, and it's not supposed to any more than any other history book will possess. Rather, it presents the facts of the creation of the world, the rise and fall of the Elves and Men, the history of the Dwarves in their interactions with the other two races, the creation of the various evil races, the conflict not just between the Elves and the minions of evil but also between the higher beings of the Valar in their own ranks and how that was the downfall of the goodly races time and again. There are tales of heroes, tragic sacrifice and grand betrayal. Truly, in examining each vignette individually, there are stories with plot and resolution and all the aspects one might find in an anthology, but this is not true for all such chapters and sections of the book. There are two maps included, but due to the small size of paperback pages, these maps are poor and all the places referred to time and again in the text are not to be found on them. This is the only reason I awarded four stars instead of five. More than anything else, reading this makes on appreciate the backstory of the film trilogy and respect the effort of Jackson to stay true to the source material, which he very much did."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Many years ago, I listened to about 1/3 of this unabridged on CD reading, but never got through it. Later in life I picked up and put down the novel, reading all words in between. (That was a bit of a loyal, grueling effort!) A couple months ago I started listening to the CD again, and finished this morning. Let me just say that Martin Shaw totally gets Tolkien. The accent, the pronunciations, even the different voices. The story came alive through his narration, and with the listening of this CD set the words I'd read long ago came alive again but this time managed to stick in a way that I can truly say that now _I_ get The Silmarillion. Bravo to JRR Tolkien and his son the editor for letting us enjoy this history of the world Tolkien created. And bravo to Mr Shaw for a masterful storytelling that left me longing for more. The dramatic music at the start and close of each major section was the icing on the cake of this wonderful unabridged audio book on CD."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was an epic book. While it is diffcult to read as Paradise Lost due to how it is structured it really adds to the beauty that is seen in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The stories are fantastic. You can really attach yourself to the characters. Also this book has spawned one of my favorite villains of all time Melkor a.k.a Morgoth and fleshs out the character of another Sauron. Though which is the better villain I am still debating that. If you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion\\"The Silmarillion\\" Author, J.R.R. Tolkien.The reason I purchased The Silmarillion from Amazon.com was while I was looking for the book Amazon.com showed a couple view's of the book, offered new and used book's I bought new. Amazon.com also showed me other people and site's selling the book even if they were lower in price. Amazon.com was the cheapest thou in this case. Amazon.com packaged the book so well that the book's dust cover nor the binding could be scratch or broken or bent. I also recieved it before the deliever date they estimated to me. I will be purchasing all my book needs and other's from Amazon.com.\\"The Silmarillion\\"J.R.R. Tolkien is the most capticating Author I have read. His creation of Beleriand and Middle Earth is amazing. I love how The Silmarillion tells you how Middle Earth was created along with who created the Elve's,dwarve's, tree's,sun,Orc's, Dragon's, Dark Lord,and everthing else that exist in Middle Earth. Who made and how the Silmarils came to be. And the importance of them. How life came threw the ages.I even love the forward, preface to the second edition. I especially loved the letter from J.R.R. Tolkien to Milton Walden in 1951 Walden wanted a brief sketch of Tolkien's work, the letter was about 14 page's. They also included Notes of pronunciation to help with the Elvish language,Index of names of each person and place along with page's for a quick referance,there is the family tree's of the King's,Lord's,Dwarves, Elve's, Men who they married and how they became kin, also a Appendix for those like myself whom are interested in the Eldarin language. I love also that map's are included 1 on page 114 which tells lands and kings and lords of those lands. Another map in the very back which is attached to the book but can be opened up which is 3 times larger then the book. There are also illustration's throught out the book, but Tolkien is such an amazing writter you don't need the picture's or map's but they are a great referance. Because i saw in my mind exactly what the pictures and maps looked like. That's because J.R.R.Tolkien is a great Author, his son helped with this book because J.R.R.Tolkien passed away before this was complete, also thanks to the IllistratorI would recommend this book for children and adults alike. J.R.R. Tolkien is a very capticating writter a book I didn't want to put down. I also read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" and the trilogy \\"The Lord of the Ring's\\" of which all those kept me as excited to read as this. \\"I can't say enough about this book. I highly,highly recommend it.\\"I was very happy Amazon.com had this book.Thank you,Margaret {pardon my Spelling}"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you're a Tolkien fan, you'll love it. It shouldn't be your first read. I would start with \\"Lord of the Rings\\". It reads like mythology and not a novel. The book gives the history of Middle-Earth. There is tons of action, and many characters with interesting names. It can be a hard read. Tolkien has many names in his Elvish language. If you're not use to it, try getting the audio CD. The book is so dense with information. If you want to remember all the names and places, it may make sense to read it twice. The Silmarillion has five parts. It covers the First Age and Second Age heavily while just summarizing the Third Age. If you read LOTR then this is a MUST read. It sheds some background and history to it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The silmarillion is a great read that excels in any other of Tolkiens writings. It is a great read because it describes the fight between good and evil. For example in this book one of the Valar named Melkor turns his back on the rest of them and tries to take over Valinor which was the home of the elves. after he fails he is exciled from Valinor. When this happened he swore to take revenge abd did so by takeing the silmarils which are the only source of light in the forest of lorien. After he obtains these he travels to middle earth and wipes out the men of the north. Another reason why I think this is am excellent read is because it connects all of Tolkiens writings reletive to middle eart which is important to tose both farmiliar and unfarmiliar to the lord rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Its important to undertand that even though The Silmarillion was not published until four years after the death of its author, it nevertheless contains some of the earliest of his writings about his invented world. Compiled from a mass of unfinished and disorganized writings, this is the closest we will ever get to J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork as he himself imagined it.The largest part of The Silmarillion covers the thousands of years which make up the First Age, in which the Great Enemy Morgoth makes war upon the Valar or angels of Iluvatar/Eru, The One. As the lands later known as Middle earth were formed, new creatures were born to populate it, first the Elves or Eldar, and later Men, Dwarves, and others. All of these were drawn into the Great Conflict against Morgoth and endured centuries of warfare. The main part of the Silmarillion closes with the defeat and casting out of Morgoth. The next part, the Akallabeth, deals with the history of Numenor, the island realm given to the noblest Men, the Edain, as a reward for their struggles. Finally we have a recapitulation of the history of the Third Age, in which Morgoth's chief servant Sauron was finally defeated.Christopher Tolkien edited and compiled the writings which became The Silmarillion, and some have criticized him for eliminating much of the beauty which characterizes his father's writing at its finest. But its important to understand that the Silmarillion is meant to be the motherlode of Middle earth lore, and that the later embroiderings developed to adorn this original text.This edition is greatly enhanced by the beautiful illustrations provided by Ted Nasmith."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a easy read. It lays a wonderful foundation for the adventures to come. If the revival of the Lord Of The Rings series left you wanting more, this book is very satisfying."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is the Best Book I've EVER Read. And I've read some Doozies.. Oh, i mean, this is Second only to the Bible, of course. There are some initial similarities, But that is not why i Love this book. This book is Amazing. Because of the Writing and greatly creative stories. This book is So insanely poetic and has very peotic king james-like language. The Adventure stories that Mr. Tolkien comes up with are purely the work of a Genius Creative Mind. His Stories took my breath away, like the chapter on Beren and Luthien! Talk about Adventure! I will read this book over and over again."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is Tolkien's original background story for The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. This book does not read like a typical novel though, and really is for the serious Tolkien fan. It's a mythology, and a wonderfully developed one at that. Here we have the history of Middle-Earth going back to the First Age. It's a tale of creation and long ago origins, the elves and dwarves, Morgoth the Dark Lord, the forging of the Nine rings and the creation of the One Ring that is the basis for the story, The Lord of the Rings.I've enjoyed this book so much that I've read it 3 times and now plan on continuing with Morgoth's Ring, the first of 2 books considered to be the second Silmarillion. I'm very impressed with the amount of time and effort Tolkien went into creating such a fantasic world as Middle-Earth, not just the history, but the languages as well. Very impressive. 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I had read Lord of the Rings and i thought it was great. both entertaining, multileveled and smart. I wanted more so I was thinking of reading the SILMARILIAN. I heard from some people who said it was difficult to read and not really worth it, but i got a copy anyway. I am only a college student but I did not find it difficult to read at all, and halfway through it, it is the best thing I've ever read. It is amazingly well constructed mythology, and history. I understand now why Tolkien is hailed as a genius and great litterary mind. I loved The Lord of the Rings but I think The Silmarillion is a million times better. It is so rich and well thought out, I think any students looking for something interesting and something they could learn from should read this book, as well as any fans of mythology, or of Lord of the Rings. Parts get a little dry where &quot;so and so is the son of so and so who came from the line of whats his name...&quot; but still the whole thing is amazing and wonderful and full of magic and mystery in the tradition of imagination as well as education and understanding. Very entertaining on top of everything else. i read half of it in two days...once i read the first paragraph of Ainulindale i couldnt put it down and still have trouble doing so. Especially recomended for art, music, and literature students, or likeminded people or areas of interest. Also it fills in a lot of holes in your mind about where Sauron comes from and illuminates the poems and brief histories and origins of characters given within The Lord of the Rings. I am certainly glad they decided to release this, which as i understand was origionally just something Tolkien wrote to establish the history of his story.I wish i had come across this book long ago."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I just picked up the Silmarillion again a couple days ago, and devoured every page of it and finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Immediately after, I took out my collection of the LOTR, and started reading them again.I read my first Tolkien book when I was 10. It was called the Fellowship of the Ring. Ever since, I was hooked and became a fan. A few years later, I discovered the Silmarillion and read it. In fact, I dropped it after the first couple of pages, since it was dead boring and full of high elven names that frankly didn't stick to my head. What? Feanor son of what? Fingolfin? You get the idea. Unfortunately, my curiosity got the better of me, and I re-read the LOTR trilogy again. Straight off the bat, with the memory of Lorien, Rivendell, Moria still fresh in my mind, I started reading the SSilmarillion and this time, I enjoyed every single bit of it.What does this show? That this book is an excellent addition to The Hobbit and the LOTR and answers many questions that were left hanging in the mystical world, but, can hardly stand alone by itself. I highly recommend this only if you have read and enjoyed the LOTR."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"FYI: Yes I am a kid. This is no joke.Like many people have said Tolkien relates this story to the Bible, in many ways, particuarly in the beginning when he tells about the Valar and the Maia( both similar to angels) and how Melkor( Lucifer) falls into darkness therefore, being much like Satan, Iluvatar(God) never really does much but the Valar, are the main \\"Angels\\" or characters in this Genisis. Elves come, then Men, and then the Dwarves made my a Valar, named Aule, not Iluvatar. The Silmarillion isn't a book with many chapters so when you stop after a chapter you have much tension, it's a book of many stories.My favorite is Beren and Luthien about a Man and an Elf, wait, wait, this sounds like Aragorn and Arwen doesn't it? And doesn't Aragorn mention the word \\"Luthien\\" when he sings that song in the Fellowship of the Ring? Tolkien does a fabulous job with this in many books, of how he relates. Many stories aren't just love, but fierce battles more than you've ever heard of in any of Tolkien's books. Fights that many times, Good doesn't triumph over evil, some, are very touching.Melkor is THE true evil, Sauron is just a servant, YET, even in the Silmarillion Sauron is a threat, yes a large one to. Here you see all of the elves and their former glory, you see Dwarves defeat Dragons and Balrogs, you see the Easterlings betray the race of Men, yet one battle and almost everything falls...Also in the books you see how Orcs are created, mutated elves.I'm sorry I'm going much to far, if I talk any more, we'll be here all night.Tolkien is a fabulous author, one of the best of our time, and ever. EVER. His imaginations is so great that he puts these books in front of us, for our enjoyment,these books are so great even in the Return of the King it STILL leaves you hanging.What of the Fourth Age? What evil is left? How will men rule the world? There are still kings to reign! These books are magical in a sense, but then sadly you realize it never really happened.A fabulous accompianment to the trilogy and the Hobbit, a must buy, no matter what you dislike about anything realated to these books(ok maybe not, it's still a great book none the less!) A must buy for Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you've wandered onto this page, you've probably already read either the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings or both and are hungry for more. The Silmarillion will deliver that --- sort of.The Silmarillion is not a tale in the tradition of LOTR. It is a compilation of the historical stories Tolkien wrote as the background for that magnificent work. It fleshes out the details of the stories only hinted at in the poems and appendices of the Lord of the Rings. Here you will find out how Middle Earth was created, how the elves fell from grace, about the War of the Jewels between Morgoth -- to whom Sauron was but a servant -- and the sons of Feanor -- the fiercest and most powerful elf ever born. It even includes one appendix on Ahkallabeth -- the downfall of Numenor and one on the Rings of Power. You will be able to read all about the treachery of Sauron the Deceiver and his war with men and elves.HOWEVER --- the story is not told like LOTR. It's more like a history book. The characters mostly exist as historical figures. The first story especially -- Music of Ainur -- does not fare well in the leadoff spot.On the other hand, there are some stories that are simply amazing. The tale of Beren and Luthien Tinuviel is one of the most touching and epic love stories ever penned (Tolkein, in fact, had his wife's tombstone engraved to &quot;Tinuviel&quot;). The story of Turin Turambar is a heartbreaking Greek-style tragedy. The confrontation between Fingolfin and Morgoth is amazing. Reading the Similarilion is like reading a history book and finding an epic poem in the middle of it.If you, like me, read the appendices to LOTR in rapture, you'll love this book. Buy it in hardback and treasure every word. On the other hand, if you found those boring, then you should probably buy the paperback and flip foward to the best stories. Otherwise, you'll probably put it on your shelf, forget about it, and deprive yourself of some of the best stuff to ever come out of the golden pen of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about the rich history of Middle-earth. If you've ever wondered where the phrases and history talked about in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; come from and mean, then this is for you.At the same time, this is not an easy book to read. It can be slow and the number of places and names (many of them alternate names for names already mentioned), can have you spending most of your time flipping to the index in the back.But if you keep with it, you'll be rewarded with an expansive and amazing view of Middle-earth.&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is actually five stories in one.Ainulindale, the Music of the Ainur, deals with the creation of Middle-earth.Valaquenta, Account of the Valar, shows how the Gods and Godesses of Middle-earth came to be, including their brethren the Mair (of which Gandalf is a member). Valaquenta also lays the groundwork for the betrayal that Melkor would exact on his fellow Valar, forever after being called Morgoth (the first Dark Lord) by the Elves.The Quenta Silmarillion is the largest and most detailed of the stories. Herein lies the story of the beginning days, the coming of the Elves, the making of the Silmarils by Feanor, and their theft by Melkor. This sets off the major war of the Firs Age between the Elves and Melkor.Two more shorter stories are included at the end. Allakabeth, the downfall of Numenor, and Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age.After these are the genealogies of the House of Finwe, the descendants of Olwe and Elwe, the House of Beor, the House of Hador and the people of Haleth. A table showing the sundering of the Elves is also included, as are notes on pronunciation, an extensive (and extremely helpful) index of names, and finally, various elements of Quenya and Sindarin names.Combined, these stories and the indices at the end, provide a remarkable journey back in time, to the Elder days of Middle-earth. A must read. Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"When coming to the Silmarillion, do *not* expect it to turn out like Lord of the Rings 2. This book is very dense. I mean Bible-level dense. Unfamiliar names are abundant and the amount of dialogue is minimal. You'll need to pay attention to each line as the stories progress at a fierce pace.But the results are well worth it!The Silmarillion contains tales of love and oaths and loss and betrayal and great magic and sharp swords. It is full of tragedy and triumph and enthralling tales that rival greek myth in their scope and wonder.If you've read the Lord of the Rings appendix and enjoy the detail there, the Silmarillion is for you. But once again, look on these stories with an open mind and try not to think of the later works - as you'll only find yourself second-guessing the story and missing the joy of them. This work stands on its own as a masterpiece of modern writing."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"So, you've finished the Lord of the Rings and you're looking for more. Well have I got a treat for you: The Silmarillion. This is one of those books that you read for the beauty of the English language. The fact, for me anyway, that the story of the Quenta Silmarillion is wonderful is merely an added bonus. Just thinking of Beren and Luthien makes me want to pick this book up and read it again.I love the Lord of the Rings, but I love this book almost as much, so if you are a Tolkien fan, read the Silmarillion.But as a side note, if you are just getting started with Tolkien, make sure that you read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings first. Even though the Silmarillion is chronologically before Tolkien's other works, it requires someone with a true passion for Middle-Earth to appreciate this book. The best way to develop this passion is to read the trilogy first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Like most people, I have read The Hobbit and The LOTR several times. Last year, I finally decided to give The Silmarillion a go. I'm glad I did; it is actually a better book than either The Hobbit or LOTR. I'm just really glad I had the other books under my belt first.This is a difficult book to follow, and you will find yourself flipping back several times throughout. It is completely worth it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It is the prehistory of the Lord of the Rings. The majority, besides Akallabeth, takes place in the First Age of the world; the Lord of the Rings takes place in the Third Age. It details the awakening of the elves and the creation of men and dwarves. It talks of Feanor, one of the greatest elves of all, and his jewels he created which were known as the Silmarils of which Morgoth the Dark Lord wanted to possess for himself. It goes into the battles that Morgoth waged on elves and men to destroy them and rule the world and of the great heroes of men and elves that fell at the force of his horde.Also, it mentions heroes that slay great fire demons, known as balrogs, and save kingdoms in doing so and of a great and terrible dragon slain at the hands of perhaps the greatest warrior of man, Turin Turambar. The end battle, in which Morgoth is defeated isn't the end to the evil, as his greatest servant, Sauron, takes up the title of Dark Lord. It goes on to the Akallabeth, which tells of an island doomed by Sauron to fall into the ocean, becoming the Middle Earth equivalent of Atlantis. It then ends with a summary of the events that take place in the Third Age, the time of the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion gives the reader a more complete background of the world of The Lord of the Rings. It is more of a history and less of a story, but it is nevertheless excellent, although it may be considered heavy for some. This book tells of the creation of Middle Earth and the Undying West, and its early history. It begins in a time before the Elves, where the Valar ruled and the world was new. Evil was at its worst, Good was at its best.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about a great fantasy series. Each story leads to another, with a 3-dimentional quality that make the tales gripping and believable. Immediately, I found myself becoming endeared to characters. For the Tolkien fan, it is definitely an experience that is worth having."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In the Tolkien canon, \\"The Silmarillion\\" is the most highly contested of all his works. Constructed as a prehistoric history of the Universe, the book has the cultural significance of the Bible in Tolkien's universe. It is Tolkien's primary work, but it's also his most troublesome, in more ways than one. One thing you need to know. In Tolkien scholarship, there are two primary ways to refer to the \\"Silmarillion\\". One is the Silmarillion, the legendarium proper, and then the 1977 \\"Silmarillion\\", which may or may not be what Tolkien envisioned.\\"The Silmarillion\\" , the book Tolkien spent all of his adult life writing, was, sadly, incomplete when Tolkien died at the age of eighty one in 1973. Naturally, this begs the question why did it take him decades to write the book, and it still be unfinished after all that time? Well, to understand that, you need to understand two things: the scope of the project, and how Tolkien worked.The scope of the book was a complete imaginary history, a totally self-contained mythology, all written and developed for his home country, England (my home country as well). Imagine the Greek and Roman mythologies, all those myths and gods, developed by one man. Imagine Homer completely inventing all the gods for his stories. Imagine how hard that would be to come up with your own mythological traditions as such. No wonder Tolkien had such a hard time completing the work.Now, the scope (which is extremely ambitious for any artist) was compounded by how Tolkien worked. First, he was a philologist first and foremost, and so before the stories he invented languages. All of these languages (which would have taken a life-time to develop on their own) had their own history, and are so interlocked with the mythology that you cannot remove them. He developed the main body of legends around these languages. Many features of the central body of legends changed relatively little over the years, but he wrote different versions of them at different times and in different styles. Some of the legends were set in poetry, those in annalistic histories, others in condensed summaries, and others in the more traditional (at least, for modern readers) novel format. A lot of these writings are also unfinished, due to Tolkien's perfectionist tendencies. Christopher Tolkien said that for most of his father's writing there existed a stable tradition from which Tolkien worked from, but there was no such thing as a stable text for the primary legends.All this is tied to how Tolkien worked. C. S. Lewis famously stated that you did not influence Tolkien, you may as well as try to influence a bandersnatch. Tolkien would either take no notice of your criticism, or else he would start all over from the beginning. And so he did. A lot. Tolkien would reach a certain portion of the draft, be unsatisfied, and began the whole thing over again, while never reaching the end. Or Tolkien would have two copies of the same manuscript, one to be the fair copy and one to be working copy. Well, Tolkien would make conflicting revisions on both copies at separate times. How do you decide his final intent? Good question. These tendencies presented major problems from Christopher Tolkien when he prepared the 1977 \\"Silmarillion\\"Another problem with Tolkien's work also is that toward the end of his life, he began contemplating changing major features of the mythology that stretched back to the earliest versions. A lot of these changes had to do with cosmology, with the sun and moon, and changing Arda (the earth) from a flat-world to a round world. In the original mythology, and the 1977 version, Arda begins as a flat world but is made into a round world. Tolkien contemplated other major changes that would have totally changed much of the more distinguishable features of the mythology, stable features present from the very beginning. Consult \\"Myths Transformed\\" inMorgoth's Ring: The Later Silmarillion, Part One: The Legends of Aman (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 10), Vol. 10 of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH for more information.Then we have the problem ofThe Lord of the Rings. Tolkien was tantalizing close to some sort of final version of the work in the late 1930s (indeed, the 1937 version of the \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\" is the only complete version he ever made of the primary work and which is heavily used in the 1977 \\"The Silmarillion\\"). Then, due to publisher demand, Tolkien began working on his masterpiece for the next fourteen years, leaving the \\"Silmarillion\\" legendarium completely untouched for over a decade. When Tolkien picked up the \\"Silmarillion\\" again, he now had to account for LOTR and somehow incorporate that major work into the mythology. Tolkien did a lot of work on the legendarium after the completion of LOTR, but this work was plagued with uncertainty and contemplation of radical rewriting.And in the last years of his life, Tolkien also began moving away from strict narrative and began working extensively on theological matters, essays on Elvish culture and linguistics, and other matters not tied to the actual narrative of the main storyline.So when Tolkien died in 1973, he left his son Christopher in quite the predicament. Decades of writing, much if it unfinished, with a staggering palimpsest of manuscripts from which to draw from would be daunting to anyone. As literary executor, he had to come up with a publishable version of the work (as clearly that was his father's wishes, and Christopher was the man for the job, being most acquainted with the work). So, in four years, with the assistance of Guy Gavriel Kay, he cobbled together a self-contained narrative, largely compatible with the Hobbit cycle. Due to Tolkien's tendency to not finish drafts, some of the narrative in the last portion of the work had not been touched by Tolkien in literally decades (The Fall of Gondolin never got a complete version other than the 1916 Lost Tales storyThe Book of Lost Tales, Part Two (The History of Middle-Earth, Vol. 2)). Thingol and Melian presented thorny problems, especially the Girdle of Melian (her magical protection around Doriath). Christopher and Kay constructed the chapter dealing with the ruin of Doriath from scratch, with no corresponding writing in Tolkien's own work.Yet another major issue was, due to getting a version of the book published as soon as possible, Christopher rushed through much of material, and did not have access to all of his father's manuscripts, some of which had been sold off. While he always used post LOTR material as often as possible, Christopher was as many times incorrect as not when guessing his father's intentions for the work. In the ensuing twelve volumes of THE HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH, where he had years to get to know the manuscripts, Christopher examines more closely his father's works, and there is much in those twelve volumes that were Tolkien's final intention for the work, but did not make it into the published version. Christopher has stated, given time, he may have produced a much different version than the one published. But he is now retired and will not revise the book (much of which would have to be wholesale).That's quite a bit of history, and ultimately all that history may bog potential readers down in their journey into \\"The Silmarillion\\". For all of its imperfections, its unfinished nature, the endless debates on how much the 1977 version is what Tolkien really intended, the book is powerful mythology. The reading is dry, and the names are jawcracking trying to pronounce. While it's hard to keep track of the multitude of characters and all the permutations and migrations of the three main Elven tribes, there are unforgettable images in the book, and beautiful passages of despair and hope.While the work is not the most accessible for modern readers, for those who persist you can see why Tolkien really did regard this as his life work, or, as Tom Shippey says inJ.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century, \\"the work of his heart\\". And what a mighty work it is, despite its unfinished nature.----------------------------------------Back in the 1990s I wrote another review of \\"The Silmarillion\\", and including that as bonus content. 9-10-2012\\"***** Tolkien's Bible\\" Hark now to The Silmarillion, the Bible of Tolkien's fantasy world. This is not a work to be taken lightly, for here we at last uncover the great truths of Middle-earth, and hear of its creation.The Silmarillion, simply put, is a tragic book, beautiful, with one flaw that nearly kills it. It was unfinished. We do not know (or ever will) how much different it would have been if Tolkien live to complete his greatest work. Christopher his son has done as well as can be expected, but there are quite a few style shifts betraying his pen instead of his father's. This is to be read with such seriousness as The Illiad or The Odysse. It is a mythological work that should be studied. This is not for a conventional reader, this is for the serious student. Without the knowledge his other two novels (for Lord of the Rings is one novel, not a trilogy) The L. R. and The Hobbit, The Silmarillion is not near as rewarding as it would otherwise be. The Hobbit is for children, The Lord of the Rings is for adults, and The Silmarillion is for students of this great work. All students interested in literature should read this, flawed as it is because of the mortality of man.It also shows how strong Tolkien believed in God. His world was very much a Christian world, set up in the likeness of God. God is never mentioned in the L. R., but as I remember he is in The Silmarillion. You see him with the Ainur create the world. Truly, this is a master of fantasy, and a great Christian man."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It's more than slightly staggering to consider: the epic fantasy \\"Lord of the Rings\\" to be the tail end of Tolkien's invented history. The \\"Bible\\" of Middle-Earth, the \\"Silmarillion\\" stretches from the beginning of time to the departure of the Elves from Middle-Earth.A complete summary is impossible, because the book spans millennia and has one earth-shattering event after another. But it includes the creation of Tolkien's invented pantheons of angelic beings under Eru Iluvatar, also known as God; how they sang the world into being; the creation of Elves, Men, and Dwarves (hobbits are, I think, not really covered); the legendary love story of Beren and Luthien, a mortal Man and an Elf maiden who gives up her immortality for the man she loves; the demonic Morgoth and Sauron; Elves of just about any kind -- bad, mad, dangerous, good, sweet, brave, and so forth; the creation of the many Rings of Power -- and the One Ring of Sauron; the Two Trees that made the sun and moon; and finally the quest of the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins.Many old favorites will pop up over the course of the book, such as Elrond, Galadriel, Gandalf, and so on. Fans of Elves will find plenty to feed their hunger; fans of Hobbits or Dwarves will not find as much here. It will also answer some questions that \\"Hobbit\\" and LOTR may raise, when references to long-ago incidents and people are made -- what is Numenor? Who are the Valar? This includes those things, and much more.The writing style of Silmarillion is more akin to the Eddas, the Bible, or the Mabinogian than to \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" It's more formal and archaic in tone; Tolkien did not get as \\"into\\" the heads of his characters in Silmarillion as he did in LOTR, and there is no central character. Needless to say, this is necessary as a more in-depth approach would have taken centuries to write, let alone perfect. If readers can bypass the automatic dislike of more formal prose, they will find enchanting stories and a less evocative but very intriguing writing style. This style strongly leans on the Eddas, collections of story and song that were unearthed and translated long ago. Though obviously not as well-known as LOTR, it is clear that these collections helped influence the Silmarillion.It's clear to see, while reading this, the extent of Tolkien's passion for his invented history. Someone who had a lack of enthusiasm could not have spent much of his adult life writing, revising, and polishing a history that never was. It's also almost frighteningly imaginative and real: It isn't too hard to imagine that these things could actually have happened. In a genre clogged with shallow sword'n'sorcery, Tolkien's coherent, carefully-written backstory is truly unique.If you can take the formal prose and mythical style, this is a treasure, and a must-read for anyone who loved LOTR or \\"Hobbit.\\" Only after reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" can readers truly appreciate Tolkien's literary accomplishments, and the full scope of the Middle-Earth that is glimpsed in his more famous books."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is perhaps the most unique and difficult-to-explain book I have read. It is among the books I love the most, but this might not be the case if I had not read it in a bizarre way that I can hardly recommend to anyone else, and yet may be the best way to read it. For ten or twelve years I skimmed through &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; &quot;The Hobbit,&quot; &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; and many of Tolkien's posthumous books (many of which present the stories of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in different forms which Tolkien wrote at various times in his life) without reading the books verbatim. Only in the last twelve months have I read these books all the way through.This was a wise way of approaching Tolkien's most famous works because of the odd nature of &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; which must be understood by anyone desiring to enjoy it. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is not a &quot;novel,&quot; as are &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (Tolkien preferred the word &quot;romance&quot; to &quot;novel&quot; for LotR). &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is well described by the subtitle on the front of the jacket of the Ted Nasmith-illustrated edition: &quot;The Myths and Legends of Middle-earth&quot;. &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is the equivalent, for the imaginary world in which &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; take place, of a work like Hamilton's or Bulfinch's &quot;Mythology&quot;. It does not tell one single story; rather it tells many stories in a briefer form, almost as though the stories are being synopsized rather than told. In a real sense &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; is a greater work than even &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; could ever be, since it contains not one but several stories with as much power and grandeur as that of LotR.However, much of the book is written in the style of a tome of history, setting out the vast historical framework within which these unforgettable stories unfold, and thus seems dry and soporific to many readers. Moreover, large numbers of characters, often with similar names (seven important Elven characters have names starting with F, and six of them start with the letters &quot;Fin&quot;), are presented without space for them to be strongly characterized, so that the reader may be unable to become as engaged with them as with Frodo, Sam or Gandalf. This is where my bizarre manner of reading the book came in handy: I became familiar with all the characters over my years of skimming, and knew precisely who they were and how they were connected to each other when I finally read the whole book. Moreover, since I had often skimmed &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; before reading &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; I could appreciate the many references back to the former work in the latter. Although &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; was not published until many years after LotR, Tolkien had written all the stories that make up &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; before writing LotR. Many of LotR's references to past events, which contribute greatly to the impression it gives of taking place in a real world, are references to events told in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. (No Hobbits appear or are mentioned in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; until the last three pages of the book, when the events of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; are briefly described at the end of a section that explains how the events of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; ultimately led to the events of those books.)In my opinion, the creation myth with which &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; opens is one of the most intellectually and emotionally satisfying creation stories I have ever read; the chapter &quot;Of Turin Turambar&quot; presents a heroic tragedy comparable in grandeur to a Wagner opera and in depth and power of sorrow to a tragic opera such as &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; or &quot;Tosca&quot;; and the chapter &quot;Of Beren and Luthien&quot; presents Tolkien's very best story of all, perhaps the most unforgettable tale of love and adventure written in the twentieth century. But for readers to appreciate these treasures, they must be aware in advance of the unusual nature of &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and not expect a fantasy adventure novel, a mere &quot;prequel&quot; to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. These are the stories that are told in Frodo's world; they are to Frodo, Sam and Strider what &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is to us: a saga of a vanished world of heartbreaking beauty, glimmers of which we can still see if we look hard enough.(Some of Ted Nasmith's illustrations are better than others. The image of Luthien dancing in the wood is one of the best Tolkien-inspired paintings I've ever seen, especially since it leaves the ineffable beauty of Luthien's face to our imaginations. On the other hand, Galadriel's brother Finrod is not depicted as nearly good-looking enough in the painting of him singing by the campfire of the first Men to come into Beleriand.)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If like me you consider the Lord of the Rings (LOTR) one of the greatest books written in human history, then The Silmarillion is a must for you. LOTR can be read as a self-contained package, thanks to the detailed Notes that Tolkien painstakingly provides, but it still leaves many unanswered questions. After all, LOTR covers the 3rd Age of Middle Earth, telling us very little about the previous two ages. And it is full of tantalizing references to the past glories of Numenor, the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, the origins of the elves, dwarves and men, the various Lays and so on.The Silmarillion is, if anything, on an even larger scale. Its chronology starts at the Creation of the Universe and builds to the events of the climactic Third Age that are described in LOTR. If LOTR is awesome, the Silmarillion is stupendous. A proper order would be to read the Silmarillion, followed by The Hobbit and then LOTR. But even reading them out of order (as most readers would have) is rewarding.The Silmarillion starts at the very beginning with the story of the creation of the Universe, (a fascinating tale in itself) and then lays the ground for the various players on this vast stage. It is in fact 5 separate books. First comes the Ainulindale which is the story of the creation of Tolkien's Universe - a veritable Genesis and Fall if you will. Then comes the Valaquenta, the tale of the Valar or Guardians. Third in the chronology is the Quenta Silmarillion itself - the tale of the Silmarilli. Fourth comes the Akallabeth, the tale of the rise and fall of the Men of Numenor in the First Age. And almost as a footnote, the fifth and last book, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age. Bear in mind that this is in fact a compilation by Christopher Tolkien from his father's papers so expect some discontinuities.The fabled jewels or Silmarilli give the book its name and are the thread that binds the various tales of the book together. Tolkien tells of the emergence of life on earth, the rebellion of some of the elves and their departure for Middle Earth, their efforts to build a new life for themselves in the teeth of the oppression and tyranny of Morgoth and his servants (like Sauron), the origin of the distrust between dwarves and elves, the creation of orcs as twisted copies of the elves, of the much debated \\"gift\\" of mortality to men. It is the tale of humanity all over again, of people striving in the face of difficulties to make a new life.The tales themselves are fascinating as Tolkien tells of love and war, of courage and treachery, of nobility and baseness. There are great battles and mighty warriors, bewitching romances and spellbinding intrigues, great victories and grinding defeats.And of course the lyrical prose: Tolkien is one of the very few writers whose very prose reads like poetry. The ring and cadence of names, the melody inherent in the lyrics of his songs: this is fine writing at its peak. A wonderful book, not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"As the reviews on this page show, this book is not from everyone. Indeed, it's not even for all Tolkien fans. If, however, you were hypnotized by the tantalizing references to the lost past that are scattered throughout The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, you will probably enjoy this. (By the way, people who stopped after twenty pages quit just before the story got exponentially better. Oh well, their loss.)I was completely amazed when I read The Silmarillion. I was completely captivated by the story of the Noldor and their deeds in Beleriand. The story is written in truly masterful style, and even (primarily) without dialogue, the richness of the story grips the reader and immerses him in the Elder Days and the great War of the Jewels. The images of the story are powerful and will stay with the dedicated reader forever. I can still vividly picture Fingolfin doing battle with Morgoth, Yavanna crying over the ruin of the Trees, Beren in Thingol's hall, as well as Mablung sorowfully wandering the shores of the sea; and most of all I can see Feanor and his sons swearing their oath by torchlight in the court of Tirion.Just a word on the content: this is not happy stuff. The world of LotR contained an aura of lost greatness and the certain knowledge that the world was in slow but irreversible decline. This story has that aura in spades, in addition to the fact that the reader gets to see the fall from greatness firsthand. The terrible sadness of the whole story and the tragedy of Tolkien's irreparably marred world is enough to make even the most dry-eyed (and I count myself as one of these) break down. (I cried at least four times during my last reading of The Silmarillion, which is perhaps the highest praise that I can possibly give it.)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Hark now to The Silmarillion, the Bible of Tolkien's fantasy world.

Truly, this is a master of fantasy, and a great Christian man."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Every culture from the ancient world through the middle ages seems to have produced one or two works of mythology that represent the pinnacle of that culture's creative character. The Finnish have the Kalevala, the Celts of Britain have the Mabinogion, the Greeks have their Olympian Gods and so forth. But the modern world doesn't seem to produce any truly definitive mythology. Or does it? It's just possible that Tolkien has produced in the Silmarillion, a work that will be to modern english what Beowulf was to Old English.A warning to newcomers - this book is NOT a novel, and if you approach it with the same expectations you have for a novel you will be disappointed. That would be a great tragedy since you will miss some of the best mythology ever written.The Silmarillion is more of a history text than a story. It begins when Illuvatar (the elven name for God) creates the world and proceeds through time to the birth of the elves and humans and recounts the history of the first age of Middle-Earth. The elves, being immortal, don't care about time so much as men do and therefore don't count the years so diligently. Nevertheless, they apparently DID think to keep track of the years during their great war. That time spans slightly less than 6 hundred years. We have no idea how much time passed before that.A brief summary - God sends 15 of his most powerful angels (The Valar) to take care of the world. One of them, Melkor, (a very obvious parallel to Satan) goes bad and is renamed Morgoth. The Valar make war on Morgoth and imprison him and everything seems well in the world. Sometime later, Elves appear. The Valar decide it would be a good idea to invite the elves to live with them on the western continent. A large portion of the elves decide to accept this invitation and depart from Middle-Earth to go live in the west with the Valar. Due to their proximity with the Valar, the high elves grow very powerful, skillful and wise. Their greatest smith, Feanor, creates three fabulous jewels, the silmarils, which have managed to capture the light emanating from 2 sacred trees that provide all the light in the west. Sometime later, Morgoth's sentence is served and he is released, in the hopes that he has been rehabilitated. Of course, if he were rehabilitated, it would be a very short, rather boring tale. He immediately destroys the two trees and then steals the silmarils and beats a hasty getaway back to middle-earth where a large army of things that go bump in the night have been secretly awaiting his return. Feanor's people in a fit of rage swear a terrible oath of vengeance and chase after Morgoth with swords in hand, killing anyone that may stand between them and their precious jewels - including other elves. The silmarillion is the story of this great war between the elves and Morgoth, and how through their pride, the high elves of Feanor's line committed themselves, as well as men, dwarves, and the elves who never left middle-earth, to a tragic fate without hope of victory.Over the course of this war, there are a great number of heroic deeds and quests, several of which could have been expanded into novels the size of the Lord of the Rings. The tale of Turin Turambar is a tragedy that dwarfs Hamlet. The story of Beren and Luthien is a romance that makes Pyramus and Thisbe look like a sit-com. The Voyage of Earendil compares favorably to the Odyssey (well OK, that one is a stretch...)But the Silmarillion is much more than a simple collection of fables in a common setting. In spite of the fact that it spans 4 generations of elves and probably a dozen generations of men, it is in fact one cohesive story. All of the events, even if they don't have any direct connection to the war for the jewels are somehow linked to the tragic oath that the high elves swore. And so the fates of all of the characters are somehow tied up in the fate of the jewels.There is only one other work I can think of off the top of my head that can really be compared to the Silmarillion in terms of it's scope and structure. Sir Thomas Mallory's Le Morte D'Arthur similarly has an enormous cast of characters who span several generations, many of whom do great deeds worthy of their own stories, yet all are linked by a common storyline underlying everything.If you have ever read (and enjoyed) Le Morte D'Arthur, then chances are you will love the Silmarillion. Serious fans of the Lord of the Rings should also read the Silmarillion, as it will shed serious light on many aspects of the Lord of the Rings. In particular, the significance of certain important elves in the second and third ages (Galadriel, Elrond, Gil-Galad and Cirdan) will be made abundantly clear. The meaning behind the Grey Havens and this habitual sailing into the west that the elves do will be revealed. And the importance of Aragorn's lineage, and the origin of the dunedain will be given some context. Also, little details like Galadriel's Phial will have much more depth when you realize where it's illumination comes from. And also, the Lord of the Rings is just so much more FUN after reading the Silmarillion. All those snippets of poetry and references to the &quot;good old days&quot; that Aragorn and the elves keep referring to will have a context for you. You'll also understand why the Nazgul fear water and the name of Elbereth has power."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Most Tolkien fans read The Hobbit first, followed by The Lord of the Rings. The more intrepid readers give The Silmarillion a go, and they must be glad they did. I was no exception. The biggest reward for Tolkien fans will come with reading The Silmarillion, Tolkien's great mythological work which charts the rise and fall of Middle Earth, from the creation, to after the events told in The Lord of The Rings. I can't recommend it enough. I don't consider myself a true Tolkien afficianado or a true fan of the fantasy genre. However, The Silmarillion is one of the finest books ever written and a magnificent and precious achievement. It is frightening to think how one man could conceive of such a vast, complex, fascinating and - ultimately - believable mythology. The word epic is over used, but in relation to The Silmarillion it is entirely justified. The quality of the writing is first class, the characterisation exquisite, but Tolkien's real genius lies in his ability to conjure up strange worlds, strange creatures and strange events which resonate in the reader's imagination and renders them totally convincing. By the end I was overwhelmed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For those of you who adore the great narrative of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, or the charm and vigor of THE HOBBIT, you owe it to yourself to at least attempt to read THE SILMARILLION. Tolkien spent most of his life writing and rewriting the tales that comprise the full story of the First Age of Middle-Earth. Although he sadly died before completing the work, enough remained for his son to edit THE SILMARILLION into publishable form. Although it shot to the top of the bestseller lists when it was first published in the 1970s, it is certainly the least read of all Tolkien's works. The book - which is nothing less than an entire cosmology and myth cycle covering the creation of the world, the religion of Middle-Earth (oh yes, there is one), and its history during the thousands of years which elapsed before (and led up to) the War of the Rings - was perhaps not meant to be popular. As so many other reviewers have noted, the language of THE SILMARILLION is quite archaic (deliberately so) and hard to grasp. Recall that Tolkien spent decades creating the languages of Middle-Earth long before the LORD OF THE RINGS took shape in his mind, and you will understand what this book is and how it is supposed to be read. Like the Greek world's ILLIAD and ODYSSEY, (or even the Bible) THE SILMARILLION is meant to read like a collection of myths so ancient that centuries elapsed before they were written down, not like a novel in which we travel as narrators. Indeed, THE SILMARILLION sounds much better read aloud or even chanted, than consulted in silence. The subject of the book is the War between the great leaders of the Elves - assisted by some of the first men - against the Great Dark Lord, Morgoth (Sauron's \\"boss\\") for possession of the Jewels made by the Elves in their pride and stolen by Morgoth from the land of the gods. Although the haughty language of the book may discourage the casual reader, once you allow yourself to get caught up in the story, you will be riveted. THE SILMARILLION is ultimately concerned with the same theme as RINGS - the corruption that inevitably comes from power and the inability of thinking beings to let go of pride and materialism. From the earliest portion of the book, it is obvious that Morgoth cannot be defeated, and that the Elves allowed their immortality and their long residence in the land of the gods - Valinor - to lead them into temptation. For those of you who wondered why the Elves - who seem so powerful in Tolkien's other works - were so reluctant to involve themselves directly in the War of the Ring, the litany of their mistakes and miscalculations contained in THE SILMARILLION will answer your questions. The book is not a hopeful one - although it contains much beauty among its tales of grief. Time and time again, the lust for power and rigid adherence to ill-chosen oaths destroys one mighty lord (and a few ladies) after another. The individual tales are all tragic, and only grow more so as the reader comes to realize that the bulk of the miserable events that take place could have been avoided. The Elves, who to the human reader seem to have so many advantages (like eternal life and youth), are fatally flawed by their own hubris, which leads them to think that they can defeat the Dark Lord. Although much good comes from their attempt to do so, much of the evil that winds up besetting Middle-Earth in Tolkien's other works can be laid at the door of the Elves. The fact that none of the characters in the book intend to do evil makes the story all the more heartbreaking. If you can handle the language, THE SILMARILLION is a profound tale of struggle and a great series of adventures that will break your heart, for even as you hope that good will triumph, it is not to be."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Ahh, Tolkien, Lord of Fantasy and Creator of worlds! After reading the Lord of the Rings, I found myself seeking more writing by the master of fantasy, J.R.R Tolkien. That's how I came across the Silmarillion. I admit that Tolkien's style may not appeal to many (I personally love the way that he writes); it's too dry or too hard.... Tolkien starts of retelling the Story of Creation (or rather, just before Creation). The depth came be a bit hard to grasp, because the beginning of the book is basically retelling Genesis in Tolkien style. The first few hundred pages is a snore if you don't like fantasy, but I swear that as soon as the Elves make it to the domain of the Lords of the West, the whole tale really picks up. It's important to keep in mind that the Elves are immortal, and many of them reoccur in several places later in the book. Keep track of the events, and you'll be sure to pick up everything that happens in the story. There is one thing that I have to remind you of, though: YOU CANNOT SKIP OVER ANYTHING IN THE BOOK! If you do, you'll definately be lost very quickly. If you tried Tolkien over and over again and still don't like it, then I suggest the following authors/books to you as a fantasy fan: Robert Jordan--The Wheel of Time, Melaine Rawn--The Dragon Star &amp; the Dragon Prince, Dennis McKiernan--The Iron Tower Trilogy, George R.R. Martin--A Song of Fire and Ice. Also, pick up any of the older classics, like the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Just because you didn't like Tolkien doesn't mean that you have to give up on fantasy all together!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings and doesn't understand anything that's going on. For anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings, or seen the movies, and wondered who and what Sauron is, how orcs came from elves, or even if you still don't understand the Rings, this is the book for you.But let me just start off saying that this does not read like a novel, just to warn you. I thought it was interesting, because it reads much like The Bible. It covers vast amounts of time in the course of a few short pages or even paragraphs, and the dialogue is very minimal.It's interesting how Tolkein starts at the very beginning of time and explains how Iluvitar (God) created the earth and the Valar (sort of like angels)and how Melkor (The Devil) rebelled and became the Dark Lord.Most of the information in the book was interesting to learn if you didn't know it otherwise, but the reason I only gave it four stars was because toward the end, you just get a barrage of endless names and events that I didn't care about that much.Before you read it, I would advise that you read the letter that Tolkien wrote. He sets it up better and explains a lot of the reasons he put the things in Middle Earth's history that he did. Did you know that as far as the geography goes, Middle Earth is actually supposed to be England thousands of years B.C.?"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion has gained notoriety for its dense, difficult style and huge profusion of names. This reputation has, no doubt, driven away many who would otherwise have tried to read this magnificent work.In contrast to these people, I would just like to say that most of these complaints must be by younger readers of Lord of the Rings. I really believe that the complaints are seriously exaggerated. Any adult should have no problems with this book. It is fairly short, too.I really believe that the Silmarillion is by far Tolkien's greatest work. I don't really like Lord of the Rings that much, to tell the truth. But Silmarillion, with Tolkien's daydreams written down over a period of sixty years, is unforgettable, brilliant and beautiful.In short, it is not as hard to read as people tend to claim. Indeed, it is brilliant and fast-moving.Jonathan"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"For the obsessed Tolkien fan (like myself), this book is a revelation. In epic language occasionally reminiscent of the King James Bible, it describes all those events of the First Age which are alluded to in _The Lord of the Rings_. I particularly enjoyed the full story of Beren and Luthien.For all the book's strengths, some readers will be put off by the epic style (which only appears intermittently in LOTR). It reads more like mythology than a novel at times. It is not &quot;cute,&quot; like _The Hobbit_. It's not for everyone, but if you love the grander aspects of Middle-earth, I think you'll enjoy it.By the way, (according to Carpenter's biography), this group of stories was always Tolkien's central artistic project. _The Hobbit_ and _LOTR_ were both accidental offshoots. They were not published during Tolkien's lifetime because he was a perfectionist and never felt they were quite ready for publication."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is my favorite of the Tolkien books. I must agree with the person below who said it explains what the characteristics of Middle-Earth and Valinor were. I completely disagree with the rather misguided reader who gave the Silmarillion two stars. He or she evidently &quot;skipped over&quot; The Lord of the Rings, going directly from the Hobbit to the Silmarillion. The reader compared the two saying that he &quot;loved the Hobbit&quot;, but that the Silmarillion was &quot;boring&quot;, with &quot;too many names to remember. This is not anything like the Hobbit, which was almost for children. It is a serious document which almost might be an Iliad-like description of an ancient civilization's comflicts. I might forgive this person if they were a child, but even then, he should read The Lord of the Rings first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This was the FIRST Tolkien book I bought. At first I found difficult to remember all the different names (even to the same people: Elves, First-born, Eldar, Eldalie, etc...) but soon I reached a point I felt like a smash deep in my soul and my mind. I couldn't stop. I finished. I started again (now understanding everything) and was even better! This is a book full of deeply moving stories told in an epic language, like the Homeric Poems, so overwhelming that my imagination kept running for weeks! When I bought Lord of the Rings I was very dissapointed with the childish tone of the First Book. I didn't care about the hobbits. Happily &quot;The Return of the King&quot; shows a more epic tone, like The Silmarillion, making at last The Lord of the Rings enjoyable for me.If you like simpler, lighter stories you won't enjoy this book. For the rest, it could be still hard at times, but the whole experience IS rewarding, and with the time it grows endlessly."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you liked the lord of the rings, and are like me meaning you could have used a little less of the hobbits and more of the other races, than this book is one you should read. The main positive point is the high drama and creation of a world that is the version that I kind of wish actually happened. There ar some points that don't make a whole lot of sense, but these are explained in the history of middle earth series with GREAT DETAIL. Yet everything that happens in this book that Christopher Tolkien says his father said would not have been possible in the evolution of a planet, I can come up with many reasons that it does work. It is sad that Tolkien started the lord so late in life, and then when he did start it, it took him like 10 years, and he was bogged down with teaching classes grading papers, and MANY other things. His main problem was he kept on revising the lord and the appendices over and over again and never had the time to complete the silmarillion. When he did go back to it he just kept on giving up every 5 years or so because he thought there was no possible way to completely link them together. This decision to not finish it in my opinion was a good and bad decision. For one, he was not money hungry whatsoever, so didn't need to push the book out as soon as possible, rather he kept on working on it trying to get it perfect. I respect him for that but if he could have gotten over his own problem on say the trees and only a couple of other things, just like he left a couple things alone in the hobbit then he would ahve been able to publish this undrr his own name. The book would most likely have come out in two parts and would have been close to twice as long as this version. It is very sad that we did not get the right version of this, but Christopher Tolkien certainly made up for this all he could in the history of mid earth series. And I am certainly very glad that I have finally gotten to read this.By the way this is a really good prequel to the lord, so I know this is unlikely, but you really should read this before the lord, at least that was what tolkien wanted to do, but because they would have had to release at least five books instead of three, money was the factor, so now that you have a chance to read this first, go ahead and experience turin turumbar, beren and luthien, and pick up the history books to get the real version of the fall of gondolin, the hidden city. I have to get back to work now so you don't have to read any more of this."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is a great and difficult classic. I confess to having failed to read it through on my first two attempts. I suceeded upon the third attempt and am glad I did. The best approach to this challenging work is through an audio book since Tolkien's prose in the Silmarillion follows the form and meter of stories told in an oral tradition. Words and phrases that may seem long and difficult upon the written page come alive when read aloud and you'll find an exciting eloquence to the work that you may have missed when reading it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is J.R.R. Tolkein's TRUE life work. He spent over 30 years working on it before he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is an epic work, spanning over 7,000 Years of the Sun (divided into three Ages), plus several millenia (we don't know for sure how many) before that. It covers the entire history of Middle-Earth from the creation of the world all the way through Frodo Baggins and the destruction of the Ring. However, the majority of the book is concerned with the history of the First Age (LOTR takes place at the end of the Third Age). The First Age is the time of the glory years of the Elves in Middle-Earth, with a secondary role played by Men. The Elves are struggling to free Middle-Earth from the dark rule of the Great Enemy, Morgoth, and his servant Sauron. There is also a section near the end of the book concerning the great race of men known as the Numenoreans, their history, and their eventual fall.The Silmarillion is not a single full-length story. Instead, it is a collection of many smaller works into one volume (not unlike the Bible). As such, the narrative is a little difficult to follow, and there are gaps in time where nothing significant is going on in the world. However, LOTR makes many references to the material contained in this book. I read this after LOTR, and I was interested in learning more about Gondolin, Luthien, Beren, Morgoth, and many other people and places mentioned in LOTR.As I mentioned above, this book is mainly about Elves. If you liked the Elves in LOTR, then you will love this book. You learn the origins of the Elves, and why they are all sailing away from Middle-Earth to the West. You also learn more about Galadriel, the Lady of Lothlorien who figures prominently in LOTR.If you didn't like LOTR, or if you only liked it a little bit, then this book is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you fell in love with LOTR, and if you are intrigued by the backstory references, including the many elvish songs therein, or even if you are just a fan of truly great literature, then this book is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Silmarillion is the least read of all of the Middle Earth books, and for a reason. First of all, the book's format is not easily digested. In a true canonic tradition, Silmarillion does away with many years in a single sentence. I would advise taking notes. Likewise, there are far too many names in order for the reader to remember them, and, however realistic it might be, I can never recall the similar names of many of the elfin heroes. On a final note, and this is where many of you will object to what I say, Silmarillion is an overview of a CLASSIC fantasy world - i.e. if the reader is familiar with fantasy, he will find little originality in the basics of this otherwise groundbreaking piece of work."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is an incredibly intruiging book, although you can't be hesitant in the beginning. It starts off as very incredibly hard to understand, and I had to read it various times to really apprieciate the story.This book attempts to uncover the myseries of the creation of the world that we have grown to know and love. It starts from the very beginning, with the creation of Arda, the world where middle earth exists.It tells the story of the gods, of the elves, of the men . . . and of a world so unlike our own that you don't want to leave. It also makes the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit so much more enjoyable, taking away the mysterious aspects, and shedding light on the questions that we used to ponder.The releasing of the Simlarilion was a very risky move for Christopher Tolkien, especially so close after the release of the Lord of the Rings, I guess because one of the most appealing aspects of the Rings is it's in depth history. Either way, I found it both helpful and enlightening.I strongly recommend this book to all Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is an amazing read to anyone who considers themselves a fan of Middle Earth mythology. Its breathtaking creation story is without compare in fantasy fiction, achieving the exact effect Tolkien intended of being a text that seems like an ancient history handed down through centuries of oral and written tradition. Tolkien fearlessly shows his audience the creation of the heavens and the earth, the origins of evil, and the ancient battles that set the stage for his later Lord of the Rings tales. Even though this isn't the whimsical yet dangerous frolic of The Hobbit or the world-saving epic journey of the Rings trilogy, fans should still be fascinated by the scope of Tolkien's imagination. He boldly starts at the very beginning of everything, then details the rise of the world and all life, the key conflicts that established the world's opposing forces, and the valiant quest for the Silmarils. This book is not recommended for casual fans of the Lord of the Rings movies, but for readers genuinely interested in Tolkien's unrivaled contributions to fantasy literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm sure almost all of you have read J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"The Hobbit\\". I'm willing to bet most of you have not read Tolkien's true masterpiece, \\"The Silmarillion\\". Have any of you ever wondered what Middle Earth was like thousands of years before Bilbo Baggins ever left the Shire? Before Isildur cut off Sauron's finger? Before Sauron was even in charge of all evil, when he was just second-hand-man to a much more sinister evil? I bet you didn't even know that Sauron wasn't always the big-bad-guy. \\"The Silmarillion\\" answers all these questions and more.This book answers so many questions that I don't even know where to begin. It is the history of the Elves in the First Age of Middle Earth. Have you ever wondered why the Elves sail away from Middle Earth into the western seas? If you read \\"The Silmarillion\\", you will find the answer. The origins of Elves and Men are revealed in this epic novel. If you are curious about what was up in Middle Earth during the Age of the Elves, this is the book to read. If you ever wondered about the Atlantis-like empire of N&uacute;menor, that story is also in the book. Read \\"The Silmarillion\\", and the stories of Middle Earth will become much clearer.Not only does this unforgettable story answer many questions, its plot is paced like lightning. Reading \\"The Silmarillion\\" is not recommended for those with high risk of heart disease. Every single letter in the book reeks of heart-stopping action! The book is filled to the brim with charecters so fantastically described that they seem so real that it's like you're watching a surround sound 3-D movie! Charecters like Manw, lord of the Valar, Fanor, greatest craftsman of the Elves and oldest son of Finw, King of the house of Elves known as the Noldor, Fingolfin, second son of Finw, greatest warrior of the Noldor, Beren and L&uacute;thien, the Romeo and Juliet of Middle earth with Beren being a mortal man and L&uacute;thien being Princess of the Sindarin Elves, and, among the cast of villains, Gothmog, lord of Balrogs, Sauron the terrible, Ungoliant the spider, mother of Shelob, and Morgoth, the Dark foe of the World. The tales of epic battles, heroic quests, and forbiden love are enough to give anyone a heart attack!Another reason to read this fantastic story is that the book has life lessons. The battle between good and evil is the ever present main plot. It reminds you that said battle is a never ending war, no matter how long the cease fire lasts. Just as in the Lord of the Rings, there is no such thing as despair. There is always hope; it isn't over until the fat lady sings. The ever-present sub-plot is nothing, and I mean nothing is ever as it seems.This fast paced, ever changing epic is way better than most books you have ever read, all of them excluding Tolkien's other works. If I were to recommend it to any particular age group, I would say twelve and up."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tells the history of middle earth prior to the popular tolkien series.

However, I think this is a worthwhile read for anyone really interested in Middle-earth, if only to get the background history to LOTR. It's fascinating and quite informative, but don't attempt unless you really, really want to know the info in it. Or like Elves. There are WAY too many Elves. I have to say I kept wishing a couple of hobbits would turn up to make it interesting..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Lord of the Rings was so wonderful. The Silmarillion has a completely different kind of beauty. It reads more like an old tale of history (like Herodotus without all of the digressions), and it is steeped in the unique magic of Middle-earth. If you ever feel a longing for days that will never return, The Silmarillion is for you. It satisfies that feeling for a while, yet it sharpens the longing all the more."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Three things one should say about this book:1) It is really only for the die-hard Tolkien fans. It's long, complicated, intricate, and written more like a historical/mythical geneology, than a novel. There are many people who manage to get through The Lord of the Rings, but not this book, which is written in a very different style.2), However, if your are one of those diehards-like myself-you'll love it.3) The illustrated edition by Tolkien artist Ted Nasmith, is probably the best edition to get.It is divided into 4 sections.1) The Creation of Arda-(ie the world)-being the time before the \\"First Age\\";2) The \\"Quenta Silmarillion\\"- which is essesntially the \\"First Age\\" of \\"Middle Earth\\";3) The \\"Second Age\\" including the \\"Alkallabeth\\"-whhich is the Downfall Of Numenor and4) \\"Of the Rings of Power and The Third Age\\" (ie a background to the Lord of the Rings).It is really a prequel to the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, upon which much of their material is based. Viewers of the recent \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies will learn more about Balrogs, for example and their origins, wizards, orcs, the seeing stones, and Sauron's original master-Melkor of the Valar-the Ainu, or \\"Gods\\" to men. Elrond, and his ancestors, where Gandalf comes from, the origin of dwarves, elves, men and others, are all there.4 of the main stories include:1) the ancient elvish race of the Noldor, attempting to get back their Silmarils-beautiful light giving gems-from Melkor who stole them,2)the tale of Beren and Luthien who fall in love and get back one of these Silmarils, and3) the tale of Turin Turumbar who destroys the first and mightiest dragon, but is also caught in the corruption and doom of the Noldor, who become accursed in their greed to retain the Silmarils.4) Another major story is the Alkallabeth which describes the origin of Aragorn's race in Middle Earth, coming from an Island Kingdom -Numenor-destroyed by the Valar (Gods) because of their ultimate corruption by Sauron.J.R.R.Tolkien wrote these books well before he wrote the Lord of the Rings, mostly for his own benefit, since he saw little hope for their gaining popularity in general. After the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a success, The Silmarillion was published, (after his death), to which the Lord of the Rings looks back in time.It is highly mythic, with grandeur and romantic elegance, for those interested in the deeper and ancient things of Middle Earth. In many ways it is deeper and more mythic than even the Lord of the Rings, but it is not an easy book to read. It certainly has a romantic- poetic-even religious flavour to it, which gives solace to the spirit. Read it if you're keen on all things Tolkien, otherwise many try, but get lost half way through.One point to note is that Mr Tolkien, being a classical linguistic scholar, borrowed much of his material from the ancient myths of ancient Europe-the Norse, the Celts, the Vikings, even the Greeks in part etc, so an alternative to these narratives of Tolkien is to read some of the ancient myths of these cultures themself, upon which many of his ideas are based. Some of these aren't too bad to reasearch-think of some of the ancient Greek myths made into some Hollywood movies- eg Jason and the Argonauts, the Golden Fleece, or the Rings Saga of the Vikings and Germanic tribes- which Wagner elucidated. What many of these ancient myths have in common is an understanding of deeper human nature, upon which much of our modern society(s) stems. \\"The Silmarillion\\" is no different.Good luck."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If you have read The Lord of the Rings and you want to understand the &quot;History&quot; behind it, this is for you.

But I won't talk about the book.I want to post some comments on the illustration made by Mr Ted Nasmith for this edition. This book has a greater number of them (45 in total) than the previous editions. Some of the paintings are awesomely real. They caught my eyes from the very beginning. It's a pity that some paintings made by Tasmith, like the ones entitled \\"E&auml;rendil Searches Tirion\\" and \\"Luthien Escapes the Treehouse\\" haven't been included in the final edition.To tell the truth it's a privilege to have this book in my bookcase beside the illustrated editions of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.Once again thanks Tolkien for give us such a wonderful world to live in, and thanks Mr Nasmith for put it into images."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is the grand prehistory of Middle Earth, setting the stage for 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Ring'. It is an amazing work where Tolkien develops the world of Middle Earth. From the creation, the first beings (the Ainuin), the rise of evil, the elves, the War of Wrath, the Fall of Numenor, and the Rings of Power. It covers the First Age, and the Second Age of Middle Earth.It is amazing and wonderful to think that a writer, scholar took the time to develop the lore behind his stories. It set the standard for all writers to follow.I first read this book after having read 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings'. I have since reread all of the books in chronological order enjoying them even more.The Silmarillion is not for everyone. If you are not fan of Middle Earth, some of this book will be dry.

The Silmarillion is very different than The Hobbit and LOTR. I rated it at 3 stars because I think the book would be of interest mostly to just serious fans of Middle Earth. Just because you enjoyed (or even loved) The Hobbit or LOTR, it is not necessarily true that you will enjoy The Silmarillion. It is a difficult read. There is not much of a connecting narrative. A big reason for these qualms is the simple fact that it was not actually completed by JRR. Rather, his copious notes and writings were tackled by his son Christopher. I think he did a very good job in a difficult situation. However, what results is not a cohesive story. Therefore, I think that unless you are a serious fan of Middle Earth and are interested in delving very deeply into its deep past, The Silmarillion is probably not a great choice for you."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I am an avid reader of books, and through writing the author has the power to create and potray things, persons, thoughts, ideas, and dreams that no other medium (for example: movies) can potray. This is one of the reasons why I love books. But unfortunately, most authors do not take advantage of this unique copacity. Instead, they write novels that would make good sitcoms, or soap operas. Not so with the Silmarillion. In this book, Tolkien shows us an epic history comprised of a wealth of incredible characters such as the embodiment of evil that is the main villain; Morgoth, the greatest of the elves; Feanor, the heroic and starwart man Beren and his love Luthien, the heroic elf king Fingolfin, the serpentine evil Sauron that is the villain of LOTR, and many more. He takes us to places of infinite beauty that cannot be seen with our physical eyes, into the barren void, and down into the lowest and foulest pit of Angbad; Morgoth's evil fortress. He tells of battles of such a magnitude that they make the battles of LOTR seem like skirmishes in comparison. He describes battles involving Dragons, Balrogs, Valar (Angel-like creatures), and many other creatures and beings so imaginative that they make the battles of LOTR seem completely bland in comparison.I could write pages of praise of this book, but it simply isn't necessary. Read it, and prepare to travel to a world that inspires the imagination in a way that no other fantasy world, book, or author has ever done."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Tolkien is one of the few writers with an ability of presenting evil in all of it's wickedness and then shading it with infinite goodness.Silmarillion is an wonder..."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This tale is by far the best I've ever read. I don't suggest it to any old person, just someone who is a really strong reader, who doesn't mind the way it's built. My favorite part is The Voyage of Earendeail and The War of Wrath, which tells of the breaking of Angband, the scattering of the dark forces, the banishing of Morgoth Bauglir, and the first defeat Sauron was to experience."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"if one should describe this epic book, he should say that he is reading the bible of middle earth. not only that the way in which tolkein describes each and every detail in the tales that are told in this book but he also gives it light and he guides youe imagination so you can actually seean image in your mind. this book involves gods,profits,heroes ( which didnt exactly ment to be heroes ), evil within, evil without and much more elements that are similar to our holy book. the book gives you a much better understanding of the relations between all folks of middle earth ( including magicians! ) and spreads out the history of the events that lead to the last war and the begining of the age of men.i strongly recomend that every fantasy books lover should read this book and i feel that everyone who enjoyes beautifull language and litretuer shoul try and read it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Having read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, I thought I would give Tolkien's tale of the First Age of Middle-Earth a try. This is about the time before the Rings were made, about the very beginnings of Middle-Earth. Tolkien begins in Genesis style, and the entire book reads like the Bible, something between King James and the NIV. Sometimes the sentences are a little hard to understand because of a lack of comma stops and other punctuation, but you quickly get accustomed to it. Anyway, the first bit is very Gensis-like, depicting the creation of Middle-Earth and the gods and goddesses. Then the Elves awake and go to live with the gods, very Garden of Eden.After some of the Elves leave the gods, the story shows that the action and plot has increased, but the stilted writing style keeps it from being as involved as The Lord of the Rings. There is definitely a plot to this and it is very interesting, but it is clear that Tolkien wrote it to be a history of Middle-Earth, and it reads rather like a history book. Still, the storyline is there, and it is good--you just have to slough through the writing and keep up with countless people and places (fortunately, there's an index to help!)Bottom Line: Excellent for more hard-core fans who want a history of Middle-Earth, as this one answers several questions raised in The Lord of the Rings, but beware--it is a history, and it reads like one."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is one of the best pieces of literature I have read. It is not complete like the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, but it is more tragic. The main part of the novel covers a period of five hundred years condensed into less than four hundred pages. There is less detail than usual, and some of the material is gone over very quickly. By reading Unfinished Tales in addition to the Silmarillion, I saw how much information was probably not finished or left out. Despite the fact that this is one of his shorter works and was released by his son, it is my favorite Tolkien novel. The tragedy of the elves is very sad and it moved me. From Feanor to Dior, there was only one or two happy stories. Beren and Luthien and Gondolin, but even they had sad endings. I encourage anyone who likes the Lord of the Rings and wants to learn about Middle Earth to read these novels. But if you want more information about the Lord of the Rings, I think Unfinished Tales has more information about the time period of the War of the Ring.I like this novel and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion is great in the fact that it establishes the origins of Middle Earth and Valinor, and discusses an immense number of characters and events. For the most part, the book is as well-written and coherent as the Lord of the Rings - captivating and in excruciating detail. The 4 stars I give this book are primarily due to its contents - the history of Ea, the Valar and the rest of the characters is fascinating.This book is harder to read however, than LOTR, by as much as LOTR is harder to read than the Hobbit. You will also find that the events and characters are often not explained or introduced in sequence - for example Beren, Luthien and characters/events unique to Silmarillion. While those that have read LOTR may get a good idea of what is happening, I seriously doubt anyone picking up Silmarillion as their first Tolkien book would be able to make sense of things easily.Those who have been able to follow LOTR and Hobbit through maps will also find that the map of Beleriand does not include certain locations pivotal to the story - such as Thangorodrim, Angband and others. To make things worse, this book does not include a general map of Middle Earth, which forces me to pull out my LOTR book every now and then.That said, if you'd like information on the origins of Tolkien's characters, including the Balrogs, mentioned in the Fellowship of the Ring, look no further than Silmarillion. As a piece of literature, the book is a classic - though if you plan to read it, I suggest you read The Hobbit and LOTR books first."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Wasn't my intention, but I read Tolkien's books, in this order, LOTR, Hobbit, Turin, and Silmarillion. I think it has worked out quite well reading them in reverse chonologic order.The Silmarlillion is a fantastic backdrop and foundation to the entire world Tolkien has created. A Masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is not a literary review. This review is about the MASS-MARKET PAPERBACK printing/edition.I have the version with a gray/silver cover... WASTE OF MONEY. This is a wonderful companion for the Lord of the Rings, but this printing is terrible. It's tiny, stiff, and cheap. The paper is yellowish with tiny, poorly printed font.If you love LOTR and Tolkien, then buy this book -- just DON'T buy the mass-market paperback, keep looking for a better version."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are several chapters in the Bible consisting solely of genealogies, lists of who beget who, used mostly to establish bloodlines. The last being in Matthew in which the lineage of Jesus is established through the bloodline of King David. I have always found these fascinating because of what they don't say. You look at the names on the lists and wonder just who these people were and what they did. What big or small things did they do in their lives that may have wrought monumental changes on the world for future generations. There is an unwritten history there that fascinates.The same can be said for J.R.R. Tolkien's saga The Lord of the Rings. Whether reading the books or watching the films you come across names of individuals and of peoples that give historical depth to the work but also make you wonder who they were and what part they had to play in the development of the Middle-earth of the Third Age. Thankfully Tolkien didn't just mention these people and pass on, he spent his lifetime developing the creation of his world. The culmination of these efforts can be found in The Silmarillion.The Silmarillion was never published in Tolkien's lifetime. It was a work that in essence started in the trenches of WWI and was not completed at the time of his death. Thankfully much of it was completed and his son, Christopher Tolkien, was able to take the large body of work left by J.R.R. Tolkien and edit it together into a complete narrative. The Silmarillion is essentially the history of Middle-earth, from the creation of the world and the First Age through the Third Age up until the time seen in The Hobbit and then The Lord of the Rings.Let me stop here to say that I was completely enraptured by this book. The Silmarillion is not something that one can pick up for light reading. It is a history book and reads as such. However if you are in a LOTR frame of mind I believe you would find the book amazing as well. Tolkien was a scholar of language, of the history and mythology of Europe, and of religion as well. These things heavily influenced his life's work and can be seen in the creation of the world in which his characters lived.It has been said that Tolkien was disappointed in the lack of a true mythology for England and that part of what he set out to do was to create one. The Silmarillion then is Tolkien's description of the creation of the world and ages that existed in a time long before our time. The opening chapters in which Eru or Iluvatar, the One creates the Ainur (or Holy Ones) and teaches them to create the world through song is beautiful, especially in comparison to the creation accounts of the book of Genesis. One of the things it does quite well is establish the importance of music as a tool of communication and storytelling, something that not only was true in the \`real' history of our world but in Middle-earth as well.The Silmarillion goes on to tell the story of the Silmarils, three jewels created by Feanor, the most gifted of the Elves. Within each jewel was captured the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the trees were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. These jewels were eventually stolen by Morgoth and set in his crown. The Silmarillion then becomes the \\"history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy\\". It goes on to tell the tale of the rise of Sauron and his battles with the peoples of Middle-earth, the creation of the rings of power and the One Ring, and the battle in which Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, eventually losing it in the river to one day become the possession of Smeagol.Although The Silmarillion was begun long before Tolkien ever intended to write The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings it turned out to be the ultimate Tolkien fan bible. It answers so many questions about the people who came before those we loved in The Lord of the Rings. It was so fascinating to learn about the Elves and the Dwarves, about the Numenoreans who are referenced often in LOTR, about the first Dark Lord and the creation of evil in Middle-earth.Well-written history is wonderful to read. Two of the most interesting historical books I have read are the the books I, Claudius and Claudius, the God by Robert Graves. They are the stories of the Roman Emperors told through fiction and they are amazing. Despite being the history of a fictional world, The Silmarillion is equally amazing. The depth of the many historical and literary influences in Tolkien's life as well as scholarly command of language makes this history feel real. Reading The Silmarillion does not feel like reading a work of fantasy. It feels like reading a history of our world describing a time that has passed out of all recollection of men. The fact that it gives so much back story and dimension to the world that so many have fallen in love with via the LOTR novels and films is just a bonus. Like any \`true' history, the peoples who populate The Silmarillion are far from perfect. They are very real, full of virtues and faults and the actions of individuals and groups have far reaching consequences in the world they leave for future generations. Reading The Silmarillion was an amazing experience and one I am likely to repeat. The last chapter alone, Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age, is something everyone should read at least once before watching the movies again.I was talking with my brother-in-law the other day mentioning the fact that Tolkien's work is so interesting because his grasp of language allowed him to create a universe in which the many and varied names of peoples and of places and of cultures do not feel made up or silly. The Silmarillion is full of names one hasn't heard before but never does it feel like Tolkien was just making things up. It reads like a history that has been passed down from generation to generation and for that Tolkien has to be acknowledged as a literary master.I guess it goes without saying (then why have you wrote so much???) that I highly recommend The Silmarillion. It is the work of Tolkien's lifetime and is a remarkable legacy. Tolkien would no doubt consider The Silmarillion to be his important work. The stories in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were just moments out of the vast timeline he created. Read it, it is the ultimate LOTR geek's dream. It is also a book that I believe would appeal to anyone who is interested in mythology and history. Reading it one finds it hard to believe that this isn't actually a true history of an age long before our own which I think is the ultimate compliment for what Tolkien set out to do. By far the best book I have read this year."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It does not matter whether you're into fantasy or not, this is a must read. The first 1/3rd of the book can turn off even LOTR fans, because it is filled with too many names and places. But, work on the book. The rest of the book is one of the best reads ever. Like so many other reviewes say, THIS IS NOT A COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES. This is a story about elves and men and their wars with Morgoth (Sauron's boss). The writing is top notch. This is a great fantasy and literature at the same time. If you're sick of G.R.R. Martin and Robert jordan and looking for something original, read the old master JRR. This is an undeniable masterpiece. I'm not one of those ringnuts, but after this book, I might become one :)"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Have you ever wanted to know the stories BEHIND all the characters in LOTR? Ever wondered why the elves are immortal? Do you want more information on the wizdards?? Are you curious how Sauron forged the \\"One Ring\\"? GET THE SILMARILLION!! I started reading The Lord of the Rings when I was in 9th grade. I never finished it until I saw the movies. I became obsessed with the trilogy. After reading all 3 books, I wanted a clearer understanding of where all the cool characters came from. The Silmarillion is THE BOOK and THE KEY to understanding and enjoying LOTR. A MUST for any fan of Middle Earth!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The book itself is the masterpiece of Tolkien's writings. From the beginning of creation to the end of the Third Age it is awe inspiring. It is presented in a way that you cannot stop listening to it. The narration is moving and the diction is clear. The musical score adds to the excitement of the book. I highly recommend this book to all who cannot get enough of Tolkien or any other Fantasy writer."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"--Commentary with some minor spoilers---Tolken's silmarillion is rather interesting in many respects. One could say that he probably knew about the doctrine of 'the music of the spheres' which is represented in his writing as the 'music of the ainur'. Several esoteric doctrines claim that the world was created through sound/vibration emanated from the mind of 'God'. What is usually referred to as 'God' according to some esoteric doctrines is the mind of creative entities/beings who apparently exist on higher planes of existence and who project aspects of themselves into lower planes to experience what these beings create on the plane of mind.Another interesting facet of the stories in this book is the creation of 'beings of the elements' (4 element theory of Aristotle and some eastern doctrines). In this respect Manwe is a Lord of the element of air, Ulmo is a lord of the element of water, Aule is a lord of the element of earth and Melkor is a lord of the element of fire. In a similar vein, Varda is a lady of light/fire, Yavanna is a lady of earth, Nienna is a lady of water and Este is a lady of air. There are also the other Valar and the Maiar that have their specific purposes.Tolken also delves into the dualities of light and dark and even of balance. The raising of the left hand, the right hand and finally both hands of illuvatar (during the music of the ainur) signify light, dark and the blending of both light and dark (both hands raised) into a balanced expression. Some of the Valar represent the expression of light and Melkor definitely represents the dark expression of experience. Yet the interplay of these two fundamental modes leads to the variety experienced in the music of the ainur (remember the creation of slowflakes and rain as an interplay between the forces of Melkor and Ulmo).Another most interesting point is the appearance of the Valar before the 'Children of illuvatar'. The Valar are akin to beings of nature known in some esoteric doctrines as Devas (high order ones while the Maiar are lower order ones) and their various purposes dictate their function in the music of the ainur (the creation and evolution of manifested reality). Also several esoteric doctrines state that the Devas and their elementals existed before 'man', since they embody reality by taking form/ideas and giving them shape/matter. The purpose and function of the Valar are very different from those of the Children of illuvatar (Elves and Men) and yet both are required to evolve the music and to create new music at a later period.Tolken limits his work to Earth/Ea but develops his stories well. After all, the accounts in this book are fictional but it is hard not to draw parallels with certain esoteric doctrines. For instance the Elves or the eldar are akin to the angelic-like humans said to have existed on Earth and who lived in harmony with the planet long before the legendary Atlantis. These are said to appear human in form, yet different from the human beings we are today. Some commentators have also drawn parallels with the Numenoreans of the Silmarillion and the Atlanteans.All in all the stories in this book are really entertaining and well written from a literary point of view and they provide great context for the later stories found in the LOTR series. The stories can also be seen as interesting from another point of view that usually termed esoteric/occult. It is however important to bear in mind that this book is fiction and not fact and that without any knowledge or interest in esoteric doctrines or in myths such as found in the Eddas, it is entirely possible to thoroughly enjoy the stories in the book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"In short, this book showcases the mastermind that Tolkien is. Here he reveals the creation of his world, with almost every detail intact, from the mountains to the seas to the sun and moon. It is fascinating to discover the origin of many characters or legends found in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. It is true that this book does read somewhat like a history book and it does take some more effort to get through at times because of the huge amount of characters that are presented to the reader, but for any die-hard Tolkien fan this is essential reading that you will thoroughly enjoy. Also, the index and pronunciation guide are very helpful.As for this edition, it is a solid book good for many readings. Those who want something more may want to go for the newest edition illustrated by Ted Nasmith, with a fold-out color map and color illustrations."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book is what I think the greatest book Tolkien wrote. I read it once a year because there is so much to it. It starts with the creation of the world and Middle Earth. It goes deep into the history and myths of Middle Earth. Many stories mentioned in the Lord of the Rings books take place in the Silmarillion. This is not an easy book to read. I guess you can call it the \\"bible\\" of Middle Earth. But it is a very good book. Things in some of his other stories make more scence after getting the pieces The Silmarillion fills in."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Silmarillion tells the mythology and lore of Middle- earth before the War of the Ring. It mostly contains the history of the Noldor race of Elves - their fall from grace and their struggles against the Satan-like Melkor (Morgoth). The history of the early race of men is told as well. We learn the story of Turin Turambar, very much like a Greek tragedy, complete with incest and suicide. Beren and Luthien, the first man-elf union, can be found here, as well as their illustrious descendants. For readers of Lord of the Rings, this book will explain the many allusions in Tolkien's trilogy to Middle Earth's past.The question many might have, if they are about to first delve into Tolkien's writings, is if they should read The Silmarillion first, because it is first chronologically. I would advise against this; read The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, then The Silmarillion. Why? Part of the genious of Lord of the Rings is that the many references to the past - to Gondolin, Earendil, the Kings of Numenor,etc. - give Middle-earth its amazing richness and realism, even if the reader is unaware of the details. If you read the Silmarillion first, you know the answers without having ever asked the questions. The work loses its significance. Going back and rereading is rewarding as you see Middle Earth and the War of the Ring in the light of new understanding; however, the first time, you should experience hearing names of unknown people and places so you, along with Frodo, are a traveller in strange lands, often unaware of all being discussed.For those who have trouble with names (like me!), the index of names in the back of the book will become your new best friend. Be warned: The Silmarillion contains a Finwe, a Fingolfin, a Finarfin, a Fingon, a Finrod, and that's just the beginning. The map of Beleriand should also become a good pal. If you are determined that you must have all the names of people and places straight, you will often find yourself flipping to index pages. This can slow down you reading, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This book isn't for the novice fantasy reader and it comes with some baggage. However, it is the Genesis equivalent of the story line. Fingolfin's rise and fall is fascinating. The creation of the elves, the calling of the Istar (wizards), man, dwarves, the Valar most all the beings of what becomes Middle Earth (except perhaps the Hobbits) all in one. I really enjoyed this book even if it was unfinished. So many questions were answered reading this book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Yeah I know. It is A REAAAAALLLLYYYYY long book. I did the math using the percentage on my kindle. This book is anywhere from 1200 to 1300 pages long. Luckily, if you know what you are looking for, you can easily just skip to that section. It is like the Bible, you read the parts that you are required or want to, and can easily understand them without reading the entire book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I have read this like 3 or 4 times now and still get lost in the details. But I still love it. The history of middle earth is a great story for anyone who wants to delve deeper in the story."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I'm not so much rating the book itself, which I enjoyed more on a &#34;4 1/2 star&#34; level, but this &#34;e-version&#34; of the book through the Kindle application on an iPad. Reading it wasn't difficult, but there were occasional problems with things like spelling, links to footnotes and the general layout. Since I had never read this book and had the application, I decided to give this and another book by Tolkien a try through the Kindle app, but I think I'd have rather added hardcover editions of the books to add to my small library. I think I might choose to save Kindle editions for books I am quite certain that I won't care to keep at all, because the errors in this edition were slightly annoying. It is quite possible that an actual Kindle may not have had the same problems, but I cannot test that out as I only have applications for iOS and Android."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Though not pristine this will do the job.

The descriptions of Middle Earth, and details in general, were so vibrant it made me feel like I was there. Love Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a difficult read, not like the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, which are stories of great adventure.If, after reading Appendix A of the Lord of the Rings you long to know more, than this is your chance.The Silmarillion is a collection of pre-Middle Earth histories and musings edited together to provide reasonable continuity and consistency. At times the writing is in the style of ancient myth, with curious names and references. At other times history segments become more story-like, but always these are snapshots of the many important historic pre-Middle Earth events.The story of creation of the Tolkien world is here, the cause of all that's evil and twisted is here. That Sauron was only a mere servant of the real Dark Lord unfolds here. How Sauron brings low the once high glory of Elves and Men is here.But it is a sometimes tedious read when things wax mythic, and for that reason I give it 4 of 5 stars if you're a fan fascinated by the Tolkien Middle Earth saga, but if you're not, you'd find it 3 or less."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is Tolkein's wide spanning overview of the ancient history of Arda and Middle Earth. It is really awe inspiring in it's sweep and vision, and encompasses thousands of years in the essential struggle of good vs evil, with enough detail and craziness to make it actually believable. Don't expect the same tone as The Hobbit or even Lord of The Rings. This does not read like a novel at all, but more like a brief history. If you are a LOTR fan, it will give you a new appreciation and understanding of just how epic this story is!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The must read background story to all the other middle-earth stories. The only downside is to remember all those names."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Probably the most brilliant collection of writings by one of the masters of speculative fiction. The opening chapter alone elucidates the beginning of Creation in such a way that the Bible account itself is brightly illumined."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This is a not an easy read, such as The Hobbit. However, the wealth of information about the world gives a large measure of insight into the actions of chracters in the Lord of the Rings. The stories here are entertaining by themselves but are even better knowing some of the stories to come."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I truly awe inspiring creation story. Tolkien left nothing on the table creating this story. Every last detail ties to everything he has written in some way or another. Fun to read the story of Sauron and how all of the species came about. Worth the read if you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings series or the Hobbit. It is a bit a difficult read though so be prepared."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I bought this for my nephew (10yrs) for christmas. he hasn't rec'd it yet, but when he does, i'll have HIM write a review. what i CAN say is that the book itself is very beautiful. the illustrations throughout the book and the map that is included make it feel like i'm giving him something really special. i hope he'll treasure it as i did some of my favorite books as a kid."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"great book, a little hard to read, but with an amazing description, I highly recommend it.

It will drive you back to the trilogy with new eyes, it's like reading a completely different history when The Silmarillion has been absorbed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Great read for anyone even slightly interested in Middle-Earths lore and history. Is right up there with Tolkien's best writing."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I can tell you that if I need to choose between Alan Lee illustrations and Ted Nazmith...I will choose Ted Nazmith, years ago I bought the 2000 Tolkien's Calendar and it was the first time I was able to review some of the illustrations which are included in this book. Finally as a birthday present my mom bought me this excellent book. Paper is great and illustrations incredible. This is a most to have book specially if you want to have a good collection with the Lord of the Rings illustrated by Alan Lee (Single Centenar Anniversary Edition or 3 Books) and the Hobbit again illustrated by Alan Lee. However from all these 3 books this is my favorite as the Sillmarillion it self is what is behind the Lord of the Rings and is much more deep in content, legends and even mythical creatures! If a contribution to JRR Tolkien has been made by Christopher is to publish this book...hope he let someday the rights to play a movie it will be greater spectacular than any scifi/fantasy movie so far!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A little bit like reading the bible, but a good read for Tolkein fans.

I would still recommend the book for Tolkien's fans."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I can hardly add to the more scholarly reviews written about the Silmarillion, so I'll just leave my opinion of the Kindle edition version of the book. Of course, the story is neither embellished nor diminished in its electronic publication, however the paperback version has at least one advantage over the Kindle edition. I am a big fan of the maps that Tolkien included in his books, especially in the Silmarillion, as it helps me to visualize the world he created. When I read the paperback version originally, I found myself referencing the maps, and the genealogical tables rather frequently as the names of places and cast of characters is rather expansive. This task is more cumbersome with the Kindle edition, but not impossible. I would recommend reading the paperback version of the story first, and then deciding if the Kindle edition is worth the $10. Also, the auto-reader function really struggles the pronunciation of Tolkien's writings, as do I."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The stories in The Silmarillion are intensely philosophical and deeply humane. Due to the fact that this book is basically a posthumous compilation of drafts, very often an event is told in only one or two sentences and many things are not elaborated or explained. This leaves many holes in the stories, but at the same time this allows the reader to interpret a story in many ways according to one's own believes and understanding. Be it the author's intention or not, this is actually one of the most fascinating aspects of The Silmarillion. No matter how my interests may have evolved over the years, this book is the book I always return to and find new perspectives to look at the characters and the stories."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This hardcover edition of the Silmarillion is flawless. It retails for like 40 bucks, so to get it at this price was a steal! The Silmarillion is NOT an easy book to read. If you do not have a passion for language, fantasy, and spirituality, do not buy this book. It is, however, the perfect gift for a Tolkien enthusiast. The pages are glossy, the illustrations are brilliant, and the hard cover is a beautiful sapphire blue. It really makes this rather dry and wordy story come alive."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"There are a lot of detailed reviews about this book, so I'm not going to bother discussing anything besides my feelings about it. The first time I read the book I was eleven, so I remembered it being much longer and more tedious than I find it now haha I remember comparing the first couple of chapters to Genesis when discussing it with my teacher in middle school. I just read it again a week ago, however, and absolutely love it. I may enjoy this book even more than the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which is pretty hard to do, I am in love with those books). I love Tolkien's writings style - I find it so relaxing, probably because it isn't so fast paced. I really enjoy detail, and I love the world created by Tolkien. It can be very sad in different chapters, however, so if you don't handle sadness in books well you may want to rethink reading this. Or keep chocolate handy ;) I think the fact that not all of the stories end happily makes the world more realistic, though. All in all, I love this book and I hope you enjoy it if you choose to read it as well!"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I first read The Silmarillion about 7 years ago. I made the mistake of reading this before reading The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Therefore, it was very difficult to read and follow the storyline. It is like trying to read the bible or Shakespeare for the very first time. Anyway, it is now 7 years later, I have read those other books, watched the movies, etc. It is now much easier to follow. The book is quite poetic in several places and really is a rich work of fantasy fiction. Now that I have read it again and can actually comprehend most of it, it will now go down as one of my favorite books. I highly recommend this book. My only caution is to read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings first (even though The Silmarillion is chronologically earlier than those books) before trying to tackle this one. It will be a much better experience."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"The Simarillion--what can I say?One of the greatest books in every way.In language, in tone, in subject matter,Most other literature compared just shatter.A history of woe, mixed with hope.Someday Middle-Earth shall stop its downward slope.The Elves will stop fighting for the Silmarils--Those mighty jewels with which legend overfills--Which through the ages have driven elves to kill,Hatred in their hearts to fill,Drove them to betray their kin,And caused their hearts to lose peace within.Someday this shall cease, at the very end.When Beren and Luthien are only known by song,When the lives of the Elves have grown weary and long,Driving them to the land of Valinor,Where they shall find peace, and joy evermore.Yet what of the Men, and the Dwarvish clans?Shall they be left desolate, until the last one stands?This is not Eru's plan for his creation.All of his creatures, of every nation,That did not submit to the evils of Morgoth--Though their suffering was great under his torment wroth;The wars of the ages, the Orcs of Angband,Bloodshed and torture and fear throughout the lands--These who did not bow, shall join in the great songThat Eru had planned for all to sing ages longIn joy and peace, and true fulfillment.When Morgoth is chained, to suffer the tormentOf his own mind, as he exists in the Void.Then shall Middle-Earth, and all of Arda,Live in peace, in innocence's bright aura.If you like what you readOn this page that you seeThen you must proceed--You truly do need--The Simarillion to read.Ryan RobledoAuthor of the Aelnathan:"},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"\\"Thus it was in Gondolin; and amid all the bliss in the realm, while it's glory lasted, a dark seed was sewn.\\" In this fiction book, there was no main character. However, the character mentioned most often was Melkor, whose name changed to Morgoth. In the beginning of this book, Melkor was the most powerful of the Valar (whom the men of middle earth call gods, but the elves call Creators), and was the most fair hearted. Yet as the book went on, Melkor turned into an evil spirit. He persuaded other Vala (singular for Valar) to join him in his evil schemes. When Feanor made the silmarils, great gem-like objects that shed light and are blue, Melkor stole them and fled to Middle Earth, where he was eventually defeated in the Great Battle during the wars of Beleriand.This book was a definite page-turner, mostly because it was so interesting due to in depth detail and an interesting plot. I recommend this book to anyone, especially if they like Tolkien books or descriptive battles. I must admit, my mind did wander a little when I was reading The Silmarillion, but this was only because it was so well written that the \\"Movie in your mind\\" would carry you away. As I said before, I would recommend this fiction book to anybody."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"This collection of lose knit tales of the history of Middle Earth and those that live there. We learn many things as what different names of beings and places mean. This helps add a dimension to the stories that take place there.I would say that it would help to read Lord of the Rings first because it is more comfortable when getting to know the area and characters. Then we can see where they came form; relationships are better understood.Much of The Silmarillion can be taken in small bits and then sit back and contemplate how it could have been.One does not just cut through any cultural history book for light reading and just shelving it. This is a cultural history book and will require rereading.When people talk about the war I think back to which one they are talking about. Or are they just referring to one of the many orc skirmishes.You do not have to be a Tolkien fan to find interest in this collection."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"It is a good source of background information that leads up to Lord of the Rings (and I've only seen the movies), yet it is placed much further back in time so don't expect to find much of your favourite characters from LOTR's - mind I'm still reading it so maybe towards the end we will see. I suspect one would need to buy The Hobbit to bridge more of the gap, which I have just done, along with LOTR's boxed set.Otherwise it quite good reading and even though it rambles a bit at times or seems to, yet it is still being informative, if you're into this sort of mythical thing it is somewhat compealing."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"One of the best fantasy novels of our time, a tragic tale of love, heroic deed, war, the history of middle-earth and the rescuing of the simarils: three jewels that control the fate of the world!

For instance, did you know that Elves have a homeland? Did you know that Gandalf is a Demi-god, not a wizard? Did you know that he was sent into the land to stop Sauron and nothing else? I bet you didn't. But if you read the Silmarillion you will learn this and everything else.The story in LOTR was about one inch of a story that is a foot long."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"I think there is a tendency in the world of Tolkien-worship whereby hardcore fans will always say Silmarillion is better than LotR. I think this is due to the fact that only a hardcore fan can actually walk away from this book and say that its a good piece of literature. Most casual readers never get past page 50. It's a set of myths. It is not a novel. The story is pretty boring. The characters are flat, largely uninteresting, cardboard cut-out typed people. Of course, that's sort of the way it happens in myth/legend. As a made up history for a fantasy world, it does its job about as well as it can, but that does not make this an enjoyable read or a good piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"What makes Tolkien great is that he understands that modernity is a lie; that there was a better world inside of man long ago, and if there wasn't, well then there should have been.It is this that gives his books their haunting, mystic quality.But where Lord of the Rings has a little too much of children's literature in it, this one - despite the presence of \\"elves\\" and such - is for grownups alone. Its intellectual level, and the quality and density of the prose, are too high for children. And for dummies, or the spiritually bankrupt. This is Tolkien's best and most elite statement, a true classic of 20th century literature.I'll pay this book the best compliment I know and say that it is the single best Lord Dunsany imitation I have ever seen, but it is also much more than that. Tolkien's prose soars to the majestic heights that his inventions warrant. Nothing against his other books, but many elements of them are a matter of taste whereas the greatness of the Silmarillion cannot be seriously denied by anyone with a brain or a soul. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"If the number of books I have read could be considered as a proper set of credentials to rate books, I would quote it. If my academic accomplishments were to give me any credit whatsoever as far as proper cultural background is concerned I would list them.But that is not the point of this or any other review, I think.I will tell you why I, a reader like you considers this book to be the best, even when compared to my other favorites, like &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&quot;, &quot;The Prince and &quot;The Tempest&quot;.Yes, it's that good.It's not just the prose, which reads like the chanting of a gregorian choir, nor the characters that are true archetypes, of the kind that the human psyche is made of.It's the tales.They are hauntingly familiar, for the simple reason that Tolkien took them right out of human folklore and tradition. Yes, you could call them rip-offs, and I would not argue with you, but tell me, if someone presents an old message with a truly new and vibrant voice, isn't he or she entitled to at least a degree of originality? And if the new message verion touches you more deeply than the original did, would you not take the new one as your own?That's what is brilliant about this book.You've read about battles of good versus evil all your life.You've heard about heroes with swords and mail forever.But this ones sound like the original. They act like the original. And they touch you like the original.You've always known them by other names. But when you first read about Fingolfin's fight with Morgoth, you will think of him instead of Arthur battling with Mordred or Saul struggling against the Angel or Cyrano duelling with Death whenever you think of desperate battles in which victory is impossible. And you will come to believe, at least for a moment, that all of Creation is really only a chorus, with each voice bearing a unique and invisible importance in the grand scheme.At least for a moment.That is what this book is about. The greatest of topics discussed and presented by one of the greatest of storytellers.None of his other books has such a breathtaking scope.None can touch you so deeply.This is where all modern fantasy writing began. With Eru in the void giving thought to the Powers. If you would take advice from a fellow reader, take this much: Don't hesitate in picking this book up and reading it. At least once.Then you will know just how good Tolkien was. And you will understand that the day must surely come again.Thank you for your time and patience."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"Consider this book the equivalent of Everything You Wanted to Know About Middle-Earth But Were Afraid to Ask. There hardly seems to be any point to it except to satisfy the curiosity of the thousands of Lord of the Rings fans of the time, who just couldn't get enough of Tolkien's fantasy world. The book is a posthumously-published collection of stories and myths that Tolkien had scribbled on paper during his life, some of which were not even originally a part of his Middle-earth world. (Or rather, the characters of The Hobbit and LOTR were not originally meant to be a part of this other world, but came to be subsumed into it.)Some parts of the book, which reads like the biblical book of Genesis on Norse steroids, are excellent and memorable. The creation account and the fall of the Elves are of particular note, possessing the mythic power of most ancient pagan mythologies. The story of T&uacute;rin Turambar competes with the Icelandic sagas for high drama. But too much of the book is cobbled together from stories that were never completed, and the effect is of a patchwork quilt with patches of fine linen and rags sewn side by side.Anyone hoping to find an expansive section on the events of The Lord of the Rings will be disappointed. Frodo's adventures warrant barely a footnote at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Silmarillion","review":"A Tolkien masterpiece!

But it introduces some basic sentence patterns and vocabulary fairly painlessly.

That being the case, one can do well by reading Sister Maria Boulding's spiritual masterpiece \\"The Coming of God.\\" In the book, Sr. Maria shares her grasp of Sacred Scripture, the Church Fathers, and various other resources as she makes plain the \\"central message of the Word of God.\\"God brings this message to us through the communication of himself. Instead of shouting edicts from a remote vastness, he came and still comes to us as a \\"hands-on\\" God. And instead of hurling platitudes from an ivory tower, he seeks after us in our deepest recesses. If only we would hear his voice. Jesus did so, setting an example for us to follow. For whenever he listened to the voice of his Father, they reached communion. In the Word made flesh, \\"self-giving, self-revealing God meets self-giving, responding, participating, receptive humanity.\\"We too can experience this communion. For such a \\"relationship between God and a free, spiritual being in grace\\" is our highest possible relationship and fulfills, in the words of the late Pope John Paul II, the \\"nuptial meaning of the body\\" (mutual self-giving).God's gift of himself is a great mystery, yet it is a mystery that we can embrace. We simply need to be receptive, to be open to God, for he will take the initiative. As Benedictine Abbot Gregory Polan encourages, \\"The reader comes to the realization of how the mysterious yet wondrous comings of God into our lives are the sheer gift of divine grace.\\" May this fine book warm your heart and fill your soul.

Cyert is Professor of Economics and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. James G. March is Professor of Management and Professor of Political Science and Sociology at Stanford University. This book was originally published in 1963 and consists of 9 chapters with a short introduction and preface. This 2nd edition published in 1992 adds an epilogue.The authors start clearly in the Introduction: \\"This book is about the business firm and the way it makes economic decisions. We propose to make detailed observations and to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision making within business organizations.\\" In the second chapter Cyert and March introduce some of the problems with the original theory of the firm and organization theory and introduce their approach to explain the behaviour of business firms with respect to economic decisions.The authors provide some partial answers in the 3 following chapters in which they consider organizational goals (chapter 3), organizational expectations (chapter 4), organizational choice and (to a limited extent) organizational control (chapter 5). This section is concluded with a skeleton of their basic theory of organizational choice and control upon which one can develop an explicit model of organizational decision making. The first model of price and output is already given in chapter 5 and in chapter 6 Cyert and March introduce a model of price setting in a department store.Chapter 7 introduces a summary of the basic concepts in the behavioural theory of the firm which is based on 2 major organizing devices. First, a set of exhaustive variable categories (goals, expectations, choice) and, second, a set of relational concepts (quasi resolution of conflict, uncertainty avoidance, problemistic search and organizational learning). \\"We think that these concepts will prove useful in dealing with organizational decision making as it is reflectd in business firms.\\"Chapter 8 serves as a concluding chapter and explains that the theory of the firm serves four major purposes within the framework of economic theory: (1) a method for decision making; (2) a prescription for decision making; (3) a description of behaviour of certain aggregates of firms; and (4) a tool for deciding among some alternative economic policies. Each of these purposes are discussed in detail.In the final chapter Cyert and March attempt to place the preceding chapters into a contract of developments subsequent to the original publication. \\"In the first section, we describe the main ideas on which the book was built, key themes in behavioural studies of the firm. In the second section, we discuss developments in the economic analysis of the firm since 1963 ... In the third section, we discuss developments in the behavioural study of decision making in organizations.\\"This was a monumental piece of research in the early 1960s and, yes, the authors admit \\"that they may not have it all quite right. Yet.\\", but is still pretty much up to date especially with the adjustments made for the 1992-edition. It provides great insights into decision making within business firms. I have read this book with great interest and enjoyment. I can recommend this book all managers and people interested in decision making and organizational behaviour."},{"Title":"A behavioral theory of the firm (Prentice-Hall international series in management)","review":"This is a really basic book for my interest, and I've been searching for it for quite a long time.

Goals arise in such a form because the firm is, in fact, a coalition of participants with disparate demands, changing foci of attention, and limited ability to attend to all organization problems simultaneously\\" (pg 43)"},{"Title":"Pop This!

Very satisfied with transaction"},{"Title":"Wolverine, tome 4 : L'arme X","review":"&quot;Weapon X&quot; was originally presented as a 13-part story, including a prologue, that was published in 8-page installments in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; issues #72-84 in 1991-92. This was a Marvel title that presented four 8-page stories in each issue (except for the grand finale), some of which were multiple-part sagas and others that were one-shot deals. So while Barry Windsor-Smith was telling the story of &quot;Weapon X&quot; (&quot;Before Wolverine&quot; the first cover tells us), there is a multi-part story featuring Shanna of the Jungle and various stories involving everyone from Daredevil and Dr. Doom to Red Wolf and Captain America.The chief attraction of &quot;Weapon X&quot; was that Barry Windsor-Smith was doing the artwork. In fact, Windsor-Smith was doing everything except some of the lettering, which Jim Novak handled. This meant that for the entire run of the story line BWS was doing the cover art in place of the usual rotation amongst the four stories for the cover art. The idea of the story was simply to finally go back and explain how it was that Logan, the mutant whose power was a regenerative ability, ended up with the skeleton laced with adamantum. Originally the idea was that Wolverine was simply born that way, but eventually there was this whole mysterious background that a secret military organization did this to him (keep in mind, we are talking a CANADIAN secret military organization, despite the revisions in the &quot;X2&quot; movie). The mad scientist behind the plot is Dr. Cornelius, who basically sees the opportunity to build the perfect offensive weapon.The key thing to remember in reading &quot;Weapon X&quot; is that this is not a Wolverine story. For the first part of the narrative Logan is unconscious in the tank, hooked up to all sorts of fun toys while he endures the painful treatment, and then he is a primal killing machine, whose mind has not yet come back from where ever it went to hide during the process. The idea is to let the character cut loose in full berserker mode before disappearing into the wilderness to eventual emerge as the Wolverine who ends up with the X-Men. In the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; the creator's sin was not that he brought the creature to life, but rather than Dr. Frankenstein abandoned his creation. Well, in &quot;Weapon X&quot; the sin is the brutal act of creation. Windsor-Smith basically begins with the procedure underway, and Logan's culpability in his own transformation is not a part of the equation.The result is neither a great story nor great art, even for devotes of Windsor-Smith's illustrative style, but &quot;Weapon X&quot; does fill in a major hole in the Wolverine backstory. Artistically it is reminiscent of Windsor-Smith's style when he was drawing comic books that would often have several pages reaching double figures in the number of frames. It is hard to tell how problematic the eight-page &quot;chapter&quot; format is to the telling of the story, but you get the feeling the story would have been stronger if it was a bit shorter."},{"Title":"Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection","review":"Recently His Holiness the Dalai Lama published highly edited transcripts of four empowerments he gave into the traditional Nyingma teaching of Dzogchen or Great Perfection. Both Dzogchen and Mahamudra represent important indigenous developments of Tantric teachings in Tibet. Like all wisdom traditions, Buddhism rests upon the transmission of heart-essence realization and dharma from one generation to the next. Dzogchen, literally &quot;great perfection,&quot; is the primary teaching of the Nyingmapa school of Tibetan Buddhism, having been carried to Tibet in the eighth century by Padmasambhava, who is recognized as a &quot;second Buddha.&quot; This actualization of what Dzogchen is is sent out through this collection of empowerments given from 1982-1989 by the 14th Dalai Lama. Sogyal Rinpoche (The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying) requested these teachings, and His Holiness the Dalai Lama obliged with emphasis on the 5th Dalai Lama's visionary receipt of Dzogchen teaching, which is summarized simply by the verse: &quot;Ema! Phenomena are, without exception, Perfect within the continuum of self-arising rigpa.&quot; Ema is an expression of wonder and astonishment. Whereas rigpa is a technical term for root single awareness that illuminates all; whereas ordinary awareness is that but as refracted into various experiences of subject and object, so that the unity becomes a secret, except for those who are aware of the nature of the root awareness then everything is the root awareness. To attempt to understand enough so that one can cut through the veils of separations that is usually the habit mind. Of course the development of habitual indwelling in non-divisive bliss might be more fun than reading hundreds of books. But as the verse say there is no difference at the root or in the stem and branch or such preferences seeming important. Empowerments are a principle way the Tibetans are bringing Buddha dharma to the west. An empowerment is the oral recitation of the teaching with impromptu commentary for the audience. It is done with a ritual format so that there can be prayers, chants and other meditation aids going on but the most important aspect of the empowerment is that the teacher and his assistants as well as the whole audience is speaking at the time from within the nondual realization of what is being taught. In other words the Dalai Lama and his retinue are all within a state of actualization of the reality to which the teaching refers. As the audience is also so attuned the psychic contagion can be intense and experiences can quickly and deeply cut through the fog of our surface consciousness. Now this volume is likely to be popular among students of Buddhism, but, except for the Appendix: Compassion, the Heart of Enlightenment; the texts would confuse the novice. Because of this I recommend several other texts that provide more systematic accounts of the Dzogchen traditions and how they fit in with the wider traditions of Buddhist practice. The Golden Letters: The Three Statements of Garab Dorje, the First Teacher of Dzogchen, Together With a Commentary by Garab Dorje, edited and translated with a commentary by John Myrdhin Reynolds (Snow Lion Press) In many ways the best guide to Dzogchen teachings. Includes explanations that were previously thought too secret to publish. Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection by Mi-Pham-Rgya-Mtsho Nes Ses Rin Po Chei Sgron Me edited and translated with commentary by John W. Pettit (Wisdom Publications) offers the necessary links between Madhyamika and Dzogchen. And as a relatively easy introduction the The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, edited by John Shane (Tibetan Buddhist Philosophy: Snow Lion Press) provides a useful introduction."},{"Title":"Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection","review":"This is the most technical of the 9 Dalai Lama books I've read so far. This is appropriate, however, for such a deep subject as Dzogchen-claimed by the Nyingmapa School to be the ultimate teaching. The Dalai Lama does NOT dispute this but dedicates a significant portion of his book (actually a collection of oral presentations given mostly in California in the late \`80's) to \\"the correspondence between Highest Yoga Tantra and Dzogchen\\" (p. 120) per Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima (1865-1926). Highest Yoga Tantra is the highest teaching of his own Gelugpa School. He points out both similarities and differences, compares it to Mahamudra (the highest teaching of the Kagyu School), the highest teaching of the Sakya School, and the Madhyamaka Prasangika philosophy as well. However, as he states on p. 176: \\"I am explaining Dzogchen, but in order to explain it, at this point I shall employ the vocabulary of the new schools of tantra.\\" At least for me, he cleared up considerable ambiguity/confusion regarding the differences between this philosophy (now dominant in Tibet) and the Cittamatra.Thus, this is NOT an introductory text. In fact, it's quite uneven-but then it wasn't written, it was a series of lectures. It includes some extremely basic Buddhist material (including his referring to the Southern Buddhism Schools as the \\"Fundamental Vehicle\\" on p. 98). This, as well as the final lecture, reflects his great compassion for all-emulating Avalokiteshvara & Tara. Indeed, he discusses some very erudite subjects with great sensitivity: emptiness (the 4 empties), free will, & (especially) context. He states:p. 143: \\"there are many different presentations of emptiness.\\"p. 144: \\"it is very important to examine what the reference of any particular term may be.\\"p. 160: \\"even though the context may appear to be similar, we cannot assume that a particular term will retain the same meaning whenever it occurs.\\"Most of this book is a comparison of Dzogchen with other systems rather than an exposition of its methods-perhaps its sub-title might be amended. However, one lecture is a wonderful commentary on Patrul Rinpoche's \\"The Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King\\" which demonstrates the Dalai Lama's great erudition, knowledge of Dzogchen, and his rare ability to translate complex concepts into simple language. He chose this text because it is (p. 91) \\"quite short but of great substance.\\" He also makes a very enlightening (for me) statement about a particular Dzogchen technique:p. 56: sky gazing: \\"direct your gaze toward the space between you and external phenomena.\\""},{"Title":"Dzogchen: The Heart Essence of the Great Perfection","review":"I thought people would be interested to see all the reviews given to this precious, clear, beautifully written book, so am posting them here.

I was in a french sangha of an internationaly known lama near Paris. This lama endlessly spoke (in videos, he was scarcely present) about dzogchen importance without never explaining the method of dzogchen. I was so glad to find this book! Unfortunatly when I read it, it appeared to me very criptic as written in a very erudite langage, and I am sory to tell that, very badly organised with a lot of citations without clear progression. And worst, there were several speeches or interviews turning around dzogchen lineage, but only one practice text: a Dalai Lama comment on Patrul Rinpotche's \\"The Special Teaching of the Wise and Glorious King\\". The practice described consists into sitting relaxed in Shine meditation, then shouting \\"phat\\" to frighten the mind which stops thougths, then be aware of the non dual consciousness of this state, then remain in it. Which is childlish: I don't expect the Dalai lama practice that, he who is not affraid by the practice of wratfull deities. Would him be affraid to the point of not thinking by just shouting \\"phat\\"? Seriously! If the pope was saying that everybody would laugh at him!He says himself that he chose this text because it is (p. 91) \\"quite short but of great substance.\\" And obviously not because he uses it for his own practice. It is just an oportunity for him to debate about dzogchen in the medieval scolastic tradition of Tibet, but not describe fully dzogchen practice. For me it is like saint Thomas d'Aquin books based primarily on sacred texts and not experience.I was not sure of that, me a small practicionner of shine, but events shown me that I was true. One year later there was still the same raw of this book, unsold because too erudite and not usefull. Finaly it was put in clearence sale, but still not sold! You imagine, Patrul Rinpoche and Dalai lama on dzogchen! One of the most profound text according to some lamas! Finaly there was a retreat with our lama and for the first time he spoke about dzogchen practice. He commented this text of Patrul rinpoche, but the text was distributed only to the happy fews belonging to the \\"mandala dzogchen\\" that is the old students. Most people where frustrated, but I said with discretion to people around me: don't care folks, it is sold at the bookstore in such book. At the break, the whole raw of books was sold!After the retreat I tried to discuss with people about the accuracy of the book, but they became nervous and agressive. Visibly no one had tried to practice according to this text, but they had great reverence to it, as it was said to them by the lama that they should have. And a lama is assumed to be enlightened! It seems that they did not even make the distinction between the simple practice of Patrul rinpoche who was a very simple man, and the complexity of Dalai lama erudition. They expected the practice so complex!

Her old family place in Maine, however, offers a prickly refuge. Indeed, Sarah Goodyear's first novel spendidly upsets expectations at every turn.

Throughout, too, we're never far from good-humored insight, though always at arm's length from treacly sentiment. Perhaps most impressive is how Goodyear sticks close to her protagonist yet exposes all the young woman's contradictions.

The pictures in this book look as if they were copied using an old copier from the 70s very dark and pixilated and hard to view. A book on photography, I would think, should have better images. This book looks as if someone printed it up in their basement. A much better buy would be \\"The Camera\\" by Ansel Adams.

Do people really want my opinion of Wordsworth as a poet in the same way they'd ask my opinion of the latest Harry Potter movie? There are countless critics much better qualified to pass that kind of judgement so I'll keep mainly to the specifics of this edition.As all the titles in the Penguin Classics series this one is very serviceable. It contains a generous selection of Wordsworth's poems as well as a goodish part of the 'Prelude'. 'The Excursion' on the other hand is not included at all, because Stephen Gill, the editor, didn't think its style lent itself to excerpts as in the 'Prelude'.The introduction is fine but a bit on the short side in my opinion. My main criticism is a general one directed against the workmanship involved in the production of all the 'Penguin Classics' titles. For $18 they feel quite cheaply made, the binding doesn't hold up well and the paper looks new the ugly yellow some paperbacks from the 1960 have acquired over time. Other publisher's manage to present the content more respectfully so why can't Penguin? Wordsworth definitely deserves it.The poems have a serene quality to them with a nice flow and none of the overwroughtness one finds in certain other romantic poets. That being said in larger doses I find the effect is a bit escapist as I distrust art that is too soothing."},{"Title":"Selected Poems","review":"As any fan of poetry will admit, Wordsworth is perhaps the central figure of poetry of the last two hundred years-- only Whitman contends with him in eminence. I love both (though I am partial to Keats!), and the fame of each is very just and in proportion with their merits.Wordsworth is a musical poet, in that his verse flows with a beauty of language that has no rival I have yet encountered save perhaps Yeats or Shakespeare. Even the latter two, though better poets than Wordsworth overall in my opinion, fall slightly short of his music. I find many of his poems very easy to commit to memory, because of this quality:She dwelt among th'untrodden waysBeside the springs of Dove.A maid whom there were none the praiseAnd very few to love.A violet by a mossy stoneHalf hidden from the eye--Fair, as a star when only oneIs shining in the sky.She lived unknown and few could knowWhen Lucy ceased to be;But she is in her grave, and Oh!The difference to me.That is from memory, and I memorized it almost effortlessly; I suspect most can do the same because this poem (one of Wordsworth's \\"Lucy Poems\\", some of the best in all literature!) has a certain rhythm and flow to it that makes it as easily committed to memory as song lyrics.There is in Wordsworth's poems a wonderful depth of thought, as well; common themes include lost youth, nature, and the poet's own mind (Wordsworth was notoriously egotistical). I find him a sadder poet than others do-- many read him as almost superficial or happy and joyous in nature, but I think this is too simplistic, as his poems resonate with a certain loss and regretful inwardness that really reverberates in my mind.He is commonly considered the greatest of the Romantics, a consensus with which I disagree. I prefer Keats and Blake (Coleridge might have been as good, had he written more!), but Wordsworth has been more of an influence on later poets than either, and I certainly do not shy from calling him among the greatest."},{"Title":"Parson's Pleasure","review":"Patricia Wynn has a nice, quiet style of writing that reminds me of Laura Matthews and some of the &quot;older&quot; style authors. She gets her facts straight without making a big deal of it or info dumping you. And in The Parson's Pleasure she tells the boy meets girl story from a slightly different perspective, that of a man forced into the clergy who really wants more in life.Miss Claire Oliver is the daughter of a Baron who lives a quiet country life with her loving parents. She is a young lady of good looks but not exceptional beauty, intelligent, practical and the possessor of a handsome portion. A portion whichshe gratefully knows will allow her independence after her parents pass on and she is left as a spinster, there being no one in their small community she desires to marry and not having found anyone during her one Season in London. It is not until the new parson arrives that she discovers just how much she would miss a lifetime spent with a man of her heart.Mr. Christopher Bennett is the son of the younger son who has had to depend on the grudging generosity of his wealthy cousin to make his way in life. The avenues which he wanted to explore, land steward to his cousin, member of parliament, have been denied him and he found that fighting the Americans in a senseless war while missing out on defeating the true enemy in France a waste of lives. Now his one path left in life is that of a clergyman but he is determined to do more with it than his lazy predecessor even if he puts a few noses out of joint in his efforts to help the truly needy. When he finds the woman of his heart, his position as a dependant poor cousin unable to support a wife truly strikes home.Claire and Christopher are delightful characters and it is sweet watching them slowly fall and admit their feelings to themselves. It is also obvious just how hard it must have been in this society to fall in love with one whom you knewsociety would not allow. Wynn tells a nice character driven slice of country life story with nary a Duke spy in sight. Unfortunately, she ends it with a convenient conventional HEA that sidesteps all the dilemmas she had given her two lovebirds. So a B for almost all of the book and a C for just the resolution."},{"Title":"Parson's Pleasure","review":"It was interesting to read a book that made known the daily life of a country lady. It spoke about how mundane it was and why any current news was so important-also why a new parson was a thrill - something new to gossip about!I enjoyed getting to know Claire Oliver. Her parents and she dealt with life in a mature and intelligent way. It seemed they knew how to be gracious and joyful. Mr. Bennett was an honorable hero, who had been pushed into the church. For once, it was the man with little control over his future. He made the best of it and still pursued his dream \\"to make a difference.\\"Mr. Bennett also realized that he could never marry Miss Oliver. Not only was she \\"above his touch\\" but his path was going to be a rocky one. He believed in making waves. Lord Babcock (babbling and cocky!) was a wonderful secondary character! His pursuit of Claire is hilarious, but when he really falls head over heels for Claire's cousin Lydia, it gets even better. All the secondary characters in this book are enjoyable including Claire's Aunt and Uncle (parents to Lydia).Not a lot of distress in this book, just some soul searching. It did get a bit clich&eacute;d in the end with how everything was resolved, but I will not disclose the ending. Needless to say, our hero & heroine fall madly in love and do end up together.Pleasant reading."},{"Title":"Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus : Delicious Dining Without Wheat or Gluten","review":"This book is chock-full of great recipes! There are over 200 recipes for everything from breads to pizza to desserts to sauces. There is a whole section devoted to menus, to help you plan a meal around the foods in the book. There are several wonderful appendices, including one on wheat flour equivalents, hidden sources of wheat, baking with dairy substitutes, and mail order sources for some of the more obscure ingredients used.My only quibble with this book is that it does use a fair amount of sugar (although brown, rather than white) in some recipes, which is not as healthy as it might be. But the author has another book which addresses this issue: Special Diet Solutions - Healthy cooking without wheat, gluten, dairy, eggs, yeast or refined sugar.All in all this is a marvelous book for anyone who is dealing with a wheat or glueten food allergy or sensitivity. Don't hesitate!"},{"Title":"Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus : Delicious Dining Without Wheat or Gluten","review":"This book contains my all-time favorite GF bread recipe. Carol Fenster uses stiffly-beaten egg-whites in many recipes to aid in rising and texture. An added benefit is, many of her recipes are lower in fat and cholesterol than other GF recipes. The recipes are well-written, easy to follow. This is the cookbook that I use the most in my everyday cooking as a Celiac."},{"Title":"Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus : Delicious Dining Without Wheat or Gluten","review":"This book is a great investment (and for those of us who live on gluten-free food, we all know how HARD it is to find anything for celiacs that's a bargain!)! It has over 200 recipies, but to be honest, there are a few that don't come out all that great. Still, a few out of 200 still makes this book a great investment!This book is divided by section; Breads: yeast breads, quick breads and breakfast breads; Breakfast and Brunch: breads, meats, cereals, casseroles and other dishes; Pasta, Grains, Beans and Rice: pasta, grains, beans and rice; Desserts: cakes, bars and cookies, fruit desserts, puddings and custards, pies, miscellaneous; Soups: soups and soup components; Sauces and Salad Dressings: salad dressings, chutney and salsa, sauces for entrees or vegetables, dessert sauces and miscellaneous; Vegetables: potatoes and miscellaneous; Poultry: grilled chicken, stove-top chicken, and baked dishes; Fish and Seafood: fish and shellfish; Meats - Beef and Pork: beef, mixed meats, and pork &amp; ham; Menus and finally, Appendices with valuable info like wheat flour equivalents and substitutes for wheat as a thickener.My only major complaint (apart from that some of the recipies don't turn out half as well as they sound, but then again, that's to be expected on a gluten-free diet), is that unless you like Mexican / south-western food, about a quarter of these recipies are of no use to you. Before being diagnosed with celiac I used to get terrible indigestion (the author claims her only problem with wheat and gluten was a runny nose and stuffy sinuses). For anyone who is a celiac, and who has experienced the horrible side effects of simply eating food before a diagnosis is established, you probably want to AVOID foods that traditionally cause heartburn or gas or other symptoms similar to what I call a 'wheat-attack'. I'm sure plenty of people out there are able to handle Mexican / south-western food, but a huge number of celiacs are sensitive to all kinds of food, and kicking food up with peppers and spices and whatever else is great if your sinuses are blocked, but after having heartburn for months on end, you might not be too eager to start cooking up a big ol' pot of chilli!Over all, it's still a good buy. I mean, even though I don't see many celiacs (espically soon after their diagnosis) cooking some of these things, it's a good book to have. You can make lots of things that are fairly &quot;soft&quot; on your tummy, and maybe after a little while (it's been almost 2 years since my diagnosis and I STILL won't touch a pot of chilli!) you can try some of these more spicy variations in the kitchen. If you're simply gluten-intolerant, or have sinus problems like the author, then this book is a great investment! If I weren't a celiac I'd definately give it 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus : Delicious Dining Without Wheat or Gluten","review":"Carol Fenster has given all of us that must eat wheat and gluten free such a gift! The time that it must have taken her to perfect such wonderful recipes is truly something not many have the time or talent to do. She has covered just about everything to make eating wheat and gluten free most delicious, indeed! Besides the delicious recipes she has included menus for Quick and Easy Dinners, Reduced Fat, Low Calorie Meals, Fish &amp; Seafood Menus, Poultry Menus, Southwestern Menus and Meatless Meals. And there are more treasures in the back of this great cookbook that are so helpful such as Wheat Flour Equivalents, Substitutes, HIdden Sources of Wheat, Mail-Order Sources etc. If you need to eat wheat or gluten free this cookbook just must be a part of your life! I wouldn't know what to do wtihout it!

Although there are recipes for many different types of food, my three favorites are for traditional &quot;wheat-replacers&quot;: Spice Cake, Soup Dumplings, and Pizza Crust. I would agree with the other reviewer below that Dr. Fenster does tend to use too much sugar -- who puts sugar in pizza crust? But the recipes are very flexible, and I find if I change the amount of sugar, or add carrot shreddings to a cake, or cream cheese to a dumpling - the recipes still work great! I highly recommend this book, not only does it include a ton of gluten-free cooking advice, but also has non-dairy substitutes for every recipe. I also like that she writes, for example, &quot;1 teaspoon GF vanilla&quot; instead of simply &quot;1 teaspoon vanilla.&quot; For the recently-diagnosed, this is a great reminder to check _all_ ingredients for gluten."},{"Title":"Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus : Delicious Dining Without Wheat or Gluten","review":"Many of the recipes in this book are very good, but some are only ok.

Coincidentally, some of the character names/personalities find their way to S.M. Stirling's alternate worlds novels as well."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"Everyone has heard of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. What many readers aren't aware of is that in addition to detective fiction, Doyle also ventured into historical fiction. Doyle's 1891 historical novel The White Company is one of his early efforts in this genre, and I found the medieval adventure great fun.Beginning in England in 1366, during the Hundred Years War, the novel begins with our protagonist Alleyne Edricson venturing forth into the world for the first time. Raised until age 20 in a monastery per his deceased father's instructions, those instructions also require that he go forth into the world for a year before he can choose to return to the monastery. The sheltered young man ventures into the world with little idea of what to do but to visit his older brother and try not to fall prey to the dangers the monks have warned him of.Alleyne soon encounters two companions, however. Hordle John is a rough and wild giant of a man who has been tossed out of the monastery the same day Alleyne leaves. Samkin Aylward is an archer just returned from France and service in the White Company, loaded with plunder, who regales Alleyne, John, and anyone else who'll listen with tales of his exploits. Samkin convinces Alleyne and John to join him in visiting Sir Nigel Loring, a brave and well-respected knight of England who he hopes to recruit as the new leader of the White Company and to return France and beyond for great deeds. Sir Nigel quickly agrees, as he is full of chivalrous fervor to do great deeds of battle and gain honor. Sir Nigel takes Alleyne as a squire, while Alleyne takes an interest of his own in Sir Nigel's daughter, Lady Maude. After months of preparations and recruiting of additional archers and men-at-arms, Sir Nigel leads the company abroad. Great deeds of honor are performed in France in friendly tournament before the White Company goes to Spain to face real war, and a variety of exciting adventures are had along the way.While reading The White Company, I couldn't help but be reminded of The Black Arrow, Robert Louis Stevenson's 1888 historical novel set a hundred years later during the Wars of the Roses, and also featuring a young knightly protagonist and daring adventures. As big a fan as I am of Stevenson, I enjoyed The White Company much more. The characters are much more likable, there's much more humor, Doyle keeps the medieval language much more accessible for modern readers, and overall, it's just a lot more fun. Doyle's action scenes - Stevenson's definite strong suit in The Black Arrow - are as good as Stevenson's, and the White Company leads in every other aspect between the books.I believe my fellow fans of J.R.R Tolkien would enjoy The White Company. Though a historical novel and not a fantasy novel, it shares some of the high and noble adventure that sets Tolkien apart from the more grim interpretations of fantasy. At times some of the beliefs of the day reflected in The White Company, such as a woman who has prophetic visions, are closer to fantasy than today's reality anyway. Had Doyle just put in a dragon for Sir Nigel and Alleyne to fight (although Tolkien would probably have had Samkin the archer deal the deal blow to the beast), this would have make a perfect fantasy novel.I read a version of The White Company illustrated by N.C. Wyeth. I first encountered Wyeth through his illustrations of many of Stevenson's works, and he really brings some of the most exciting scenes of the book to life with his art. Wyeth illustrating an edition of an adventure story is becoming a signal to me that I'll probably enjoy it.I highly recommend Doyle's The White Company to anyone who enjoys tales of knights, archers, and chivalric adventures, as well as to anyone who enjoys fantasy novels like The Lord of the Rings. I had read and enjoyed some of Doyle's Holmes stories before, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how strong Doyle's historical fiction was. I definitely plan to read Sir Nigel, a follow-up book from Doyle chronicling the early adventures of that character."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"Note: This review is of the 1922 hardcover edition published by the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation, New York, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"With this book set after Sir Nigel yet written prior, Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle has set the framework of chivalry as it should have been. Here you have charecters of honor and dignity who thought their honor was more important than life itself. Something modern society has lost."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"For anyone whose only expsure to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the Sherlock Holmes tales, this book will be an interesting read. It's a fantastic adventure book, featuring characters with depth set in a truly historical setting. Doyle did his research, and while the characters may be mostly fictional, the rest of the book is historically accurate."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"A romantic intperpretation of the 100 years war.

This book is clearly about HONOR, and our aspiring knight is on his walkabout trying to decide where he should spend the rest of his life. Our hero is educated and an asset to the company. But his moral training gives him a perspective that makes ordinary people and situations fascinating. This book combines the best of the movie &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. There is humor and adventure here. But never forget, it's about Honor, even when the characters are less the honorable.

But the text on many of the pages in my copy is faded, like a bad photocopy. Legible, but faded. I'd return it, but if they're all like that, there's no point."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"Chivalry may be on life support, but it's still breathing in the words of Arthur Conan Doyle's The White Company. Although he is well known for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was most proud of creating the noble knight, Sir Nigel Loring of the White Company.This book is set in the tumultuous days of the 14th century, when the political struggles among England, France and Spain, and the Crusades in the Holy Land, created instablity for peasant and noble alike. There are many heroes in the tale of knights and battles, but young Alleyne Edricson is the main protagonist. Sheltered in an abbey, where the orphaned lad was educated per his noble father's wishes, Alleyne is unwillingly shoved into the world for a period of a year, where he must decide whether he wishes to make his way there or return to a monastic life.It doesn't take long for Alleyne to meet with adventure. He is shocked to find the world is a rough and tumble place. But his straightforward and naive approach to life helps him out of some scrapes and endears him to some colorful characters who become his bosom companions. Together, they join the service of Sir Nigel, who is an unlikely hero with his bald head, bad eyesight and scrawny stature. That is, until he is able to prove himself in \\"some small feat of arms,\\" which is his favorite pastime. He is always victorious in these exhibitions of his knightly prowess, and he always has a kind word for the vanquished, his noble opponent. His motivation is always to defend the honor of his \\"lovely\\" wife, for whom he cherishes the greatest tenderness, although others wonder if this is due to his poor vision rather than any attractiveness on his lady's part.There are many satisfying battles and cliffhangers in this book. Sir Nigel plunges headlong into any opportunity for a fight. Alleyne becomes his squire and follows him to France, to fight for their Prince, Edward III, who wants to restore the vanquished king of Spain. Alleyne becomes adept at sword fighting and exhibits as much bravery as his lord. He is also motivated by the love of a lady, Sir Nigel's lovely daughter, Maude.I read this book aloud to my children, and we shared many moments of laughter as we followed the warriors from England to France. I struggled a bit with the French pronunciation of names and places (how do you pronounce \\"Blois\\"?), but it was a very funny and exciting book, and I'm glad we were able to read it together. Doyle was an expert on this time period as his mother read him many chivalric tales as a boy, exciting his interest in medieval times, which continued into his adulthood. The descriptions of weaponry, customs, religious life, clothing, historical events and geography permeate the story without detracting from it. There are numerous stirring and gory events (including pirates, hangings, peasant uprisings and decapitations...yuck), which will have readers on the edge of their seats. Of course, the illustrations by N.C. Wyeth added to our enjoyment.There is another book about Sir Nigel, a prequel to The White Company, called Sir Nigel, which we will have to read soon. He has become one of our favorite literary characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"I can't remember how I happened on this book- probably Amazon herded me to it- but I'm quite glad. I'm more of a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, but I found this as enjoyable as The Black Arrow or Robin Hood or any other medieval book that I've read, and I'd never even heard of it before. The protagonist is a young man raised at the monastery who joins a band of rough but good hearted archers and follows their exploits as they head to war in France and Spain. The old agnostic (Doyle) weaves in more respect for the Catholic church than one usually sees from so-called church leaders today, combined with some common sense insights of true morality. For Doyle chivalry not only is not dead, it'll cut off the head of anyone who says otherwise. In other words, a man's word was worth something, and a man's actions were worth even more. Lots of swordplay, a little (very little) romance, some interesting and well developed characters, and an undercurrent of humor. Not as clever as the Holmes books, but a lot more action, and one learns a little English history at the same time. I'd highly, highly recommend it for kids, or anyone really, and I am amazed that it's fallen through the cracks to this point- at least for me."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"I cannot tell you how much fun this book is...you will have to read it yourself. This is the kind of book that you must immerse yourself in. Give yourself the time to just sink into Conan Doyle's world. It is easy to do, because Conan Doyle had a gift for imagery. The book is so complete. It shows both the beauty and the barbarity of the times with complete harmony. It is also downright funny at times. I have found myself laughing out loud while reading this book, largely because of the language used. Yes, the language is sometimes hard to follow, but who wouldn't laugh at \\"I have been cozened and bejaped!\\"? I think the author does this on purpose because it IS funny. It is interesting to compare The White Company with Crichton's recent novel \\"Timeline\\", set in the same era. Both authors worked to bring the flavor of that time to the reader, but with vastly different aims and results. Anyway, give yourself a break and escape into another world. Go to battle with Hordle John, Sam Aylward, and Alleyne! Then go sample another of Conan Doyle's little known gems and read of the outrageous exploits of Brigadier Gerard!"},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"I recently purchased this book for my husband and myself to enjoy together. Needless to say, he's been hogging it every night. Occasionally I hear him giggling (at a passage) like a ten-year-old boy. From what I recall when I read this as a kid, this book IS the perfect adventure story. Complete with knights and archers both dashing and dumpy (Sir Oliver), and even pirates, it almost reads like a serial novel in this respect. One cannot, however, overlook or underestimate Doyle's brilliant use of medieval language in his dialogue, nor the sheer color of his vivid descriptions. This is a timeless book; one to get yourself lost in."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"This books is definitely the stuff of childhood dreams and imagination. Who among you can say they have never imagined themselves playing the part of the intrepid knight battling injustice or the damsel awaiting the return of his true love? The book follows the progress of an adventurous monk that has left the cloister and hitched his wagon to Sir Nigel's White Company, a group of English mercenaries seeking fight and fortune in France and Spain. Those young at heart will especially enjoy this tale. It is gripping without being brutal but with the endearing quality of a bed time or fireside tale."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"I loved this book as a kid, and found new depths to it when I came back to it as an adult. A must-read! The breadth of imagination and the color and vividness of the descriptions are hard to match, and the characters are memorable -- Samkin Aylward the master-archer is my favorite."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"The White Company is one of those books which lies completely below the radar. While we all know stories like The Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, Doyle's classic and simple-hearted story about English adventurers in the Hundred Years' War is a largely unknown work. I purchased it as a lark, and because it cost a single dollar, and its worth was proved to be many times repaid.In reading The White Company, it is best to set aside expectations of sophisticated or intricate character development--this is a story that does best with a sympathetic reader, already steeped in the daydreams of bygone days and lusty battle--and simply have fun. Also, this is the kind of book that a person with some grounding in history will get more out of than someone ignorant of the 14th century. Perhaps it's advisable to obtain a little background information before settling into the book; assumptions about educational background were--ahem--more stringent in 1900 than today.This is a man's story, to be sure, and it appeals to the insurgent lurking within all men. However, it isn't offensive to womankind, either, revealing the strength of the female characters as well. Enjoy with confidence.One last comment: If, at the end of the story, you don't a lump in your throat, or feel a stirring in your heart to don a steel cap, lace on a jerkin and take up a stout length of yew, you've missed the point."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"Though popularly remembered for the Sherlock Holmes stories, the historical novels of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are more illustrative of his literary flair and narrative skill.'The White Company' and 'Sir Nigel' are set during the Hundred Years War between England and France, focused around the figure of Sir Nigel Loring, a chivalrous knight whose thirst for honour and glory pull him and his companions into many strange and warlike adventures.Mixing real historical figures such as Edward III and the Black Prince with creations of his own, Doyle manages to weave a number of separate incidents into an interesting and highly enjoyable tale. At times very humourous, these stories nevertheless also describe the harsher realities of medieval war, presenting a colourful picture. Though characterisation is sometimes two-dimensional, Sir Nigel as the main protagonist is both funny and endearing.

Containing detailed descriptions of heraldry, castles, weapons, and cities, The White Company takes you back in time to the romanticized world of knight errants, damsels in distress, gallant squires, but does not shy away from the more realistic facts of Medieval life - starving peasants, blood-and-piss battles, captives and ransoms, rape, pillage, and plunder. The White Company contains, among other things:a chase with archers and knights,an awesome sword fight,a giant who can fire an arrow 600 metres,a sea battle between pirates and a merchant boat,a rampaging bear,a gunpowder explosion,an archery competition where Longbowmen shoot birds out of the sky,a pseudo-monk,a wrestling match in a tavern,a last stand between five knights and thousands of starving, crazed peasants,a huge battle in the end,a princess who lives in a nunnery,a lord and a archer taken slave,and much, much more. But the best thing is that the book won't drown you if you tie it around your neck and go swimming and if you put it in your suitcase it won't be overweight: The White Company is just the right length.On a different note, it must be remembered that Conan Doyle was INTENSELY patriotic and much of this book had parallels with England's situation then. So if you don't like that sort of \\"England is supreme. French are dogs.\\" sort of stuff, avoid....The White Company contains one of my favorite poems, an old archer's song: The Song of the Bow. I will show some of it here:What of the Bow?The Bow was made in England:Of true wood, of yew wood;The Wood of English bows;So men who are freelove the old yew-treeAnd the land where the yew tree grows....What of the Shaft?The Shaft was cut in England:a long shaft, a strong shaft;Barbed and trim and true:So we'll drink all togetherto the grey goose featherAnd the land where the grey goose flew....The White Company is one of my favourite books, and I have read many.

Robert Bringhurst recommends from 45 to 75 characters, ideally 66.Also, the margins are so narrow that you need to contort the book to be able to read the letters near the middle.Another sign of amateurish typesetting is that \\"symmetric\\" quotes are used.I guess this work is public domain.

And throw in a budding romance and you have one heck of a tale.

The The White Company was written before Sir Nigel; however, Sir Nigel (Nigel Loring) is set earlier and should be read first. Although famous for Sherlock Homes, Doyle was knighted for his historical novels of which these are two. Both books are excellent for young people forming their characters."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"The White Company, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is an inspiring tale of knightly honor and chivalry. Though famous for his Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in writing The White Company, produced an extremely vivid account of the horrors of medieval warfare, while mixing in moments of humor to create an inspirational and highly enjoyable tale.The protagonist, Alleyne Edricson, is a young man come fresh from the monastery to explore the world and all it has to offer, as his father had wished. Soon after leaving the monastery, Alleyne meets a beautiful young lady and her father, Sir Nigel Loring. Alleyne then becomes squire to Sir Nigel, a humorous and highly respected knight, and the adventure begins. While fighting abroad, Alleyne proves himself to be a worthy suitor for the lovely Lady Maude, Sir Nigel's daughter, and returns from the war as a courageous and honored knight to marry her.Though the characters are at times two-dimensional, Doyle does a superb job of endearing them to the reader and enabling the reader to feel as if he or she really knows the characters. The White Company, an escape fiction novel, is an excellent example of formula fiction. The characters are mostly stock, and the ending is a happy one. The worthy hero rescues the damsel in distress, loses her for a while, but returns to win back her love. Even though the novel contains some flat characters and stereotypes, a dose of reality is present in the horror of war portrayed by Doyle.This account of knights, war, and fair ladies is permeated with the theme of honor. The code of chivalry for medieval knights is a well-developed theme presented by Doyle. This valuable theme mixed with an enjoyable and funny story makes this novel unique. The White Company is a well-written, interesting book and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The white company, (Longmans' supplementary readers)","review":"If the Divine is in the details, than this novel is touched by It with easily readable and rich details alive with imagery.

There were some minor inconsistencies between the two books--which were probably occasioned by Sir A. C.

(I won't detail the discrepancies, so as not to diminish the reading enjoyment for those who missed them.) I was glad I purchased both books together, though, because they're both worth reading.

Alleyene intervenes, which causes his brother to set dogs upon him. Alleyene then decides to become a squire to a knight, the knight happens to be the beautiful young lady's father. Alleyene goes off to war and gets involved in battle. Some soldiers called Alleyene weak because he dwelled on the horrors of war, but Alleyenes friend explained his weakness. &quot; It is not weakness of heart, for I know the lad well. His heart is as good as thine or mine, but he hath more in his pate than ever you will carry under that tin pot of thine, as a consequence he can see further into things, so that they weigh upon him more.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brings the story alive with vivid detail and characterization.

Because it is based on the TCM archives it is very generalised and basically covers movies of the thirties, forties and fifties. The chapters are dictated by what is available in the archive so there is no collection of comedy classics, 'Mr Blandings Builds His Dream House', for instance and other light-hearted titles are included in the chapter called Battle of the sexes.The posters are presented in various sizes and mostly you'll be able to read all the text, especially the percentage credits that usually appear at the bottom of each poster. Some of this is quite interesting because plenty of people named are complete nobodies now. Rather annoyingly the whole page posters have been enlarged a bit too much so that bottom credits are missing.I think it is fair to say that there is not a well designed poster in the book, so no stunning Saul Bass work or Bob Peak graphics but you'll get to see the best portraits that Hollywood marketing departments could offer.Overall a good title to have if you like poster art and if you have an interest in the thirties have a look atReel Art: Great Posters From The Golden Age Of The Silver Screen, a huge, beautifully produced coffee-table book showing three hundred posters. A lot of MGM productions are in the TCM Archive and probably the most complete showing of this studio is inMgm Posters: The Golden Years, with 260 posters in a very nicely designed book.

Even the reproduction market is extremely busy reproducing these posters for those of us who can't afford the originals. This is a well diversified sampling of both high-profile classics as and \\"B\\" movies. The only short-coming of the book is that it only features the posters of three studios: MGM, Warner Bros., and RKO. Classic horror fans will no doubt be a little let down that Universal's films are not included. I'm not sure why but it's a serious oversight. The horror/sci-fi section is quite skimpy overall. It would have been nice to see \\"Mark of the Vampire\\" or \\"Doctor X\\". That little caveat aside this is a wonderful book for any fan of classic films."},{"Title":"Picture Show: Classic Movie Posters from the TCM Archives","review":"Some of the full-page reproductions are cropped - in the case of very well-known images like \\"Singing In The Rain\\", this is pretty painful to look at. This would be a fine, low-priced item otherwise."},{"Title":"Picture Show: Classic Movie Posters from the TCM Archives","review":"This book contains movie poster art that is the exclusive domain of the TCM archives. Thus, as others have already correctly observed, the movies are limited to RKO, MGM, and Warner Brothers. Someone else stated that the posters ranged from the 30's to the 60's, but there are some posters for MGM's silent films of the 1920's such as The Big Parade. I recommend it as long as you know the studios to which you are limited.Someone mentioned that they wished that there had been some Universal posters from the 1930's too. If that is what you are looking for let me recommendFilm Posters of the 30s: The Essential Movies of the Decade, which has movies from all the different studios for that decade. Also good isA Century of Movie Posters: From Silent to Art House. Seeing the very early posters in this second book is particularly interesting."},{"Title":"Lucrecia's Dreams: Politics and Prophecy in Sixteenth-Century Spain","review":"Story of Lucrecia De Leon whose \`dreams' embarrassed Phillip II and caused her to stand before the Inquisition as a heretic. Based on transcripts of her trial and other first hand documents, Lucrecia's Dreams is an important part of Early Modern Spanish history.

For. Legion Operation. The pictures and narratives are worth the price of the book. Yves Debay has done a great job on this book. Highly recommend it to any and all FFL admirers."},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"I realize that this book only deals with the pilot episode of the show, not with three episodes like the other two tie-in books. Therefore, there had to be a little something added to keep the book from being too short. Also, six months elapse between Catherine's attack and her seeing Vincent again. Readers may ask what happened during those months, so the author provides the answer. I don't like this answer. It takes away from the main story of Catherine and Vincent; the author spends way too much time on it. It involves a flood, of all things, and of course, a death. Obviously this book was written after Season 2, when the show developed the pastime of offing series regulars. Also there is an Asian girl in this \\"lost months\\" story named Kristen Ho whom I cannot stand. Vincent's community has welcomed her warmly, but she is very unappreciative, critical and downright rude. When she decides to leave the community near the end, I could only think as I read \\"Good riddance, Miss Stuck-UP! If she wasn't such a prominent character here, maybe my rating would be higher. I really prefer the other two books."},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"This is not merely a rehash of the first episode of the 1987-1990 tv series \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". It is a retelling of the story that introduces the characters adding depth, dimension and motivation not only to the characters, but to the story as well. What really happened to Catherine when Vincent left her at the basement of her apartment building after nursing her back to health? How did her friends and family take the news? More importantly, how did she manage to keep the secret of the tunnels and still explain her disappearance? I think Barbara Hambly does a wonderful job of taking these characters and situations and making them her own; adding more detail and information to explain what is not explained in the television show.If you are not familiar with the television series you can still read this book and understand the characters and stories.Some people objected to the added story of the flood and the character Ho, but I understand Ms. Hambly's reason in using them. When Ho explains to Vincent her reason for leaving the tunnels (and face it, they are credible), her reasons validate his desire and determination to see Catherine again. In the television show he just shows up on her balcony, but in the book, we understand what gave him motivation to return. Love was part of it, but not all of it.Ho may not have been the most likable character, but is everyone who lives in the tunnel likable or even supposed to be? We have only to see the character Cullen in the season one episode \\"Fever\\" to see the answer to that. Unlikable people and situations exist, yes, even in the tunnels.I found myself much more involved with the characters emotionally than even in the tv show because I could read what they were thinking. I liked this book much more than the other in the series: \\"Masques\\" by Ru Emerson. This one was much more interesting, well written and more like an original novel rather than an echoing of the script."},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"This is one of only three authorized and licensed novels about TV's beloved Beauty and the Beast TV show from the 1980's. It's my favorite show of all time! This one is slightly less engaging than the other two, but is still very good."},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"This review is done by the account owner's daughter.B. Hambly has done an exceptionally good job. I like how she made the characters of Vincent and Cahterine more in depth as to who they really are and what they are thinking (more deeply than you can tell on the TV show). I don't particuarly agree with the added events such as the flood, and simple characters that don't have any significance, but overall a very nice book to add to my collection!"},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"This early expansion sadly lacks dialogue and lays heavy on story-telling. Keep in mind this is an early piece of work. I would like to see more of this Author to truly understand her style.In years after this the fandom was gifted with Conzines that bestowed a wider view of this era of Vincent and Catherine's early relationship"},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"I would've preferred to have equal focus on both Catherine and Vincent as it was in the show not just focusing on Vincent. Also, there was some time of the book focused on a flood in the tunnels. I didn't really care for that. It didn't move the story along. But the main part was alright."},{"Title":"Beauty and the Beast","review":"A truly inspired retelling of Beauty and the Beast, filled with depth and heart. This novelization covers episode one of the hit 90s tv show Beauty and the Beast. In New York, a superficial socialite falls in love with a soulful man who quotes the works of great poets, yet cannot venture above ground due to his beastlike appearance. As with all her other books, Barbara Hambly does an incredible job bringing both characters and action to life. A must for each fairy tale fan!"},{"Title":"Somewheres East of Suez","review":"I really like and respect T Jones,a formidable personality on the sailing world and have enjoyed and treasure all of his early work.This book unfortunately doesnt measure up to those.A combination of ailing health and tough financial needs may have played a role.I gave a 5 stars because my admiration for this unique sailor and all he represented during my earlier cruising life."},{"Title":"The lost ones (An Evergreen original E-587)","review":"This short and unusual novel by Samuel Beckett, winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature (this book was the first major puplication of Beckett after the award was announced), depicts a \\"universe\\" that is made up of a flattened cylinder fifty meters wide and eighteen meters high containing 200 bodies of all ages. The insides of the cylinder are basicly featureless except for a few niches that can be reached by a few ladders (these ladders are the only inanimate objects in the cylinder). Some of these niches are interconnected by tunnels. The cylinder is lit slightly by a dim yellow light that is everywhere. The temperature changes from 25 degrees to zero in four seconds and then back again. Some of the people are searchers and are looking for an exit. Others are the vanquished. As time goes on, all become the vanquished except one. When I came to the end of the novel, all I could think of was entropy."},{"Title":"The lost ones (An Evergreen original E-587)","review":"Here is human motivation, hope and loss reduce to essences: small repeated gestures echoed in a repetitive language of intense poignance and beauty."},{"Title":"The lost ones (An Evergreen original E-587)","review":"I'm relatively new to Beckett, and so my only point of comparison is \\"Waiting for Godot\\". Look elsewhere if you want more of the majesty and humor of that work, but \\"The Lost Ones\\" does have its own charm.Give Beckett credit, he creates a world of his own, and unpacks it in exhaustive and minute detail. The complex social patterns that develop among the pitiable inhabitants is perhaps of greatest interest. All of this is described in Beckett's characteristically dense prose.Despite being serendipitously timed and thus receiving the Nobel Prize for literature, \\"The Lost Ones\\" is not itself a major work. Whether this particular experiment is enjoyable to you is probably a matter of taste, but it does have the advantage of brevity; like a Ramones song, if you don't like it, it'll at least be over before you know it."},{"Title":"The lost ones (An Evergreen original E-587)","review":"This is a very short work, but meaningful. I won't try to give a description of it, for that would be thoroughly useless and not do justice to the work. I will say that it is a must for fans of Kafka, and even existentialist writing in general."},{"Title":"Michigan: a history of the Wolverine State","review":"As a life-long resident of Michigan, I felt that I needed to know more about my home state. Dunbar and May's work did just that.Michigan : A History of the Wolverine State lies somewhere between a textbook and a more casual non-fiction text, with copious endnotes for the historian, yet a clear, flowing style for the casual reader. It would serve as an excellent text for a college course on the subject.I found reading this work to be immensely valuable and entertaining, and a great conversation starter. In it you will find explanations of the origins of nearly every facet of Michigan society. Beginning with the ancient history of the Native American tribes, and finishing with the education and tax reforms of the early 1990's, very little is left behind. You will learn such quirky facts as the meaning of the name &quot;Ypsilanti&quot;, why Kellogg and Post Cereals are both headquartered in Battle Creek, and the true story of the Michigan-Ohio border war. Comprehensive, lucid, and entertaining. Recommended."},{"Title":"Michigan: a history of the Wolverine State","review":"I had bought this book because I needed it for a class for college, and as I started reading it I started to understand the drama of how Michigan came about-It was a rough road for our ancestors. The authors pull you back in time in a way that it is not just a history book, but it kind of tells the STORY too."},{"Title":"Michigan: a history of the Wolverine State","review":"This is a very good book to read for Michigan history, starting with the very beginning to the new millennium. However, this book is too comprehensive for a college MI history class, which is what I had to read. I would have preferred pictures, yes I like pictures, of the history. Also, the lack of commas drove me nuts because the authors did not use them when they should have. I think the book could be reedited in a better way.All in all, if I had to say, the book is gives a great idea of MI, but it's so. freaking. comprehensive. The authors give percentages on pretty much every topic."},{"Title":"Michigan: a history of the Wolverine State","review":"I purchased this classic Michigan History used as a textbook for my community college class in Northern Michigan. It was a lot less expensive ordering it through Amazon. No waiting in line at the college bookstore. That was 10 years ago! I do local motorcoach tour guides in my area and this history book gives me a solid foundation of information to use in my tour narrations."},{"Title":"Michigan: a history of the Wolverine State","review":"This is the required text for a Michigan History Course I am taking at a local community college. Each chapter is long and lacking a true theme; I would describe each chapter as a collage of arcane and dense factoids in a topical fashion concerning Michigan History. The content in many chapters overlap and the lack of solid themes in each chapter, combined with names, dates, and too many statistics make each chapter difficult to summarize and assimilate. The authors are both deceased, Dunbar died in 1970, and May in 2003, so it could further use to be updated, and given a more modern analysis of the material. This book should be about 2/3 shorter. It needs heavy editing; someone to look at the content - really analyze it, then cut out the dead ends and dried leaves. Michigan has an interesting past, but you have to wade through a lot of minitiae to get it out of this book."},{"Title":"ABC","review":"Kids are funny, sometiemes they just never like a book, no matter its status as a \\"classic\\" or not, sometimes they're infatuated with one for a few days or weeks only to never return to it again, and then others, they return to constantly.This book is in the latter category for our now 2.5 year old, who has had it for about a year and a half or so, and still enjoys it a few times a week at naptimes and bedtime.It's nice reading to your kid the letters and the animals' names, you can establish a nice rhythm. And even though we don't really know what an Uakari or a Quokka is, the pictures are still nice, and it's fun to be silly reading those silly names.The artwork is really original, which in my view, is the book's selling point. These are not literaly renderings National Geographic style, but rather interpretations of animals, instantly recognizable, yet quite cleverly and uniquely drawn. One of the nicest aspects of this book is that it's both a traditional ABC book and a compilation of artwork at the same time!It's quite sturdily built, too! Nice thick boardbook-style pages, with a sturdy binding. Guaranteed to last! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"ABC","review":"Mathew Porter is a local Seattle artist that owns a very funky Art Boutique shop called Blue Bottle in Capitol Hill.

Each page of the book depicts a different animal: \\"I is for Iguana\\", etc. However, I was mildly surprised when I noticed that the R page has a pretty basic typo (\\"R is for Racoon\\" instead of \\"R is for Raccoon\\"). Obviously, it's nothing major, but it's somewhat irking since the book is meant to be a learning tool. I also think that some of the chosen animals are a bit esoteric for a children's book (Quokka? Nuthatch? Uakari?) It's a beautifully designed book, however, so if you can overlook these flaws, you will probably enjoy reading it over and over."},{"Title":"ABC","review":"I think this is a great ABC book!

This isn't as encyclopedic as Schwab's work, and it doesn't provide the umpteen variants and footnotes-atop-footnotes of Graves's work, but it does a better job than, say, the Bulfinch or Hamilton toward which the feet of the uninitiated are typically directed. I still think--regardless of the obvious juvenility (which I prefer to regard as juvenescence!) of the target audience--you can't do better than D'Aulaire. Their coverage is superior, their illustrations are unique and intriguing, the stories are expertly narrated, and you just can't ask for something that looks or feels more comprehensive and thoughtfully knitted together.

The photos and linguistic data are absolutely fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating! I have recently been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of this book- that many of the Northern 'Athapaskan' tribes are not totally 'mongoloid', as I had previoiusly surmised. I have discovered Indian (from 'India') and Turkish strains that are especially, concentrated in northeastern British Columbia and northwestern-Northwest Territory bands.

Morrison follows the majestic tree through all the seasons of the year, and depicts the diverse community of animals that live in and around it: the mourning cloak butterfly, red-tailed hawk, downy woodpecker, gray squirrel, honeybees, skunks, tree crickets, gray tree frog, and more.This elegant but earthy book is packed full of nature facts. The beautiful illustrations are rich in detail. It seems to me that Morrison has a deep reverence for nature; such a reverence is communicated to me through this wonderful book. If you've never had the urge to hug a tree before, you just might want to do so after reading &quot;Oak Tree.&quot;"},{"Title":"Oak Tree","review":"Gordon Morrison has produced a fine book in \\"Oak Tree.\\" With a single oak tree as the central 'character' of the book, he explores the life cycle of the tree through the cycle of seasons and over the lifetime of the tree. By including critters that live in, around, on and under the tree, a window into the ecological impact of trees is subtly gained. The book is easy enough to digest for the early elementary student (perhaps as a read-aloud), but the depth of material and beautiful pencil studies will interest any naturalist.As an artist by profession, I often choose books for my children based on the quality of the art and that is what first led me to this book. Morrison's watercolor illustrations are not cartoonish or child-like in any way - they simply and accurate depict his subjects. As a homeschooling mother, I pick this book up over and over again when discussing life cycles, seasons, food webs, habitats, teaching art and simply for enjoyable reading (sometimes when the kids aren't around).I loved this book so much, I just order \\"Pond\\" also by Gordon Miller and I am not disappointed."},{"Title":"The Yeagleys of Penryn: The Edward Hummer Yeagley family with genealogies of Jacob Jackle and John Hummer","review":"Probably not for everyone, but if you are a relation and interested in genealogy this book has lots to offer.

In fact, I had the privilege of participating in one of Don Wetmore's three day programs about 10 years ago, and still use his strategies today in my own business. My most recent book, 10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking (Warner Books, 2001) would not have been completed on time if I hadn't been well organized. As an international professional speaker, I spend a lot of time traveling and I know from first hand experience that there is a correlation between good time management and career success. Th opposite is true as well. Failing to manage your time will limit your opportunities for success.Beyond career success, however, managing your time effectively permits you to do more of the things you want to do and enjoy a better quality of life every day-both at work and at home. The K.I.S.S. Guide to Organizing Your Life guides you along the path to more effective time management, starting with the important step of balancing your life. After all, good time management isn't based on doing the wrong things quicker-that just gets you nowhere faster. Instead, this guide show you how to achieve better balance in every aspect of your life.Don has taken a complex topic and boiled it down to a simple step-by-step plan that can be readily implemented by all readers-and I like that. There's enough complexity in your life already; the last thing you need is an even more complex and cumbersome system to manage it! Luckily, Don has devised a easy-to-implement, 20-step action plan to organize your life. In fact, if you follow one of Don'd steps each weekday for the next four weeks, you will be surprised by the enormous strides you'll make toward managing-and enjoying-tasks and responsibilities that may have once seemed overwhelming.The methods Don writes about, and uses every day, are not lofty theory, but, rather, practical, common sense tools and techniques that he has tested himself; If they work for him-and they can work for you, too.Lenny Laskowski, Author of National Best Selling Book:\\"10 Days to More Confident Public Speaking\\"President of LJL Seminars(tm)"},{"Title":"KISS Guide to Organizing Your Life (Keep It Simple Series)","review":"Don Wetmore's &quot;Guide to Organizing your Life&quot; is a well-thought out, thorough and easy-to-read time management book.

The Aventures of Reddy Fox, being the first of the 20 bedtime story books, grabs your attention in this way.

I got this book for Christmas last year and read it for a book report. IT IS SO GREAT!These are the reasons I like this book:1. It's funny2. It teaches good lessons3. It made me imagine. (I even wrote my own sequel.)I have read many Thornton W. Burgess books and this is my favorite. He is my favorite author."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Reddy Fox","review":"This is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it. However, the prospective buyer should be informed that the illustrations in this Dover edition are NOT by the original illustrator, Harrison Cady. Instead, they are crude redrawings by another artist, Thea Kliros. Although they are better than the illustrations in the Dover titles for which artist Pat Stewart did the crude redrawings, they are not as charming as Cady's work.Some of the other titles in this Dover series of Thornton Burgess books do have original Harrison Cady illustrations.To get real Harrison Cady illustrations of this title, you'll have to buy a used book. There were two sets of original Harrison Cady illustrations for this title:-- Published by Little, Brown, with 6 full-page grayscale illustrations.-- Published by Little, Brown, with 10 full-page color illustrations.-- Published by Grosset & Dunlap, with 14 full-page line drawings, including line-drawing versions of all 6 original grayscale illustrations in the Little, Brown editions, plus many smaller line drawings. Also a paperback version of this published under the name \\"Tempo\\".The redrawings in this Dover edition are of the 6 Little, Brown grayscale illustrations.On the other hand, the cover illustration is one of only four special paintings Cady did of Burgess animals. As far as I know, the four Dover titles that have them are the first editions to use them. The price of the book is worth it for that cover alone.I recommend the Grosset & Dunlap (and Tempo) editions. Cady did them decades later, after he had grown as an artist. Even though the Grosset & Dunlap line drawings are simpler than the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations, they are more charming. On the other hand, the Little, Brown grayscale illustrations better show Cady's remarkable vision for Burgess' creatures, so if you can get both, that's ideal. But either one is better than the drawings in this Dover edition.The Little, Brown edition with the 10 full-page color illustrations was done about the same time as the Grosset & Dunlap drawings, but that edition is very rare."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Reddy Fox","review":"In another one of Thornton Burgess' books on the forest dwelling animals of green meadows and green forest, the mischievous Reddy Fox and his antics take center stage. Burgess uses poetry, humor and mischief to captivate his young audience. The story also teaches many morals, but not in the usual way: the narrator will often not explain why something is right or wrong nor will the characters express it. Instead, Burgess will tell a short tale which involves some sort of wrong doing, and that wrong doing will never go answered for. It is up to the reader to see this, which I think is one of the factors that made this a great book.We start out the tale with Reddy Fox going to live with his Grandma: Granny Fox, who teaches Reddy how to survive. Granny Fox is fiendishly smart and everybody in the forest knows this. Thus, the scourge of the forest, Reddy Fox, is developed and born. Later in the tale Reddy gets into big trouble, and his grandma and some of Burgess' other characters (out of sympathy, for nobody quite likes Reddy) help him out of it. Reddy and Granny then have to move on account of Reddy's actions.The main thing that I got out of this story, and that I think parents will appreciate is how some of the other characters in the story who generally don't like Reddy, decide to be nice to him on account of his troubles. Despite the fact that Reddy has at times tried to catch and eat those characters, which Burgess doesn't explain explicitly because after all, this is a children's tale.This book is 86 pages long, has very descriptive illustrations, easy to read font and a little bit of forest poetry (for lack of a better phrase) which usually opens up a chapter. The book is broken up into 26 chapters that are about 3-4 pages long. This book is meant for readers aged 9-12, but due to its short chapters, it can easily be read aloud to children of a younger age and I'm sure they will enjoy it. My kid does.Darien Summers, author ofThe Mischievous Hare, a children's book."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Reddy Fox","review":"This is great childrens book that show interactions between various forest animals.

I try to purchase all books available, on Pyrography. &quot;Learning the Art of Pyrography&quot; by Al Chapman, offers a very basic insight into wood burning. It did not offer much content, only lightly explaining various methods. If you are new to this form of art and want to get started, this will give you some clues. Including the purchase of tools, tips &amp; cleaning. Don't expect to find detailed information on techniques. However,if you're really serious and want something more indepth. . . . I would suggest Bob Boyers, &quot;The Amazing Art Of Pyrography.&quot; This book is a MUST! Al Chapman's book does include nice photos of wood burnings."},{"Title":"Learning the Art of Pyrography","review":"This book is a good beginners introduction to the wonderful world of Pyrography. Lots of color and illustrations with easy to comprehend text. I was a little disappointed in the photo references, which show an American made burning tool being used. This tool is not readily available worldwide and may deter a potential Pyrographer from pursuing the art any further. There are many other tools available for creating this art and it's a pity these options were not suggested in this book. The upside of the book is it's clear and precise layouts and (disregarding the obvious tool brand loyalty) the demonstration photos and sketches are first rate. I would have liked to see a bit more information on Pyrographing paper and gourds....Maybe Mr Chapman will honour us with a Vol.2? I think this book is must have for any Pyrographer, as any book of this type is always handy as a reference guide."},{"Title":"Learning the Art of Pyrography","review":"Have had this book for a couple of years now,and I love it.

This map also covers the 90-mile long Maah Daah Hey Trail, which connects all three units while going through the Little Missouri National Grassland.The map is done at a very useful scale. Though there's only about 500 feet of elevation in the entire park, there's a lot of fairly steep up and down in places. (That's why they called it \\"Badlands.\\") The contour lines show this very effectively, so you shouldn't be surprised.In terms of production values, this is the most beautiful of the Trails Illustrated maps that I have. Parcels of land are shaded by owner (national park, forest service, state of North Dakota, private) and the colors are well-chosen so that the whole map *looks* good. There are also colorful symbols for prairie dog towns, oil wells, water sources, vegetation, and other features. Again, it's just pleasant to look at in addition to being useful.Roads are marked so that you don't trespass, and the official wilderness areas are also clearly marked as such. All in all, it's what a topo map should be."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Here's one for all you that &quot;happen&quot; upon this book and haven't read the first book in the series --- you really don't need to read the first book. There's a synopsis in the beginning that gets the reader up to speed on what's happened, and then the reader can just jump right in. Granted, I would like to read the first book and the third book, and I probably will (actually, I know I will), but I just want to let anyone and everyone know that Williams has made it possible for anyone to pick up Stone of Farewell and jump right into it. I felt that Williams did an excellent job in creating an epic story that covers so many characters and locations. The plot was interesting all the way through, and the ending, while not really an &quot;ending&quot; in the literal sense, it is very satisfying regardless."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Ok, if you've made it through &quot;Dragonbone&quot; and are now reading this one, you don't have much farther to go.

This is getting a lot closer to what I'd consider great! Tad Williams has taken the all too familiar &quot;quest to defeat evil&quot; plot with which he began this series and molded, shaped and stretched it beyond its boundaries. The characters (particularly Simon) have grown since the last book in a realistic way, and the &quot;other races&quot; have their own cultures, strengths and shortcomings: Yes, even the noble Sithi have skeletons in their cultural closet. That was a surprise -- and in this somewhat overworked genre, surprise is a good thing!I'm glad I started this series and am looking forward to the next book!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This was by far the best book I ever read and positivly the most far reached detail book I ever read.

It is the story of Seoman Snowlock, formerly Simon Mooncalf the Kitchen Scullion and his friends Binabik the troll and Princess Miriamele. This is a great follow up to the Dragonbone Chair which if you haven't read, you need to read before reading this. In this, the second of the series, the forces of the rebel Josua Lackhand are beginning to organize. But the dark powers that have been ranging throughout the land will do anything to stop them. This is a great book that any fan of fantasy will thoroughly enjoy. Williams expands on already fleshed-out and memorable characters and introduces some more. No other series except maybe Lord of the Rings has such an epic feel to it. You really feel the enormity and difficulty of the task that is before the characters. Loaded with intrigue, battles, mystery, and romance this book and the rest of the series are a requirement of any fantasy fan."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"A former student recommended this series of books to me.

The answer is: Definately. The trilogy really picks up momentum about half way through this book, dragging the reader, spellbound, through it, and after reading this book, I was clamouring for the next. Throughout this book, Williams enhances the intricate and wonderful world of Osten Ard and weaves tangled webs of intrigue, love and hatred between all the characters that he has painstakingly painted hitherto. If you've read The Dragonbone Chair and are wondering whether this book is worth reading - yes, a million times yes."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This book begins the quartet of &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn,&quot; and is one of the better fantasy series currently available for reading. Well written, with a developed mythos, good characterization, and solid plotting, this series must stand as one of the better, if not among the best, of the fantasy series availble for reading. Much of the story and world are freshly rendered, and rarely does the reader encounter the overly familiar or implausible contrivances that plague so much of contemporary fantasy fiction. Nor are the characterizations idealized or juvenile. While this series does not rise, for me, to the imaginary involvement of works such as &quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; the first three &quot;Chronicles of Thomas Covenant,&quot; Bradley's &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; Kay's work since &quot;Fianovar,&quot; and Martin's or Jordan's (despite its flaws) ongoing series, nonetheless, I cannot recommend this quartet highly enough.One note of caution: Action addicts may have difficulty with the &quot;Stone of Farewell&quot; as the first 150 pages are devoted to establishing background and character development of the main protagonist, but I believe if they perservere, only the true adrenelin junkie will feel short-changed. And for you, there is always Eddings or Bradshaw or comics."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I'm not going to rehash the earlier reviews, but I did want to add my two cents to the mix.This was a thoroughly enjoyable second book in a well-written trilogy. True, the main character does have to bumble around a bit as an adolescent before he comes into his own, but that's standard fare for most fantasy trilogies.Williams does an excellent job of fleshing out the characters and the situations. In fact, he's one of the best sci fi/fantasy writers I've come across in a long time at honing the descriptive aspects of everything in a story. It helps bring you into the scene that he so masterfully paints for you.I'm in the middle of the Belgariad series by David Eddings and I have to say Williams' Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy trumps it (even though it's some of Eddings' earlier writing). I've purchased the first of Williams' Shadowmarch series and I anxiously await more.In essence, if you're on the fence about purchasing this and like epic fantasy, I wholeheartedly encourage you to try it. I believe you'll sincerely enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This book is faster paced than the first and much more enjoyable. All the strengths of the first (identifyable world, characters) are present, its just faster paced. A good story, but destined to get better - the final book(s)is my favorite of all time."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The Stone of Farewell is Tad Williams' middle book in his epic fantasy saga Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. It is a definite improvement of the first book, though it doesn't shake off all of the first book's ills.The prose is much improved. Williams finally finds his knack for incredibly descriptive and oddly intriguing metaphors. Gone are the obtuse puzzlers from the first book. Williams' ability to compare unlike things to really draw a mental picture is quite good and will leave you with some very striking imagery.Having said that, the editing is still terrible. Misplaced punctuation marks, especially periods, really break up the flow and pull you out of the moment. As with the first one, I'm not sure if this is just poor editing or a byproduct of converting the paperback to the Kindle edition, but it's terrible.The plot and characterization are a mixed bag, but the bad parts aren't so unpleasant as to drive you away from the book. The pacing is still very off, which I think drives the oddities with the plot and characters. Williams spends a lot of time showing that Simon, now a more mature young man (sort of), is still just a teenage scullion-turned-warrior who doesn't want to get up early, doesn't feel like saving the world, just wants to go home to be a scullion again. While intriguing at first, by the end of the book Williams presents so many examples of this that eventually you get tired of Simon's whining and just want to reach through the book and slap him. Even by the end of the book, after all the horrors Simon has lived through, he still acts like a whiny brat at times. Williams drags Simon's hero's journey out just a little too long, making Simon's in-between phases just a little too pronounced. This seems to throw the character into fits of going a little out of character one way when he's been acting the other.Miriamele's journey with Cadrach is another example of a plot line drawn farther out than it should have. At first, the odd pairing of a princess with a drunkard, thieving priest seems interesting, but after the umpteenth time that Cadrach gets drunk and does something shady to or with Miriamele, you begin to wonder when it's all going to come together.In all, the second book does a serviceable job of what most \\"middle of the trilogy\\" books should do: It serves as a bridge between the first and third books, getting the characters from the end of book one to the beginning of book three. If the entire book could have been trimmed by 50 or so pages, it would've been splendid."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Anybody that has read Dragonbone Chair knows about those dreaded first 200 pages, This has has very few boring pages, of endless landscape and people getting introduced. In this book the first 200 hundred are the most exciting, they're four groups of people, and three single individuals that the book follows and when one seems to to be out of the clear the other seems to get it in trouble. It keeps the pace pretty rapid, not that there aren't a few chapters that you have to sludge through, there are, but they are few and far between. the Maedgewin chapters are little to slow for me.The best part is how Williams ties all these characters together, its reminiscent of the Two Towers, but instead of multiple chapters to one character he will tell multiple story lines during a chapter, which sounds confusing, but it makes perfect sense the way it is told.In the first book I was really confused where people were in the land, he does a better job with making that make sense and keeping the reader in the loop of where characters are relation to one another.It a great read and I'm on to the next book To the Green Angel Tower."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"As the second novel in Tad Williams four part trilogy, \\"memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\" \\"The Stone of Farewell\\" suffers from very few of the defects that made the first book, \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" kind of hard to like-at least in it's first forth or so.From page one this book is all action. Josua Lackhand, the high king's brother, stronghold has been broken by his brothers new and very deadly and evil allies the Norns-along with one of the red hand, the Storm king's undead five fellows. Josua himself escaped with a very small band of followers but in the falling of the castle not only men were lost-precious knowledge and the last remaining master of the league of the scroll are gone- leaving massive riddles to be untangled.But nothing can be figured out if there is no safe haven for Josua's people. And so along the increasingly unsafe dream road and through wise women and men it is passed that they must go to the stone of farewell-an old Sithi gathering place where they can regroup. But first they must win their way through the oldest and deepest of Osten Ard's forests and across leagues held by unfriendly peoples.Simon and his mixed bad of human, troll and Sithi seekers succeeded in their quest for the great sword Thorn in the frozen north but a high toll was taken by the minions of the Norn Queen and an ancient ice dragon. But their mission is by no means over-many things hinder the group in returning the sword to Josua.Miriamele, the high king Elias' daughter, abandoned her father in favor of her uncle but is determined not to sit about and wait-so she took off for Nabban, the lands her mother hails from to try and gain support for Josua's cause-with only a corrupt and highly secretive monk Cadrach, who has an extremely mysterious past. Once again Miriamele travels as a black haired boy instead of a blond noblewoman- but even in disguise a princess may be recognized-and used as a powerful bargaining chip...And in the swamp lands of Osten Ard-a place called the Wran-a man named Tiamak sends and receives small gray birds of the very kind used by the scroll league-but of the very little news he receives from the few members still answering him, all is troubling and indicates he may have to leave his enclosed society behind and seek out things he has only every dreamed of.Filtered through the rest of the book are more questions-about the Sithi, about the three great swords and how to use them, about the Storm King-about the very nature of Osten Ard itself. And more then one battle-as nearly all free people in the nation have come under attack from Elias and those loyal to him.Like I said this book moves at a breakneck pace. From crisis to crisis, fight to fight and flight to flight we follow the action of this wonderfully complicated story. The characterization remains very real (especially Simon's continued evolution from boy to man, mooncalf to, well, man) the detailed description of the landscape is almost unreal and the shivery nature of the threat faced is almost leaping off the pages.It may have taken him a while but when William's got this story moving he really got it moving!Five stars."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"In part two of the epic story, williams again tells a great story that you just don't want to put down.

I have the last two books in the series and cannot WAIT to read them!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"After reading this second volume in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, I am of mixed feelings. While Tad Williams is undeniably one of the most talented writers at creating vivid and emotional scenes, plus the story and the characters are believable and easy to love, I can't help but to feel a little cheated. After DRAGONBONE CHAIR, I was expecting this book to pick up right where the exciting end of that book left off, with the forces of good and evil ready to duke it out in a glorious show down and the first of the 'star swords' recovered and ready to be put to use. Instead, I was disappointed to find these characters I love being relentlessly whipped and chased towards a strange goal that they know nothing about. Chapter after chapter of desperate, cold, and weary heroes just gets old after a while.The brief episodes of action seem thrown in to placate the reader, but don't usually contribute to the overall progression of the story. Actually, at the end of this book, I felt as though I didn't really understand what was happening on the whole any better than I did after the first. Not even the characters grow in any major ways that I could tell. Simon Snowlock is still the self-pitying 'mooncalf' from the first novel and Josua Lackhand still has no idea of how to overcome the overwhelming odds he's up against. While every Williams novel I've ever read could have been edited down some, most of them at least reward you with progression through the story.Of course, I can't say that I'm not looking forward to the next in the series, praying that all of my questions will finally be answered. I love the world Williams has created, with its multitude of races and realistic personalities, not to mention its absolutely fascinating mysteries and secrets. I tell myself that there is no way I could be disappointed in the final book!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The Stone of Farewell is the second installment in Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn series. Like the first installment, this is a hefty-sized book that will keep the fantasy enthusiast well-entertained for some time.Please know that epic fantasies are not for everyone. They are bigger, slower, and involve a whole lot of characters (many with goofy names). Personally, I enjoy the bigger stories as I feel it just makes the fictional world more real and enjoyable, but I understand others may feel weighed down by all the detail.Stone of Farewell is divided into several storylines as characters are all over the place doing very different things. You'll follow Simon, Binabik and Sludig as they try to bring the magic sword \\"Thorn\\" to Josua at the Stone of Farewell. You'll also follow Prince Josua and his remaining party from the disastrous fall of Naglimund as they also seek the Stone of Farewell. You'll tag along with Miriamelle and Cadrach as they just try to stay out of trouble, rather unsuccessfully. You'll spend more time with Tiamak, the swamp native who is a member of the League of the Scroll as he really makes his way into the story. And you'll also follow along with Eolair and Maegwin as they adjust to life under the mountains, and what they encounter there.Sure, it sounds like a lot to keep up with, and it is. But Williams does a good job of keeping most of these storylines engaging. The only one I didn't care for much was Miriamele and Cadrach's. I didn't find these pages particularly exciting. In fact, at times, I thought their story could be told in half the time that was spent on them.Williams writes beautifully, decribing scenes in wonderfully vivid details. The characters feel like real people. It is rare that I would think that one of their actions seemed completely unreasonable for their character.This is an enjoyable read, and if you read the first book, you really need to read this one. It's even better. I can't wait to get through the third. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The Dragonbone Chair was an amazing opening to the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series and Stone of Farewell is a wonderful sequel. In the first book we journeyed with Simon from the Hayholt to the far north, discovering ruins of ancient cities, visiting castles, and seeing the wonders of Urmsheim -- all of which Tad Williams paints with such imaginative delicacy. That's one of main things I love about Tad's style, and all the characters and everything in the world is so alive and intricately detailed as a result. And he not only continued in that direction from The Dragonbone Chair but surpassed it in many ways as well.If you've read The Dragonbone Chair, you'll know that things are looking pretty grim for all involved at the end. Stone of Farewell sees the characters continuing their journey towards the one place that is their last hope for safety. There's many great twists and turns along the way, but it's the arrival at a certain city towards the middle of the book that is the real highlight of Stone of Farewell -- that and the city's citizens who are easily my favorite created race ever, be it sci-fi or fantasy.It's no ordinary arrival either. As one of the characters mentions: \\"It is not a road that takes us there. It is a sort of song.\\" This is just one sort of wonderful exoticness that defines this place, and it goes even deeper. It is definitely the most imaginative and well realized place in the entire series -- there's a few odd rules of its own that make it seem like the characters have discovered another world almost. Never have I read anything before that was described with such fantastic imagery and in such a beautifully vivid way -- strangely simple yet alien-like. The city, the events there, and its strange inhabitants are bound to be burned into my mind for years to come -- as will the book as a whole.While it's not my favorite book in the series, the visit to said city is one of the most impressive and remarkable things out of any of the books and probably one of the first things I'll think about whenever this series comes to mind in the future.5/5 for this book and the series itself.P.S. If you plan on buying these books prepare some free-time, because you're bound to get lost in this series for weeks -- I did. It's that good."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"If you are into fantasy you will really enjoy this series of books that the author wrote. Suggestions that I would have would make sure that you read the books in order and do not try to read the book fast and before you move on while reading the story make sure you know what is going on because if you do not you will become confused and have to go back to find out what you missed and by doing this you will enjoy the series much more."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I'm the type of fantasy reader that will plow through 1,000 pages in 2 days if the book is good enough. This one took me 6 months - it just couldn't hold my interest. In the meantime, I read Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy and Patrick Rothfuss' two new books - both series I find much better than this one.

I didn't have to speedread my way through as much long winded explanations, there still is a lot...but it is much easier to find the story. The pace is much better.

I love the Sithi, who are basically Japanese Elves with some native americanism thrown in. In fact I love the Sithi and Tinukedaya too much and lose interest in the human characters. I certainly don't need to hear silly preaching about Jesus (Usires) in such a fantastic world and the inclusion of Rome (Nabban) and catholocism is just unnecessary. That being said the Sithi world is fantastically realized along with the troll society early in the book. The Wrannamen culture is also interesting. I'm looking forward to reading the third book again. Truth be told if I could spend the rest of my life among scantily clad immortal Sithi women in a city of summer, a future the character Simon was so unhappily facing at one point in the story, I think I could die a happy man."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Tad Williams extraordinary in his ability to capture the veteran fantasy reader with new and exciting images and stories."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Stone of Farewell is the second book in the fantasy trilogy Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn by Tad Williams. The first book is The Dragonbone Chair. Williams is an exceptionally gifted fantasy writer in the style of Tolkein. For Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, Williams gives us the world of Osten Ard. There are parallels to our own world - regions that are cold with races resembling the Vikings (Rimmersmen) and Eskimos (Quanuc trolls), South Seas (Wran/Wrannamen), grasslanders, coastal cities, and the mysterious eternal summer land of the Sithi, a race resembling elves. There are forests, mountains, a vast ocean, and an ancient abandoned underground city. The reader just gets lost in the book, and the journey of the many characters.The main characters are Simon and his troll friend Binabik and his Sithi Prince friend Jiriki. They are travelling across Osten Ard to try to find Prince Josua, who has been ousted by his brother the king. The king has made the evil priest Pyrates his chief counselor. The book switches from one group of characters to another. There is Josua and his ragtag band of escapees, the king's daughter, Princess Miriamele and the mysterious monk Cadrach, and a group going to investigate the abandoned underground city.Winter is creeping over Osten Ard, as the evil Norns are leaving their home in the ice lands of the north. Three swords called Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn have great power. The corrupted king has one, Simon has one, and the other is missing. No one is safe. Even the lectern (pope) and the belief in Usires (Jesus) are not enough to stop the vile Pyrates and his scheme to use the kingdom to aid his evil master.Williams writes with descriptive skill such that you fall into the book and into this world. There are some chilling parts that scared me pretty bad. There is some romance but not too much. Lots of adventure, challenges, magic, tragedy, lore and legend.Highly, highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This definitely had the feel of a filler book, setting up the final book of the series. This book just felt like all the characters were on a journey that never ended. Not enough action I guess is what I am saying. No, I'm not slamming it, because I thought the climax was pretty good, but I couldn't help feel relieved when I had finished it. I do think there is great potential for the final book (1600 pages in 2 paperbacks), but I hope the future books don't take as long for something to actually happen."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"In the second book Semon finds himself in the troll community in which Binabik left long ago. From there he ends up a sort of prisoner of the Sithi. Along with the king's daughter who is stuck on a boat which is owned by an Earl who is under the direct control of her evil father's councilor. So many points going on at once but Tad Williams keeps going strong."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"A lot of readers seem to like &quot;The Stone of Farewell&quot; better than &quot;The Dragonbone Chair,&quot; but I felt the opposite. In this second volume of Tad Williams' breathtaking series, the action seems haphazard and events or plot drive the story, rather than characters. Some readers think this is an improvement on the slower pace of the first book, but I enjoyed the slow beginning and beautiful background scenery of &quot;The Dragonbone Chair.&quot;While I still count this series as one of my all-time favorite fantasy epics, it let down my expectations after reading the first book.I found myself eager to reach the end of each chapter and a change of scene and characters instead of enjoying every detail as I had in the first book. Action seems to happen randomly and pointlessly, especially to Simon and Binibik. When Simon arbitrarily slams headlong into a tree while fleeing the witch-girl's house, I almost stopped reading from annoyance. And that incident sets up Simon's storyline for the rest of the book! Hadn't we seen him starving and whining by himself in the forest already? I didn't really like seeing the Sithi homeland either; I loved the first book because it kept the Sithi distant and mysterious, and something was lost in this book.And when haphazard events aren't happening, the pace drags. It took me forever to get through the chapter where Maegwin encounters the Dwarrow.Most disappointing of all, though, was the development of the female characters. Maegwin going mad, unable to handle her grief and her feelings for Eolair? I liked her because she seemed strong and practical and ready to be a competent leader to her people, but in this volume she acts like a child throwing a tantrum.And Miriamele is no better. She has no control over anything that happens to her, although I really liked the scene where she threw Cadrach overboard. But Cadrach is also one of my favorite characters (and I'd like to know what terrible things happened in his past!) and later it seemed clear that he was trying to repent and that Miriamele should be able to trust him, but she is really mean and childish to him. And letting that lord on the ship seduce her at the end? I know she felt frightened and alone, and that it's a sign of good storytelling when characters have weaknesses, but I was very disappointed with her.There aren't very many female characters. Williams might have kept one of them emotionally strong.Despite all that, though, I enjoyed reading another volume of an epic filled with depth, beauty, and mystery. I hope the last volume improves the series."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"&quot;Ender's Game&quot; falls flat when I compare it to &quot;Stone of Farewell.&quot; Ender has conflicts that are not really quite conflicting development-wise. Hel-loo! He is six years old at the beginning of the book with the mentality of a 30 year old. &quot;Stone&quot; leaves us with characters that we can watch as they develop. Besides that, its a darn good read.The beginning of it takes place with Binabik and his people, and its not boring. No, its fun. (Not just because Binabik's one of my favorite characters!) Williams knows how to write, unlike some other people out there. And he gives us thousands of pages per series -- I'm all for the gargantuan novel thing. He doesn't pointlessly babble. He is as worthy of note as George R. R. Martin -- by the way, Martin read MEMORY, SORROW, AND THORN, and even picked up a few tips from Tad. (The comet = the Conqueror Star, the Dothraki = upside down Thrithings-men,...and whose to say that Qantaka (sp?) didn't inspire the direwolves!., etc.)Begin with &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot; -- pull through the fifty or so introductory pages -- and READ THIS SERIES. Then get your copy of OTHERLAND, vols. 1 and 2, and enjoy. Unfortunately, you will have to wait for vol. 3. Sigh. Of course, you can read &quot;Child of an Ancient City&quot; while you're waiting, and pick up a copy of &quot;Caliban's Hour&quot; at your library or used bookstore. I will shut up now. I think that you get the idea."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Love the series, which is why I also purchased the Kindle edition. However, the publisher needs to hang their collective heads in shame. Not only is the Kindle price a dollar more than the paperback, it was loaded with misspellings, missed punctuation, and in many instances wordswerejustcrammedtogether. Is there no such thing as proof reading or even spell check any more? My guess it was typed by non-English speakers.

The author's wonderful writing compliments reasonable action with thorough imagery of emotional and physical exertion.The mixed perceptions concerning Simon's component in the developing saga craft a skilled story despite his irksome self-pity \\"scullion\\" comments. While the separate yet elegant storylines involving Maegwin and Miriamele maintain the overall plot continuity, the fascinating adventures devoted to Josua and Deornoth may grab the reader's greatest attention. The outcome of Ingen Jegger from the prior novel becomes spellbinding whereas Duke Isgrimnur grows engaging near the end with a phenomenal discovery.Sufficiently detailed maps precede each of the three sections relating to the Storm King's tactics. Conventional characters and races inhabit the vivid realm, such as the Sithi or Fair Folk containing Tolkien's Elven traits and mannerisms. The great assortment of royal characters might leave one hoping for a more comprehensive appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order or with a genealogical chart.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"\\"Stone\\" continues right where \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" left off (in rather climactic fashion). Well, this sequel moves slower and IMO is somewhat less satisfying. I give it 3.5 stars (I really wish Amazon had a ten-point rating system). It's well written and we learn much more about the mysterious Sithi, as well as get some helpful background on the evil Pryrates and his superiors the Queen of the Norns and the Storm King. However, the plot meanders with few events of real importance.Williams tackles several disconnected threads at once but fails to allow anything momentous to happen in any of them except at the end of the book, with Simon in the Sithi vale. So as a result, the novel kind of drags and serves mainly to make the situation of Josua and his allies (the 'good guys') look even more desperate than it was before. Which means the third book's going to have to have quite a few dramatic events in it. No wonder Williams had to split the third book into two large paperbacks: there was simply too much to turn around for the good guys to win.I don't have much more to say. It's a good book, just not that exciting. It's the middle of the series and is typical of most books in that position: more buildup than real action."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Stone of Farewell by Tad Williams is the second book in the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy.This book picks up right after the end of The Dragonbone Chair, and continues the story of Simon and the friends that follow him through the story. This book also does a good job of exploring the secondary plot-lines that were merely mentioned in the first book. When thinking how to review this book I thought back to what really happened in this one, in terms of memorable events and plot shifts etc. Yet, the more I thought about it the more I realized not a whole lot really happened in this book. That's not to say this is not a good book, it is well written for sure. However, the premise seems to be character development and advancing the characters to the point of the next book To Green Angel Tower.The character development in this book is fantastic. Williams does a very good job at showing how the characters choices they make can affect them down the road. For instance, the choices the character Simon makes throughout the book reverberate during the later half. The Sithi are also shown the power of their choices. I could list more examples, but I won't bore you. I was a little disappointed that there was not a larger development of the character Elias, hopefully that will be rectified in the third and final book.The plot line of this book seems to amble along without much teeth to it. Again, that's not to say it's a bad book or bad plot, just that it is slow moving. For fans of an action packed novel, this is certainly not the book for them. For fans of books that make you think and that take time to develop this would be a good read for them.I think it needs to be said that Tad Williams is not the prototypical fantasy writer. Many fantasy writers jump right into a plot and character development. However, Williams is more of a painter with a broad brush and takes his time in the development of both his story and his characters. I can easily see some fans of the genre would not like Williams' writing, so if you do read these books just be aware of that.I would recommend this book, and the one before it, to fantasy fans who do not expect an action packer novel. It is a refreshing read and one that should be read by many people. It is quite a long book though and I see the 3rd book is even longer, so be prepared to spend some time with this one."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I just finished this book.. over the past week it was hard to put down. Williams is a master at bringing his characters to life, and I was repeatedly blown away by his use of words when describing Osten Ard. He brought the world to life in a way that far surpasses some of the other fantasy 'writers' out there, who write like ESL students. Very fresh, unique, personal style.BUT I have one major issue: NOTHING happens in this book. Not much happened in Dragonbone Chair either, but that's fine because it had the discovery aspect.. you were still meeting new characters, taking it all in.. but at volume 2 that enthusiasm runs dry, and it's time to make these grunts WORK. Yet there wasn't much of the intrigue and exciting plot that some other reviewers mention. This book was 760-odd pages - and yet now at the end I can remember clearly how it started since the chain of events was so SHORT. If you like having the whole situation turn upside down, if you genuinely like being surprised by new developments, if you like intrigue, then look elsewhere. This tome rumbles by like an old tractor. A beautiful old tractor, to be sure..What redeemed the book for me, and what gave it 4 instead of 3 stars, was the fact that Williams made all the characters real and lovable. Even though the plot sure as hell didn't keep me excited, I still wanted to see what happened to them. Binabik is by far my favorite. There are a few passages where Williams almost effortlessly describes the nuances of his peculiar way of talking and acting.. in the end I feel like I have been hanging out with Binabik face to face. The way the characters interact is also very compelling. The tensions between them make them more real. Miriamele and Cadrach in particular (each poking holes into each other) and Binabik and Sludig too. As the book goes along you just can't help but follow along, eager to see what happens to them.In short, if you want a slow and yet indulgent, beautifully written ride and don't care that much for plot and intrigue, then check this out (Dragonbone Chair first, of course). I will soon be picking up Green Angel Tower."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This is the second volume in the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Tetralogy (starting with The Dragonbone Chair, ending with To Green Angel Tower: Siege and To Green Angel Tower: Storm).As the great Storm is building up in the North and a terrible winter is spreading all over Osten Ard, Simon and his friends escape from Yiqanuc and start their long and perilous journey down the mountain and across the frozen plains to the Stone of Farewell, where they have to meet Prince Josua's party of exiles and deliver the sword Thorn.In the meantime Princess Miriamele, accompanied by the enigmatic Brother Cadrach, travels southwards to seek help from her family, Maegwin and her folk hide in the Grianspog caves, where she discovers what seems like an ancient Sithi city, and King Elias and his advisor, the red priest and alchemist Pryrates, conspire with the evil Norns.A great epic, full of unexpected new turns as the plot unfolds, varied characters you get immediately attached to, and marvelously detailed descriptions, like those of the beautiful legendary cities of the Elf-like Sithi folk. Definitely a great read. Can't wait to read To Green Angel Tower."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"SOF picks up where Dragonbone Chair left off. It is much faster paced than Williams first book and I found it much more enjoyable. I especially enjoy the way he brings the church into the politics and struggles of Osten Ard. The Hero Simon is much more mature and not the annoying character he was in the first book. The plot unfolds as foreshadowed in the first book, without too many unexpected twists. The Cadrach character is very intriguing and Prince Josua reminds one of Hamlet. You can almost predict tragic ending for him in the future. The way Williams jumps from sub-plot to sub-plot very rapidly is distracting, but forces you to keep reading! I can't wait to read the last book"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Book Two of Tad Williams' long epic series Memory, Sorrow and Thorn is great. It starts out right where the last story left off and even gives a synopsis of the first book for those who are too lazy to read it. However, after reading that part, it really doesnt help much and one could easily get lost if they hadnt read the first book, the Dragonbone Chair first. Plus, you miss out on so much character development. Anyways, Stone of Farewell picks up a lot faster than the first book and continues on its pace all the way through to the end. I like how the author continued to have SImon's character grow up, becoming more and more of a man. I was worried this would not be the case, but Williams accurately describes Simon's coming of age and his eventual maturing and does it very well. Some new characters are introduced, which is pretty typical for fantasy, and it really becomes apparent the battle of good versus evil. What is really great is how Williams builds the characters. He really gets you attached to them and care about what each of them have to say. SOme parts of the first book were very confusing but Tad straightens us out in this second helping. A side note: this book is much shorter and easier to read than the Dragonbone Chair. Pick it up, but make sure you read the first book first, fans of fantasy rejoice, Mr. Williams has done it again."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I wrote a review on the first book of this series, The Dragonbone Chair, and there I stated that everyone should stick with the book because though it started out bad, it turned into a real winner. That still applies to that first book, but don't get so enthused you go out and buy this one.I don't know why, but I almost couldn't finish this book. It had the some problem as Dragonbone Chair, but only it never got better. The interesting action was interspersed between such long, drudging scenes that once you got to the good stuff, instead of getting excited, all I felt like saying was, \\"About time.\\" The actual writing in this book seems weaker as well...maybe Williams had a deadline he was pressed to meet. I don't know.Problem is, I can't really be sure this book is that much worse than the first. It may be that my taste has just changed since I read the first one. That is very possible, since I haven't found a fantasy novel I've really enjoyed in the past two years (except for Martin and Goodkind...they stand out). It could be that I've learned more about writing, and now pick out weaknesses in plot and style more easily. I'm not sure, so if you loved the first one, take this review with a grain of salt.I think the main problem with these novels, Dragonbone Chair and Stone of Farewell, is that Williams is padding the books. These could be stellar, 300-400 page fantasy novels. Instead, they're slow, plodding, 800 page novels. Kill your darlings, Mr. Williams, and be ruthless.To sum up, pick buy this book at your own risk. I'm definitely not reading the third book of the trilogy--a third book that comes in two parts, each about 800 pages...see what I mean?"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"It's no mystery that Tad Williams draws much of his \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\\" series from the J.R.R. Tolkien well - and most contemporary fantasists drink from these same waters, point of fact - but what Williams does not replicate is the intensity of \\"The Two Towers,\\" the middle volume in Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" \\"The Stone of Farewell\\" is a bloated tome that rambles more often than it compels. Even so, the characters introduced in \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" are strong enough to warrant the effort spent on \\"Farewell,\\" and the concluding volume (\\"To Green Angel Tower\\") promises a resounding conclusion. I can't help but think that \\"Farewell\\" just runs on too long, especially during those times when nothing of any real consequence is actually taking place. To be curt, it can be very boring. On the other hand, there are some very moody and inspiring sequences - they just happen to be trapped in the tangle. As a bridge between \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\" and \\"To Green Angel Tower,\\" \\"The Stone of Farewell\\" is definitely worth the hike - but even books in an ongoing series should, to some extent, satisfy on their own. \\"Farewell&quot; suffers from the middle volume blues.

So I am giving it three stars. And I intend on finishing the series. But I do wish more would happen. It is a bit trying at times to read through the second 700-page volume and see how very little happens. While things do happen, they are subtle changes. For 700-pages now the characters are journeying toward a gathering place, the Stone of Farewell, and after 700 pages, one would expect some type of finality. I am a firm believer in the idea that each book in a trilogy or series must stand alone on its own merits and if it were to be picked up alone and read, it would be a full, complete story. If I look at it that way, The Stone of Farewell is a disappointment.Middle books are hard (just ask Ms. Rowling), but nonetheless, after 1,400 pages, Mr. Williams has yet to key in the reader completely on the goals of the two sides of his conflict. Near the end of The Stone of Farewell, one character stands up and says, &quot;I know what's going on here, and let me tell you...&quot; So much for her... I wish the author would do the same thing.If I had to do it over again, I can't promise you I would have started this. But now I have to finish.

Everything I hated about the first book in this series has magnified in the second. Nothing happens. All the characters just sit around and complain about how bad everything is. Simon just cries all the time. Frustrating.One thing I personally hate in a book is when the protaganists get captured. Frustrating. Binabik wouldn't speak b/c he broke his oath! Ahh, poor baby. Why don't you cry me a river. Did you also know the world is ending? Quit crying and do something about it. They spend the whole book walking to a rock. Wow. Real excitement. Can I have another 1500 pages of nothing? Oh, wait, that's about the length of To Green Angel Tower. Boy, I can't wait to fall asleep.I've literally read hundreds of Fantasy Adventure (I guess this is just Fantasy, since there isn't much of an Adventure) books. Everything from Tolkien-and comparing this to that is blasphemy- and 1930's Conan to Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance and Warhammer. Most of them may not have the &quot;character developement&quot; or the &quot;plot mechanics&quot; all of the other reviewers seem to place on Memory, Sorrow and Thorn but every single one has been more fun to read. Even the ones I didn't like.The fighting scenes are just more frustration. They are not seen from a direct view. It's all seen from a skewed angle. Deornoth hurts his head and can't see what is going on around him when they get ambushed in the woods. Haeston is killed but we don't see the actually blow, he simply lands at Simon's feet. This literary device of using subtle violence can be great when used from time to time, but not ALL the time.&quot;Oh, but the descriptiveness is sooo good,&quot; yeah, well, when you use three pages to describe a mountainside it just becomes tiresome. I could describe taking a dump in either three pages or one sentence. Which do you prefer? If I want over-descriptiveness, I'll read a Romance novel.

The hook is that you are supposed to be watching everything unfold in real time; that after watching a one hour episode, one hour has passed for the characters as well. This author seems to be going for the same effect. Unfortunately, the characters are going on weeks-long journeys over which little of note takes place. At least 24 has the courtesy of refocusing the narrative on other characters while the main characters are \\"in transit\\" between destinations. Williams has decided to bore us with a wealth of detail about the weather and surroundings which only ends up being relevant to about 20 pages of plot (and most of even that plot turns out not to be important in the long term scheme of things).That isn't to say that interesting things aren't happening. An old prophecy, which everyone is staking their hopes on, was made by a crackpot who wrote a book about the future. Unfortunately, they only have second hand quotes from other sources, as the original book was lost. The prophecy hints that the present crisis can only be diverted by gathering up three magical swords. One sword (Sorrow) is definitely in the hands of the enemy king Elias, one (Memory) is thought to have been lost at sea or be hidden somewhere in Elias's stronghold, and the third (Thorn) was taken on an ill-fated quest to the north (hence the book's subtitle). Since Thorn is the only sword they have strong intell on, the impromptu council that Prince Josua has called organizes a search party to go look for the black sword. The rather passive Simon gets himself attached (rather like the piece of baggage he emulates) to the expedition. While there is plenty of wonder as Simon wanders through first the troll society and, later, a city belonging to the elf-like Sithi, these passages are too brief or focus too closely on (to me) uninteresting details like the arrangement of buildings and architecture. Who knew that the blessing of eternal life would make a society too lethargic to be interesting to us mere mortals?The siege of Naglimund turned out to be the most interesting \\"long-term\\" event to me. Sadly, it is an event that only lasts a few days, and the book devotes a corresponding brief amount of time to it. The tantalizing hints that the three swords are somehow linked are also intriguing, but more is revealed about their diverse and separate origins and histories, than about the relationship between them.I gave this book two stars because there are interesting things going on here. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like it was worth wading through nearly 1,500 pages (paperback) between the first and second books to get the few morsels available. This book reads better as a travelogue to polar regions than as the high fantasy adventure that it pretends to be. I read the first and second books consecutively, so I'm a little hazy about the separation between the two. It is possible that this review includes some events at the end of the first novel."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"If you read the first book (Dragonbone Chair) and thought that was slow, this second volume is much worse. At least in the first book there were some snippets of excitement, but in this effort the pace is slower than a snail moving on flypaper. I finished it as I would finish some laborious duty that must be performed because I like to read the books I buy all the way through. Unfortunately the payoff was nil.The borrowing from Tolkien also became too much, unlike the first one where it was more disguised. Here we have the Dwarrow (Dwarves, he couldn't even bother to change the name that much), Sithi are the Elves, Binabik is more of a rip off of the Star Wars character Yoda (he even talks like him) and Pyrates (\\"I want power!\\"), the main villian is as cliche as a paper-thin evil bad guy gets.Another pain is Simon, the main character. He gets even more annoying than in the first book, and in just about every scene he is either whining and moaning about his fate or in drama queen tears. I guess Williams thought that this device would ellicit emotion from the reader and would lend some kind of weight to the story, but the problem is the emotion elicted is exasperation and rolled eyes.This is somewhat mitigated by the cutting to other storylines involving other characters that are more interesting, such as Miriamele and Cadrach's ship board adventure, but Williams cuts around too much and it gets confusing keeping track of all the various characters and their situations.I have heard the last volume is the best, and I sincerely hope so because so far it has gone from an average fantasy book (Dragonbone Chair) to a mediocre one (Stone of Farewell)"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This book was supposed to be as new and unread.

Price was not in line with condition."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Having moved past the hundreds of pages of exposition and Simon's \\"ordinary life\\" in the first book, Stone of Farewell picks up the pace significantly and establishes Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn as a worthwhile, though not mandatory, genre read.The action crescendoes, especially in the first half of the book, as Josua leads his men from ruined Naglimund, and Simon, Binabik, Sludig deal with the trolls in the north. A couple unforeseen turns of event bring Binabik and Sludig closer together (their banter marks the high point for characterization in the novel) and send other characters into some novel and some traditional fantasy encounters. The pace slows toward the end, especially when Simon has an adventure of his own.One thing I really enjoyed about the novel was that it continually demonstrated how many of the characters' choices carried a price. Simon particularly makes a choice which may save his life, but it costs him it a way he could not have foreseen.I look forward to To Green Angel Tower, but not so much that I won't break up my M,S,& T reading before tackling that monster."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Wow, Williams does it again. If I was impressed by The Dragonbone Chair I was certainly not disappointed by the next volume in Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. The quest for the magic swords continues along with the struggle against Elias.I actually read this book alongside the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, reading a chapter of one and then the other--thus the suspense from chapter to chapter was heightened, but what was naturally there was still very good. The cast of characters has increased and the time given to each larger than in the first book. However, I don't think that there were too many characters or too much time was spent switching between them. Rather it helped to heighten suspense and keep the plot moving.Again the cover artwork by Michael Whelan is superb, only adding to an excellent volume. I appreciate that Simon isn't a typical hero, quickly learning expert swordsmanship and leading an army by the start of the second book. I think the following quote captures the mood perfectly:\\"Walking in silence beneath the stars, Simon thought aobut the things he had seen since leaving the Hayholt. To think that once he had feared he would live and die as a castle-drudge! Was there to be no end to teh strange places he must go, to the strange people he must meet? ...he was growing weary of strangeness. But the strangest thing, he thought suddenly, was that no matter where he went or what he saw, he always seemed to remain teh same old Simon--a little less mooncalfish, perhaps, but not very different from the clumsy kitchen boy who lived at the Hayholt. Those distant, peaceful days seemed utterly gone, vanished without hope of reclamation, but the Simon who had lived them was still very much present.\\"Yes, some of the characters seem typical, but far more are like Simon, not your typical epic characters. Furthermore, the volumes are each long enough that the story isn't rushed, but things are allowed to take their natural course and not appear to be happening too fast. Despite the summary you definately need to read The Dragonbone Chair first, but if you're looking for good epic fantasy go no farther."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Tad William's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy is one of the five best fantasy series ever.

No character is melodramatically good/evil and you feel empathy for the \\"villians\\" (Guthwulf, Ineluki, Elias). Cadrach/Padreic is another classic character. Unlike some fantasy series, women play a vital role (Utuk'ku, Maegwin, Miriamele, Amerasu, etc.).The story is not a bright, cheery one. There is plenty of despair, depression, hopelessness, and death. These dark aspects serve to make the triuphs and happiness all the more satisfying. It is also unconventional and provides some real surprizes/twists, unlike many fantasy books which are predictable to the point of farce.There are similarities to Tolkien: Immortal elf-like creatures who originate from a paradise \\"across the sea,\\" who are dwindling at the face of encroaching mankind.

I noticed there's been some comparison between Ender's Game and this book. This is apple's and oranges folks. Science Fiction and Fantasy are TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE GENRE'S. I LOVED Ender's Game. Outstanding story, I loved it's companion novel Ender's Shadow as well but I can't compare Card to Williams. Impossible. Two different styles, two different genre's. I agree that Tad does like to talk, the Otherland series is a prime example of this, but it is SO worth the effort. Trust me. You will not be disappointed.

If you liked the first volume, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"In response to souldestroyer@hotmail.com, I have to say yeah, Jordan, isn't that the guy who writes the redundant, cliched, books, where the good guys don't die, with the fabricated endings, and the characters that all have the power of gods?Once upon a time, I was an avid fantasy reader, devouring every series I could sink my teeth into: Lord of the Rings, Shannara, Earthsea, Dragonlance, Gom on Windy Mountain, Riddlemaster of Head, the Pern books, the Last Unicorn, and many others. Then I picked up Tad Williams, and suddenly got a perspective of what it was I was allowing myself to settle for.While still being gripping, this series was realistic (as much as fantasy can be), had an extremely deep plot, characters that seemed to live and breathe just as much as I do, and style about it that made you think. Probably if I had read Jordan before these books, I would have liked him ... as it stands now, Mr. Williams has given me a passion for high quality work that will not be satisfied with anything less. I guess I'm just spoiled.This is not to say that it's better than Tolkien. Tolkien is the God of fantasy, and I don't think anything will ever beat out him, although I'll try to keep an open mind."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The second book of Williams' epic &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; is better than the first because it moves faster and adds much to the plot of the overall series.

Nonetheless it is a book that is worth the money of fantasy readers."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"It continues where The Dragon Bone Chair left off, giving another large part of the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn series.

If you read Dragonbone Chair, part 1 is a little slow and complicated, but once Simon meets Binabik, things get going. From there on in Memory, Sorrow and Thorn had my complete attention. Williams has created wonderful characters that you can really relate to (like Simon) and beautifully written environments. There is a wealth of information you have to read through, but for readers like me this is nothing. I say MT&amp;S is classic fantasy. It is just as good as Tolkien, if less poetic. It's much easier to relate to Simon and Miriamele than Frodo Baggins. (I'm not knocking Tolkien, I love it, too.) I enjoyed To Green Angel Tower Part 1 by far of all the trilogy, though. But Stone of Farewell is definetely a worthy sequel. So, keep it up Mr. Williams. I am eager to start reading Otherland."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Tad Williams has done it again.He has continued this book without losing anything that happened in between. i have begun the last novel in this trilogy, and i can't wait to finish it!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This continuing saga of Simon, Miriamele, Josua, Binibek and all the others takes up where Sorrow, Memory and Thorn left off without losing any of the impact and momentum of the first of the trilogy."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I loved this book.

The book is well written all through and includes some humor to the difference of Jordans books.You can put fantasy writers in two groups.

With the very land blighted by the power of Ineluki's wrath, the tattered remains of a once-proud human army flee in search of a last sanctuary and rallying point-the Stone of Farwell, a place shrouded in mystery and ancient sorrow.And even as Prince Josua seeks to rally his scattered forces, Simon and the surviving members of the League of the Scroll are desperately struggling to fulfill missions which will take them from the fallen citadels of humans to the hidden mountain caves of Qanuc trolls..across storm-tormented waters to discover the truth behind an almost-forgotten legend..to the secret heartland of the Sithi, where the near-immortals must at last decide whether to ally with the race of men in a final war against those of their own blood.Now known as Simon Snowlock, because of the white tuft of hair on his forehead, the former kitchen boy continues his arduous journey in the service of the rebel Prince Josua, brother to the (human) High King, and enters the last great citadel of the Sithi."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"If your looking at this, I assume you've read the first book. With that said, I will give no spoilers but will say that your long hours of suffering through the crawling pace of the fist half of The Dragonbone Chair will pay off with this one.

The story moves along at a good pace and I can honestly say that it only gets better with To Green Angel Tower books 1 and 2."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The second in the Memory, Sorrow and Thorn trilogy. About 3/4 of the way through this volume, too much of the influence began to show. Not that such an occurrence is surprising--it's damned difficult to write a fantasy epic without Tolkien influencing it in some way--but something pegged a memory cell, and I winced at the similarity. As I said about The Dragonbone Chair, Williams isn't as bad as Terry Brooks. Brooks' main character was a short halfling type; Williams' is a young boy who is maturing quickly. Brooks' main good wizard was a mysterious man who comes and goes; Williams kills off the good wizard halfway through the first book. The similarity that made me wince, however, was the knowledge that the main bad wizard (as opposed to the overlord baddie) was once a member of the good wizard group. Shades of Saruman, and, as Jill pointed out, Star Wars.To break it down into these stereotyped roles is to reduce the work. Williams does a wonderful job in scene description, and his plotting ain't too shabby. Many times I was caught in a storyline that I wanted to see resolved. These were often the times that Williams would break from that action to cover a slower scene elsewhere, in the hopes that you stay fixed to the book looking for the resolution of the first. Unfortunately, there's more than just two of these situations going on, but something like four or five. Tolkien did the same thing, but in large chunks. (In fact, if my memory serves me, Tolkien had one group move on, and then returned to another and the time had to backtrack several months. Williams' sections seem to match fairly consistently in shorter durations than that.)I'm still enjoying it, though I think I might take a little breather before attacking the last, and thickest, volume."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"An absolutely spellbinding novel. In the fantasy genre, I often find the second volume of a trilogy to fall flat, but Stone of Farewell fairly crackles off of the pages. I just ordered the third volume and can't wait 'till it comes in. Highly recommended to anybody who enjoys epic fantasy."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Come on people, its good, but not THAT good...for one thing, it was very boggy and many parts I had to lag through because, and only because, I wanted to read the whole book, and not just parts. 5 stars should be reserved for PERFECT books, such as 'Enders Game' and 'Seventh Son' by Orson Scott Card, 'The Forever King' by Molly Cochran and Warren Murphey, 'The Eye of the World' by Robert Jordan, 'Magician' by Raymond E. Feist, and last but certainly not least 'Wizard's First Rule' by Terry Goodkind. Read all these and their sequels, then rereview this series, it's very good, but far from perfect..."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"'The Stone of Farewell' is the middle book of Tad Williams's 'Memory, Sorrow & Thorn' trilogy, and as such it is a bit of a mixed bag. The positives include appealing characters, several interesting plot lines and a comprehensive back story for his world. The negatives include a slow paced and somewhat mundane plot. The whole book feels like Williams is maneuvering the pieces around on the chessboard to get them where he wants them for the final book without regard to making the journey compelling. This wouldn't necessarily be an issue, except 'The Stone of Farewell' weighs in at 700+ pages in paperback. This was a definite step back from 'The Dragonbone Chair'."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"If you look at the reviews for the first book in this series, many complain about a very very slow start. I agreed with those people and ended up skipping to the last 1/5 to see what happened. Based on that, it appeared the story was about to pick up the pace.The story does indeed pick up the pace, but the main character, Simon, grows very little. After over 1,000 pages, he's still a bumbling kitchen boy. Yes, he's done a few 'great' things, but they are all by accident, luck, etc...He still has no training in magic, no great skill as a swordsman, no magical abilities which give him power, and no great intellect to think of clever plans or snappy dialogue. He's...just...an...average...boy. Who gets lucky. If that is your idea of a grand fantasy, following around a boy who literally has nothing remarkable going for him, where every other character he meets is more remarkable, then this is for you. Personally, I'll take a Terry Goodkind hero who is perhaps _too_ perfect, but infinitely more integral to the story than some idiot lackey who bumbles his way to victory which is what you're given here.Additionally, there are many long slow passages, like 7-10 pages of description at a time. These could have easily been pared down to 1-2 pages, but we have to keep hearing about how cold it is, how the bones ache, etc...I've never seen anyone so enthralled with giving you a play-by-play of each step on a path a character takes. Get on with it already!The reason I gave it 2 stars is because there are just enough interesting parts, mysteries, new places uncovered, that you at least feel the need to keep skipping around just to see what happens. As torturous as it may be, I'm even considering picking up the last one just to know what happens. I may only read 100 out of the 700 pages, but you gotta do what you gotta do."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I have very little to say about Tad Willaims other than he has an astounding imagination and is always a joy to read. This is the second book in the trilogy. I almost gave up after 100 pages or so of the first book. After I stuck with it I realized that the reasons for me not enjoting the first part of this book are the same reasons I loved the rest of the trilogy. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fanatsy."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Unique in all aspects of fantasy. As an avid reader of Tad Williams, Anne Rice, Phil Rickman, and all great fantasy writers I must say that all who read book one of this series, book two is a must read.

It was completely engrossing. There is a surprise around every corner and you find yourself so very attached to the characters. Before this book, it has been so long since I found myself reading--forgetting the world around me. I could not stop reading this book--living every piece of it along with the characters--even when my train ride to work is over I read during the walk from the train to work!! EVEN CROSSING STREETS!! It's that good. I cannot even tell you how excited I am to begin book 3 tomorrow! Green Angel Tower!I cannot see how anyone could say anything negative about this series.

William's undaunted prose and fully realized characters mix to create a tale that will make you cheer. Williams takes that classic fantasy beginning of a young boy and his trials and tribulations on his way to greatness and he adds a new twist that the fantasy genre has not seen in years: HE DOES IT RIGHT. The story is great, the setting realistic, the characters palpable, and most improtant of all for legitimate fantasy readers, the magic is realistic and believable. This is one tale that you will not want to miss, and the entire series is done being written and in paperback print. Williams is one of this age's finest fantasy authors and deserves the praise to be mentioned along with other greats such as David Feintuch and George R.R. Martin. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I feel I must increase my review, and give the second book a 9. Unlike in the first book, Williams starts in this one to discuss the church. This is a favorite topic of mine in fantasy lit. and don't ask why. Williams succeeds in accurately capturing the struggles between church and state and between church and heretic. In any fantasy book, the inclusion of religion can make or break the novel. In the first book Tad vividly describes the conquest of the land by Prester John. I've been doing some research, but noone seems to be able to tell me whether or not this guy ever existed historically! I'd appreciate e-mail on the topic.But to move on. Prester John conquers the land and subdues all opponents, wielding in his hand a mythical sword which succeeds in defeating even the sword wielded by the hero Camaris. The Aedonite church becomes the dominant religion throughout all of Osten Ard...except for Hernystir.Here the inhabitants continue to believe in their own gods of the sky. In other parts of Osten Ard, the inhabitants also make slip ups at times and call on their old gods. This is a brilliant depiction of what happens after a religious conquest.It shows how even after a dominant religion asserts itself, the society continues to secretely believe in the old for many generations after. An example is in the Christian conquest of Peru. Here the Spaniards came in search of gold, though the official reason they gave was that they had come to save the populace from damnation.The Inca's were defeated, and the remaining natives were herded into _encomiendas_ or collectives. Here they were treated as virtual slaves by their Spanish masters (as far as I can deduce from the literature - so please correct me if I am misrepresenting the facts). They were also taught the Christian faith. Today Peru is one of the most devout Christian nations in the world, yet the inhabitants of rural moutain villages continue to carry out age old ceremonies such as snaring the condor and placing it on the bull's back (appologies - I don't know what the ceremony's called).This shows how in reality religions always reassert themselves - no matter how well erradicated. Tad captures this well, as well as the contempt expressed by the Aedonites for the Hernystir.He portrays a fine character in Cadrach - though in a later novel this character become slightly less believable. In short this novel is another breath of fresh air in a world of by now stagnant fantasy lit. with a few notable exceptions. To sum up: Buy it!!!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"STONE OF FAREWELL is the action packed second book in the MEMORY, SORROW AND THORN trilogy. Picking up where the first book left off, we find the forces of humanity fleeing before the seemingly unstoppable evil of the Norns. Meanwhile, Miriamele and Cadrach are off adventuring in the south while Simon becomes seperated from his friends and becomes the first human to ever visit the home of the mysterious Sithi. This is a novel you can't miss. You won't even be able to put it down once you've picked it up. With this series, Tad Williams has created one of the best fantasy series since THE LORD OF THE RINGS"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"\\"Stone of Farewell\\" is the second volume in Tad Williams \\"Memory, Sorrow, Thorn\\" high fantasy trilogy which began with \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\". This novel is not quite as long as \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\", but it still weighs in at a hefty 570 pages in trade paperback. This middle volume continues the story of Simon, now called Simon Snowlock by some, and of his quest to bring the sword \\"Thorn\\" to the exiled Prince Josua to aid him in his fight against his brother, the King of Osten Ard. King Elias and his advisor Pyrates are being aided and corrupted by a great evil coming down from the frozen north and a thought long dead Sithi King is coming to bring destruction to the land while Elias ruins his own kingdom. Prince Josua has to find a way to fight his brother, who has a strong grip over Osten Ard and he knows that fighting Elias means at some point fighting the Storm King from the north. The true darkness that is facing Osten Ard is the Storm King and not Elias but few know the truth.Like \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\", this book offers the reader a good deal of detail and proceeds at a leisurely pace. Critics of the book may call it a plodding pace, but I think that is a matter of perspective. While Simon does go on a long journey and goes some place very few humans have ever been, it almost does not seem as if he really gets anywhere...that his portion of the story just sort of stumbles along. Prince Josua has a much greater journey.The level of detail and the overall storyline is vast and we are starting to get closer to an ending since there is only one book left. But there still seems so much more to do that I find it hard to understand how Williams can end this in a single book...except that the single book is as long as Books 1 and 2 combined. I am enjoying reading \\"Memory, Sorrow, Thorn\\", so the pacing does not bother me, but at times I wonder that it has taken Tad Williams 1100 pages to tell this story so far when it could probably be have shortened by a good 400 pages and nobody would have noticed. It's just a thought.The bottom line is that to read \\"Stone of Farewell\\" the reader must have first finished \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\". There is enough back detail to fill the reader in, but much would be lost without having read the first book. Is this book good? Yes. Is this book better than the first book? Also, yes. It is a fairly big time investment and there are better books, but this is a worthwhile trip to Osten Ard and the world of Tad Williams.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I have a hard time putting this book down once I start reading and I think you will too. Excellent book by a very good author."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This series by Tad Williams is a must read for dragon lovers. It is an excellent adventure that will leave you wishing there were more books."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"\\"The Stone of Farewell\\" is the second book in the \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn\\" trilogy. This is an epic fantasy novel that I found very slow although there were a few exciting scenes mixed in and a real surprise at the end of the novel.It almost feels like the author is trying too hard. There are at least 11 major story lines, and the author spends an excruciating amount of time describing minute details for each setting. It also felt like there was an overall lack of action as characters didn't evolve much -- take Simon for example who was injured, captured, and/or dreaming for the majority of the book.Another reason I rated down the book is because I found the Christian-like religion of Usires a bit distracting. The characters have a concept of Heaven, Hell, God, and a great demon (i.e., Satan), and this just seems out of place with the polytheistic religions presented in the book. I don't mind religion as a part of epic fantasy novels, but when it so closely matches a real religion it seems out of place.To the book's credit, it is \\"clean\\" in that it doesn't include content that would be inappropriate for a young adult audience (i.e., sex, cussing, gruesome battle scenes, etc.).Overall, this second book didn't really compel to invest my time in finishing the trilogy. Based on how things have progressed so far, it feels like the typical good versus evil. I'm sure the third book will present some interesting twists, but I'm just not sure I want to slog my way through another 500+ pages of overly descriptive writing."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"I got sucked in to this series, and trust me, the first couple hundred pages are somewhat boring and simply not very interesting. After the wizard (or Simon's mentor) is killed, things pick up, and there is a decent story. Be warned, if you get into the book and decide you like it, you have three more books to read, and each is fairly long (700 pages or so per additional book). The author has no problem killing off some of the marginal good characters, so don't get attached to any of them or you may be depressed. The author spends a lot of time on wasted description; the whole series could have been easily done in a thousand pages, not two thousand. I do enjoy some of his descriptions of the battles. There is a certain amount of ambiguity in the non temporal elements in the story; you don't really know what the Storm King \\"thing\\" is; it is somewhat vague and never really clearly explained. The story attempts to weave a spiritual and earthy story together; it fails in places. If you heavily into fantasy, it may be a worth a look, but I warned you."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This series and in particular book 2 keeps your interest and is fast paced. You care about each and every well defined character. I highly recommend book two and all the books in this series."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"As I have not written a novel such as Tad's, I cannot say what he went thru to make his works into a reality. No, I am here for the world he creates and bestows upon us while reading. The imagination he inspires is great and consuming but dull at some moments. The book is good and brings forth a great adventure but lacks a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\""},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Though the series as a whole is wonderful and highly-recommended, Stone of Farewell led me on an unexpected emotional journey. William's number one strength is his characters - Miriamelle aside (I almost gave this book four stars because she annoys me so much) However, reading it through for a second and third time and skimming through her passages made this a perfect read. Secondly, he has a great sense for the visual. Mists, flowers, groves, hills, towers...his visions fill my mind for days after I put the book down...Though all the sub-plots are engrossing, especially those involving Maegwin and the journey of Prince Josua, I found the journey into the Sithi-stronghold some of the most amazing story-writing I've ever encountered. The Sithi come to life in a magical, three-dimensional way with me striving to understand like some whacked-out, hungry anthropologiest. It's been a long time since I've wanted to get the 'heck' out of this world or ours and jump headfirst into another - but this is where I would go if I could find it. Like a shot. I'm also an adult reader, so if you're a kid looking for massive amounts of sword-play and 'cool' magic (though I think these things DO lie here-in), this isn't the book for you. But if you enjoy a depth to your story, striking characterizations and dialogue that is actually enjoyable to read (read: NOT Goodkind) then you will enjoy this series and especially this volume.This is also one of the only series - and certainly the first since I was TWELVE - that I find myself concocting alternate stories in my head before I fall asleep in the eve or even day-dreaming during my day (fan-fiction of the mind, if you will!).I cannot emphasize what a cut above the rest of fantasy-schlock this triology is. It even gets better on a second read. But I do believe you have to have a certain tolerance for steady pacing, emotional complexties, drawn out descriptives (which I adore), and the bittersweet undercurrents of beauty lost beyond retrieving."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This book is a fitting successor to the Dragonbone Chair. Tad Williams continues with his fine work in the previous book. Again, this is a story of epic proportion, with numerous subplots and lots of character development. Osten Ard again is a vibrant,believable world in the process of being overwhelmed by a seemingly unstoppable ancient evil. The heroes are a scattered, ragtag bunch running for their lives, having a vague notion of how the evil should be stopped, but having very few options at their disposal. It just seems that there is no way in the world that good will prevail here, although here and there there are hints as to how it might occur. The despair of the main characters in the story is almost palpable. I found myself identifying many times with characters, many of which are memorable. Characters grow and develop in the book and in the reader's mind. This book is more fast-paced and has more action than the previous title, but character development and interaction are not sacrificed. Magic is referred to more than in the previous title. The enemy strikes with magic in places the reader would never expect. This book again contains much in the way of kingdom politics, intrigue, betrayal, loyalty, dark scheming, and much, much more. This book kept me up very late some nights so I could learn what happened next. Again, much of what will probably be important is not revealed early in this epic tale. I felt like my understanding of the Sithi was very inadequate and grew very slowly, just as Simon's did. Like the mortals in the books, it is difficult so far for me to truly understand the culture of the Sithi and its timeless ways. I'm looking forward to finding out more."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"&quot;The Stone of Farewell&quot; is an amazing book. I have not found a better epic piece of fantasy since J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; Tad Williams has crafted a fantasy of epic proportions that imerses the reader in rich details. The story catches at you and compels you to read on. The first book of the series, &quot;The Dragonbone Chair&quot;, is a little slow to start but if you can stick with it this series is worth it! This is a must for anyone who enjoys Tolkien and good fantasy novels."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Stone of Farewell, the second volume of Tad Williams' trilogy Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, is amazingly good, easily surpassing in almost every way (except length) the first book in the saga. It starts with the technical details. The pretty frequent typos and grammatical errors found Dragonbone Chair are virtually eliminated here. And the story itself has become much more unique and self-defined, drifting out of the standard Tolkien rut the first book was in.The characterisations continued to advance believably, enjoyably, and sympathetically, and some of the characters not focused on from the first book enjoy a much more prominent role here. The action and interactions are superb, the pacing excellent, and the author wisely chooses not to show the POV of the characters with twisted minds or royal blood.The Sithi society is interesting, not too human but not so inhuman that we can't relate, either.This is one of the best fantasy works that I have seen in years, and I'm very much looking forward to reading the third book in the cycle."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Perusing the bookshelves at a local bookstore, I once overheard a conversation between two women about the novels of Tad Williams. Hefting the first part of TO GREEN ANGEL TOWER, one of the women mused, \\"He writes such nice long books, if only he wrote better.\\" Sadly, this is a very accurate description of Williams's fantasy series MEMORY, SORROW AND THORN.The second book in his New York Times best-selling series, STONE OF FAREWELL, continues Williams's tale of the scullion Simon and his adventures in the land of Osten Ard. The darkness is spreading, Ineluki the Storm King and his Norn minions move across the land, and the forces of good must retreat to the Stone of Farewell, their only sanctuary in these perilous times. The charismatic Prince Josua Lackhand hatches plans to reclaim his kingdom from his brother, the mad King Elias and the evil sorcerer Pyrates, while Simon and the dwindling number of the League of the Scroll seek to fight their battle on a different front.STONE OF FAREWELL can be easily summed up as being \\"more of the same\\" of THE DRAGONBONE CHAIR. Williams admirably moves the reader through what is a commonly tedious section of the fantasy novel, the development to the climax. Fast-paced action interspersed with moments of introspection, Williams's characters are well-rounded and identifiable. The plot is somewhat predictable, but readers will enjoy it nonetheless. Reading MEMORY, SORROW AND THORN is almost like hearing a more detailed retelling of a story everyone knows. Political intrigue and the courage of man are delved into during the calmer parts of the story. Morality is a constant theme in the series, what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is evil.For readers who worked their way through THE DRAGONBONE CHAIR, it is highly recommended that they read STONE OF FAREWELL. If the first novel in the series left you feeling empty, you might not be as well served working through the rest of this series. However, for avid readers of fantasy, with the amount of detail in Williams's epic, it should be enough to keep them coming back for more."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Stone of Farewell - one really excellent book. A great, fully-realized sequel to Dragonbone Chair. I originally read this book before Dragonbone Chair because as usual the excellent (hardcover)cover had caught my eye and the first book wasn't immediately accessible. The way this one plunges into the story straight away helped me read the Dragonbone Chair later without finding it tedious or being impatient with the slow development of plot. Osten Ard and especially the forzen mountains of the troll-folk were excellently described. This book isn't the normal action-packed, paperback fantasy with sword-fights and ripped-guts galore, (which can be fun in its own way, I grant you) but a very special, very real classic. A lot happens in this book on a grand scale and the author isn't afraid to kill characters, which kept me holding my breath and not daring to form predictions. I really like his characters. I love Simon, not because he's a great hero, because he isn't; nor because he's cool: he isn't. I like him because he feels real and because Williams makes us understand him and feel the story. The supporting characters are great! I love adorable Binabik and his hilarious troll quotes and his funny speech. Duke Isgrimnur is a bear of a gem. Prince Josua is intriguing and his queer humor and scholarliness sets him apart from the usual run. The only main character that I'm not all that crazy about is Princess Miriamele, but she's no where as bad as some of Robert Jordan's female creations!"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The action really picks up here. What with siege of Naglimund, and the adventures that follow, Tad Williams proves his ability as a master of plot development. The writing becomes more evocative with every passing scene and description, and as a result, more terrifying. The power of language is utilized to the fullest extent to breathe life into nightmare. Few other writers have the courage to plunge into blackest despair as Tad Williams does here; and one cannot help but imagine that it is hopeless, that all is lost. Evil is no longer a bed-time story, but a full-blooded, horrifying reality. There is no respite, no sugar-coating of the consequences. Although the author truly cares for his characters, he gives them no quarter in escaping from suffering.As to the characters themselves--now they have started to truly develop and grow, in the readers' hearts as well as on paper. Simon is growing up the hardest way imaginable, by being forced to deal with the harshest realities possible. Josua is a wonderful character, a leader whose last desire is to lead. One of my favorite scenes in this book is his wonderfully choreographed sword-fight in the Thrithings. Maegwin takes a strange turn, and Miriamele is tested to her limits. The only drawback to this book are the segments with Tiamak, which are rather dull and easily skipped or skimmed.No hope is extended here for how the conflict will end--the atmosphere of hopeless despair is staggering. The reader's only assurance is that surely something good must be coming, else why would there be another two books following? For those who think this series has possibilities at this point, all I can is, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Stay tuned."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"This is the second time I have read Tad Williams epic fantasy series, \\"Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn.\\" The first time through, when I was fifteen years old, and the series had only been out for a couple years, I didn't understand that I was reading a unique, and unprecedented series. I wasn't aware that many of the other series I would read in the next thirteen years would be only pale shadows of this series in terms of quality and originality - all I knew at the time was that I couldn't put the books down.I've learned a lot in the thirteen years since I first read the series. I've learned that the fantasy genre is a chaotic, fickle ocean of \\"literature\\", filled with terrible novels, surrounded by shores mediocre novels, with only a small island of great stories in the center. I've read hundreds of fantasy books and series, and while some were great, and many were good, a vast majority were underwhelming - even some that many critics consider greats, I can barely make it through the first or second book in the series.I picked up \\"The Dragonbone Chair,\\" the first book in the series, a few weeks ago, with the intentions of just browsing a little bit while I was bored. Little did I know that this act would take me back in time, and once again, I wouldn't be able to put the book(s) down until they were done. However, I'm reviewing the second book, \\"Stone of Farewell,\\" because I just turned the last page this morning, and it is freshest in my mind.Farewell picks up literally where Dragonbone left off, with one group of heroes fleeing for their lives, and the second group in an uncertain scenario after besting the villains atop Ursheim mountain. We immediately get a feel that this novel will not only be continuing the important main sequence, but will also be expanding on other important characters as new plot lines, new information, and new characters are introduced. It is these new characters that I believe I was so fascinated with. Every single one has his or her own personality, with quirks and annoyances, as well as heroic and comforting properties. One character who we have had no reason up until now to believe is anything other than a rogue and scoundrel shows a side that helps us understand his predicament, and even gives us some sympathy towards him. Other characters, who seemed infallible and unbreakable are shown to have human flaws and weaknesses that truly make us empathize with them. The characters learn from their experiences and actually grow because of them.Stone of Farewell is where Tad Williams begins to really pick up the plot, and show that the stakes are high. He is not afraid to kill of a character just because we love him, and he is not afraid to show evil at its worst. The villains have true motivations that slowly begin to become apparent, but all their motivations are their own, and unique. The Storm King wants something different from the Norn Queen, who in turn wants something other than what Pryrates wants, who's goals have nothing to do with Elias. Webs of intrigue are sewn masterfully, and the twists are surprising, while at the same time logical.The different cultures and kingdoms really stand out as well. It is extremely obvious that sithi society is nothing like that of the Erkynlanders, and that Qanucs are not just short Rimmersmen. All the cultures have their own religions, societies, arts, crafts, languages, and lifestyles, and each is as real as the next. It is almost hard to believe this is written about a fantasy world, and not just a past version of Earth.Tad's writing itself seems to also have made a few leaps by this book. It is perhaps a little-known fact that \\"Dragonbone\\" was his breakthrough into the fantasy genre, and many readers could tell this - I couldn't, the first time I read, but I could this time around. However, by the second chapter of the second book, I could swear I was reading the works of someone so established in the genre, that I thought, \\"How could this series not be one of the most popular, well-known fantasy series around??\\" This book is also where we see a true break from the standard Tolkien-esque fantasy, and the plot takes real, unique directional leaps that have never been seen before or since.I was able to stop turning pages long enough to write this review, but \\"To Green Angel Tower\\" is calling me, and I fear I must come to beck. I don't know if I will ever read this series again, ten or twenty years from now, but I know that the world of Osten Ard is a great place to visit, and I wouldn't mind coming back to hear the stories again. If you're looking for a great fantasy series to read that is different in style and plot from Tolkien, Eddings, Feist, and Jordan, then I highly recommend giving this series a try. Many people have said that the first 150 pages of Dragonbone are too slow, but I just think it's a slow acceleration to a non-stop joyride, giving you all the background information you need to jump headlong into the series. You won't regret picking this book up."},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"The work of Tad Williams can easily seat with honor beside the Lord of the Rings on my shelf. I have yet to find a Fantasy writer this good. Even though it's size is intimidating, I found I just couldn't put it down. I kept looking with dread at the amount of pages left to read wishing the book will never end. When I try to analyze and evaluate a Fantasy story, I consider the following: Characters, Plot and the Fantasy world build around them. Williams scores a perfect 10 in all categories.His characters are dynamic, as the plot evolves around them they evolve. Simon changes from a clumsy daydreaming boy to a clumsy hero. The Bad guys are not whole black, they have their shades of gray also the good guys have their share of skeletons in the closet.The plot is captivating, the choices made by the heroes make the difference. Unlike many other writers, Williams doesn't leave us with unfinished subplots or holes in the story.The world of The Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Series, it is the strongest essence. We have Religion and we have Magic. We have History true or false one (depends on who's looking). We have mysteries unsolved from the past and much much more. But to my opinion the best job Williams have done was with the different races. In regular Fantasy story books the Elves are treated as Humans with pointy ears, the Dwarves/Gnomes/Halflings (Williams trolls) as short humans. The races in most books suffer from sever Tolkien stereotype (Elves are noble keepers of the forest, Hobbits are shy etc..) Williams races on the other hand are completely alien. They follow a different set of rules, has a foreign civilization structure, has a set of customs, history and bounds of honor. They share a world with suspicious medieval human society, and so when they get with humans, conflict usually arises (Which is the foundation of our story). To sum it all up, this series is a great reading, leaves you with a taste for more.Thumbs up Tad Williams"},{"Title":"Stone of Farewell: Book Two of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn","review":"Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn trilogy was one of the first fantasy series I ever read and it's still one of my favorites.The writing style is very pleasant and the pace is slow enough to be savored, but characters actually accomplish things by the end of each book (you know what I mean). The characters are well-developed and loveable, but not annoyingly perfect. This is a classic epic fantasy plot: Simon the kitchen boy saves the world. But please don't roll your eyes -- this was written in the 1980's -- before it was a clich&eacute;. Even though he's now a clich&eacute;, Simon is still charming and you can't help but love him.Memory, Sorrow, & Thorn is on my list to read again, and along with Robin Hobb's Farseer Saga, it's the one I always recommend to newcomers to the genre."},{"Title":"The Hut Six Story","review":"The men and women of Bletchley Park, who repeatedly broke German military cyphers throughout the Second World War, made an incalculable contribution to the allied success. This book, written by one of the code-breakers provides a fascinating insight into the process.Despite the core subject, this is not really a book about cryptography, but about how to manage people and technology to solve complex, important problems. Welchman was the \\"glue\\" between the pure ideas men like Alan Turing, and the code-breaking production line. His talents were clearly in building the organisation, and liaising between the different parties so that interception, decoding, understanding and using the intelligence became a repeatable success.Welchman's insights into British wartime society and bureaucracy are keen and frequently very humourous. Many of his insights are equally applicable today, in business as well as military circles. For example an individual's promotion, prestige and salary should not depend solely on the number of subordinates.Although he was very modest about it, it is clear that Welchman was no mean cryptologist himself. The book does attempt to explain several of the ways in which Enigma was cracked, but I found the primarily verbal explanations difficult to follow. However, this doesn't prevent an understanding of the principals, and how different methods were applied at different points during the war.The book does have some limitations. Because he was not personally involved, he explicitly refuses to discuss the effort focused on the German naval codes so important to the Battle of the Atlantic, and generally says little about the use of the intelligence information. Sadly, the current edition of the book omits much of Welchman's advice on the analysis of battlefield communications, and how to keep such communications secure. However, one observation has been retained - it was a fundamental mistake to believe Enigma was secure simply because of the enormous computing power required for a brute-force attack. This should perhaps be noted in our Internet age, when so much depends on the assumed difficulty of factoring large numbers.If I have a criticism of the book, it's the rather poor production in places, with very faded photographs and occasionally blurred text. Figures are sometimes absent when they are most needed, e.g. when first explaining the Enigma machine. I read this book having only recently attended an excellent lecture and actually seeing an Enigma - otherwise I would have struggled at such points.Nonetheless this is an excellent, insightful and inspiring book, containing a range of lessons relevant today, and I thoroughly recommend it...."},{"Title":"The Hut Six Story","review":"Fascinating account of Gordon Welchman's work at Bletchley Park, where he worked particularly on understanding patterns in German radio traffic (for example, call signs) and more generally on cryptography. The later part of the book talks about his experiences after the war, for example with MITRE, and includes numerous well-thought-out policy recommendations.I purchased this book as an adjunct to Robert Harris fictionalized account of Bletchley Park, Enigma, which of course is much higher on overt human-interest type things (love affairs, cloak-and-dagger operations) than this non-fiction account. But one can still see the excitement and danger lurking through the surface of this work.Welchman comes across here as an extremely careful and scrupulous (auto)-biographer. He is careful to qualify all his conclusions, and he even goes out of his way to minimize his own role. This understated style, needless to say, is well out of fashion.Nevertheless, Welchman paints a very interesting portrait of himself and his compatriots. Some were mathematicians, some were chess-players, some were classicists. He describes in great detail exactly how he went about deriving a method for breaking Enigma.Despite Welchman's rather understated, perhaps classically British, account, it's clear that there were great people working there at that time, and that they were in fact utterly critical to the defeat of Germany. Welchman persuasively argues that Germany would likely have won Europe, or at least invaded England, had Bletchley Park not been so dramatically successful.Welchman's policy suggestions also seemed wise. He believes American should focus more on communication security. He specifically notes Afghanistan as a potential theater of future war operations (this in 1982).Even apart from the distinct possibility that Bletchley Park preserved Europe from the Nazis, and the certainty that its work dramatically changed the course of the war, and even the importance of what were then some of the earliest computers, somehow I found more interesting Welchman himself. He comes across as a pleasant, warm, good person; who loves puzzles; who loves mathematics; and who is extremely honest and careful. And Bletchley Park itself comes across as one of those rare times and places in history when people like Welchman can and do succeed. So there is almost a wistfulness to the passing of the place.There were also a lot of just fun and fascinating details. Perhaps the major theme running through the book was the remarkable carelessness of the German radio operators. Welchman notes the Enigma itself was relatively secure: but the operators failed to follow good cryptographic protocol. For example, the person who chose the keys got lazy and just reused old keys! Sometimes operators would select keys based on patterns on the keyboard. One operator in the African theatre of operations daily sent the same message \\"nothing to report\\", letting that day's key be quickly cracked (apparently Bletchley toyed with the idea of instructing the Allies to leave him alone).Another notable point, to show how flummoxed were the Germans, was that after Rommel began to suspect that Enigma was insecure, the German cryptanalysts reviewed the code (several times in fact) and always concluded it was unbreakable.Many of the sacrifices made by British were perhaps not so spectacular and visible as the high-profile codebreakers, but nonetheless critical and moving. Welchman has a nice passage (pp. 141-142) describing the plight of the WRENS, the women navy operators. They had signed up for the navy expecting to be on ships, to see the world, and they were consigned to listening to transcribing Morse code gibberish for the entire war, hour after hour, year after year. They never saw the decrypts and they could never be told much about the value of what they did - and yet, like everyone there, they were never allowed to leave until after the war. Some WRENs did operate the bombes, the machines that helped decrypt the Enigmas, as well of course.One example of the personal sacrifices made by the analysts there was that they were often viewed by others as cowards or shirkers for not fighting for Britain. Welchman tells of one young man who \\"received a scathing letter from his headmaster accusing him of being a disgrace to his school.\\" (p. 86).Looking back on all this seventy-odd years later, and nearly thirty years after the book itself was published, I was struck by two things. One was the great character of the British at the time. And the second is how incredible it seems nowadays, for a government to accumulate so many smart people, working tirelessly, penuriously and secretly for years just to save others, all with complete support of the government. Not since the Apollo project (or before that, Manhattan) has anything like that been seen, or even can be seen as plausibly occurring."},{"Title":"The Hut Six Story","review":"Hut Six by Godon Welchman is a gripping story about how British code breakers broke the code of the Enigma Machine. This code machine was used by the German High command to send secret messages to and from the commanders in the field, including those from and to Hitler. The Germans were secure in the thought that the code generated by the machine could not be broken. Every day the key was changed to ensure, they thought, that their war messages remained secret.The British high command kept secret that the code had been broken to the extent that a deciphered message alerted the highest authority. Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered that the Royal Air Force not be informed that the British town of Coventry not be defended from a German Air Force attack the following morning. Had the British Air Force engaged the enemy it could be deduced by Germany that their code had been broken.The British commanders were given the info that referred to their sphere but not the info that did not apply to their specific engagements. Two Generals, American Mark Clark and British General \\"Monty\\" Montgomery arrogantly refused to accept the information unless they could have ALL of the info, even that which did not concern them. Consequently they probably, because of their obstinacy, some lives were unnecessarily lost.If you are interested in the history of World War II you should read this book. You will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"The Hut Six Story","review":"Gordon Welchman wrote this book mostly based on his own recollections of the events that took place nearly 40 years ago. His memory is not perfect.The most interesting parts are the ones where he deals with people and their relationships. He is describing events related to Army/Air Force enigma which are much less covered than their naval equivalent. Some anecdotes that he relates are fresh and appealing.The sadly missing part of the book is the description of the events surrounding the visit to the Prime Minister's office and installation of Travis as the head of the B.P. The letter send to Churchill (and Welchman was one of the signatories) is not mentioned.If one is interested in the recollection of the facts; there are gaps in this book that can be filled if one reads wonderful books by D. Kahn. Welchman constantly (and justifiably) complains that his memory is not as good as it used to be.All-in-all is an attractive book for a nut like me who read dozens of books on the subject but it is probably a bit dry and borderline boring for someone who picked this book without an extensive background."},{"Title":"Women in Ancient Rome","review":"This volume is part of a fine series which looks at women's role in civilization.

Anyway, this book is terribly, terribly bad, nasty, ugly, whatever you want to call it, but also engrossing and enjoyable. At least I enjoyed the crazy, soap-operatic plot, and January Wayne really is an endearing, touching character, always looking for happiness in all the wrong places and trying so hard to be loved. In other case I would have ruthlessly dictaminated that she was a moron, but she spent the best years of her life cooped up in a secluded clinic, so it's easier for me to understand her astounding naivete. The other characters are less likable, even January's father, for all his practicality and relative good sense, although Karla is quite a person, and not nearly as stupid as she tries to make others believe. Very, very bad book, but very, very well written and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"I remember buying this book in hardcover the week it was released--for the same price a paperback goes today. After Jacqueline Susann's previous novel, The Love Machine, I'd been eagerly awaiting her next book. I was not disappointed.I read it so many times, the dust jacket was in tatters. I loved it. Once again, Susann delivers. Once is Not Enough focuses on famed movie producer Mike Wayne and his only child, his daughter January. As the jacket blurb says, January is in love with her father. No man ever measures up to him in her eyes.When January is seriously injured in a motorcycle accident and spends months recuperating in a hospital in Switzerland, she returns home to find the world as she knew it has changed dramatically. Her father is broke, having spent everything he had on her medical bills and having lost his Midas touch in Hollywood. He's remarried to a socialite January can barely tolerate. This new marriage plunges January into an unfamiliar world in which she searches for the one thing she craves most:love.

Because of it I also read the Valley of the Dolls some years later - also a translation in Portuguese."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"DUE TO THE CONTENT OF THE ITEM REVIEWED, THIS REVIEW IS RATED PG-13/R.Jacqueline Susann launched a genre and crowned herself queen of the wonderful bad book with \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" the first and still the best of the trashy showbiz romans a clefs. Say what you will about her fascination with the seamy underbelly of the lives of the rich and famous or her artless prose, the woman had first-hand access to the cruel machinations of the entertainment business and could tell a story that keeps the reader turning the pages. The reader roots for the characters in \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" because at the beginning of the book, they have dreams and the youth, hope and will to strive for them. If I'm in bed with the flu and there's nothing good on TV, I reread my well-worn copy of \\"Valley of the Dolls.\\"\\"Once Is Not Enough,\\" written when Susann knew she had terminal cancer, is a much bleaker, dirtier book. I suppose it reflects both Susann's mood and the tawdry state of New York City in the early 1970s when the majority of the story takes place. It's about January Wayne, a beautiful, wealthy girl in her early 20s with an Electra complex and her struggle to love a man other than her father.SPOILER ALERTJanuary Wayne is the only child of Mike Wayne, a charismatic Broadway and film producer. January's mother commits suicide when she is seven. January and her father become extraordinarily close (though no actual incest). It's hard to like January because she's so vapid and she's always had everything handed to her.Mike, a serial adulterer, loses his money and marries Dee, a wealthy closet lesbian who uses her money to control everyone around her and loves Karla (no last name), a reclusive Polish World War II refugee and retired screen goddess who also has sex with and is escorted around town by Dee's nephew David, who while he obsesses about Karla keeps trying to marry January for her money, even though he and January don't have a thing to say to one another. Linda, the sex-obsessed editor of a magazine called \\"Gloss,\\" hires January as some sort of writer because of the celebrity connections January has through Mike. Linda becomes January's friend and \\"mentor,\\" encouraging January to engage in promiscuous sex and get \\"vitamin shots.\\" The shots give the lethargic, passive January a ton of energy but are actually laced with methamphetamine. Through her work on \\"Gloss,\\" January meets and finally finds love with Tom Colt, an author even older than her father, when she \\"cures\\" his impotence. Unfortunately Tom has a wife and child out in California and writing always comes first with him. Although Tom dumps January and breaks her heart, I found him the most likeable (actually the only likeable) character in the book because he knows what he is and he's honest about it. After Mike and Dee die in a plane crash and Tom dumps her, January goes to a wild orgy with a group of off-Broadway actors where she takes LSD and has an orgasm during which she screams \\"I love you Mike!\\" Then she goes out to a beach in the Hamptons where she disappears, perhaps by drowning or perhaps by UFO abduction. No, I am not kidding, it could have been a UFO abduction.END OF SPOILERSWhile generally better-written than \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" (the bizarre ending on the beach is quite atmospheric, for example) and still something of a page-turner, \\"Once Is Not Enough\\" will never become a sickbed favorite. It reflects Susann's obsessions: the father complex--she actually dedicates this book about an Electra complex to her father's memory: creepy!--drugs, show business, music of the WWII generation, plastic surgery, lesbianism and mental impairment. The sex is much more graphic than in \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" the drugs are harder, the theater is all about nudity and prurient curiosity, every character is using another character for something, and anybody who decides to get off the hamster wheel and do something worthwhile with his or her life is killed off. I don't object to sex, drugs or swearing out of hand (I gave Keith Richards' \\"Life\\" five stars), but \\"Once is Not Enough\\" is merely sordid, pointless and completely lacking in the seedy charm that made \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" a great bad book. I felt thoroughly depressed and crummy after finishing it and have already deleted it from my Kindle. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"J. Susannn had an IQ of 140, and it shows. This book is pretty dark. The movie (starring Kirk Douglas and beautiful Deborah Raffin) is more whimsical and eliminates a lot of the subplots that are present in the book. To get a \\"slice of life\\" in the 1970s, nothing is more interesting than this book. A Louis Vuitton shoulder bag cost $130 - those were the days. The harshness of relationships is a big theme, and how people are constantly changing their minds, trying to convince themselves to be loyal to one person, etc. Main characters are:January - poor little rich girl, but so much more, back in the US after three years spent rehabilitating from a motorcycle accidentMike - gruff and tough man, January's dad who loves her more than everything but has to learn to respect herDee - a selfish heiress. She is much more developed in the book than in the movie. I really enjoyed her character.David - Dee's nephew. He's also a more complex character in the book than in the movieKarla - Polish movie icon in her 50s, remains hugely appealing to several other charactersLinda - friend of January's from work. Has some of the best dialogue and I suspect is the \\"voice\\" of J. Susann and friends of the time. Also, actress who played this character in the movie was nominated for an ACADEMY AWARDTom - January's lover, book provides interesting anatomical detail that didn't make it into the movieKeith - Linda's ex, interested in January, key to the ending of the book which differs from that of the movieSome of my favorite lines from the book, that are also in the movie:\\"Everyone has large dogs nowadays. Not for pets.. for protection\\"\\"Gucci is in and Pucci is out\\""},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"The second time I read this book, I found that I really identified with Linda Riggs! Always the star in school, once she hit the real world, she found that nothing in life comes easy. But, why not use what abilities you have to get what you want? January was the perfect way for Linda to feel that she was still a creator and God all rolled into one! January was daddy's girl, and who better to have for a dad then one of the most accomplished directors in the history of Hollywood? After getting January a job at Gloss Magazine, Linda then wants her to use whatever pull she has to get an interview with Tom Colt. But, along the way, Linda finds herself attracted to Tom. But, one glitch in that is that January is also attracted to Tom. So, Linda pulls the childish tactic of getting January another assignment at Gloss so she can have Tom all to herself. Didn't work! So, a little tramp like Linda backs off when she sees that Tom really has feelings for January. But, in a sense, January is more of a lady than Linda could ever hope to be! But, keep in mind, that Dee (Mike's extremely rich wife) also was using Mike to keep her image to the public intact. If I were Mike, I wouldn't have stayed with Dee once he found out that Dee's only pleasure in life was running other people's lives. But, in a sense, Dee is like Linda in the sense that the one person that Dee can't run over is the one person she cares the most for. The Great Karla. But, I can see the similiarities between Mike and Karla. They both stay alive and Kicking by using and taking advantage of anyone who seems the least bit interested in them. But, January is in a sense trapped in two worlds. the one she had at Miss Haddons and the one that Mike throws her into after her accident. When you are between two worlds, of course, you can't be expected to fit into either one. Enter the Vitamin Shots. (LSD). January tries them, and finds that they help her to cope with the reality of her messed up perception of the world. Needless to say, Dolls and Lsd go hand in hand!"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Having read Valley of the Dolls, I expected this book to be one of the same type of books. Wrong! This is a very powerful and poignant look into the subject of mental incest. January Wayne is the main character. Having Mike Wayne as a father, she had the perfect role model. Strong, no-nonsense, and always ready for action, after a tragedy befalls her, January returns to Mike and the life he arranged for her. January tries to fit his perfect daughter image, but along the way she finds out that daddy isn't the only one who can get what he wants. Enter Linda Riggs, editor-in-chief of Gloss Magazine. Hard, nonplussed and ambitious, Linda brings January into her office and changes her idea of life. After getting a job at Gloss with Daddy's approval, January replaces Daddy dream man with Tom Colt, an Exceptional writer and larger igame of daddy himself. When January falls in love with Toma nd forgets about Daddy, Dee (Mike's new wife) cuts January out of her will. Or, almost! Mike finds out about January and Tom's affair, and tries to get January to end it by attacking Tom. But, Daddy's girl turns on him and tells him to leave. Then, a tragic accident befalls someone very close to January, and she is left with only ten million dollars to keep her happy. Afterward, she finds that life really wasn't all that great, but once is not enough. If you liked Valley of the Dolls, read Once is not Enough. You will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"This book chewed me up and spit me out. When it was over, I felt as though I had been abducted by aliens (hint hint). While this book has one of the ugliest covers of any book known to man (and I refer to the original cover, not the updated 90's version by celebrated graphic designer, Evan Gaffney), it does boast an Oscar nomination for Brenda Vaccaro for the film version. My favorite passage is the paragraph starting on page 447 of the new edition. January is doped up and feeling free (and feeling everyone else as well). That one compact paragraph uses the F-word 18 times plus the immortal line: &quot;Sniff hard, January...It's a popper.&quot; BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!!! and then you need to read &quot;Yargo&quot; with the giant bumble bees in the cigar shaped ships.

Jacqueline Susann's attention to the language, behaviour, and fashion of the time is very apparent in her prose. I first got interested in Jackie Susann after reading &quot;Lovely Me,&quot; the bio written about her. Also, my roommate had a lot to say about Jackie, so I had to read one of her books. Overall, from what I've read, I understand that Jackie's books were heavily edited. However, from reading this one book, I still think whatever all editing was done, it did not water down what it was that Jackie Susann wanted her readers to experience. I highly recommend this book, and I've sort of been putting off finishing the book for a week now, which I do with really good books. Alas, I'm about to start on Rona Jaffe's newest book, so I've got another good one lined up afterwards."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Does anyone remember the feud between Truman Capote and Jacqueline Susann?I've read that in a Tonight Show appearance, he described her as looking like &quot;a truck driver in drag.&quot; For her part, Susann parodied Capote through characters in her books, including this one.Ultimately, though, Capote got the last laugh on Susann: While most bookstores carry Capote reprints, few, if any, offer Susann novels for sale. If you do get your hands on a Susann book--or at least, &quot;Once Is Not Enough&quot;--you'll see why.Her dialogue, description and characters are unoriginal and average, at best, while the storyline itself is simply over-the-top. As described by the book jacket on the old copy I read, &quot;Once&quot; deals with the theme of mental incest. See, there's this beautiful, innocent little number named January Wayne who's crazy about her movie mogul dad, Mike. In trying to cope with the fact that he's recently remarried, she ends up lost and afraid in a world she never made of parties, vitamin injections and the sex-obsessed rich and powerful.Quite the combination, eh? Well...I have to admit, as bad as the book is, I appreciated it in the same, awful way I enjoy the Spice Girls. And in many aspects, &quot;Once&quot; can be considered a mirror of early 1970s society. In one scene, January shops for clothes, marveling over the mini- and maxiskirt lengths--even purchasing a semi-formal patchwork dress at one point. Now, how cool is *that*"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"I have been moved, changed, turned upside down by this amazing piece of work. I have seen the light, Jackie! Very few people know that Jackie was really a man! But I do, I knew him well. Way to Jackie, hey-hoo!"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"I didn't know if Jacqueline Susann could live up to \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" with this book, but she sure did! \\"Once is Not Enough\\" is thoroughly entertaining. The story revolves around January Wayne, a tragic heroine who has an unnatural adoration for her father and is unable to have a successful relationship with another man because of it. When her father marries a wealthy woman to secure his family's financial future, January finally falls in love. Unfortunately for her, the man she falls for is Tom Colt, a married man who is older than her father. Tom replaces \\"Daddy\\" for January, but it's only a matter of time before the relationship drags her down into the drug-induced haze that every Susann heroine eventually falls victim to.Like \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" \\"Once is Not Enough\\" boasts many colorful characters whose lives intersect in a variety of unexpected ways. There are some funny moments in the book, but for the most part it consists of tragedy and unhappiness. The final few chapters threw me for a loop because the ending is more depressing than either of Susann's other novels. Still, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining read. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Mrs. Susann was a cinematic writer. She was not content to write books in which poor people walk around in circles and talk about their problems. Instead, she wrote about rich, beautiful people-probably the only interesting kind-and exposed them for what they are: spoiled, lonely creatures who need to be constantly reassured of their uniqueness. Most serious writers hate Mrs.Susann because 1)she was a woman who defied convention, 2)she had more balls than most writers ever dreamed of having, and 3) she wrote about people most academics would love to be. With that said, Once is not Enough is not as good as Valley of the Dolls. You can tell that it wasn't well edited, but who cares? The protagonist January Wayne is really interesting: a rich, fragile girl with an Electra complex. She's involved in a motorcycle accident that leaves her in a coma and unable to walk. Mike, her daddy, stays by her side, but he loses his touch in Hollywood and becomes poor. He has to marry a rich society witch named Dee Milford Granger, who is secretly in love with a Polish actress named Karla, who in turn is in love with Dee's nephew David, who Dee wants January to marry when she is fully recuperated. There is also a horny magazine editor named Linda Riggs and an impotent Mailer type writer named Tom Holt. Needless to say, these characters commit all kinds of wonderful indecent acts. Once is not Enough is not the kind of novel you read for depth of character. You read it for its spectacle, and thank god, Mrs. Susann lived long enough to fill our boring lives with that. Jackie was a wonderful, brilliant woman who deserved more respect than she got."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"...but I tried by picking up this book. When I was 13 my mother refused to allow VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in the house so I read it bit by bit at the local library and was thrilled by the fast-lane problems, hard characters and handy pills. Even as an early adolescent it was easy to recognize good trashy fun.ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH is not great literature but it still delivers and now, in retrospect, points up the 70s as a kind of innocent time when everyone went to New York City to find their fortune and fill their heart's desire, as well as drempt of being rich enough to travel around in style. Susann knows that it's entertaining to read about folks who travel at a moment's notice to Los Angeles, London, Rome, Cannes and Switzerland to play out their caprices. It seems daring of Susann to write about January's ambiguous love for her father and to describe nearly sexual scenes between them. The book remains steadfastly moral however, and January, who has everything anyone could wish for, remains alone and unloved, realizing too late that one moment of happiness is not enough."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Her third consecutive #1 bestseller, ONCE was also her last completed novel before her tragic early death. Susann knew she was dying when this book was written, and this may account for the book's hysterical and desperate emotional tone. Like all her novels, ONCE is a tale of alienated relationships, sexual obsession, and unrequited love, with a little hint of incest for added spice in this case. The characters are more sympathetic than in any of her previous novels, but the plot is so far out and the dialogue so extreme that ONCE comes dangerously close to high camp. Then again, the early 1970's (the culture which produced this book) was an era of extremes at every level, so perhaps this is not surprising. ONCE still packs a punch (particularly in the final orgy scenes), and like all Susann, is written in such a vivid manner that you can't put it down. Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Incest, orgies, rape, UFOs, betrayal, drugs, dark secrets and hidden children. Yes, this book has it all. And it did keep me reading, as did Valley of the Dolls. It is not good literature, but who reads Jackie for good literature? It is a terribly fun read, though. I just picked up The Love Machine and will give it a read probably later this month, if I can hold off that long. I'm only giving it three stars because I feel it could have used some editing, and she could have rearranged some of the story a bit. I don't think the nun rape scene should be so far from the Karla scenes that happen later in the book. For a while I had an odd feeling that that was the end of Karla. Then she came back and all was well again. She could have varied her sentence structure a little, too? But don't let these little quibbles keep you away."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Jackie Susann's final novel published in her lifetime is the story of young January Wayne, a girl with an Electra complex so big, you'll blush. \\"Enough\\" is a terrific read. It goes quickly, is maddeningly involving and, if I may be so bold, is better written than Susann's classic \\"Valley of the Dolls.\\" Sure, this is tried and true Susann territory with the milquetoast heroine and the usual stew of sex, drugs (in this case \\"vitamin shots\\")and deceit is in place but even so, this time something's different.In \\"Enough,\\" New York is no longer a glamorous city but a place becoming overrun with junkies and whores, Broadway shows feature (simulated) sex and nudity (but that's nothing compared to the downtown theater scene!) and movies are less escapist than a reflection of the growing desperation of the late 60s/ early 70s. Susann, to her credit, bravely takes on this new era but you can't help feel that she really doesn't know what to make of it. Some of the attempts at youth culture and lingo seem less than authentic (Did people really say, \\"How about throwing on some slacks and coming over!\\" back then?) and other incidents appear to have germinated in stories that Susann may have heard being whispered in passing at a party and wrote down (\\"Did you hear about the types of parties those kids have nowadays?\\") And despite featuring a heroine in her early twenties, Susann has January get involved in a bad accident and spend three years (not so coincidentally the \\"revolutionary\\" years 1967-70) in a Swiss hospital that does not allow television, radio or newspapers. Perfect - a young heroine who's a tabula rasa with no knowledge of the youth movement. Golly, what a neat trick!The characters in the book are a fun lot, though I felt Karla was exceptionally frustrating as \\"the lesbian who wasn't\\" and David Milford was as stiff as they come (and the casting of George Harrison as David in the film version makes perfect sense.) Look out for the characters of Linda Riggs and Tom Colt allegedly based upon Gloria Steinem and Norman Mailer, respectively. Try not to laugh when you come upon Tom Colt's \\"ailment\\", perhaps one of the funniest cases of literary revenge ever.If you only have read and enjoyed \\"Valley of the Dolls\\", you should definitely check this one out. It's a lot of fun but you won't feel especially guilty for enjoying it."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"I first read Jacqueline Susann back in the 70's, and am glad these books have been re-released. This is my least favorite of Susann's &quot;Trash Trilogy&quot; of books, probably because it has the most tragic ending, but it is still worth the read for the shocking behavior of her characters. Especially when you take into consideration the era they were written in.Once Is Not Enough is about January Wayne, a very spoiled girl who has an unnatural attraction to her own father. A self-centered man who was not around enough as January grew up in boarding schools. January really does suffer, she is in a horrible accident and spends three years recovering. She joins her father and his new rich wife in New York, and wonders what to do with her life since she cannot have her father. She goes to work with an annoying schoolmate at a magazine, and her life on her own begins.She is courted a good looking man who is in love with another woman, and then meets Tom Colt when she is assigned to interview him for the magazine. Tom Colt replaces Daddy for her, and she falls hard for this older, rude, hard drinking, and married man. I had to snicker at Tom's &quot;little problem&quot;, I think every woman did.Karla is kind of an enigma, and definately the most interesting character in the book. Everyone is unhappy, and just when Mike, Dee, Karla, and January seem to be on the brink of getting it together and doing someting to make themselves happy, tragedy strikes. A plane crashes, and like dominos, the lives that are left slowly crash also.Of all Susann's novels, drugs are never portrayed in a positive way, and Once Is Not Enough probably brings the worst into play, because January is more innocent that Susann's other drugged heroines. So of course, she falls quicker and harder when she finds them. Good campy trash, fun to read, and well written as usual in wonderful Susann style."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"January Wayne is the daughter of a big time play and movie producer Mike Wayne. She also has a very unnatural attraction to him. When he gets married to rich Deirdre Milford Granger she is upset and searches for love and meaning in her life with other people. Among the huge cast of characters is David Milford who supposedly loves her; Karla a mysterious and reclusive movie star (obviously modeled after Greta Garbo); Linda Riggs, a fashion magazine editor desperately searching for love...and sex and Tom Holt a masculine man who she sees as her father.OK--this is Jacqueline Susann so you know it's not great literature. However it is a lot of fun to read. It moves quickly and has believable characters and situations. Also it's full of some VERY strong material. There's sex, drugs, orgies, nuns being raped, lesbians and VERY frank sex talk. Also it takes place in 1970 and 1971. It captures EXACTLY what it was like in New York at that time. It captures the mood and tone of the times. There's plenty of talk about nudity in plays, the generation gap, fashions, \\"vitamin\\" shots etc. etc. Among other things this is a perfect time capsule of that time and place.Also this has to be her best written book. I found \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" boring and terribly written. \\"The Love Machine\\" was better but THIS is just great. She improved as she went along and, by this book, she was a pretty good writer. Sadly, this was her last book (unless you count \\"Doloros\\" and \\"Yargo\\" published after her death) but she went out on top. Yes it's trashy but it is FUN! My only complaint was the ending which was REALLY strange--but it sets the stage for \\"Yargo\\". HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"Let me just start by saying that I don't agree with people who use the word &quot;trash&quot; when describing the work of Jacqueline Susann. Her books indeed did involve drugs and sex, but they show the DARK sides of drugs and sex; nothing glamorous about it. The language she uses is very straightfoward and &quot;in-your-face&quot;, and above all, very real. A lot of people use the fact that the &quot;f&quot; word is used often as an excuse to call it trash, when, in reality, the &quot;f&quot; word is a word that is used often among the types of people in the book. As in all Susann novels, you'll find a bit of Jackie in the novel, and you might also find a bit of yourself."},{"Title":"Once is Not Enough","review":"In reply to Jhood - Capote described Jackie as a &quot;truck driver in drag&quot; - then apolized to all the truck drivers.

Written from the heart, it is a combination of soap and science fiction, (Her original ending was to include a sex scene with a space alien. I suggest you read her novel - 'Yargo'.)This was her last completed novel. She first found out she had breast cancer soon after 'Valley' was published. She had hope thru 'Love Machine' (hense the ankh symbol - symbol of life) but by this novel I believe she knew wouldn't survive.What does it mean to be loved? To be a human in an inhuman world? To try to make sense of senselessness?I believe more than all the male writers before her - she came closest to answering these questions (and having a ball at the same time!).'Once is not Enought' is about trying to live one's life in only one lifetime."},{"Title":"Right Here On This Spot","review":"This award winning look at the past, winner of the Archer/Eckbald Children's Picture Book Award, is a touching look at the history of place.

Addy takes the intriguing question of \\"What happened right here on this spot--last week, last year, a million years ago?\\" and turns it into a meditation on change, time, loss, and more. She goes from pre-human history to native Americans hunting to pioneers to Civil War soldiers, all planting them firmly in the exact same spot, living their lives out, leaving their fragments of history for future generations to find.Addy's tale is more than matched by the breathtaking illustrations of artist John Clapp. Clapp, who teaches illustration at San Jose State University, has done a superlative job of giving larger life to the text without overpowering it. His illustrations are not only incredibly realistic and beautiful, but they transcend their medium by having an almost emotive quality. You almost hold your breath to see the Civil War soldier waving goodbye from a field.I can't recommend \\"Right Here on This Spot\\" highly enough, and hope that reading this review will spur more readers to purchase it.

It focuses on his way of seeing things, his path in perception in Art and Social Criticism. Landow claims that Ruskin thought by seeing and in this seeing also saw the symbolical and mythological meanings he valued in Art. Landow discusses Ruskin's championing and promoting of the work of J.M. Turner. He often cites that complicated Ruskin prose style which supposedly influenced among others Proust. He outlines Ruskin's social thought, his concern for the poor and presents Ruskin's unique conception of economics. For Ruskin wealth was not measured in money or possessions but ' fullness of life'. And Ruskin believed the great deprivation and social evil was not simply in material poverty but in loss of opportunity for cultural and spiritual enrichment. Ruskin is a visionary of Art and Social Reality, who saw both with the eyes of Tradition and with his own radical ideals of how to better reconstruct the world. Landow also indicates the very great influence of Ruskin in Victorian thought. As one who does not know Ruskin's work that well I felt this work gave me a clear idea of the main purpose and direction of a major nineteenth - century creative visionary."},{"Title":"The D.A.

All of the characters are in some way connected to the theater community and artifice is therefore their business. There is a great deal of confusion between what is real and what is feigned, imagined, projected or merely confusing. The reader sees everything through the eyes and mind of the eponymous party host. Gerald is a womanizer and a hopeless relativist. For most of the evening he tries to understand and rationalize increasingly outrageous behavior on the part of his party guests and the police who come to investigate the murder of one his party guests.Yes, this is a murder mystery, or at least it is a parody of one. The number of dead bodies that turn up is never certain, but there at least four. The first body (and the only murder that the police investigate) is that of Ros, a bad actress and a loose woman who is much beloved by everyone at the party, male and female. She is an innocent, a creature of pure impulse and she is beautiful. But as the evening progresses you realize that no one really knows her and that she is perhaps unknowable. At some point Coover suggests that she is the personification of Truth; the police detective reveals that Ros looks exactly like a mysterious woman who he has met only in his dreams and who his therapist has told him symbolizes Truth.Coover uses people's memories and ritual use of the body of Ros to show that this community (apparently representing all of us) has a very shakey relationship with the Truth. Ros is all things to all people. Some party guests initially keen hysterically over her loss, while others simply shake their heads and pretend to have seen it coming. In the course of the evening, however, she is reduced to a memory and her body to a stage prop and a symbol.Coover repeatedly juxtaposes the mundane with the horrifying. Policemen eat sandwiches while they are beating recalcitrant guests. Gerald's wife shows off the sewing room to the new neighbors while he is lying on the floor of the same room unable to remove his penis from a teenager that he has just (accidentally) deflowered. In order to get better light on the shot a cameraman asks Gerald to move to one side while he is comforting his best friend, who as been shot in the heart by the police.This is a hilarious and depressing book. If you don't have a strong stomach for irony or don't think that debauchery is funny, then it probably isn't for you. If you enjoy being told that the bourgeoise are going (have gone) to hell in a handbasket, then read with pleasure."},{"Title":"Gerald's Party (Coover, Robert)","review":"\\"Gerald's Party\\" depicts a single evening in the life of Gerry, a married man who has opened his home to a flood of strange friends, and describes the chaotic string of strange events which occur. The book is written in real time, its 300 pages comprising a single narrative, unbroken by chapters, from the party's beginning to its end. Gerry is the narrator, proceeding from event to event, unable to control anything, and hardly able to understand anything, including himself.The book is experimental, but does have a plot, concerning a murder-mystery at Gerry's party of strange guests. The story is told in the tradition of surrealists, however, and not a straightforward narrative. Once the reader settles into understanding how the story works, it becomes a joyful romp through mad times.The theme of the book is very simple: life is a major mess, and it just keeps going. People eat and drink, sleep and sex, live and die, digest and waste, kill and protect, mate monogamously and share polyamorally, control themselves and let themselves go, have children and have fun, grow up and act childish, dirty and clean, dress and undress, lie and speak true, think scientifically and think artistically, fantasize and live pragmatically, search for philosophical meaning and live hedonistically for today. And they never stop! Robert Coover pushes all the buttons in the psyche of the human animal, as if writing a reference manual for an extraterrestrial, telling it: \\"Here's humanity. Welcome to it!\\"This book is experimental and surreal, but arguably more accessible than Beckett, and certainly more earthy and explicit. (This is so Coover can push all your buttons.) It uses an interesting form of dialog occasionally: two or three different conversations interweave their lines, making it a joyful challenge to follow along, and creating interesting intersections at times. There are two dozen characters, all with their own independent dynamic, and Coover mixes them with entertaining effect. Some are consistent, such as the wife, the son, the mother-in-law, and others, who exercise their own unique idiosyncracies steadily throughout the book, like pschological points of reference interweaving with the other characters.This book is very well done. I cannot praise it highly enough. Coover deserves immense credit for pulling it all off. Once the reader understands the story is meant to be absurd, not literal, it becomes great fun, very vivid, and memorable. Coover is extremely imaginative, and \\"Gerald's Party\\" is a fantastic riot."},{"Title":"Gerald's Party (Coover, Robert)","review":"This was my third Coover novel. I had read &quot;Origin of the Brunists&quot; and &quot;A Night at the Movies&quot; a few years ago. &quot;Gerald's Party&quot; is an account of a party gone wildly out of control in every way possible. The story climaxes with an impropmtu and highly metaphorical theatre production in Gerald's living room, mind you, involving all the (surviving) characters (clothed and unclothed) that summaraizes the whole concept of the book. How many parties have you been to like that?! The dialogue is from people all over the house (in whatever room Gerald is in at the time), all mixed in with, and at the same time as his own conversations. The prose gets hazier as the night goes on and the multiple-conversation thing does too but it's all in the name of an accurate party aesthetic. It's difficult to latch onto at first but well worth it. Up there with Barth's &quot;Lost in the Funhouse&quot; as an important and tricky but really fun fiction work about fiction. Sit back and enjoy it like I did, but don't get fooled. Sweet vermouth on the rocks is never a good idea. I don't care who's drinking it or what they look like."},{"Title":"Gerald's Party (Coover, Robert)","review":"This is a very intelligent, beautifully written book; yet, for me, there just was not enough natural momentum to carry the whole thing off. Time...one of the main obsessions in the life of this novel, and the idea of Time being nonexistent, and ever the same with only spacial relations changing is one that is dwelled on by some of the characters. And that's the problem with this novel, with the idea of time thrown out the window every page read the exact same. Read any 30 pages and you will enjoy them immensly but to keep it up for 300 pages is more stamina than i could produce.There were so many funny scenes though!! But, like a David Lynch movie, after awhile the bizzarities just become repetitive and annoying, with nothing deeper underlying them. Some of the kids from Coover's generations (Barth, Vonnegut, kind of Barthelme) seem to do things that would be more fun to think up and write than to actually read. With these guys (i hate to group, but oh well) you can almost always imagine them slyly smiling behind the page at their zany little creation or attack on the prevailing form of fiction. It often comes off as too academic.At the same time not at all... there is way more chaos and madness than most uptight, imaginitively limited professors could ever handle, brimming in blood, unsound meditations, dizzying desire... i guess i dont know what to think about this novel... i kind of think Coover may be one of those writers who sometime down the road i will want to scream at myself for ever criticizing."},{"Title":"Gerald's Party (Coover, Robert)","review":"--it would look something like the shindig being thrown in Robert Coovers *Geralds Party.* Think Sartres *No Exit* but with a lot more guests, a lot more sex, and a lot more dead folks. Youre not reading this book for plot, anymore than you'd read Samuel Beckett for plot, so don't expect anything to really \`happen' in the conventional sense. Nor should you expect anything to be resolved--or even make \`sense.' In other words, this novel is a lot like life, only without all the humanizing illusions that ordinarily shield us from what lies just beneath. As such, Coover throws a party that is largely a battlefield of warring lusts, jealousies, rages, and largely futile yearnings after transcendence--a party that reveals the radically anti-social beneath the social conventions that draw us together. Having said that, this is an extremely funny text, a comedy, if you will, in the classical sense of that term, in the Dantesque sense, surely...this being a party that could easily be taking place in Hell, if Hell were the home of a typically married couple in suburbia, which, of course, it all too often is.Language, too, is an important part of this novel--the sensual labyrinth of expression that words, as words, can take and Coover is a master at weaving words into a reality all their own. He has, in fact, \`reinvented' the world in his unique and distinctive style which is an accomplishment only the very best writers of any generation achieve. Coover is, indeed, one of the very best, and *Geralds Party* may be his finest book."},{"Title":"Gerald's Party (Coover, Robert)","review":"I have long admired Robert Coover's work and GERALD'S PARTY is among my very favorite novels.

Delicious. One word of warning: Watch your step in the back yard!"},{"Title":"The Price of Greatness: Resolving the Creativity and Madness Controversy","review":"Great book that the author poured heart and soul into through ten years of research. He states in the Preface that he spent this time investigating the link between mental illness and exceptional creative achievement. However, it's also about the characteristics--life histories, personality traits, etc--of people who achieve historical eminence in general. What are the characteristics of those who achieve the highest level of eminence? I'll name just two of them and not spoil the rest of it for you: the personality trait of contrariness, and the tendency to be a loner. What's most impressive about this book is the sheer volume of biographical information that the author read through in order to write this. He read extensively on about 1000 eminent people who lived in the 20th century, and then summarized the information in a concise and highly readable fashion. Overall, a great read for anyone remotely interested in the subjects of creativity, mental illness, and high achievement, as well as their relationship to one another.

However, he is a geographer, not a sociolinguist, and thus many of his conclusions are frankly question-begging. He seems to be pre-convinced that the language is dead, and writes accordingly. Although exaggerated optimism about the future of the language is definitely not justified either, Hindley's is no objective approach either. There are direct lies, such as the reference to the disintegration of the R&aacute;th Cairn Irish-speaking colony, which is still going strong, having even a web page in Irish.

Most of the fingerpicking is drab and more of chord progressions than true fingerpicking style. I'll rate this book at mediocre if you don't have the chord progressions for these songs, want a good fingerstyle of yesterday and get a good low price. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fingerpicking Beatles","review":"I hear what the other reviewers say, but I think they are being too critical of this work. It's not aimed at experienced players who have been gigging for years. This is all aimed at a player who has been doing fingerstyle for 6 months to a year and it won't challenge the advanced player at all. And as such the arrangements are easy to play and don't have harp effects, or any fingerpicking specialties. It's a learner's book.So if you've played for a while now and want to move up to something that will sound OK, then this is the book. These arrangements are slightly harder than the Fingerpicking series from Hal Leonard by about one grade. Hal Leonard is about grade 3-5 and this book is 4-6 level. (I'm a guitar teacher so that grading is more based on what I see students practicing and playing, than a technical measurement of note values per bar and tempo etc.).If you want to get into Fingerstyle this book would definitely be on the list, together with Hal Leonard's Fingerpicking StandardsFingerpicking Standards: 17 Songs Arranged for Solo Guitar in Standard Notation and Tablature, 30 Easy Spanish Guitar Solos30 Easy Spanish Guitar Solos (Book & CD), Travis Picking by Mark HansonThe Art of Contemporary Travis Picking: How to Play the Alternating Bass Fingerpicking Style (Bk & CD)and lastly the Fingerpicking method books by Alfred PublishingBeginning Fingerstyle Guitar (Book & Cd) (Complete Fingerstyle Guitar Method).

The arrangements in this book are NOT the same as those in the bigger book. They are in often different keys and are simpler and not as full-sounding. In addition, they are not &#34;guitaristic&#34; arrangements, but are more &#34;pianistic,&#34; which often creates awkward moments on the guitar.My recommendation is that you pay the extra money and buy the bigger book called &#34;Fingerpicking Beatles.&#34; It is much better."},{"Title":"Fingerpicking Beatles","review":"great book for the Beatles fan.

Taking their cue from the classic story of St. Francis of Assisi and the Wolf of Gubbio, the book's short stories (mostly short enough to be bedtime stories for young children) focus more on the saints' love for, and personal relationships with, individual animals, who all have names and personalities. This is a book that may be enjoyed by an adult, looking back to a long-gone era when children's books were not yet edgy or slapstick, but sweet and with a gentle moral... in this case, be kind to animals (which hardly seems oppressively 'teachy'!), but may equally be a a collection of fine bedtime stories to read to the two to three year old.

Having already reviewed the Audio Partners complete reading of &quot;The Code of the Woosters,&quot; I am happy to report that &quot;Carry on Jeeves&quot; (41109) is even a tad more successful.Any Jeeves fan must have noticed that the full novels are really a series of wild incidents put in to to stretch out a pretty flimsy plot premise. In the short stories, we have the typical pattern of Bertie Wooster ordered (by an aunt) to or tricked (by a friend) into helping out in some manner usually concocted by Jeeves with the ability of a master chess player who can see a dozen moves in advance. The original collection of stories under the title &quot;Carry On, Jeeves&quot; contains 10 independent episodes, of which eight have been chosen for this recording; and each fits the expected pattern.We start with Jeeves' first appearance &quot;Jeeves Takes Over.&quot; The other stories seem all to take place in New York City; and in two of them, Bertie is required to relinquish his flat so that some elderly relative of a friend will think it is the flat of the nephew. Telling the truth never seems to be the first course of action in any Jeeves story.The titles alone tell the story: &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy,&quot; &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo,&quot; &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot; are the ones that name the blighters who are thrust upon Bertie's good intentions and wallet. &quot;Without the Option,&quot; &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg&quot; are almost indistinguishable from the rest in plot and character, except that in the last one, the young man is actually admirable in his refusal to accept help from the Wooster largesse.Actor Marlin Jarvis does as good a job as did Jonathan Cecil in the earlier Jeeves recording, neatly adjusting his voice for each character; and indeed I would have thought I was hearing Ian Carmichael had I not known better.Another nice feature about these 4 tapes is that no story goes onto another cassette; and in only two of them do you have to turn the cassette over to hear the ending before the next story starts.

Totally hysterical. A classic"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"&quot;Carry On, Jeeeves,&quot; a collection of ten short stories first published in 1925 involving the adventures of Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, provides an excellent introduction to the world of P.G. Wodehouse. The collection contains the first Jeeves' story, in which the valet comes to work for Bertie replacing a valet named Meadowes, evidentally a hypocrite who converted to evangelism (as we find out in the story &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard&quot;.) At any rate, Meadowes was sacked by Bertie when the valet was caught stealing his silk socks. The stories take place in New York, briefly in Paris, and, of course, in London, although Wodehouse, as usual, does not delineate any part of New York except to place Bertie in a flat on 57nd Street and mention Washington Square as a place of Bohemianism, and Long Island as rural countryside. The stories contain the usual Wodehousian social parasites living off wealthy aunts, and develops such characters as Aunts Agatha and Dahlia, Bingo Little, Sir Roderick Glossop (the loony doctor) and several of Jeeves' numerous relatives, including a relatively incompetent constable and female model and partime &quot;actress.&quot; The charm of the Jeeves-Wooster stories, I have always thought, comes from Bertie as speaker, and Bertie narrates the action in nine of the ten stories. Wodehouse is at his best in characterizing Bertie: Wooster's prose tends to be rich in unusual similes, metaphors and 1920's slang; there is a cadence to Bertie's narration, as well as a refreshingly humorous charm to his perception of the world. Bertie has been termed &quot;a useless blot on the fabric of society&quot; by his former valet, and a &quot;wooden-headed blighter&quot; by others. Bertie, himself, admits to having &quot;half the amount of brain a normal bloke ought to possess.&quot; Even the discrete Jeeves considers Bertie &quot;mentally negliable,&quot; although, of course, this is an unspoken thought. (In the final story in this excellent collection, Wodehouse uses Jeeves as narrator, an unusual occurence in Wodehouse, but one which enriches the character of Jeeves and makes him more meaningful in later works. Wodhouse seemed to have exerted more care in the Jeeves' stories throughout his writing career. Wodehouse admits that he always took particular care to be especially humorous and witty in these stories because he thought that the reader demanded more with Jeeves and Wooster. &quot;Carry On, Jeeves&quot; is a highly recommended introduction into the world of Wodehouse; a first-time reader may, like most of us, become quickly addicted to Wodehouse and further explore the richly humorous world of this marvelous author. Longtime admirers will, of course, return frequently to these miniature gems."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"These ten short Jeeves and Wooster tales originally appeared in 1925 and three-quarters of a century later provide an excellent entry point to Wodehouse's comic series. The Jeeves and Wooster stories generally follow the same template, the young, wealthy airhead Wooster or one of his upper-crust pals gets in some sticky social situation, and it is up to his genius butler Jeeves to devise an ingenious solution to the quandary. Often the stories involve some manner of deception, misunderstanding, or often, mistaken identity-and sometimes, Jeeves' scheme backfires, resulting in even greater hilarity (although as with every comic tale, all is set right by the end). The stories can fairly be compared to contemporary TV sitcoms, as they to reply on recurring (often over the top) characters, a rarefied setting, a single type of humor, and recurring situations. Simply put, if you like one Wooster story (and don't get sick of them), you're going to like them all. Much of this can be explained by Wodehouse's mastery of the language and constant deft turns of phrase, period slang, and comic timing. Those who deride the shallow subject matter and milieu of the Jeeves and Wooster series need to recall the context in which these stories appeared. Only a few years removed from the horrors of World War I-an event that is never alluded to in the series, despite the loss of an entire generation of British young men-the stories can be viewed as a bandage of sorts, an attempt to transport the reader to a world far removed from the traumatic recovery from the Great War. Not to mention Wodehouse's clear depiction of the upper classes as wastrels and idiots of the highest order when compared to the street savvy of the servants (as exemplified by Jeeves). Of course, one doesn't read Wodehouse for social commentary or as a salve these days, but for his dry wit and keen command of the written word."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"I had never got around to reading any P.G. Wodehouse until I read this volume, and now I regret the delay.My first exposure to Wodehouse, at least the first I can remember, was the great Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie (better known from \\"Black Adder\\" and \\"House\\") TV series \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\". That series, plus a few artsy articles on Wodehouse (for example this one by Christopher Hitchens [...] ), turned my Wodehouse radar on.Even though the world of butlers and aristocratic drones in the 1920s may as well be life of the Siberian Steppes to us web connected suburbanites, the human comedy never really changes. It was the Jeeves and Wooster stories, not \\"Seinfeld\\", that was the original \\"show about nothing.\\"Every story starts from a minor mishap that turns into major mayhem, requiring the sagacious Jeeves to slide in and rescue his well meaning but social accident prone patron from the self induced quagmire.This is humour that is sympathetic to all the parties involved. As such it is a pleasant change from the rude brood of \\"cruder than thou\\" comedies that has dominated mainstream TV / movie comedy from both England and America for most of the last dozen years. My guess is that generation of young media consumers has grown up that know no humour other than the stick it someone else variety. Not to say there is anything wrong with that, it's just the monotony of it all that I am tired of.Bring back Wodehouse!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"This volume of ten stories originally hails from 1925. I read them in the 1999- 2000 Penguin paperback edition. While many readers like the covers by Ionicus on earlier Penguin paperbacks, these recent editions with covers by David Hitch are my favorites. They are very well done, reasonably priced and just the right size, which is to say, perfect for the novice or seasoned Wodehouse reader. The stories are also among the absolute tops in the Wooster/ Jeeves canon, and give the back stories that Bertie meditatively refers to in so many of the later books.As Richard Usborne notes in his invaluable guide, Plum Sauce, five of these stories appeared earlier in My Man Jeeves (1919). Two of the stories there told by Reggie Pepper are here transformed into Bertie's ruminations. Carry On Jeeves was the next collection following the ten stories in The Inimitable Jeeves (1923), and Wodehouse was on a roll. Here's Bertie's first engagement to Florence Craye, and his first encounter with her younger brother, Edwin, the Boy Scout, who rapidly renders unsafe house and home. Enter Biffy and Bingo Little, later fixtures in the Wooster ouvre. Here also Bertie pens his oft- mentioned \\"piece\\" for his \\"good aunt\\" Dahlia Travers, and her struggling paper, Milady's Boudoir. The last story in this collection is somewhat questionably narrated by Jeeves, but Wodehouse fortunately reverted to telling tales in first person Bertie in the later shorts. Some of these tales also found their way into the Jeeves and Wooster TV shows with even more riotous results. All in all, a capital collection."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"I am not a native English speaker, so my vocabulary consists of what I learned in school (a long time ago), what I hear on movies/TV, and what I read. Books and films most often these days come from America, of course, so that is the version of English that I speak (albeit with an accent). Reading P.G. Wodehouse, this or any other book, shows that the English language is not confined to the transatlantic variant; it can be so much richer! Add to that the wonderful, sarcastic sense of humour the man had and you end up with a truly sensational reading experience. Of course, you do need to know a bit of the society of which he writes. It makes me wonder what youths in e.g. the U.S. today would think if they read this book.I am still looking forward to many hours of delightful reading, as I have only read a few books yet. My own introduction to Bertie, Jeeves, and the others in fact came from the excellent British TV series starring Hugh Laurie (as Bertie) and Stephen Fry (as Jeeves). If you get the chance to see it, do so."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"It's almost impossible to write funny about humor, and anyone who writes seriously about it is doomed to come off as a fuddy duddy. E.B. White, a funny writer himself, once said that analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog, in that the thing tends to die in the process and the results will be interesting only to the purely scientific mind. -Andrew Ferguson, Divine Comedy : P.G. Wodehouse's perfect pitchTwo things the critics generally agree on are that : (1) P. G. Wodehouse is one of the funniest writers in the English language; and, (2) it's almost impossible to explain why. Among the various authorities cited for the difficulty in analyzing humor are Evelyn Waugh and Sigmund Freud, themselves authors of hilarious fictions. Suffice it to say, and I mean this in the very best sense, the enjoyments of the Jeeves and Wooster stories are much the same as those of the great TV sitcoms. Wodehouse created these two great comic characters, surrounded them in each story with oddballs, plunked them all down in trying situations, and then had the inimitable Jeeves extract Bertie and his upper-class nitwit friends from their difficulties through various stratagems and diversions. Though Andrew Ferguson and others deny that there is any deeper meaning or political content to the stories, it is at least notable that the finest young gentlemen in all of England are hopelessly overmatched by life unless Jeeves steps in to save them. The resulting stories have a certain sameness to them--of course, just try watching ten episodes of Cheers in a row and see if it's still fresh and amusing in hour five--but read in moderation they are immensely enjoyable and their very familiarity becomes quite comforting.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"P.G. Wodehouse's CARRY ON, JEEVES, is a masterpiece of hilarity! Jeeves is Bertram (Bertie) Wooster's manservant in jolly old England. Jeeves is always there to get poor Bertie out of his farcical jams. This book was first published in 1925, but the comedy plays out just as well today. I especially love the variety of turns of phrases that pop up on every page. (Imagine being described by Bertie as: &quot;As vague and woollen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich.&quot;!) Each of the ten short chapters is another adventure, with the last adventure being told from Jeeve's own point of view. I highly recommend this book, and I can't wait to read the others in the series!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Previous: The Inimitable JeevesWhile some of the stories in this collection pre-date The Inimitable Jeeves, it was published as a collection two years later, and so I'm calling it the second book in the series. The stories in this set are all stand-alone and unrelated. While many of them are charming, there is one that stands out far and away more noticeably than the others - the ingenious Bertie Changes His Mind. I will not give away the wonderful twist of this story, except to say that Wodehouse pulls it off with flying colors, and it is surprisingly hilarious. If the first couple paragraphs throw you a little, keep reading - you'll catch on, and you will be utterly charmed. Another notable story in this collection is The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy, in which Bertie looks like a genius in comparison.Next: Very Good, Jeeves"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Wodehouse is perhaps the best antidote I know for depression. His novels are literally unreal, for Bertie inhabits a world of leisure, servants, and privilege, an Edenic world where even the threat of pain, suffering, and mortality have no place, and Jeeves is always there as a deus ex machina. But ultimately we return to Wodehouse (again and again!) because of the language--quite simply, the man cannot write a bad sentence."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Martin Jarvis' reading of Carry On, Jeeves runs circles around Jonathan Cecil's reading of anything (for more on Cecil, see Psmith: Journalist). He simply embodies the characters of Bertie Wooster, Jeeves, Biffy, Corky, and all the cast (albeit with the same typical attempt at an American accent).Carry On, Jeeves contains eight of the ten stories available in the print version (the remaining two stories appear on My Man Jeeves), so completists will want that, but for pure enjoyment, you can't go wrong with this. Even the titles Wodehouse writes are funny, my favorite being \\"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy.\\" They simply roll off the tongue.The stories here include \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\" (chronologically the first as it tells the story of Jeeves' entry into Bertie's life). The others, namely \\"The Artistic Career of Corky,\\" \\"Clustering Round Young Bingo,\\" \\"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\\" (about a young cousin of Bertie's who goes wild under his wing), and \\"Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg\\" are all classics of the Wodehousian genre and show Jeeves at his problem-solving best.This would easily appeal to the casual Wodehouse fan, and is perfect for long road trips or any other situation where a laugh is needed. Wodehouse exceeds all others in humor and, one assumes, will remain that way for centuries to come."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"In Carry On Jeeves Wodehouse sends up the English aristocracy of the 20th century like no other writer.And the butler,Jeeves, stands alone as a calm voice of reason among a bunch of idiots led superbly by Bertie Wooster.Berties friends are always in trouble because of financial problems or usually because of their lack of ability to handle the strong women of the English upper Class.Hilarious at times as the stories from the English countryside & the Big Apple keep up the standard of Wodehouse writings that never fail to amaze, never fail to entertain.It always needs the remarkable Jeeves to solve Bertie & his friends problems that ensure asurprise ending to the many short stories in the book.It may not be the best of Wodehouse but it certainly is right up there with them."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"The book arrived quickly in perfect condition. The book itself is very humorous and very well written.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some reading on the lighter side."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Wodehouse writes brilliantly and with great humour. Jeeves, his mannerisms and the various characters practically jump off the pages. This is deucedly good reading."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"I'm not embarrassed to say that I came to the Jeeves stories many years ago through the wonderful BBC television program starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. For some reason, it took me a few decades to actually pick-up a Wodehouse book, though this one has been sitting on my shelf for a long while. It's too bad, really, because excellent writers of humor are so rare, and Wodehouse definitely fits into the category of excellent writers of humor.Consider this turn of phrase (from \\"Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest\\"): \\"She fitted into my biggest arm-chair as if it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearing arm-chairs tight about the hips that season.\\" I laughed aloud when I read this. It's an image both telling in the story and unforgettable as I think back on it. Wodehouse is a master of such humorous images. And the idiosyncratic dialect spoken by Bertie as our guide through most of these tales, is a linguistic masterpiece.Of course, the real charm of these stories comes from the characters. Every story is populated by a new set of colorful supporting cast of rich aunts & uncles, grasping nephews, clueless beaus and brides-to-be. But the great constant is the semi-dynamic duo, Bertie Wooster and his manservant, Jeeves. Bertie and his friends manage to get in scrape after scrape, but Jeeves always manages to come to the rescue (once his pique over matters of sartorial taste are mollified) with his extensive knowledge of his \\"betters\\" and their quirks of behavior.Of the number of collections of Jeeves stories and novels, this one has much to recommend it. So many of the stories are first-rate. \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\" relates the first encounter between Wooster and Jeeves. A number of stories take place in New York City, where Bertie gets exiled after irritating his aunt--a treat for American fans. \\"The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy\\" stars what is certainly Bertie's most air-headed pal (and that's saying a lot), and one of my favorite endings in the Palace of Beauty at the Wembly exhibition.In fact, the only sour note for me is the last story in the collection, \\"Bertie Changes his Mind\\". Not that the story doesn't have its humorous moments, but it was disconcerting to me to have Jeeves narrate the story instead of Bertie. Jeeves works best for me as that enigma hovering at the edge of the stage, only walking in when needed to solve the problems. Seeing him continuously in action too much of a peek behind the curtain for me.Still, these are fun, fun stories. A bit repetitive, sure, but fun just the same. Anyone who enjoys period stories that poke a bit of fun at the rich and BYTs of the post-(WWI)war period will find a lot to like here."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"one of the greatest master servant relationships ever, the amazing Jeeves and his charming but ignoramus master.

Don't yell it in a quiet theater these days, though. LOL. Anyone? Anyway, I really enjoyed this little gem. I listened to it on audio and the narrator was great as well. I go to the library and grab some audiobooks to listen to on my long commute and happened to grab this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely read more Wodehouse in the future.I only gave it a four because by the end it was getting a little predictable BUT still charming."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"My wife is a huge fan of the Jeeves and Wooster books. She said this one has been her favorite so far. Please understand my wife is not the type to laugh out-loud very often, being more of the serious type. However she laughs hysterically when she reads the Jeeves books, especially this one. I have not read the books but will one day.

Pick up any Wodehouse title--doesn't matter which one--and be astonished by his dexterity with the English language. Wodehouse is one of those authors that saves my sanity."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"As the last remnant of a decadent aristocracy, it was Bertie Wooster's job to knock about, dining at the club and interacting with others of his social status who had inherited a small trust fund and who were now awaiting the deaths of their maiden aunts, so that their personal fortunes could be aggrandized.Throughout the ten stories included in this volume, Bertie requires the assistance of his man Jeeves to select the correct stockings and shirts so as to be properly attired within his set.Bertie and his friends experience various difficulties which Jeeves resolves, often in an apparently humorous manner.The book itself first appeared in the U.S. in 1927 and contains stories extracted from, and perhaps revised, \\"The Saturday Evening Post\\" and the 1919 book \\"My Man Jeeves.\\" The stories are each somewhat amusing, if you do not mind that the main character has his opportunity to knock about only because he was born to a trust fund, containing no graphic violence, sex, etc. It would have been interesting, had the editor cited the first publication of each story. The Overlook Press edition, being reviewed, is a durable hardcover edition easy to read and hold. If you have never read a Wodehouse, this a good place to start.For those enjoying P. G.

Wodehouse work I've read and, overall, I am not particularly impressed. This collection of short stories about a rich young man, his valet (Jeeves), and his equally rich (and hapless) buddies. Jeeves is the savior to his rich employer whenever called to rescue him (and his friends) from some silly calamity. The stories are contrived and seem cast from the same mold, the setting is the hopelessly obscene upper-class 1920s society of New York and England (where no one works and everyone seems dependent on financial handout by some rich aunt/uncle), and one has to wonder why a clever domestic servant such as Jeeves puts up with such blithering ninnies.Having said all this, there are some clever comedic moments which are generally derived by the clever delivery of quips by Jeeves. One can have a pleasurable time reading Carry On, Jeeves. However it is little more than junk food for the brain, and much of this P.G. Wodehouse material has not aged well."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"This was a refreshing book to read. Funny and well-written, not only was it an introduction to English vernacular, but it seems Mr. Wodehouse was a huge influence on comedy writers today. Each chapter could have been an episode of any number of sit-coms. But, I don't want to downplay the value of this novel. I can't help but imagine what it was like to look at this as a new genre.But, these &quot;episodes&quot; still aren't as stale as some of those viewable today in primetime. Most are unpredictable, and the situations are unique (somewhat due in part to the time period, but also because they are realistically presented.) All the characters are likeable, even though they each have a teeny bit of deviousness, but that makes them more human. Their funny and they aren't plastic. They aren't completely real, but they aren't completely paper-made either. They're just plain entertaining.The last chapter of this book is the tip-topper of the whole novel. Just like a good show, it brings everything together. You wonder throughout just what Jeeves' angle really is, and in the end you find out. I can't wait to read another installment!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Carry On, Jeeves is another classic from P.G. Wodehouse. It follows in the same kind of humorous hiliarious vein of his other books that involve Berty Wooster and his Man Servant Jeeves. This is a book that should not be missed. In fact,all of P.G. Wodehouse's books involving Jeeves and Berty Woostershould be thoroughly enjoyed by every one."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Having NEVER read a P.G. Wodehouse novel I decided that I would pick up a Jeeves book and read that. And I was totally happy with what I got. 10 short stories, mostly from the first-person view of Bertie Wooster, with one story from the view point of Jeeves himself. Each story is full of simple, if silly, plots, weird, twisted turns and events, perfect wordcraft and very English characters. Maybe too English. The end result is a good book to sit down on a rainy day, to enjoy with tea and a comfortable chair. Light reading for any place or time. If you enjoy English humor or are a Rex Stout fan, being people who enjoy the proper use of the language, I would suggest this book"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"This is a collection of Jeeves stories, most set in New York, that also includes the story of how Jeeves came to be hired by Bertie Wooster and Jeeves own account of one of his adventures with Bertie. All is classic Wodehouse and great fun to read."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"The only complaint is that this book isn't longer. This is how it all begins for Bertie and Jeeves, and several of the incidents related become references in the later stories. Having read this collection after reading some later works, it was interesting to see how it all started. Brilliant, and as a previous reviewer noted, the only question is what edition of this book to buy. For the money, this one was perfect for me."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"I have tried a number of times to get into this author's work because my friends have recommended his work for years. Wit, hilarity, irony are frequent words tossed about in reference to his work. On every prior effort I've failed to \\"get it\\". I finally got it in two formats to break this impasse, if indeed it was breakable. First, I got the audio version of JEEVES & WOOSTER, narrated by Martin Jarvis. Then I watched the Video version with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. I am happy to report that I finally \\"get\\" the humor and fun which readers of Wodehouse have long enjoyed. If you too have had trouble getting into the wit behind the work, I suggest you do the same.The stories revolve around a well connected English gentleman, Bertie Wooster, who is as idle as can be. There are lords and ladies in his family. He did go to Eton and Oxford and now belongs to all the right clubs. However, the way he behaves, is the way most men of his class behaved in England back in his day, when automobiles were first coming out. You do see Bertie tooling about in his roadster. Bertie is funny but you are most definitely laughing at Bertie, not with him. He is likable but does not have much but air between his ears.Jeeves is as opposite from Bertie as can be. Jeeves is of the working class, Bertie's valet. He is suave, intelligent, well read, shrewd and manipulative. Also, he is always calm and collected, never losing his cool. In each and every story, it is Jeeves who rescues Bertie, his friends or his family members after they have gotten themselves (always) into some ferocious mess of their own making. Just with picking out potential marital partners, they are all utter disasters.A big part of my problem with Wodehouse and J&W; was simply being American. In this same era in America, a well born, well educated man like Bertie would be considered a sluggard for accomplishing nothing. That he could go to (by comparison) Andover and Yale, after being born into a prominent American family, yet be such an idiot that his valet had to do his thinking for him, would not be the making of an American satire! That Bertie and all his friends regard any form of work as beyond the pale is also about as un American a concept as there could be. This classic of wit and satire could only come from England since it revolves around the concept and conceit of the idle English gentleman in that era.Jarvis is absolutely splendid in all roles. I like Wodehouse much better on audio than on the printed page."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Let me first say I loved these stories in their traditional bookbound medium. Now let me say that I loved them even more with the fantastic Martin Jarvis at the mic, steering them as I've never heard any other reader steer a story. Jarvis' magic came from the fact that everything about his performance, from the voices, to the perfectly timed pauses, was just as I had imagined it in my own bean over the course of many readings. It's terribly hard to read a great book and then to subsequently have it torn apart by a horrific reading- not so with this Martin Jarvis, I tell you. If you've never had the pleasure of reading Wodehouse and are going to start your explorations via audio, then start with this collection. Someone bring this man more Wodehouse!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"These funny, light stories by P.G. Wodehouse are a must-read for any fans of him or British humor in general. This collection is the first of many featuring Bertie Wooster, a none-too-bright English gent, and his ingenius butler Jeeves, who is constantly thinking of schemes to get Bertie and his friends out of trouble. The Jeeves stories are a great place to start for anyone interested in Wodehouse's funny work. Though the stories are sometimes a bit long and may drag a little, they are still charming, charming tales. Delicious reading."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Did I read that correctly? The material is frothy and the characters haven't aged well? Perhaps lazza has missed the point of reading a Bertie and Jeeves.The characters of Betram Wooster and Jeeves are, indeed, far removed from today's society -- but that's what makes them so priceless. We are taken on romp after romp through busy London in the roaring 20s and the sleepy English countryside. And in the day-to-day lives of these two characters, Wodehouse has preserved for us the life of domestic service and the frivolities of the upper class in the 20s.Their lack of grit and raunchiness may be too tame for some, but P.G.'s Bertie and Jeeves deliver page after delightful page of sheer silliness, as Wodehouse strings us through meandering and beautifully crafted lines.So, comparing Bertie and Jeeves to 2009? Seems a little like comparing a stroll in the park to an hour online and asking, \\"Which one's better?\\" P.G. Wodehouse was one of THE great writers of prose. So relax, read, and enjoy, because with Wodehouse, getting there is half the fun."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the inimitable P.G. Wodehouse???Carry On, Jeeves is a great starter book for those who are intimidated with the amount of J&W; books available (or rather, don't know where to begin). The first story in this book is about the first day Bertie Wooster met his personal gentleman (or valet, if you prefer), Jeeves. The stories easily stand on their own; with the exception of characters being mentioned or being part of the plot, the book is not a novel you have to read front to back. Consider it a literary sitcom, where new scenarios and conflicts arise with each story you read.My favourite bit about reading Carry On, Jeeves was the last story of the book, where it takes a refreshing twist and is narrated by Mr. Jeeves rather than Bertie Wooster. It was great reading from Jeeves's perspective.Lots of chuckles throughout and a few hardy laughs. Overall a perfect read."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"P G Wodehouse specializes in extremely humorous, complex plots, with everyone seemingly at cross purposes, and the ubiquitous happy ending. His characters are the offspring of the builders of the British Empire, wastrels all. Bertie is an extremely affable chap, but a bit lacking in brain power. In the opening story Jeeves becomes Bertie's butler, definitely the brains of the duo. Bertie is one of natures bachelors, but this never prevents him from being engaged to completely unsuitable fiances. They generally have terrific profiles, volatile temperments, and consider Bertie to be a spineless jellyfish with brains to match; and attempt to mold him. The brainy literature they force on poor Bertie is way beyond our heroes reading level. Bertie leads an idyllic life, the sun is in the sky, the birds are singing in the trees, but he manages to always land himself in the soup. The magnificent Jeeves is ever there to fish him out, not unlike the magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Jeeves's mental prowess is always made available to come to the aid of Bertie's menagerie of pals."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"A collection of short humorous stories starring Bertram Wooster, a young English aristocrat of the Jazz age, and his cold-blooded, tactful and resourceful \\"gentleman's gentleman\\", Jeeves (first name never disclosed, or is it the surname that isn't disclosed!?). All but the last of the stories are told in Wooster's voice; the last, and, in my opinion, funniest one is told in Jeeves'.Most stories have the same structure: one of Wooster's pals, all of whom are upper class and hopeless sinecures, totally dependent on their rich aunts or uncles for sustenance, gets himself entangled in a silly contretemps of some sort. Wooster \\"rallies round\\" to his aid, calling upon his man Jeeves' superior strategic mind to provide the ruse that will save the day. It is only in the end of the story when the full nature of Jeeves' ploy is fully realized by Wooster and us.The stories are very well written, and engaging from the first letter to the last. They kept me constantly on the smile, often on the chuckle, and occasionally made me laugh out loud, particularly during the final story, \\"Bertie Changes his Mind\\".Wodehouse is a master of the English language. His vocabulary is very rich but very precise: i would often send a fumbling hand for the dictionary, and unflinchingly discover that the lexical definition of the word under consideration fits the usage to the T. He extracts every last drop of comedy from starchy, musty grammatical constructs, such as \\"Often of a spring morning\\", used to great effect in a memorable passage from one of the stories, \\"The Artistic Career of Corky\\".I cannot recommend this book enough. I'd been searching for a while for a book that would make me laugh. My penultimate attempt was Christopher Moore's \\"Fool\\"; suffice it to say that it is now on indefinite loan to one of my least favorite acquaintances. But from \\"Carry On, Jeeves\\" i shall not easily part."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"Jeeves and Bertie Wooster are my all-time favorite Wodehouse characters.

All of them are somewhere between good to great, but my favorites were Jeeves Takes Charge, Jeeves And The Unbidden Guest, The Rummy Affair Of Old Biffy, Without The Option, and Bertie Changes His Mind. The plotting is always tight and funny (in a situational comedy kind of way), and then Wodehouse's command of the language and his subtle turns of phrase throughout the book make it enjoyable on multiple levels. Sort of reminds me of Seinfeld, if Seinfeld had lived in pre-World War II England with a super-intelligent butler. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"As a little girl, I can remember my dad watching late-night reruns of the Bertie and Jeeves television series, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, and wondering what on earth he found so funny about a show focusing on two men with (what seemed to me then) strange accents and weird clothes. Thankfully, I revised my opinion of the show - and the books on which they are based - dramatically in later years when I was again exposed to them and realized how funny they are. Granted, the stories are not great literature and are generally repetitions on the same theme, but Wodehouse adds just enough variation to each to make them seem new every time you hear them. I've read this book previously and watched the television shows based upon it and I was still able to enjoy it anew as I listened to it this year.The collection of ten Bertie and Wooster stories is typical Wodehouse and a perfect introduction for anyone who has never been exposed to them. From his first meeting with Jeeves and throughout the remaining nine stories, Bertie comes to rely on his \\"gentlemen's personal gentlemen\\" to get him and his wealthy friends out of a comical assortment of straits...usually involving the female of the species, whether it be a hopeful fiancee or a maiden aunt. Bertie, no mental strongman in any sense of the word, is hapless when it comes to dealing with these dilemmas but, thankfully, he has the extraordinary Jeeves to save the day. Though his success sometimes seems unsure and his plans often lead to unexpected - and somewhat disastrous - results, Jeeves is always able to pull his master out of \\"the soup\\" by the end of the story, though it sometimes requires Bertie to give up some favorite (but hideous) piece of clothing of which his manservant most certainly does not approve!Hilarious caricatures, masterful use of language and perfect timing - all signs of classic Wodehouse - are all evident in this delightful collection. Certainly a recommendation for any long-time lover of Wodehouse or anyone wanting to become addicted to him for the first time!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"What ho? Another set of adventures with Bertie and Jeeves, how could one resist the fun? It is positively charming!"},{"Title":"Carry On, Jeeves!","review":"I like all Jeeves books, but this is my favorite.

The story is very originally developed; although it is told in first person, it is told by two people!! One of the chapters the one in writing is Julia, a six-year-old girl whose mother works all night long as a nurse and has no father, and the following is the night daddy (in Sweden baby sitters are called &quot;night mammies&quot;), and so on. I have read a lot of Maria Gripe's work, and I found outstanding in this book the observation of children's nature: contradictory, curious, naughty and tender. From the literary point of view, it has a lot of images describing moments and feelings at night. To my mind, this book is a &quot;must&quot; for people related to young children: parents, teachers, librarians, psychologists, etc. P.S. I am very interested in Maria Gripe as a writer.

Besides the book that I purchased that was for California specifically this book was another invaluable item for our vacation of a lifetime. Not only was it a wealth of information on tips for making the car ride more enjoyable, but also helped us to be uber prepared for anything that might come up, including food issues and expenses, entertaining the kids, where the populated areas are for gas stations, motels and campgrounds, and must-see attractions. And we were assured that we would not miss something by driving right by it and not knowing it was there or worth seeing. This book is loaded with the \\"must-see\\" things we didn't want to miss. And their ratings for things were right on. We were armed and dangerous with our information of what everything was going to cost, how we were going to plan our route to see the things we wanted to see, how much time things would take, and what places are crowded with tourists so when the best time is to visit - how to plan our day, where to stay, where to eat, etc.The best thing about this and the other Family Fun California vacation guide that I purchased is that my husband and kids now have memories that they will treasure for a lifetime, thanks to the tips and ratings and ideas in these books. We did it all, saw it all, and didn't waste a moment's time on so-so attractions that cost a lot an didn't offer that much entertainment value.If you are planning a trip to the SOUTHWEST, you have to get this book.

I confess that I truly loved Atlantic City when I went there for the first time, and it was interesting seeing all the people gamble at the tables and the slots.

They are in disbelief as they suddenly start flying up from a bench they're sitting on and find themselves on an island that clearly has been deserted for years. Strangely enough, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy feel like they have been on the island before, a long, long time ago. They had been there hundreds and thousands of years before as the great kings and queens of Narnia. They meet a dwarf named Trumpkin who tells them of the fall of what is now old Narnia. All the dwarfs and talking beasts that used to roam Narnia freely were forced to go into hiding. Trumpkin tells them of an up and coming king, Caspian, of old Narnia who could save them from completely being wiped out.Prince Caspian is an intriguing book that you wouldn't want to put down, although the 223 page book is pretty hard for a person to finish in one sitting. Prince Caspian has fabulous vivid descriptions along with a satisfying ending. The ending had me feeling like there was some closure, and yet I wanted to read more so that I wanted to read the next book in the Narnia series. I was on the edge of my seat at some points, feeling what the characters felt, thinking what the characters were thinking. C.S. Lewis sucked me into Prince Caspian, a thrilling exciting story you don't want to miss. Although there's a recap of the previous stories, everything makes so much more sense if you've read the other books in the Narnia series.

This book I can not honestly was the best that I have read out of the series mainly because it does not offer as much backround details as the others, but also because it is a pretty slow moving story which causes you to get bored. Even so though I would have to say that it was still a very good book. One main thing that I would recommend is to read this whole series in their ORIGINAL order because I believe that C.S.

Now, the Pevensies children are brought back to Narnia by the magic horn to help Prince Caspian defeat the Telmarines led by Miraz King of Telmar, and restore order in Narnia once again. The genre of this book is fantasy.This book was top on my list because I wanted to read the whole series and I wanted to know what happened to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. I would recommend this book because it is a good read. It's interesting and tells you what happened to Narnia when the Pevensies left. Also it tells you a whole other story about a boy named Prince Caspian. I would recommend this book to people over the age of twelve and to people that like to read fantasy stories. It was hard to concentrate on the story at first, it started out introducing new characters then it was easy to concentrate on the book again. I enjoyed the style of writing used because I like to read books written in third person. It has a good flow to it. I also liked how there was a narrator telling the story. My mind did wonder when I was reading. It happened when I was around the middle of the book.By Michael"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is the second book that C. S. Lewis wrote in his children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". If you are reading the books in chronological order, as opposed to order of publication, it is the 4th book. \\"Prince Caspian\\" finds the heroes of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", young Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, returning to boarding school a year after their first adventure in Narnia. As they sit waiting at the railway station, the four siblings are whisked once again to another land, where they find the ruins of an old castle that looks eerily familiar. While only a year has passed in our world, centuries have passed in Narnia. Humans from the land of Telmar invaded Narnia long ago and persecuted the talking animals, dwarves, and magical creatures. But now young Prince Caspian, who is sympathetic to the creatures of Old Narnia, is in line to become King of Narnia. His uncle, King Miraz will do anything to prevent it.For those reading the books in order of publication, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is the first book to hint at broad human participation in the Narnian universe, although it poses more questions than it provides answers. As to Narnia's past, the plot thickens -encouraging readers to press on for answers in the other Chronicles. The dialogue in \\"Prince Caspian\\" has been improved over the often awkward conversations in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". C. S. Lewis seems determined not to write protracted battle scenes, this time finding a way to avoid the great battle entirely. Not much happens in \\"Prince Caspian\\", but brevity is one appealing aspect of \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". Whatever may be said of them, they don't bog down. Although one may glean a few moral lessons from \\"Prince Caspian\\", it is not so full of them as \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". This is primarily an entertaining adventure story for young children."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This book was great to me,it was awesome. I was so trilled to read it because it took my interest. I was interested in the book the whole time. I never got tired of reading it. I never stared into space reading this book like all the others that I read."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian (Narnia)By: C.S. LewisReviewed By: E. MekonnenPeriod: 1It is about a young prince that hears of a great danger from a dwarf. He goes on a great adventure and becomes a great warrior. Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter come back through the wardrobe but see themselves in an unfamiliar Narnia. As they search on, they find the old gifts that Aslan had given to them. They come up with a conclusion that they have come back and the year that they were gone from Narnia was 100's of years.This book pleased me while I was reading it because it had elements of a great book. One of them is action. I as a reader can't get enough of books with action. They always give me Goosebumps when a king is threatened to be killed or when a person is almost shot. Another good element in this book is that it has a lot of fantasy. The creatures in this story are sometimes weird like the talking beavers, dwarfs, and half-horse half man.This book is great and has so many exciting parts in it. It has action, adventure, and fantasy.They fight giants or dragons. It makes me feel like I am actually in that story and I am fighting one of the beasts. It gets you so into the book that you find yourself in the morning with a book in your lap with drool down your mouth. In the story there is a scene where it shows that there are many different types of creatures in this book. \\"Peter now saw it was really alive and was in fact a Dwarf, bound hand and foot but struggling as hard as it could.\\" This shows to great elements I like about in this story. One of them is that it has a lot of suspense, and the other one is that it has fantasy. Dwarfs are very funny creatures and I like the way dwarfs play a role in this story. There is one scene in this story that caught my attention because it has suspense and a lot of action. \\"For a second the clash could be heard but it was immediately drowned because both armies began shouting like crowds at a football match.\\"My favorite part of the book was the part where Peter fought the king. It was really fun reading that part because it had a lot of action. It is really fun when Peter's skills are put to the test when he fights for his life and pride. He goes down and gets ready to fight a man that is much larger and stronger than him and fights until they both have to stop for a break. Books with action and adventure are usually the books that I enjoy reading. They are fun and have a lot of suspense and excitement. I think that Peter has a lot of courage to go and fight this king. His character flows with this story and its genre."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"C. S. Lewis, Prince Caspian (Harper Collins, 1951)In the old days, Prince Caspian was the second book in the Narnia series; these days, it's the fourth. While I can't remember how many times I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a kid, I know I only got through Prince Caspian once, and I was interested to see if there was anything in particular about it that had stopped me going back. (Upon reflection, it was probably my attempt to read The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, which I never did finish during my youthful days.)In this installment, Peter and his siblings are yanked off a train platform and back into Narnia, but it is a Narnia that none of them know; in the year they've been away, a huge amount of time has passed there (it's never spelled out, but the estimates range from one hundred to one thousand years, and based on some of the markers we're given, the latter seems closer to the reality of the situation). Narnia has fallen on hard times. The Telmarines, a race of men from over the sea, have taken over Narnia and driven the supernatural creatures into hiding or extinction, and of the royal family, only the king's nephew, Caspian, has any interest in restoring order to things. With the help of a subversive tutor, Caspian flees the castle and finds himself in command of what ragged army the supernatural creatures can field, but without the heroes of old or Aslan himself, what hope do they have? So Caspian, who's been given a horn supposedly carried by Susan herself, blows it...What really interested me about the book this time around (and it's something I'm not even sure Lewis took into account when writing it), when looking at the whole series as a massive Christian allegory, is the way it treats relics. Relics, as we're all very well aware (at least, those of us brought up in the faith), were a big business in the middle ages. (Heck, you could still buy splinters of the One True Cross in the backs of tabloids in the early eighties; for all I know, you still can.) Needless to say, every last one of them was about as real, and as efficacious, as any foul-smelling brew you might boil up in your kitchen, package as snake oil, and sell to your neighbors. Lewis, on the other hand, whether as a concept or as a plot device, seems to have bought into the idea wholeheartedly. And it does make perfect sense as a plot device, though as with other portions of the story that seem to run counter to all the stuff I was taught in Sunday school (and I'm sure would be taught even more stringently now--J. K. Rowling certainly can't get away with putting magic in her books, at least in come churches), I wonder what was going through Lewis' mind when he decided to include this stuff. Pity he's no longer around to ask.That bit aside, though, Caspian is just as cracking good an adventure story as is The Lion etc., though our four friends are almost relegated to minor-character status here (and I'm not entirely sure that's unintentional, either) and we spend much more time with Caspian and his contemporaries. Fans of the characters from the first (excuse me, second these days) novel may be a bit put off by this, but if you stick with it, I'm sure this one will seduce you as well. ***"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The Pevensie children are summoned back to Narnia thousands of years after the end of their reign to provide aid to Prince Caspian, who has allied himself with the talking animals of Old Narnia to unseat the cruel uncle that has usurped his throne.C.S. Lewis delivers more lessons derived from the Bible in this volume of his Christian parable, most notably the necessity of faith in keeping believers from wandering off the true path. In light of the foreign misadventures of our recent administration, I was most touched by the aspects of the story that touched on ethical conduct in times of war. Peter challenges the evil King Miraz to personal combat to avoid mass casualties (if only our own leaders could resolve conflicts in this way). At one point, some of Caspian's followers try to summon the spirit of the White Witch to aid them, but the Pevensies put a stop to that. They--and Lewis--understood that going to the \\"dark side\\" out of expediency is a sure path to losing one's own soul. Lessons aside, Lewis delivers as a storyteller, as well. This is an imaginative, fast-paced fantasy and a worthy addition to the series."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Just to be clear, the Narnia Series is one of the best children's book series ever written. However, I found Prince Caspian to be much less compelling of a story than Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book was good and I give it 3.5 stars, but it is not great. The Christian allegory is still there, but it is much less obvious. Nevertheless, this is still a good book and children will really enjoy it."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"To say this is the worst of the series is rather to say how great the series is. This book is highly recommended, but the other six even more so. Prince Caspian is simply less engrossing as story. It is a book about bringing justice to the disenfranchised. It is perhaps the most character-driven of theNarniabooks, which is probably why it would be difficult to make into a movie. And the primary character is of course Aslan.The book focuses on Aslan throughout, whether or not he is there. Indeed, the overarching theme is trusting in Aslan, whether or not you see him. Pervading all the scene is Aslan- discussions about him, discussions about how he doesn't exist, and a presence that can't be seen but some know is there. Character develops in response to the dilemma of the unseen Aslan.Aslan isn't the only character though. We are entertained by beautiful descriptions, like a bear who must put his foot into his mouth (suck his paws), or a giant who is always putting his foot into his mouth (metaphorically). Indeed, battle plans are drawn up precisely because of the characters of the different participants. And we are introduced to perhaps the finest character of the Narnia series- Reepicheep, the valiant Mouse.But while character-driven, Lewis seems to have taken a step back from writing good character in this novel. There are good insights into the nature of belief, but the characters don't quite ring true. And while it makes sense that Aslan would save the day, as after all, the novel is about him, we don't get enough of a connection between the presence of the Pevensies and the salvation of Narnia at the end of that day.Thus there are two excellent reasons to read this book.Dawn Treaderdoesn't make sense without it. And for the lessons on faith that are gently told through story, as only a story can."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"There were no torn pages and the cover was secure.

Great pictures"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Like most readers I presume, I read this book fourth in the order of the Narnia series. That is the only way that this book will really make sense to anyone; reading this without reading at least The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (Book #2)first would cause you to miss a lot of context and, frankly, appeal. With that background, I found this to be a good book, and at least as entertaining for me (reading this to my kids) as the aforementioned more famous title. If the latter is a re-told account of the Gospel message, then Prince Caspian might be a parable of the modern Church Age. To the \\"modern\\" characters in Prince Caspian, the four kings and Aslan and old Narnia are all things of myth and fairy tales (just like worldwide floods and resurrections, right?). Yet, the moderns get a chance to encounter the old world and experience a little real reality. All in all, it's a fun book to read and a chance to experience characters that become old friends for Narnia readers."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Narnia...where animals talk, where trees walk, where a battle is about to begin.Boomshakalaka... the four children were pulled off the train station platform by magic and ended up in a wooded place.

Now most of the talking Beasts and enchanted creatures who once lived there in peace have been killed or frightened into hiding. Only Caspian and the rulers of Old Narnia, with the help of the great Aslan, can liberate Narnia and make it safe for its rightful inhabitants.Pirates of Earth's South Pacific passed through a link between Earth and the world of Narnia, ending up in Telmar, a land to the southwest of Narnia. They invaded and conquered Narnia, and their first king in Narnia was Caspian I, whose line continued unbroken through Caspian IX, father of Prince Caspian. The Telmarines are afraid of the Old Narnians, the Talking Animals, spirits, and other beings who have populated Narnia at least since the Golden Age of 1000 to 1028 when Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund ruled as Queens and Kings of Narnia,Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in 1898. He was Fellow and tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College, Oxford, and later was Professor of Medieval and Renaissance literature at Cambridge University, where he remained till his death in 1963.

I give it four stars for all the things that make it such a great book."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This, the second book written in the Chronicles of Narnia, is C. S. Lewis attempt to allegorize the reformation of Christianity, and he pulls it of splendidly. Narnia has been over run by the Telmarines, who do not believe in magic, talking animals, dryads, Aslan, etc. Prince Caspian, the son of King Miraz, has heard tales of the old Narnia growing up, and believes that those things really exist. The rest of the tale describes how the old Narnia is reawakened and defeats the reigning conquerers. This is a picture of how distorted beliefs enter the Church, and someone will come along (like Caspian), realize the problem, and set to reforming Christianity.Now, the actual book is not nearly so boring as the way I described it. All of what I described is entwined in a magical tale of magic, glory, and believable yet extraordinary people and animals. To the best of my knowledge, only C. S. Lewis is able to talk of such a subject and make it so interesting and fascinating, hiding the real subject deep in a labarynth of powerful allegory. It is very possible that you should miss the whole allegorical meaning if you are not looking for it, so great a job he has done of hiding it, yet it is there, waiting to be uncovered if we look deep enough below the magical surface."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the fourth book in the series of the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.

They were called back to Narnia help to help Prince Caspian. Caspian's uncle, King Miraz, had killed Caspian's fater and took the throne of Narnia. Caspian found his life in danger and ran to Old Narnia, where dwarfs, fauns, and Talking Beasts are. Because of the need, Caspian used Susan's horn to call Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy back to Narnia. They were able to expel the Telmarines with the help of Aslan the Lion. I liked this book a lot, but I thought that the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was more interesting and a better read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read shorter novels, and like books that are exciting, but dull at times."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"After a work of such renown as the Lion, the Witch and theWardrobe, perhaps it is just too much for the next in the series tocompare. Of all the Chronicles, I found this to be the least engaging. I found it a small let-down to find myself in Narnia again so far in time from the Pevensies' reigns as Kings and Queens. The plot did not move me along as well as any of the other books in the Chronicles.This is the last book in the Chronicles in which all four of the children are back, and in that way, it provides for a nostalgic return to the Narnia of The Lion... The most interesting aspect was of how the conquering people had come to fear the trees and magic of the land, illustrating how conquerers and empires often despise and oppress what makes a people individual.Bottom Line: This one isn't bad enough to skip over, but it's a bit of a let down after the stellar first volume."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the second book in the chronicles.

If you read the reviews about The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe you will see that I wrote about the contrast between that first story and the Bible. This book was not quite as simple the only thing I found was the charactoristics of the Lion and their simalaritis to that of Christ, other then that this story is an imaginitive read for readers young and old.

When Caspian blew the horn, time on earth stopped for the kings (Peter and Edmund) and queens (Susan and Lucy) of Narnia. They opened their eyes to a very strange place, but knew somehow that it had something to do with Narnia, and therefore were not scared.The common theme in this book seems to be that the majority of the folk and creatures only believe what they see, and many common myths (like ghosts) that were created, passed down, and re-created. Although the children believed in the magical world of Narnia, and Aslan as well, the older children had doubts. What Lucy saw, they did not, so they kept pushing forward, instead of following the lead that Aslan gave to Lucy early on in their adventure to help Prince Caspian. However, after the adventure through the wardrobe, Edmund was more inclined to believe Lucy. And so most of the other creatures of Narnia also had their doubts. For instance, I believe Tumpkin (a hedgehog) said he believed either Aslan or the White Witch (whoever would help them defeat Miraz, and help Prince Caspian in battle.Read the book to enjoy the rest of this adventure.

Explicitly written as the \\"second\\" book in the series, \\"Prince Caspian\\" shows a much different Narnia from the one we first saw in \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\". Hundreds of years have passed, and it is actually in the era of Caspian that the most books of Narnia occur.Essentially the story is that a young prince, a human descended from pirates who found their way into Narnia via cave in the South Pacific, is heir to the throne of Narnia. The humans have taken over Narnia and have treated all the talking animals and creatures as mythological. In this milieu, Prince Caspian loves the stories and early histories of \\"Old Narnia\\", who is taught to him by Dr. Cornelius. Eventually, he discovers that Old Narnia is indeed true history, and not only that, Dr. Cornelius is not what he first appears to be.\\"Prince Caspian\\", in the actual method of story telling, is the most different of the Chronicles as a good portion of the first half of the book does not actually happen in the real time of the tale, but is instead recounted to the children by Trumpkin the dwarf. From it we learn the unusual occurrences that have taken place since they have been gone, and we also come to the first book of what I of as the Caspian Trilogy. Caspian's time frame gets the most treatment of Lewis, where the beginning of the world gets one book, the Golden Age two books, Caspian's lifetime three books, and then the ending of both the series and Narnia as one book.There are many ties in with Caspian and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Both are the rightful kings, both have uncles who are trying to kill them, and both must attempt to regain the throne. Caspian is successful, but he must place the belief in a supernatural world. Like Hamlet who must accept advice from the ghost of his father, so must Caspian place his belief in the older world to take his rightful place as King Caspian the XI.We also get directions from Aslan that, even if the crowd does not do what is right, we have the responsibility to do what we know is right. Instead of following Aslan when she knows she should, Lucy disobeys him and goes with the her siblings and the dwarf (a.k.a. D. L. F. -- Dear Little Friend). This scene in Prince Caspian illustrates the fact that you should not go with the crowd when God has told you what to do. Your responsibility is to Aslan, not the crowd. Instead of following Aslan she disobeys him and goes with the crowd. It is a positive message Lewis sends to his young readers about resisting peer pressure, because in the end you do not answer to this crowd but you answer to God..We also get the theme of the dwarfs as being for the dwarfs. Nikabrick, who cares for no one but the ones with power who will aid the dwarves, does not bear any love for Aslan. He would just as soon be with the White Witch, and indeed he brings evil beings into Caspian's councils, after which he is killed. His story is a sad story, and from this we get the theme that, even though it seems there are no friends for us, in the end God will take care us if we allow him, but if we do not God will not force himself upon us.Prince Caspian stands as one of the most interesting of the Chronicles for the relationship it shows between God and hnau, especially that remark about God getting bigger as we grow older. We also get several of the pagan elements in this text too, and how, although the Greeks and Romans used it in the wrong sense, God does indeed approve of revelry and that wild passion so intensely felt, for how could it be otherwise? If God did not approve of that passion, he would not have sent Jesus to die for us, because it is borne of that passion that Jesus came to die.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\".)..------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complictions if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomoly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian, or, Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (1951) is a children's fantasy novel, the second in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Here, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are drawn back to Narnia, where hundreds of years have passed, and must work to overthrow a usurper and put the rightful king on the throne.The story itself is rather straightforward: the Pevensies are in Narnia to do a job and get out. It's all business, and the spirit of adventure the reader finds in the best books of the series is mostly absent here; it doesn't help that the story follows the same basic structure as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, only without most of that book's epic feel and emotional power. And yet the world of magical characters and Lewis's own wit and sprinkling of profound Christian principles carry the story and make it an enjoyable read in spite of its flaws.A prominent theme in Prince Caspian is the virtue of faith and belief; some of the children experience degrees of doubt in Aslan, and many of the Narnians have lost faith in him altogether. Other themes include chivalry and, as is always the case with Aslan, grace.Prince Caspian suffers from some storytelling issues. The novel starts with the Pevensie children, follows them briefly, and then jumps to Prince Caspian's backstory, which takes up nearly half the novel. When the story returns to the Pevensies, they spend most of their time doing little more trudging through the woods. Prince Caspian almost certainly would have worked better if Lewis had written the whole thing from the point of view of Caspian himself (along the lines of what he did with Tirian in The Last Battle), although this would only further highlight the fact that the Pevensies have very little to do throughout most of the novel (and half of what they do is squabble).On the whole, Prince Caspian is probably the weakest book in the Chronicles of Narnia, but even so, it's still worthwhile."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian, or, Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (1951) is a children's fantasy novel, the second in C.

C.S. Lewis is an amazing writer and story teller, and this book proves to be no exception. I really like that Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are back in this book as the main characters. I enjoyed reading about the Pevensie children rediscover Narnia. About 1,000 years have passed since they ruled Narnia, so Narnia looks a but different. I loved how Aslan revealed himself to the children one by one showing that the others should just believe. Narnia is such a magical world that I think anyone can enjoy reading about. I know I will reread these books in the future, and when I have kids I will read this lovely series to them as well."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"this book is a classic for all children hungry for an adventure. I know that there was a movie i thought that the book was a ***** star and the movie a **** star."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In this the fourth book in the Chronicles of Narnia, the four children from The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe return to the magical land of Narnia to find things greatly changed from the way they left them. A young king is on the run from his uncle who seeks to usurp the throne and the four children, who are kings and queens of Narnia themselves must battle a new foe and restore Old Narnia. The Christian allegory is quite strong in this book as it is with others. I found it a joy myself to return to Narnia after some time away. The new characters are quite fun. This story is better than the book previous (A Horse and His Boy) with good action and progresses the history of Narnia. I enjoyed this one enough to jump straight into the next one, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. I was reading the Kindle version and was very pleased to see that the illustrations were included and of good quality. Recommended."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"As usual, what can I say about the endless stream of masterpieces from the mind and soul of this great writer? This book begins in the far future of Narnian time and the near future of earth time as the magic horn is blown and the children are drawn to the bright Narnian multiverse from a grey English train station.What is notable about this second book in the series is the sparse use of story line to convey multiple meanings. The Narnia adventures have withstood the test of time because they relate to multiple levels of thought and spirit life. While in the train from Mannheim, Germany, I was reading this book when a small German child came silently up to me and stood by my shoulder transfixed by the book until his parents had to disembark at the next stop. Was this the Holy Spirit or did he just want to read a good children's story?This book is notable as an absorbing story and a biblical allegory when Lucy discovers the Lion and the group debates with her while travelling what seems to be the safest course only to find the way blocked and impractical. The Wilderness of Sin causes each character to define his varying degrees of belief and the role that thought verses belief plays in each life. The extreme life example is the dwarf who believes that even if the Lion existed he was simply a danger; to Sue who believes in the Lion but uses her \\"common sense\\" to allow the path of sin to detour the group and overcome faith. Study carefully the chapter titled WHAT LUCY SAW.The animals of Old Narnia are hard pressed tactically; they must decide whether to follow the path of faith in Aslan's return or adopt the path of realpolitik...amoral power politics as dominated mankind during WW2. A tentative alliance is formed with a werewolf and a witch and possibly the old queen. Narnia is in grave danger which Peter and the returning children thwart in the last minute. This is the Wilderness of Sin which modern nation states often find themselves in...read the chapter SORCERY AND SUDDEN VENGEANCE.Read this book slowly with the view that it is more than a children's tale. I contemplated this timeless tale while passing a grey German train station..."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This is yet another top notch audio production. All the Narnia books have been converted to audio with great music and voice actors, and this one is no different - Highly recommended.The story itself makes one laugh at the movie that came out and how different is was, but one can also understand that a lot of what happens in Prince Caspian could be removed as being labeled \\"filler\\". Nevertheless this is an enjoyable story and is the only story that contains all the four children as a main focus from the original \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\". This is the second time they enter Narnia and they have been called back by Prince Caspian using Queen Susan's horn which she was carrying and lost at the end of \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.\\"Prince Caspian's lives in a world where humans have taken over Narnia and the talking animals and beasts are now just legend, and legend that is not encouraged throughout this new realm. Prince Caspian is the rightful Heir, but his uncle is wielding the throne after Caspian's father's death. And once he has a son, Caspian is doomed and must flee, and he flees to find the old Narnians and take back Narnia for the old Narnians. This story tells of that and how the old Narnians battle to win back Narnia.It's a good story, not one of my favorites in the Narnia series, but still good nevertheless."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"When the Pevensie children find themselves in Narnia for the second time, everything they once knew has changed. 1,300 years will do that. A dwarf named Trumpkin has been sent to find them and fills them in on everything they have missed. It seems that the Telmarines have taken over and their leader, King Miraz, has made every effort to snuff out the memory of Old Narnia.The king's nephew Caspian, however, finds the old stories fascinating. Threatened by the birth of his uncle's son, Caspian flees into the woods. The remnants of the Old Narnians realize that the time has come to take back Aslan's country from the usurpers. Caspian blows the magic horn, calling the former kings and queens to his aid.C.S. Lewis spins a great story, but the plot is a bit complex for modern children. While Peter and Edmund are busy helping Prince Caspian fight his battles, Aslan and the girls are out romping about the countryside, regenerating joy. River gods, anthropomorphic trees and drunken Greek deities all join in the fun. It's strange behavior for a Lion, but somehow it makes sense in this context.The explanation, which comes at the end, is C.S. Lewis at his best. It seems that Lewis had been reading up on the voyage of the Bounty. In much the same manner as Fletcher Christian and John Adams, the Telmarines ended up on an island and married the local women. When they found a cave, they had a surprise in store for them. Luckily, Aslan gives them the choice to remain in Narnia as equals with the talking animals or to return to their island. He doesn't give the Pevensie children that choice, however: they are sent back to school in England.This is not my favorite Narnia story, but it does have its moments. Four stars."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"My journey through Narnia continued with this second novel in the series. I thoroughly enjoyed Prince Caspian and found it to be an even better book than The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Part of that may stem from the fact that this story had less to do with discovering Narnia and more about the magic and events taking place there. Another wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next when I come to it."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I saw the movie first, and I believe that was a mistake. Because once I sat down to read this book, I was expecting the movie to follow the book. I was, of course, wrong.To read this book, I believe you got to have somewhat of an open mind and be imaginative. The Kings and Queens come back, and they come back many years later. The last time they left Narnia, they were much older...like young adults, and they come back in this book as children again. Narnia has changed and has changed for the worse. But the children, Prince Caspian, and the other Narnians fight to set things right.Aslan is not throughout the book, but shows up just in time. But I must admit that I was sad to read that Peter and Susan could not come back because they were too old, and the same time, I completely understood why.Overall, this was an excellent read, and C.S. Lewis writing is such a treasure. But this one was the book I liked the least out of all the books in the series. I guess the movie did ruin it for me.Thanks."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The Prince Caspian has always been my favourite book of the Narnia series. This is where Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy (The Pevensies) together again, entering the world of Narnia. The story takes place after a year of their first Narnia encounter. They were called back to Narnia due to the disasters in the land. Where the name of Aslan has forgotten, and the Narnia crown is in the wrong hand. The Pevensies helps Prince Caspian and the forest creatures to fight against the army of Telmarine, and... I don't want to spoil anymore of the story. Overall the ending is excellent and every chapter of the book is breathtaking.I read this book during my last week of finals in University, and it did goods to be or else I could've die from studying and working. If you've read the previous books of Narnia, don't stop until you get to the Prince Caspian, of course, dont' even stop there!! Never stop reading the Chronicle of Narnia, it is a classic wonder in every reader's heart."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Returning to Narnia for their second time, the children Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are surprised to find that things have drastically changed in their absence. A wild overgrown forest and castle ruins greet them where they formerly reigned, and men have conquered Narnia, overthrowing the animals. As Lewis continues their adventure he introduces a few new characters that will be key figures in the following books. Among these is the most lovable and humorous character in the Chronicles of Narnia series...Reepicheep the mouse! Brave with his rapier, the mighty mouse brings a smile to your face everytime he enters the scene. The young Prince Caspian is also introduced and to be seen more later in the series, although his role is rather limited in the bulk of this book. Lewis continues with the underlying Christian themes, in this book the main one being the following of Aslan by faith (just as we are called to follow Christ by faith). While not the best of the Narnia books, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is important for its plot building and has some good fun and action."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Well when I first got hold of this book, I really didn't think it would be any good. I thought the best book that C. W. Lewis wrote was \\"The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe\\". Once I started reading it, I really got interested with the book. After reading this book, I loved the way that C. W. Lewis was able to blend in real-time adventure with mystery that was shrouded in mist. The best feature that Mr. Lewis puts in all the Narnia books is the return of those four kids named Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. This time they are joined by new characters and also joined by the great lion Aslan.I rated this book a five because I thought it was simply a splendid book for all ages. Though there are very few pictures, the way that the story is written makes you feel like your right there next to all the characters"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In this fourth book in the Narnia series, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are pulled back into Narnia by a Prince in dire straits. Prince Caspian is in need of help because his uncle is trying to kill him and steal his spot as the rightful king of Narnia.The Prince and his warriors are confronted with a question of faith. When he asked for help by blowing the ancient horn of Queen Susan, would that help come? Could the hold on until it came? Should the turn to less noble resourses that might work but would impinge on their integrity? Would Aslan answer the call and come back to Narnia? Was Aslan dead?This book, like the rest, is a page turner. You should buy the whole series."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style accessible to children, or told in a narrative voice that is speaking as to children to be a \\"children's story\\", and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book falls into that category, as do the rest of the books in this series, just as do \\"The Hobbit\\", by J.R.R. Tolkein, \\"Peter Pan\\", by James Barrie, and \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" and \\"Through The Looking Glass\\" by Lewis Carroll, among others.This book is, if anything, even more enjoyable than \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\", \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", and \\"The Horse And His Boy\\", the other books in the series that I've read so far. It is a delightful tale of magic and wonder, highly recommended to anyone who hasn't misplaced their sense of play. Not for the boring and banality-riddled."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This story is again about the Pevensies.

Read this book to find out more."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the second book in the very entertaining series, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia.&quot; It is about 4 children (2 brothers and 2 sisters) who revisit Narnia, another world inhabited by talking animals, after being gone for one year. But one year in our time could be a thousand years in Narnian time, or no time at all. In this case,they were gone for thousands of Narnian years. When they return,they find that the land that they ruled as Kings and Queens in the previous book, has been taken over by humans, called Telmarines, that do not like talking animals. This exciting story tells of the children's efforts to regain power of Narnia. After reading &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe,&quot; &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; keeps you wondering what happened to Narnia and what is going to happen to Narnia.Once you start reading this series,you can't stop! A wonderful experience to read these books! I highly recommend that you do!"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This is my second time through Narnia as I read it out loud to, and have it read aloud to me by, my children. It has been thirty years since my first experience, and I have to point out that back in the 60's, the books were ordered as follows: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; A Horse and His Boy; The Magician's Nephew; The Last Battle. I am unsure why the series has been re-issued in a different order. It is more pleasing to be introduced to Narnia through the eyes of the four children, and then discovery the mystery of its making in book Six (Magician's Nephew), than the other way around. On to the book. Prince Caspian contains the weakest coupling of the real and imaginary worlds that Lewis attempted. The linkage between the Children and Narnia suffers greatly from the time differentials involved . . . however, the characters grow steadily, the plot moves at a pleasing pace, and the world is revealed much as an onion is pealed, layer by layer, by use of a &quot;story within a story.&quot; The harsh realities of politics, life and death are not overlooked, as many PC books today tend to do, yet the battle scenes do not succumb to graphic description as is done in far too many stories today, and certainly on TV. Narnia's magic retains the critical element of wonder and scarcity, though I must say that the talking beasts are trying at times. I guess it is harder to suspend disbelief as an adult than as a child-- my loss perhaps.The lessons in tolerance, teamwork and faith are well told, and the description is beautiful, even if the style is slightly out of date, and the language less accessible than before the great dumbing down of America brought on by the liberal education reforms of the 70's and 80's.This story, indeed this series, uses allegory to good effect. Best when shared with children."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In this fourth book of The Chronicles of Narnia, things are not going well. The King and his wife have both died, and their heir, Prince Caspian, is being raised by his uncle, Miraz. Miraz takes the throne and declares himself King. Caspian escapes and finds his way to Narnia.Miraz never believed in any of the old tales about Narnia, talking animals, dwarves or even Aslan. Caspian does, and is delighted to encounter all of these characters when he arrives in Narnia. The dwarves and animals all pledge their loyalty to Caspian, but Miraz is determined to put an end to him once and for all. He brings an army and the battle for control of the kingdom begins.Outnumbered, things are not going well for Caspian and his forces. Fearing defeat, he blows the magic horn left behind by Susan when she, Peter, Edmund and Lucy reigned the land. Although it was a thousand years ago, the tales of their heroics and kind governance remain part of the fabric of Narnia. The horn is supposed to bring the four to the aid of whomever blows it. Desparate, Caspian does just that.Back in England, the four children are in a train station, ready to journey back to their respective schools after holiday. To them, only a year has passed since their time in Narnia. But when the horn sounds, they are transported back, only to find that little remained that they recognized. They met up with a dwarf from the Caspian army, and he took them to meet Caspian. There, they fight at his side with the help of Aslan who awakens the old magic of the land and Mariz and his army are defeated. Caspian will be King Caspian and rule Narnia as it's rightful ruler.This was another enjoyable journey back to the land of Narnia. This book is recommended for young readers, and for parents who wish to share the adventure with their children, and for lovers of fantasy series."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"It's funny, how you come at these books as an adult and take something completely different away from them than you would as a child. I read these books about 20 years ago when my uncle gave me a complete set for my birthday. As a child, I think I read them simply as a fantasy/adventure story. As an adult, I can see the subtle religious references sprinkled throughout, and while some may see this as a hindrance to the story, at least through the first 2 books (I go by the original published order, not the new chronological order), I can look beyond that to the story underneath.However, in the case of Prince Caspian, there doesn't seem to be much in the way of story. It seems to me that the book can be broken up into two sections: the first being the Dwarf relating Caspian's understanding of his role of Narnia's future leader (the entire importance of this seems to be related to him over the course of one evening while star-gazing) and the second being Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy's trek through the jungle to get to Caspian. The ending seemed too contrived for my liking and far too rushed. It was all build up and no follow through as far as I'm concerned.Looking at the story differently, it is a story about faith; about how faith can be hard to see sometimes, but it's always there and as long as you believe in that faith, it will lead you where you need it to. Overall a good moral to the story, if a little didactic in the telling."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the second book, in order of their release, in the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis.Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia once again, but only to find it a sad and corrupted land. The human king of the Telmarine men, Miraz, has taken over this magical land where men don't belong, and what was once great, is now almost lost. There is one man, or boy rather, who can see the wrongs that have been done to this land by his uncle. This boy, Prince Caspian, longs for the days of Old Narnia, when talking beasts and other creatures roamed the land, and is determined to bring them back. He flees from the castle to find the last of the Old Narnians hiding somewhere in the forest. He eventually gains their trust and plans to lead them in a rebellion against the Telmarines. The forces are ready, but can they do it? Will They succeed?I really enjoyed this book and would recommend this book and all of the Chronicles of Narnia to any others who enjoy action/adventure books with a bit of magic mixed in. Prince Caspian was a wonderful addition to the Chronicles of Narnia, and it was very exciting, well written, and easily read."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I've always loved the Narnia Series. This particular book, the second in the series by the original reckoning, was one of my favorites because it gives the reader a more Narnian perspective of Narnia. This book focuses on the people of Narnia and, in many cases adds more depth to the animal population of Narnia. In gaining a better perspective on Narnians this book captured my imagination for what would next happen to the facinating and far away land."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Continuing through the Chronicles of Narnia, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is the fourth novel chronologically, and the second published. Because of the order in which the books were written, this book takes up where \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" left off, with the four Pevensies being called back to Narnia by magic, one year later in their time, but eons later in Narnian time.In the blink of an eye, the children are transported from a train platform, (not Platform 9 ), into the forests of Narnia, soon discovering the ruins of Cair Paravel, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens. After eating enough apples to keep the doctor away for a very long time, they rescue a Dwarf from certain peril, and begin another fascinating adventure together.The present King Miraz is doing his best to stifle the stories of old Narnia, where animals talk, and Naiads and Dryads and Dwarfs and Fauns were a part of daily life, and becomes highly upset when he discovers that his nephew Caspian has been drinking up the folklore, thanks to his devoted nurse, who of course gets the boot shortly after that. Unbeknownst to Miraz, the new tutor is also a closet Narnia believer, who begins his \\"Introduction to Narnia 101\\" and helps Caspian to escape impending doom.Learning that his usurping Uncle Miraz is up to no good, Caspian flees for his life, where by good fortune he is saved by some of the same Narnian creatures he has been dying to encounter. Having established his right to the throne of Narnia, King Caspian begins his first great adventure by getting acquainted with talking animals, dwarfs and other Narnians. Inspired by the great Centaur Glenstorm, a council of war is quickly organized, to make plans for an overthrow of the present government.Unfortunately, before he can warm up to the job, his runaway horse inadvertently gives the game away, and rather too soon, war breaks out. With the magical mound known as Aslan's How as their command center, in the midst of the mysterious woods, the battle does not go well, due to inexperience.Playing his last hole card, King Caspian blows the magical horn, and sure enough, without a moment to spare, help arrives via the Pevensies, former Kings and Queens of Narnia, \\"located\\" by Trumpkin, the rescued dwarf. Getting there however, was almost another adventure altogether, with boys who don't ask for directions, and don't listen to good advice. With the appearance of Aslan, and their faith duly restored, they reach their destination late but safely.The boys are tasked with straightening things out, and issue a challenge to Miraz, to duel for the right to rule. Circumstances then lead to a great and glorious battle, while the girls team up with Aslan to do some back-up work, right some wrongs, and perform a miracle or two. (This part happens very quickly, as if the author was trying to push in as much magic as possible in the closing pages.)Another exciting episode in the Chronicles of Narnia, but there's more to come.Amanda Richards, September 2, 2004"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In this installment of the Chronicles of Narnia, the children go back to the land a year after their first visit. They are surprised to find that, although only a year has passed on Earth, many hundreds of years have passed in Narnia, and almost everything is different. Most of the magic is gone out of the land--the talking animals, moving trees, dwarves, and other creatures are little more than memories now, and the land is ruled and dominated by a race of men. The men, incidentally, are skeptical in nature, and do all they can to oppress magic and the true history of Narnia.The symbolism in this book is very vivid, and Lewis uses the plot very well to show the situation of much of modern society. The race of men (led by Caspian's uncle) refuse to believe in magic, and also don't believe in Aslan. Aslan is a Christ figure, so this unbelief in him is symbolic of twentieth-century skepticism. Many people today do not believe in miracles or anything that cannot be scientifically \`proven,' and a similar situation exists in Narnia, where men here the old stories of magic but many do not believe them. In an allegorical sense, then, this novel shows us the folly of skepticism, and the absurdity of believing in a world in which nothing wonderful can occur.Like the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia, this book is a delightful children's story. But there is a deep theology at work here, and this is one of the qualities which makes it appealing to adults. I highly recommend this book, along with the rest of the Chronicles, to anyone interested either in fairy tales or in Christian allegory or theology."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"But now there are! King Miraz, brother of Caspian the IX andUncle to Caspian the X has taken control of Narnia. Returning Lion,Witch and Wardrobe characters, the Four Pevensies (Peter, Susan, Edmund, Lucy) are returned to Narnia once more when Prince Caspian (X) is in trouble. Cair Paravel is in ruins and wild woodlands have grown all over Narnia. Talking animals and magical creatures are in hiding and an evil king rules the land. This book continues the adventure begun in the first book, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe. Set in a darker era of Narnian time, this book chronicles the events of the returning kings and queens of Narnia (the pevensies) and Prince Caspian's struggle against his unclie Miraz. I must-read for someone who has already read Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The allegory presented by Lewis of God (represented by Aslan the Lion) and Satan (represented by &quot;The White Witch&quot;) is somewhat manipulative. Many of the justifications that it uses in asserting Christianity are the very things that atheists and agnostic disagree with. For example, in one section, Lucy is the only one of the four children who can see Aslan. As a result, the other children have to follow her on Blind Faith. Well, blind faith here is necessary because we accept the faith after knowing the truth. In Christianity, we are expected to have blind faith without knowing the truth. Read this book to your child pr enjoy it as an allegory as an adult, but be sure to talk about it with your children also."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is either the second or fourth book of CS Lewis' classic Narnia series, depending on whether one reads the books in published order or chronological order. The story picks up where \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" leaves off, with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy back in England after having spent many years in Narnia as kings and queens. What follows is in many ways almost a straight rehash of \\"Wardrobe\\" and is possibly the most forgettable of the Narnia books. Were it not for the introduction of Caspian, one of the major characters in the series, it would almost certainly be the least memorable of the seven books.The children find themselves pulled into a strange world, this time by a magical force rather than by wandering through a wardrobe. Quickly (and predictably) enough the world is revealed to be Narnia. Why did they not know this right away? Because the single year they spent in the real world was many hundreds of years in Narnian time. Narnia has aged while they have not.The four children, who in Narnia are revered as legendary kings and queens of old, find that they have been pulled into Narnia to aid King Caspian, a prince from a kingdom of rather oppressive humans who have taken over Narnia and are attempting to squash all memory and knowledge of the land's talking animals and mythical creatures. Naturally, this means those people have to be stopped.If it sounds exciting, it's not. If it sounds boring, it is.Travelogues and adventures that are little more than episodic journeys can be great fun and often tap into the glory of exploring the forest as a child, but this journey simply has little or nothing to engage the reader or capture one's interest. The glimpses of how Narnia has changed in the years since the four kids were there are interesting, but the interest is minimal at best. The travels just lack punch or adventure.Lewis takes a few ill-advised detours that seem only to pad the story while hammering home the idea that people who do not believe in the mystical creatures of Narnia are inherently bad. The heavy-handed messaging in other Narnia volumes generally feel like the moral messages of any other classic fairy tale, but here they somehow feel wrong.All in all, \\"Prince Caspian\\" adds very little to the lore (and lure) of Narnia despite being a part of the central plot, with core Narnia characters throughout. Its greatest contribution to the series is introducing the off-kilter time concept, an old clich&eacute; of alternate world stories, and bringing the character of Caspian (as well as the delightful and brave mouse Reepicheep) to the series. And that's about this book's whole worth. It introduces you to characters you will grow to like later and to concepts essential to the series.Take note, because \\"Prince Caspian\\" is part of the core Narnia books (those involving the four original children and the characters linked directly to them) it's hard to recommend skipping this one - but it really fails to live up to the fantastic spectacle of the others. Children may enjoy the return romp to Narnia, but more likely even they will find that this one disappoints."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I've collected all the 1st edition reproductions of the Chronicles of Narnia series, however I have to say that the U.S. edition printing was on slightly better paper. The U.K. editions are printed on &#34;eco-friendly&#34; recycled (i think) paper, but the paper isn't as fine or smooth and seems a bit cheaper than the american edition.

Dust cover okay. Don't bother buying the hardback series from this publisher. I can't see it standing up to much more wear than a paperback, which these books will get no doubt."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian, or, Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia (1951) is a children's fantasy novel, the second in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. Here, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are drawn back to Narnia, where hundreds of years have passed, and must work to overthrow a usurper and put the rightful king on the throne.The story itself is rather straightforward: the Pevensies are in Narnia to do a job and get out. It's all business, and the spirit of adventure the reader finds in the best books of the series is mostly absent here; it doesn't help that the story follows the same basic structure as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, only without most of that book's epic feel and emotional power. And yet the world of magical characters and Lewis's own wit and sprinkling of profound Christian principles carry the story and make it an enjoyable read in spite of its flaws.A prominent theme in Prince Caspian is the virtue of faith and belief; some of the children experience degrees of doubt in Aslan, and many of the Narnians have lost faith in him altogether. Other themes include chivalry and, as is always the case with Aslan, grace.Prince Caspian suffers from some storytelling issues. The novel starts with the Pevensie children, follows them briefly, and then jumps to Prince Caspian's backstory, which takes up nearly half the novel. When the story returns to the Pevensies, they spend most of their time doing little more trudging through the woods. Prince Caspian almost certainly would have worked better if Lewis had written the whole thing from the point of view of Caspian himself (along the lines of what he did with Tirian in The Last Battle), although this would only further highlight the fact that the Pevensies have very little to do throughout most of the novel (and half of what they do is squabble).On the whole, Prince Caspian is probably the weakest book in the Chronicles of Narnia, but even so, it's still worthwhile."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This book was great i really haven't read the others but this one was a great book and i can't wait to read the other ones! Next is my description of how the book goes through.First there are four kids: Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. They have to go on a train to there new school. when they get to the train station they just appear in the woods all of a sudden. Later on they find their castle last time they were in Narnia (but they don't know it yet). Then a dwarf comes and tells them a story of how Prince Caspian is in trouble and needs assitance right away. Before this had happened Peter and company had found their old weapons and gear givn to them by Aslan a long time ago. Edmund fights the dwarf to prove that the company and himself are really the kings of olden days. Edmund defeats the dwarf in combat and then Susan beats him with a bow. The dwarf finally realizes that it is actually the olden kings and he adventures into the wilderness to get to Prince Caspians aid. They get lost for a long time but finally get there after meeting Aslan and following him. They beat Prince Caspians step-dad in war and save Narnia from the Telmarines. Last but not least Caspian becomes King.The EndP.S. this was not all the adventures they had read and find out more it is a great book you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Like the other six Narnia books, Prince Caspian is a well told tale that is definitely worth reading. The overriding theme investigates how widespread knowledge of an original fact can become legend, then myth, and finally be forgotten all together. There is also another small subtext that I find just as interesting as the larger theme - especially in light of the author's own story. Lewis had a great love of pagan myth. He relates in \\"Surprised by Joy\\" that in pagan Norse myth he had an early taste of the Joy that ultimately led to his conversion. In some respects a regenerate pagan himself, it is not too surprising then to find Lewis often redeeming the pagan more broadly in his fiction. In the case of Prince Caspian, this is accomplished by the introduction of Greco-Roman deities and demigods working on the side of Aslan and the good. It is an approach that would not likely be utilized by the contemporary Christian author, but Lewis does it with his usual deft touch and leaves the reader glimpsing perhaps a bit more clearly just how completely a fallen world is being and will be reclaimed by a risen Lord. A good read, 4 stars, and certainly recommended."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In this magical tale of witch craft magic and fighting, The ancient kings and queens of Narnia Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy find there selves back in Narnia in a strange beach after there await for the train.

It begins about year after THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE ended. Apparently, the war that was threatening England at the beginning of LION has either ended or isn't as threatening because all four of the Pevensie children are preparing to return to school. Their summer has just come to a close and they are waiting on the platform at a train station to go their separate ways to school. Suddenly, they all feel themselves being violently tugged. One moment, they're in England and the next they find themselves back in Narnia. Except Narnia isn't at all how they remembered it. After all, time doesn't pass in Narnia the same way it passes in our world.They discover that probably over a thousand years has passed since they last stepped through the wardrobe back into their homeworld. Narnia has fallen into a world of chaos. The magical creatures that were the citizens of Old Narnia have either all been exterminated are sent into hiding. There is a New Narnia now--one that is ruled by the wicked King Miraz. Miraz took the throne through murder, but since he had no heir of his own, kept his nephew, Prince Caspian, alive. But on a fateful night, a son is born to Miraz and his wife and Caspian must flee into the night.Thus begins his crusade to regain control of Narnia and restablish the legacy that the Golden Reign of King Edmund, Queen Susan, Queen Lucy, and High King Peter had left. A war is joined between the armies of Miraz and Caspian and a long siege in the wood begins. When the Pevensies return to Narnia, it is up to them to make things right and aid Caspian so that he can take his rightful place as King of Narnia.PRINCE CASPIAN basically directly follows the events of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE and is very much its sequel. The book is full of exciting events, but the tale unravels in a way that one would not suspect. Tolkien and Lewis were very close friends for many years and different as their writings are, there are parts of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and the LORD OF THE RINGS that will forever be compared. In this sense, PRINCE CASPIAN is very much like THE TWO TOWERS: it's a bit darker than LION, deals with some deeper themes, and even has a seen where the trees come alive again to help crush an evil army.LION, though not a complete allegory, was very much allegorical and PRINCE CASPIAN continues some of that same deep symbolism. When I first read the book, I understood some of the deeper meaning (such as when Aslan commands Lucy that she must follow Him even if the others do not), but I was unfamiliar with the history of Christianity to recoginze other elements of the story. Now that I do know about such things as the Reformation, I can see those events being alluded to in the story.Regardless, PRINCE CASPIAN remains a worthy sequel to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. It's a fantasy adventure story that young children will love, especially if they've read LION."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In the begining, the four children are waiting for a train to school.

The best part was the little mysteries that made up the book."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Lewis did it again, creating a wonderful tale for both young and old alike. It is the simplicity of the way he writes, even though we know how complex Lewis can be, that is always appealing to the younger fairy tale readers, but also, surprisingly, the older readers as well.With Prince Caspian we find another good and noble king, a leader that others will follow. It is good to see the tides changed in this the second book of the series as the talking animals are forced into hiding and the Old Narnia is all but gone. As well, in this book, Lewis hints at some tantalizing possibilities for the rest of the series.No matter your age, read this book and series and let yourself be drawn into a fun and simple read that makes you become involved with the characters."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian, the fourth book in the beloved Chronicles of Narnia series, begins a year after Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy had returned to our world after ruling as kings and queens in Narnia.

Later on in the book we find out that the children had been called back to Narnia by Susan's majical horn (given to her in the second book of this series, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe). They have been called back to Narnia to assist Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the Narnian throne and the Prince of the Old Narnians, in his fight against his wicked Uncle Miraz, who is trying to destroy his nephew and the idea that the people of old Narnia now exist (Old Narnia was characterized by the existence of things such as dryads, nymphs, fauns, cenataurs, mermaids and mermen, and talking animals).

We return with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The book is a great adventure. Although, the story is not as thrilling as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, it is a good read. Get a copy and prop your feet up. It is a sweet return trip to Narnia."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Reading Prince Caspian makes it feel that it is the natural next book to read after The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. Rightly, it was C.S. Lewis' second book that he wrote in the Narnia series, which was later reorganized as he wrote other books to insert around them. This book brings back the excitement and literary style of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, and is a breath of fresh air after reading The Horse and His Boy.In Prince Caspian, the 4 children return to Narnia 1 year after they left, but in Narnia time, it had been centuries, and they returned to a place they hardly recognized. As the story goes, it tells of the history of Narnia and what had happened in those years. Basically, a race or men called the Telmarines invaded Narnia killing and driving out the inhabitants of old Narnia into hiding. This new Narnia rejected the magic and stories of the old Narnia, and it seemed to be a secularized society. There is a parallel of the new Narnia to the world we live in, where many reject the spiritual aspects of life, and the basis of their life is \\"seeing is believing.\\" Even the children were affected by this when Lucy claimed that she saw Aslan, but Peter and Susan rejected it. There is a theme of faith where believing is seeing, and as they begin to trust Lucy, being led by her \\"faith\\", they soon after saw Aslan.Another theme that showed was the apostasy of the inhabitants of old Narnia, but in it were a remnant of animals who continued to believe, even though many had rejected Aslan and the stories of old. It seemed that this secularism is a spirit that affected many in the land, and it was also interesting that the Telmarines used stories of fear to keep their people out of the woods of old Narnia. So often, it is the fears that keep us from really believing.Prince Caspian was the true heir to the throne, but his uncle Miraz was out to kill him having a son born to him. Such is also a parallel of our lives being the rightful heir to God through Christ Jesus, but having born into iniquity and trained in secular ways, it took a journey, as Caspian did, to redicover being the heir to the throne, and to us, being a child of God.Prince Caspian appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Trader and The Silver Chair as King Caspian."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"(...)Prince Caspian by C.S Lewis is the 4th book in the series called \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\".

I liked even more the fact that these dark creatures were added to the book.It's a great book, for all ages, for all those who love the struggle against evil and tyrany."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I'm beginning to see why high fantasy almost always takes place on an epic scale. The short volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia don't really give you a chance to live in the world and experience it. Prince Caspian is at its most winning when it revels in the past. When the children return to Narnia, they discover a world that has aged for a thousand years without them. It gave the place a feeling of weight and grandeur before the plot caught up with them.Like LWW, PC is a slight narrative heading towards a single, swift, decisive battle that will be easily won by Aslan after taking a moment to meditate on faith and God. The main thrust of the story is about restoring Prince Caspian to the throne of Narnia, usurped by his murderous uncle Claudius--I mean, Miraz. His plight is what summons the four children back to Narnia, and his backstory is the subject of a four-chapter flashback. No, really. This is only a fifteen chapter book. Roughly a quarter of the narrative is a single, unbroken flashback that doesn't involve any of the four children we're supposed to be following. This is not the least of the narrative issues I have with PC, but overall the book did surpass LWW. It was more engaging and the ending was less of a deus ex machina.Also, the heroes are less useless in this book. Susan gets to use her bow (although she still isn't allowed to participate in combat). Peter and Edmund get their diplomacy on, but none of them have much of an arc. And Lucy... she is the main character of a Lewis-gets-preachy unnecessary subplot that really bothered me. Not because I'm anti-allegory (I'm not) and not because I'm anti-religion (I am, but I'm claiming objectivity), but because I hate sacrificing narrative cohesion for the sake of making an unnecessary point. While the group is trying to find Caspian, Aslan appears to Lucy and Lucy alone, bidding her to follow him. She mentions this to the group, but she's outvoted. The following night, she sees Aslan again, who seems to be irked that she didn't convince the others to follow him or, failing that, follow alone. He could have just appeared to all four children and been done with it. But instead, he chose to admonish the faithless for exercising otherwise sound judgement.I realize that for Lewis, this was probably meant to be a deep homily on the nature of faith. For me, it just points out what a jerk Aslan (and by extension God) can be. In case you hadn't picked up on this, I don't enjoy Aslan as a character. He shows up, bosses people around, and everyone thinks he's awesome. But aside from swooping in at the last minute to win battles, he doesn't do much apart from being mysterious and unapproachable. Think about it, he's almost completely unnecessary to the plot. His presence diminishes the actions of the children--who are the heroes of the story. He heals people and he rallies the troops, but he mostly just exists for Lewis to fawn over. This book (and its predecessor) could have been told without his physical presence, losing the painfully plot-halting allegory and making the heroes' deeds more heroic. Would have made for better books, in my opinion.On the whole, I liked PC more than LWW. It felt lived in, more self-assured. I'm looking forward to where this series goes, but I've had it up to here with the darned lion."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Don't get me wrong. I liked this book. I really did. But compared to the others I just found it kind of lackluster and a little unfocused. The book is called Prince Caspian but the emphasis didn't seem to be on him; it was on the children and how they saved the day. I was expecting something a long the lines of the life and times of Prince Caspian, or something like that. The history that we do get of him is passively told for a couple of chapters (which was interesting nonetheless) and everything else was about the re-emergence of Old Narnia.Prince Caspian was definitely more of a secondary character than the focus of the book. It almost seemed that he was just fodder for another adventure for the children which was kind of irritating. I was sad at the end, however, when we're told that Peter and Susan were getting too old to travel back and forth between the real world and Narnia. Very Peter Pan moment right there.Overall I guess I wasn't as impressed with this one as I was with the others. It is a little disheartening to go into something thinking you're getting one thing and get something else. Like I said, it wasn't bad by any means. It's still a fantastic story but I think the power of a title comes into play here. If the title of the book is Prince Caspian, I expect him to be the main focus of the story, not a secondary plot line."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"To begin the book, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie are sitting at the railway station waiting to catch the train to begin the term at school. It's Lucy's first year at boarding school. Then, all of a sudden, they hear a noise like a horn, and suddenly, they're on a strange island. They go around the island for a bit, find food, and decide where to settle down. While reflecting on the island, they find that some things are very like their castle in Narnia that they had lived in only a year before. Upon further investigation, they come to the conclusion that they are at Cair Paravel, where their castle was located in Narnia, and it was in ruins now. After two days on the island, they go to a jungle-like place on the island, and they see two men carrying a dwarf inside a boat, and they conclude that the men are going to kill the dwarf. So, Susan shoots one of the men with her arrow, and both the men run away. The kids help the dwarf out of the boat, and the dwarf says thanks, and then asks who they are. The kids ask him the same, and the dwarf, thinking he owes them something in return for saving his life, tells them his story. The dwarf's story is about a boy named Caspian, and Caspian is the right to the Narnian Throne. He says that Caspian had a tutor that would tell him about \\"Old Narnia\\"(meaning when the Pevensies ruled Narnia) and that he mustn't tell anybody of this because they would kill his tutor, Doctor Cornelius. Caspian's uncle is the King of Narnia. One day, the King has a son, and Cornelius tells Caspian that now that his uncle has a son, he doesn't need to keep Caspian alive, and tells Caspian to run into the woods, as far away from King Miraz(his uncle) as possible. Caspian does as told, and while running from the castle, runs into 2 dwarfs, and a talking badger. Immediately, one of the dwarfs, Nikabrik, doesn't like him. The only reason being that he's a human. The other two are suspicious at first, but he tells them that he is going to bring Old Narnia back to the top, and they like him. The other dwarf's name is Trumpkin, and the badger's name is Trufflehunter. Trufflehunter tells Caspian that he will tell all of his fellow Talking Beasts about Caspian and what he plans to do. They do this, and there is a celebration and a feast when this is all done. The next day, Doctor Cornelius finds Caspian, and tells him that his horse, after he met Trufflehunter and the dwarfs, ran right back to his stable at the castle, and left tracks to where he is. The Doctor also suggests that he heard that there is a mythical place called Aslan's How, where they can find refuge for a few fortnights. So they headed off to Aslan's How, and eventually made it there. When there, Caspian announced that before he left, Doctor Cornelius had given him Queen Susan's Horn. Cornelius said that it was said that whenever the horn was blown, help would come. Although they knew help would come, they didn't know if it would call back the High King Peter, or maybe call Aslan from across the sea. They didn't know, but Caspian sent a talking squirrel to the light post at which the Pevensie Kings and Queens came from when they first arrived at Narnia, and he sent Trumpkin to the sea at which their castle was. So, at that, Trumpkin had finished telling his story to the Pevensies, but he doesn't think that they are worthy of fighting King Miraz, so the kids challenge him to an arrow-shooting contest with Susan, and Susan wins, and a fencing contest with Edward, and Edward wins. The Pevensies and Trumpkin set off to Aslan's How, and nothing to important happens except for when Lucy sees (or thinks she sees) Aslan atop a hill when they were on their way. Nobody believed that she actually saw him except Edmund, so they kept on. Near the end of the journey, the group starts to get shot at by King Miraz's army, and they decide to head back and go Lucy's way. They do that, and on their way there, while everybody was sleeping, Lucy sees Aslan again, and goes to talk to him. Aslan tells Lucy to wake everybody else up and follow him, and he says if nobody believes her, to come alone. She wakes everyone up, and it takes a little bit for all of them to come. Susan even threatens to not come at all, but she does anyway. Aslan leads them there, and eventually the entire group could see Aslan. First, Ed, then Peter, then Su, and after a long time, Trumpkin could see him. Aslan tells the boys and Trumpkin to go to Aslan's How(which turns out to be only the Stone Table) and tells the girls to come with him. The boys go down into the How, and they encounter a fiasco with a werewolf, a hag, and Nikabrik, all of which end up getting killed. Then, Peter decides to challenge Miraz to a duel. They write a document to duel, and a talking mouse, Reepicheep, Edmund, and a giant, Wimbleweather, deliver the document to Miraz. Miraz's Lords actually trick him into accepting by saying it would be too humiliating to accept and get humiliated in front of his entire kingdom and lose. So he accepts. Meanwhile the girls and Aslan slowly awaken all of the tree, water, and earth spirits. While Peter and Miraz were dueling, Miraz falls, and doesn't get back up again. Shortly after this, the spirits that Aslan awakened start to attack the \\"New Narnians\\" and one of the Lords that Miraz had insulted, quite literally stabs Miraz in the back. After this, Old Narnia celebrates their victory, and the Pevensies are sent home.C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite writers. I'm amazed at how he can pack so much emotion, action, drama, and humor into 238 pages. Although I've only read the first 4 Narnia books, Lewis's writing style makes me want to read all of them over again."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I first read this series back in high school. I enjoyed it as much now a I did then. A must read for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Have you ever been afraid? I mean, deathly, horribly, afraid? Not of the dark, or being hurt in sports or rock-climbing, or some other concrete fear, but of something more *ephemeral*? The answer is that, yes, we all have. It may have been fear of giving a speech, or singing in front of an audience, or of being laughed at by a girl that you wish to impress (or a boy that you wish to impress for the ladies). For Christians, it is somewhat deeper of a fear, and this is the real message of C. S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian*.In the book, the four Pevensies, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, are called into Narnia by Susan's magic horn she received from Father Christmas in the first book. A young boy, heir to the throne of his Telmarine ancestors who conquered Narnia several hundred years after the children returned to England, wanted to take the throne from his murderous uncle, Miraz, and reopen Narnia to the talking beasts and other creatures of Aslan that originally dwelt there.He and the Narnians are, of course, outclassed militarily by the humans on Miraz's side, and their more sophisticated (at least to the Narnians), though crude and of less quality, weapons. It is at this point that King Caspian blows Susan's horn, and the four children are pulled into Narnia.The book is a darker and less fanciful tale than *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*. The children do not have nearly such a fine time as they did on their first trip to Narnia, not until the very end at least. Whereas the earlier visit was a time of great personal blessing as well as responsibility, this was a time of hard work, with very little reward. At least this seems to be the case.Although Aslan still does the main work of saving the day, the children and the \\"old Narnians\\", lead by Caspian, are in the very brutal situation of having to kill an opposing army that is not *all* bad and villainous like the White Witch's army was in the original book. This was made clear enough by the fact that a large minority of the adult Telmarines chose to stay under Caspian's rule in Narnia, and even among the majority who left, there were some who were noble.Indeed, one could argue that this similarity to real-world warfare makes the book the \\"darkest\\" of the Narnian Chronicles, save for perhaps the final installment. Of seemingly lesser degree, but greater importance, is the struggle for faith in Aslan with which the children and Trumpkin the Dwarf must contend.At first none but Lucy can see Aslan, but He is there, and scolds Lucy for giving into the others, and then badmouthing them behind their backs. Instead, she must face up to their doubts in her and anger at her. She must follow Aslan, and hopefully they will, as well. All of this puts Peter, Susan, and Trumpkin against her. Edmund is a bit cold towards her, but this is just his nerves, as he really does support her.At the end, there is a short celebration, and then the children are sent home, with Peter and Susan told they will never return to Narnia. This seems like a pretty pathetic reward for their hard work and service. In the grand scheme of things, it is not, for Aslan (as God) knows what is best for them all, and has more great things in store for them. Indeed, though Susan will later deny Aslan and Narnia, she is likely still saved by the faith the four children found in Christ, Aslan's Person and Name in our world.You see, in the cosmology of the books, Aslan gave the children the greatest gift of all by drawing them to Himself, and bringing them to a faith in Him in both worlds. The instrument He used was Lucy, as she showed incredible faith and ability, God-given, to conquer her fears. Her fears of laughter, mocking, or rejection by her siblings. Afterwards, Lucy and Susan spread the message of Aslan to others, and they followed Him, and were in bliss in His glorious Presence. But it was Lucy's faith that made this possible in the first place.Though, as far as we know, Jesus is not a giant Lion in another world, the point about sharing the Gospel with those who so desperately need it, still stands. This can extend to other areas as well. Are we afraid to talk to others, for fear of them hurting us? Do we doubt or question God's work and role in our lives, instead of asking Him what He is trying to accomplish, and how we can serve Him? In these areas, and so many more, we hurt ourselves, others, and most importantly of all, our relationship with God, by letting our fears govern us. In this, we sin.This book, in it's content, and it's messages, is far more serious, and difficult, than the first Narnia book, but it is well-worth it to read for enjoyment, for edification, and for seeing in vivid form, the necessity of leaning on our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Even when others mock Him as not there, and even when we can not feel His Presence, He is there. He is the God Who created you and me. Trust Him and lean on Him today.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"My daughter and I finished reading this book tonight, and with three pages to go, she asked me, \\"Who is Caspian?\\" I think that says it all. She loved The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but Caspian barely held her attention. I really disliked it myself. The action is extremely slow to get going, and indeed, there isn't much action at all until the end of the book.The story is that Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy are whisked back to Narnia, and although only a year has passed in Earth time, an unknown amount of time (hundreds, maybe thousands of years) have passed in Narnia. The first two chapters are extremely boring, as the foursome arrive in Narnia (although they don't know that it is Narnia) and muddle about. Then they meet a dwarf who tells a story about Prince Caspian, and we're \\"treated\\" to a story within a story told to Caspian by his tutor. It was all very confusing, especially for my four-year-old. The next thing you know, we're back in present time, and there still hasn't been much action. Ultimately, there is a one-on-one sword fight between High King Peter and the evil King Miraz, which ends in what is basically a riot. That was decently exciting, but even the duel is relayed in the most boring fashion possible, with the other characters explaining what has happened after it has happened.Prince Caspian is an extremely minor figure in the book. \\"King Caspian\\" is the moniker used more often. His uncle, King Miraz, has usurped his throne. That's two kings. Then there's King Peter, and of course, Aslan, the King of Kings. This was very confusing to my daughter. Further confusing is how Peter duels Miraz so that Caspian can be king. The thing I liked best about the book is how Edmund redeems himself. What I liked least about it was everything else. Now it is up to my daughter to choose what book we read next, and I secretly hope she gives up on the Narnia series. The first book had a sense of wonder, but this was bland, violent, and really (in my opinion) rather pointless."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I largely credit my love of reading with The Chronicles of Narnia. My fourth grade teacher read the entire series to our class and I loved every minute of it. With the contemporary release of theatrical versions of the first two installments, I've enjoyed rereading the books for the first time in twenty years.Prince Caspian is beautifully simplistic. Aimed at children, the ideas of duty, compassion, and heroism are wonderfully relayed in an easily digestible format. When I was a child, I found the stories incredibly stimulating, but now as an adult I realize the life-lessons Lewis taught with each installment of The Chronicles of Narnia. Prince Caspian is the story of doing the right thing even when you must go against everything that seems natural. It is the story of putting your faith in a higher power and purpose and leaving mundane worries behind.Keep in mind, however, that Lewis offered more than just a morality tale. Prince Caspian lays the groundwork for an epic story to come. In Narnia, Lewis created a varied and fantastic world where mythology, religion, and reality seamlessly meld.I so look forward to reading the rest of this series as an adult and critically analyze Lewis' style and purpose. I also, however, look forward to reading the series to my daughter when she's old enough. I can't wait to see the wonderment in her eyes that only a child can experience.~Scott William Foley, [...]"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"It's difficult for me to assign a star-rating to this book.

Some things are delved into, but for the most part situations and characters are only touched on the surface. But, this does make for a fast and intriguing read. And for whatever reason I do feel invested in the story and characters. A few sections seemed a little overlong or confusing but those were very few, and for the most part the story flows quite effortlessly.

Lewis many have grown to love.Mary Anne"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Having written \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" to fulfill his own love of fairy stories which were seemingly no longer written, C.S. Lewis found that a whole world of stories existed in Narnia. With \\"Prince Caspian\\", the second published chronicle of Narnia, Lewis gloriously returns to the world that the Pevensie children encountered in the first book. However, Narnia has changed: while it's been one year for the Pevensies, over a thousand years have passed and Narnia is in a dark hour, waiting for the rightful king to take his place.The story begins with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy waiting on a train platform to return to boarding school: suddenly they are tugged into another world, and it slowly dawns on them that it is Narnia, although their castle is now in ruins. They save a dwarf from certain drowning and learn the tale of evil that has befallen the land: for talking creatures have all but disappeared from this magical land, and the evil King Miraz wants to make sure his nephew, Prince Caspian, doesn't take his place as the rightful heir to the throne. Battle ensues, and when the Pevensie children arrive to help Caspian claim his throne, they usher in an entire army of magical and mythical creatures to help out.\\"Prince Caspian\\", as well as all of the books in the Chronicles of Narnia, is a sheer delight to read. I've read these books numerous times as a child, and reread them to familiarize myself with the stories before the movie versions come out. Rereading these tales as an adult, I can see what a profound influence C.S. Lewis had on a score of writers - the comments that are directed straight at the reader, the names of places and characters - and what an influence his faith had on these tales. The message that is woven throughout these stories is subtly under the surface, never in-your-face preaching, and the characters realistically struggle with belief and choices between right and wrong."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"C.S Lewis's book Prince Caspian is an exciting adventure of the return to Narnia. In this book, the characters from the Chronicles of Narnia, Susan, Peter, Edmund, and Lucy, suddenly get sucked back into Narnia after a year of being out of the magical land. The four children and a small dwarf named Trumpkin face battles and challenges on an expedition to find Prince Caspian. Even though this book was very hard for me to get into, I would still recommend it. At some parts of the book, I got lost because I was bored with it. The book was not quite mind catching enough. The adventures get pretty exciting at parts, and especially during the end of the book.In the beginning of the book, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy get sucked back into Narnia. On a walk through the woods and the beach, they found the Ancient Treasure House, where all of their Narnian presents were from the year before, or in Narnian time periods, thousands of years before. The only thing that they had to eat was apples from the apple tree. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy then discovered that there was a dwarf that was being thrown into the river. They became friends with the dwarf and used a boat that they had found to reach Prince Caspian by crossing a Narnian river. Aslan, the great lion helped in part of the adventure to find Prince Caspian. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy along with Trumpkin fought through a few battles, and at the end of the book, found a feast of glorious food. Will Susan, Peter, Trumpkin, Edmund, and Lucy find Prince Caspian, or will they face disasters in the river or get stranded with Aslan? Travel to Narnia and read about the adventures of Prince Caspian to find out.I think that C.S Lewis's purpose for writing Prince Caspian was to get back into Narnia for example having the magic of the Narnian world pull the characters back into the land and tell a different story. He wanted to set up the story as a future year to the Chronicles of Narnia. C.S Lewis definitely achieved his purpose.I think that Prince Caspian was a little bit of a boring read, and my mind would get lost from place to place, but again, it was kind of interesting and a pretty good book. I liked the parts when the story got into an adventure like for example on the Narnian River when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are trying to find Prince Caspian with trumpkin. Peter, Susan, Edmund, Lucy, Trumpkin, and all of the other characters in Prince Caspian were realistic, I could catch on to what they did, and also be inspired by them. The information in the book was okay, but I think that it could have been a little bit more mind grabbing. Some of the quotes in the book were\\" Trumpkin, you're a brick.\\" And \\" They are fast asleep and will not wake.\\"Over all, I think that Prince Caspian was a pretty good book, and I would recommend it.

However, in Narnia time, it has been close to a thousand years since the four children left the wonderful world, and returned to Britain to continue their studies. But now, as the four royals board a train to school, they are summoned in the most peculiar way, and whisked off to Narnia. Only, Narnia isn't how they left it. It has been destroyed - at least to a certain extent - and many of the animals are no longer enchanted. The destruction of Narnia, however, has not been caused by anything that the former Kings and Queens have done. Nor was it caused by the rightful royal - Prince Caspian. No, it has all been caused by the greedy King Miraz, who has pushed young Caspian out of the way, and claimed the throne, and now wants his blood, in an attempt to make his own son the next King. Now, it is up to Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund, along with the help of Aslan - the Godlike lion - and Caspian - as well as the enchanted dwarves and animals of the Narnian lands - to take down the wicked King Miraz and his evil cohorts, in an attempt to restore the glory that Narnia possessed in the past.Perhaps it is the fact that I adore the characters of Lucy, Susan, Peter, and Edmund so much, which is why PRINCE CASPIAN has quickly become my second favorite book in the NARNIA series, right behind the wonderful THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. As always, the four children reclaim their charming dispositions for this installment, and bring to life an enchanting story, complete with new friends, as well as faux's. Lucy, once again, takes on the role of Mother Hen - even though she is the youngest of the lot - and leads her older siblings on adventure after adventure with the help of the somewhat mysterious Aslan; while Caspian will easily capture the hearts of readers based solely on his bravery and kindness, as well as inquisitiveness. Put on your robes, and embark on another enchanting adventure with the stars of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"There has been much talk recently about the Christian allegory in C. S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series of children's books. But Lewis preferred to see the purpose of his Narnia stories as one of \\"baptizing the imagination\\" in preparation for hearing the real gospel story. And if there is such a thing as a baptism of the imagination, Christian writers ought to take a lesson from Lewis in how it's done.Prince Caspian is the fourth chronological book in the series and one of my favorites thus far. I read through all the Chronicles when I was a kid, but I decided to re-read them as a result of all the hubbub about the recent Narnia movie. I had forgotten how the books had the strange quality of being both beautifully simple and deeply complex. In one sense they are simple stories of good and evil. But in another sense they are so entrenched in the Christian story that the mysteries of Christian theology are emphasized.Take the character of Aslan, who is both the heart of the books and the heart of Narnia itself. Lewis has this wonderful way of imbuing him with both the terror and the wonder of the Christian God. In Aslan we see a figure of light and beauty, a figure of almost limitless wonder that revives the soul in a single encounter with him. But we also see the terrible judge of all things, that being of infinite power and wrath that holds the divine right to execute eternal justice.I am also enamored with the different ways in which Aslan is presented in the different books. In The Magician's Nephew he is the benevolent Creator. In The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe he is the suffering Messiah. In The Horse and His Boy he is the Judge of wickedness. But in Prince Caspian we see something wholly different: Aslan as the divine Giver of life, the God who makes all things new.For example, contrast Aslan's involvement in the battle of Wardrobe with his uninvolvement in the major battle of Caspian. In Caspian he is content to organize the necessary elements to win the battle, while he goes on a parade with Bacchus and Silenus and the children of Narnia, spreading life and beauty, healing the sick, and having an all-around divine celebration of the return of Aslan and freedom to Narnia. For all the variation in modern sci-fi/fantasy films, novels, and comic books, I never see in them a scene like this. That is because the art and popular culture of modern humanity has excised God from the picture. The heavens are silent, and man is left to himself to create his own significance. The vision of Aslan restoring life to his world is an exhilarating experience like nothing else I've read, except for the biblical story itself.But while it is exhilarating, it is also depressing because there is no one like Lewis around today to write these kinds of sophisticated children's novels from a Christian worldview. There have certainly been writers who have tried, but none of them have come close to Lewis. And the bestsellers in Christian fiction are still Christified pop versions of romance novels and thrillers.But time in Narnia is time well-spent. Lewis is an author that understands both theology and mythology, and can wrap them up together in an unusual but sublime package."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the fourth book out of the six books in the Chronicles of Narnia series. There are six main characters; Peter, Susan, Edmund, Lucy, Prince Caspian, and Aslan. The story takes place in a land called Narnia. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy get to Narnia by Susan's horn. (You can find more information about it in the book; The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe.)When they arrived in Narnia there were a lot of overgrown trees, Aslan was not ruling, and people thought that animals did not talk like they did in the other books. The new ruler was named King Miraz who was a bad ruler by killing the talking animals and not allowing magic. Prince Caspian was his nephew who did not like how things were being done so he ran away. Prince Caspian finds old Narnian taling animals and becomes their leader. Meanwhile Edmund and the other kids find a dwarf who is in Prince Caspian's army. When they heard that King Miraz wanted to kill Prince Caspian they leave immediately to go and find the Prince but instead find Aslan. will Peter, susan, Edmund, and Lucy with the help of Aslan find and save Prince Caspian and the land of Narnia? Find out by reading this book.I think Prince Caspian is one of the best books in the Narnia series. I think a lot of people would read it because its full of bloody battles and it reunited the main characters from the beloved book; The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"A great continuation to the series. One of the great themes in this book is that courage and virtue come in all shapes and sizes.It contains great lessons for the young reader while giving them an escape to the amazing world of Narnia."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"'Prince Caspian' finds Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy getting ready to return to school at the end of summer holidays, when they are suddenly pulled by magic into another world. Of course, at once they suspect they are back in Narnia, but nothing seems familiar to them. It turns out while only a year has passed in our wold, centuries have passed in Narnia.This is the second published book in the series (4th in the internal chronolgy). The first 2/3rds of the book are quite good, as the kids realise where (and when) they are, encounter Trumpkin the dwarf and learn of the recent history of Narnia, and the story of young Prince Caspian.However once they reach Caspian the story really sags, as it just seems the characters wait around until Aslan fixes everything.The Christian references are toned down a little in this one. All in all the weakest of the series -probably closer to 3 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"It is a bleak time for the Narnians of old. The talking animals are all in hiding and men who call themselves Telmarines are ruling the land. The men of Telmar are afraid of and hostile to talking animals, the dryads and hamadryads, the naiads, centaurs, dwarves, and satyrs. They fear them and have tried to destroy them. The woods are silent and the dryads sleep, dreaming of a free Narnia and better times. But the memories of old, free Narnia are alive and are passed on in secret. The nurse of Prince Caspian is just one who knows the exciting secrets of old, and there are many others. And so it happens that the young prince comes to love the old that is hidden more than the new that he will rule. But although the stories of old may feed the soul, they are dangerous to know. And that is the start of the prince's dangers and adventures. He may call on those free creatures who are in hiding, they may rally to his call, but will they be strong enough to overthrow their oppressors? He has one more magical link with the past, and he will use it at the moment of greatest need - the magical horn of Queen Susan bringing unknown help to those who use it, which has been preserved as a relic by the faithful.The Chronicles of Narnia begin, as everyone knows, with \`The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe'. This story, \`Prince Caspian', is probably best read second in the sequence as it is a continuation of the original four's adventures. The High King Peter, King Edmund, Queen Susan, and Queen Lucy are summoned by magic back to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in time of crisis. The story of \`The Magician's Nephew' goes back to the beginning of Narnian time and a little earlier in our world's time to tell how Narnia was created in the first place, and it is probably best read about fifth or sixth in the sequence, but at any rate before \`The Last Battle' which tells how Narnia ends and is more frightening than the rest. The best loved of all the stories is probably \`The Voyage of the Dawn Treader', partly because it is the longest and richest story in the series and is supremely well written. It is very easy to read but full of interweaving plots, and thrills on land and sea, and full of hard realities like how people behave while thirsty on short water rations and no land in sight. It is the jewel of the set, and fits perfectly in the middle. Reading about prince Caspian will help set the jewel in your mind.\`Prince Caspian' is also an interesting story because it explains so much of the magic of Narnia, and gives those who wish to see an insight into politics, history (ours and Narnia's), battles, and human psychology. It is particularly revealing to see what a prince's education involves: some literature, some mathematics, some social graces, some skills in entertainment and music, some politics. Some people do not like this story because it is about a war, but it really is about what leads up to war, what happens after, and how the individuals involved all react and cope. The actual fighting is a small part of the whole, unlike a modern action film which is heavy on the fighting and light on the people. Having said that, the storyline is one of the simplest in the set as we stay almost all the time with the four children together, who quickly resume their adult roles once in Narnia. When things threaten to overwhelm the brave few, Aslan is at hand but to their surprise he is not always easy to see."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Peter, Lucy, Susan, and Edmund are once again whisked into the land of Narnia when they least expect it: while in a subway together several years after \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\\" Narnia has been conquered by a plotting king, and the \\"old Narnians\\" are now scattered in hiding from the wicked humans. The children must aid Prince Caspian, the exiled rightful owner of Narnia, and win their kingdom back for the good of all.This is an epic tale with many new and fascinating creatures introduced, with a central theme of faith. The fact that Lucy is the only one able to see the glimpses of Aslan when the struggle becomes bitter speaks volumes about the virtue of faith, and we can already see in this installment how Susan began to lose hers. The children are not only called to Narnia to save it once again, but to teach the new Prince the value of the old and magical ways of Narnia, and to learn a spiritual lesson themselves.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I enjoyed Prince Caspian, but not as much as The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. They were similar in terms of the characters (with new ones too), war, celebrations, and the search for Aslan. They were different in the timing - several hundred years had passed between the first book and Prince Caspian and Cair Paravel was now in ruins. All four children are back in this story, but they are aging faster than in the 'real' life. In fact, by the end of the story you learn that two will not be back to Narnia because they are 'too old'. You meet the new and next King of Narnia, Caspian the Ninth, learn his history and about his evil uncle. The plot involves a conflict between old Narnia and the Telmarines, which leads to a battle between good and evil, and of course, good wins. Aslan becomes apparent and visible to the children when they finally believe in him again. Then, Aslan helps them and all the creatures of old Narnia win the battle. In the end, and before he leaves Narnia, Aslan banishes the Telmarines but gives them another place to live, heals the sick, and rewards those who diplay loyalty."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The Dwarf Trumpkin tells the children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy)the story of Prince Caspian and how he escaped the castle of Miraz for fear of his life.

On the way he found the four children Peter, Susan, Edmand, and Lucy. They where walking along the way and they saw the REAL king of Narnia, Asland, the great lion and king of all the lands.Prince Caspian had a war with king Miariz and one of them won but, you will have to read the book and find out for yourself. I really enjoyed this book because it had alot action and adventure.It was very surprizing also. It was just a little confusing in a few parts of the book but it was fun to read. I felt like this was a good book because it taught you a good lesson and had a good morial."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This book is good for all readers. All the protagonist were amazing. It was also wonderful because with more than one protagonist it gave the reader more than one perspective. The antagonist wasn't sinister at all. He didn't even cause a conflect. Overall the book was a great read."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I don't know why, but my daughter didn't care as much for this book as for the other tales of Narnia. During one particularly intense passage she almost stopped reading it. However, my nephew and other guys I talked to found this to be their favorite book of the series. This action packed book certainly has a lot of adventure, swordplay, and suspense.This book also has more explicit Christian themes than some of the other tales from the Narnia series. After centuries of absence the land of Narnia forgets Aslan and disbelieves the old legends. In this book Aslan returns and sets things straight. The themes in this work are so strong that many might forget the quality of the work and judge it merely on their personal like or dislike of Christianity.This book presents an interesting perspective. In many tales of magic a character summons up a being or person from another time and place. This story is told from the perspective of the beings who were summoned up! Lewis' personal title for the book was something like \\"Drawn Back to Narnia\\", but this title was rejected.P.S. Don't jump ahead to the conclusion, but the last page sets up a change and new possible theme that will need to be fleshed out in a later book."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Caspian has an uncle named Miraz.

I feel wonderfully relaxed whenever I listen to this wonderful story mixed with great music and sound effects. I have the same high opinion of all the other Narnia chronicles on BBC audio.

I especially like the extra conversation that was added between the children and Proffessor Kirke at the beginning of the tape. I reccomend this highly to any Narnia fan no matter what!"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are awaiting the train that will take them to separate boarding schools when they are suddenly, and magically, pulled out of the station. They find themselves on an island that has been overgrown. Exploring further, they discover the remains of their old castle. They're back in Narnia years ahead of when they last left. When a dwarf appears, he begins to tell them the tale of the true king and the battle he is having in claiming his crown. Will the children be able to help? And will Aslan appear to help as well?I first read these books in third grade, and I struggle to get through this story. Today as an adult, I find it to still be my least favorite of the series. Too much of the book is spent giving background. The story picks up in the second half, but it's not quite enough to redeem the first. Some of my original disappointment probably also comes from realizing that this was not the same Narnia we left. With the centuries that have passed between books, the four children and Aslan are the only returning characters. Still, it's good to see them again, and a trip to Narnia is always worth it.While not a bad read, don't judge the entire series by this book. It is an important background to the next two books, so it is worth a read even if it's not quite as fun as the first in the series."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Beware! The evil, foul-minded people who are publishing these works (The Chronicles of Narnia) have profaned the fantastic writing of C.S. Lewis by rearranging the order of the seven books so as to confuse the reader and steal away some of the magic and wonder by imposing it in a chronological order rather than the artistic one in which it was rendered. Is the horrible time witch at play again or it could be that rascal Screwtape at work? I shake my head sadly at the poor folk who will read these books in the wrong order, actually thinking that perhaps the author meant for them to read Volume Six first. Yes, of course these books come highly recommended but I think it is most important to stress that they should be read in the proper order, which is as follows: 1. The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe 2. Prince Caspian 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4. The Silver Chair 5. The Horse and His Boy 6. The Magician's Nephew 7. The Last Battle Please, do yourself a favor, if you are reading these books for the first time, read them in the right order."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Lewis does a good job when he writes the passage where the children don't all see the lion the same time, only the youngest does and then the next youngest... and that the older children sometimes don't believe the younger for petty reasons. But, at many other times, the general reader seems to suffer because Lewis is writing for children, and his analogies often suffer from oversimplification.One of Lewis's early failings is that he tries to make too much hay out of his talking animal analogy. All religions have their miracles, and some are said to have happened relatively recently. This does not mean that all reports of miracles are true, or that everything in the bible without exception was meant to be taken literally.But there are other flaws. Prominently, at the end of this book, Lewis, falls prey to the sloppy writing habits concomittant to most serials. Out of seemingly nowhere, he adds a long list of nameless and faceless, one-dimensional characters and quickly condemns them. What he doesn't do is write anything about them that would make us believe that they have souls. Among them, a bunch of mischevious schoolboys suddenly turn into swines, and Lewis is the Circe who transforms them. There's no charity here: he is condemning children, in mass, without us even meeting them.This is not the Christian spirit, and the oversimplification present in his analogy is often galling."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is a part of the series of Narnia, a magical land visited only by a special few. While it isn't necessary to read any of the other books before this one, I highly recommend reading at least The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe. For those not familiar with the story, Narnia is a world that the Pevensie children have stumbled into, and with the help of Aslan (a mighty lion), became Kings and Queens of the land before eventually returning to their own home and time.In this book, the children have returned after Prince Caspian has blown Susan's enchanted horn. Their return is just in time; Caspian's uncle, who has taken over the throne, is aiming to kill Caspian and so destroy the last true heir of Narnia. Under his Uncle's rule, the original beings of Narnia (talking animals, mythical creatures, etc.) have been outcast and live in fear. Caspian and the Pevensie's will need to do all that they can to restore everything to its rightful balance, and take his Uncle off of the throne.The characters are not nearly as well developed in this book. We seem some spark of the former characters of the children, but they are really an aside to this story as compared to Caspian. But even Caspian is only half developed and for being a main character, I couldn't really connect with him. There are several minor characters that I did like. These being the badger, some of the dwarves and of course Aslan.The writing is aimed towards children and as such an adult might find it rushed and desire more detail. There isn't really anything offensive in it (aside from one minor curse word) and it is highly appropriate for anyone to read. It has a special narrator, who talks to the reader, and this makes the reading more personal, which is nice.I do like the series and while this isn't the best of them, it is still important to read it as it continues the story of Narnia and sets up some history for the next few books.Prince CaspianCopyright 1951238 pagesReview by M.

The story line was very intriguing and the characters were explained very vividly. For example when speaking of Aslan, the lion, the book gave him a very powerful and noble type of command in the story. Each character in this book was fun in it's own way. My favorite character was Reepicheep, the mouse, the way he was so humble and how he cared about his honor but never once put himself down because of his size. I also liked this book because I love the time of knighthood and legends of Giants and Centaurs and other mythical creatures. That is why I chose to read this book in the first place.The author when he writes can paint a picture in your mind of the open fields, the great forest, even the warmth and love from the great lion Aslan that Peter and the other children felt. I find the authors way of description very amazing. This book was very adventurous full of battles, mythological creatures, spells, castles, kings and queens, anyone that is intrested in that sort of adventure should really read this book.

The impression I get is that Lewis wanted to repeat the success of LION/WITCH, but hadn't figured out how to scale up the story yet. The problems?(1) LION/WITCH had a tyrant, so this book has a tyrant, too. So there's another civil war. Repetition, as I said.(2) The rebels summon the kids from LION/WITCH to help, but why? The kids have no special abilities, like the hobbits. They don't bring twentieth-century technology with them. They're good at horseback riding and archery, but a typical Narnia soldier can do that as well. Basically they are there for propaganda purposes, to awe the Narnians, but that's not heroic, and so Lewis never admits that. Instead they have to fight in battles and risk getting killed.(3) To keep the kids from reaching the rebels and finishing the story, Lewis has Aslan appear and play hide-and-seek. Supposedly it's to test their faith, but why would Aslan think it needs testing at this point, particularly when lives are at stake elsewhere?(4) Eventually they reach the rebels and we get another war. But this time there's no heroic scene comparable to Aslan's self-sacrifice in LION/WITCH, so it's a second-rate repetition.(5) Most of the Narnia stories have a moral, but I don't see one here. That fighting is good?Most of the good stuff is in the last chapter when Aslan is trying to arrange peace. After revealing that Caspian had evil ancestors, he tells the boy that he is only responsible for his own acts. He lectures a wounded rebel on accepting adversity, then gives up and heals him anyway. He praises a man on the losing side for his bravery and advises the other rebels to follow him as they go into exile. And there's the poignant revelation when Peter and Susan learn that they can never come back. But the rest of the novel is pretty much a loss."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I have only seen the movie Prince Caspian. I am reading the book right now.

So you have a lot of water nymphs, tree spirits, fauns, satyrs, and dryads about. Somehow it's all supposed to work in an allegorical Christian context. I think it does, but I'm in my 40s.

The characters and conflicts are the same as the book The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The main characters are Peter and Susan. One of the conflicts they face is person vs. self as Peter must face his fear of being killed in war. The horn Susan left behind in the first episode allowed the as they return to Narnia. However when time they return Narnia is a thousand years later. In the be ok Prince Caspian is a year later after the first. All the people they know from then are died but Aslan he can never die because he is one of the magical creature leafed in Narnia. I didn't like the book Prince Caspian because it had all the Same conflicts just like the other books by C.S Lewis. One of the same conflicts is at the battle they had they lose at first but in the end they won. I also didn't like it cuz it was boring tail like cater 12 that's when they had the battle . But there was some very cool parts of the book for example the high king Peter killed the evil king Miraz in the battle and it was back to old Narnia . The book is boring but its still a good book to read I think you better have a lot of time on your hands because it takes a lot time to read but its still good."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"PRINCE CASPIAN: THE RETURN TO NARNIA picks up just where THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE leaves off--even though it covers events hundreds of years later!It has been hundreds of years since the Prenseives (Kings and Queens Peter, Susan, Edmud, and Lucy) came into Narnia and helped Aslan, the noble Lion, rid Narnia of the White Witch.

A year after coming back to England, they're waiting on the station platform for the trains that will take them back to boarding school after the summer holidays, when suddenly, they're transported into another world.It is soon apparent that they've landed on an island. Driven by hunger, and not knowing when they might go back to their world, they start exploring the place. All they can find is apples from trees that have overgrown an ancient castle ruin. But as they explore these old stones, they realize they're none other than those of Cair Paravel, the palace where they used to dwell when they were Kings and Queens of Narnia. Why is it in such a poorly state?Later, they will save a Dwarf who will tell them how and why they were summoned back to Narnia, and help the young prince Caspian escape from his tyrannic uncle Miraz, the usurper of the throne.This booked started out well. I was excited at the prospect of exploring the old ruins of Cair Paravel, looking for treasures hidden under centuries of vines and ivy. But then the story's tone changed, and it became very similar to the previous volumes.

Lewis Report By: Cashew BrownThis book is about 4 kids that get sent to a magical place called Narnia. Narnia is a place of magic, mystery, and talking animals. They came across a dwarf that was about to be murdered. They rescued the dwarf from a long ,painful death from drowning. The dwarf, thankful for his life, told the children a long story about Prince Caspian . He told of a boy that was heir to the throne of Narnia. He ran away from his castle and got knocked out and woke up in a small cave with two dwarfs and a talking raccoon. They told all of the magical creatures that lived in the area. They all had a meeting and declared war on the castle. The dwarf ,having finished his story, led them to the mainland. They got lost in a large forest for several days. When they finally got out they went straight to Prince Caspian. They had a discussion and finally agreed on a duel with the king. Caspian had the duel the next day. Caspian had a hard battle but won. Then the four kids were sent back home.I liked this book because I love anything to do with fantasy. Ever since I could read I would always try to get only fantasy books to read. That is why I like this book.I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian is the second published installment of the Chronicles of Narnia series. It is a little darker than The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe but still definitely kid friendly. As I stated in my review of The Lion... Christian themes are woven throughout the book; however, I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy the book even if you are not a Christian.Prince Caspian picks up one year in earth time which is approximately 1,300 years in Narnia, after the great battle and victory portrayed at the end of the first book. This time Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are summoned back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian, the rightful king to take his place. Aslan, which from a Christian theme, is portrayed as Jesus Christ does not play as visible of a role in this book as he does in the first. He finally makes a formal appearance about two thirds into the bookC.S. Lewis' writing style lends itself to a quick and pleasurable read that can be enjoyed by young and old alike and I would highly recommend the first two books in the Narnia series and plan to continue to read through the rest."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The Cronicles of Narnia:Prince CaspianBy C.S. Lewis5/15/2008Even though this novel was written in 1951, the books have been big among many children and adults over the years. The motion picture based on the novel, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, has made these classical novels popular once again. Prince Caspian is based on the four children's return to Narnia. Even though it has only been one year in Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy's world, thousands of years have passed in Narnia. Author C.S. Lewis puts an English twist on words and phrases, giving the book a unique language of its own.This book is full of exciting twists and turns as the reader is given a chance to relive the Nanian experience in a new and exciting time for Narnia. The children arrive at their old castle, which is in ruins, and do not know what magic pulled them back to the other world. Soon they meet a dwarf who tells the kids what has happened in Narnia since their last departure. The author then takes the reader into another part of the book regarding Prince Caspian and his life in Narnia, a boy who lost his parents and resides in a castle with his uncle and aunt. As a boy who is forbidden to ever hear of the old Narnia, about a time of piece and the talking animals and different kinds of nature beings.The author confuses the reader a bit by jumping to another character, which is unknown to the readers. As the dwarf is telling the story, the author goes on with the story for a good part of the novel, that the reader looses track that it is a story within the novel. The reader is left wondering for many pages what this story has to do with the four children.The wording is a little outdated since the book was written in 1951, but the language also interests the reader. The length of the book is appropriate. This is not just a book for children, and adults, but also for the family to read together. The author is intent to keep the reader guessing what will come next. As Prince Caspian escapes from his evil uncle, Caspian finds that the old secretes of Narnia are still true, beasts and people of the old times still exist. On the far side of the land the children try and make their way through a large over grown forest and tough waters to help Prince Caspian and the land they have grown to love.The author paints an imaginative picture that helps the reader to visualize the land of Narnia. It is hard at times to keep focus to the story. The description of the old language is also hard to follow in some parts, but the author steps out of story mode and explains what he means by his wording choice. Thus the author is connecting personally with his readers.The ending is amazing, yet with a twist no one will ever expect in regards to the future of Narnia and Susan and Peter. This is a great story for all and ideal for parents to read to their kids. Even this book is older it is an unforgettable classic. I can't wait to see how close the book is related to the motion picture. Where will C.S. Lewis take us next?"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In anticipation of the soon to be released movie version, I decided to familiarize myself with the plot by reading the book. Though this may not be as strong of a story as \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", it still possesses the charm of the first book in the series.Since Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy left Narnia, the world changed rapidly. Although only a year has passed in their world, time moves much more quickly in Narnia. Narnia has since fallen under the tyrrany of King Miraz, causing the talking creatures to virtually vanish. With King Miraz's plan to dispose of the heir to the thone Prince Caspian, the future of Narnia is darkening. But when the same horn that once summonded Aslan recalls the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve, Prince Caspian has allies in his claim to the throne.While this may not be as strong of a book as the first book in the series, it may be unfair to hold the book to such a high standard. The book is a quick read and easily engages the reader. The Chronicles of Narnia may be the high water mark of C.S. Lewis's writing career. One can only hope the movie matches the standard of the books."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I think that C.S. Lewis was one of the best storytellers of his time.

They were called upon Prince Caspian's request for the old Kings and Queens of old Narnia to come back. But they find out that one year in England is actually hundreds of years in Narnia.The important parts of the book are the most exciting parts.

In the middle of the book, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy meet Aslan again. Then finally they meet Prince Caspian and start to get ready for their upcoming battle. And in the end they all...Prince Caspian was one of the main characters that made the book seem very exciting. He had an exciting personality, was a kind person, and was a brave and determined prince that was ready to take back his rightfully deserved throne. King Miraz, even though he was evil, he had a very realistic personallity, is a bad ,but smart person and makes the book seem very exciting. For example King Miraz killed everyone else who was going to be king. And finally, Aslan the wise, strong, good leader, and nice lion was the character that made the book worth reading.This book was the best! It was entertaining, had very detailed information about what was happening, had very believable characters, was the most exciting book in the series so for, and over all was the best book in the series of, Choronicles of Narnia.Refering to my thesis, this book was in a perfect setting, will make you get into the book easily and was a great book.

Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.As the first real sequel to \\"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe\\", this manages to draw out the story and history of Narnia so that Lewis' creation reaches its full potential. The character of Caspian is readable although a little stiff at times, and the dialogue does falter occasionally where elsewhere in the books it is very smooth. The description of the voyage and the encounters of the crew are imaginative and still feel very original, and the transformation of Eustace still brings a bit of a chill, even in hindsight!Great for youngsters and very readable for grown-ups.8.5/10"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian presents an adventurous fantasy tale of how Edmund, Peter, Sue, and Lucy are dragged into the magical world of Narnia.

His nephew and rightful heir to his throne is Prince Caspian.The kids had been to Narnia before, so they were not too surprised when they got there.

But with the other six installments, the stories get bigger and deeper, and the world of Narnia becomes even more real."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I personaly don't like to read but in my opinion Prince Caspian was a great book. I am so glad that this book is just one in a series! It is the sequel to the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is about 4 children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy discover Narnia through a wardrobe. In Price Caspian the 4 children are trying to bring Narnia to justice by helping Prince Caspian become king and bring down his evil Uncle Miraz. It doesn't matter whether you like to read or not or if you are 7 or 20. It's a great fantasy. In this book you will find all kinds of adventure. You will discover animals that talk, animals that don'y exist, and even some dwarfs. When you read Prince Caspian your imagiation sets free. There is such good description that you can picture in your head what is happening. In addition, you can also connect with the characters well. I would rate this book a 4.5 because it has all the qualities a good book but the beginning isn't as good as i thougt it would be. It doesn't grab your attention right away but later in the book it gets... interesting. To improve the book I would have made the book more exciting because in the beginning of the book th children are at the train station and the train goes by and they end up on this island. It doesn't grab your attention and make you think what is going to happen next? Overall Prince Caspian is a great book.

Ages have paased, but human greed, treachery and ambition are never out of style.Young Prince Caspian, the true heir to the crown, needs the help of the Four Monarchs to rid Narnia of his uncle/usurper. Even worse, men and talking animals alike doubt the ancient tales about Aslan, the mighty lion from Over-the-Sea, who sacrificed hismelf on the Stone Table to save those whom he loved. Yet did not die.Beneath the surface plot and childlike banter among siblings, defenders and scoundrels, SCL has included many references to Christianity--without mentioning God or Jesus. He also incorporates many mytholgoical creatures, which makes a curious literary blend. It's a challenge to provide equal action for all four kids, but young Lucy still enjoys a special rapport with her precious Lion. Sadly, this wil be Peter and Susan's last visit to Narnia, since they are growing up. Even Edmund redeems himself after his treachery in the first book, but can you ever truly kill a witch?.

This particular production is weakened by the changing of the actors from the &quot;Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.&quot; Perhaps the lapse of time meant they had to get a new Peter and Edmund (Lucy sounds the same), but the problem is that Peter sounds significantly younger than the actor playing Prince Caspian, and this ruptures the suspension of disbelief, as in the book, Peter is supposed to come off as the older king, patron to the younger Caspian. But while Caspian has a deep and resonant voice, &quot;older&quot; Peter is still a squeaky voiced kid (with a much higher pitch than Peter in TLTWATW). He never manages to sound sufficiently grand. It's really too bad because the rest of the show is wonderful.BTW the same problem with the change of actors dogs the subsequent BBC production of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,&quot; where Edmund, supposedly Capsian's age, sounds about five years younger.

I did but that only added to my ambivalence rather than building up my appreciation. The subtle sexism is less subtle in this novel than in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Not offensively so but undeniably there. Of course, given when it was written it is not unreasonable to expect there to be some sexism. Just disappointing, I suppose."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"PRINCE CASPIAN begins a year after the events of THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, the Pevensies' years in Narnia having taken only a few moments of our world's time. As they sit together waiting to catch trains to their respective boarding schools, without warning they're pulled into another world that they don't recognize - a deserted island dominated by a ruined castle. This presents a very serious problem, as between them they have only two bag lunches and the clothes they stand up in - very thin supplies for being stranded for an unknown length of time in strange country. (Lewis' own wartime experiences and peacetime hiking expeditions enabled him to write about such things very realistically.)Only gradually do they realize that this country is the familiar made strange. It is their own capital of Cair Paravel, after untold centuries have washed over it - enough to turn the peninsula on which it once stood into an island. As they walk through the royal treasury and remember what once happened - from years of chess games with fauns to the talking moles who planted the now-wild orchard grown up to the castle gates - there's a compelling mixture of fascinating nostalgia and heartbreak, remembering all the splendour of the years of restoring Narnia to a free and happy country now reduced to crumbling ruins, where even the magical gifts from the first breaking of the hundred years' winter have been abandoned to dust and silence.When the first humans the Pevensies have seen in this sadly transformed Narnia appear, they have come to murder a dwarf by drowning him in the sea. Rescuing him, the Pevensies learn that Trumpkin represents the survivors of old Narnia, while the humans represent the worst of the new Narnia, the Telmarines who invaded the leaderless country centuries ago and silenced its magic however they could.However, the new Narnians are people, not monsters - in the generations since the conquest, many have never learned of Narnia's true history, such as Prince Caspian, whose story Trumpkin relates to the Pevensies. Caspian, the only son of the previous king, loved the tales of the old Narnia he was told as a child by the nurse who was the only person who loved him (his childless uncle Miraz merely tolerated Caspian as an heir of his own blood). When his nurse was dismissed for teaching him such stories, Caspian expected only misery from his new tutor - only to learn to his terror and delight that Doctor Cornelius was part dwarf, and that the old Narnia slumbered under its oppression but had not been destroyed. This is particularly well handled, and is characteristic of the difference between PRINCE CASPIAN and its illustrious predecessor. In THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, Narnia was a magical country oppressed by a magical enemy, and the Pevensies were isolated non-magical elements. Here is Narnia is a disenchanted land where magic has been smothered, and the humans have done almost as much damage to themselves, with lies to explain why they fear the sea from which Aslan always entered his kingdom and the forests which once gave battle.Cornelius' hope was that when Caspian came to the throne he would not only be a good lord to the Telmarines but might unite the old and the new Narnia, waking the slumbering spirits of the trees and the waters and restoring the rights of Narnia in hiding. Their hopes have had to be prematurely put into action, however, as Miraz' queen has given birth to a son, marking the end of his tolerance for the boy who has a better claim to the throne than the man who sits on it.In helping Caspian to flee Miraz' castle, Cornelius gave Caspian Susan's magical horn and unwittingly sent Caspian straight into the hands of the old Narnians. Deciding this is their best chance, they have begun gathering for war to gain Caspian his throne and the old Narnians their ancient rights, and Susan's horn was sounded because of its magical properties of bringing strange help to whoever uses it - although the return of ancient kings and queens once more in childhood was something even stranger than Cornelius might have dreamed of.The War of Deliverance and the reawakening of Narnia do not follow the same pattern as the war against the White Witch, and may come as a surprise to first-time readers in terms of what does happen. PRINCE CASPIAN also has rather more complicated relationships on both sides than were seen in THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, as both sides are divided as to their goals and how best to achieve them. The vicious politics of Miraz' court are something from which Caspian has been sheltered, but become more apparently later in the story - the Telmarines are far from being a united people under his rule, and several lords who helped put him on the throne are not blind to the fact that they could act as kingmakers once again. As for the Narnians, some have given up any hope of Aslan and have little use for humans, and have despaired to the point of allying with darker forces.Final points worthy of note:- Lewis' talent for writing superlative dialogue, as in other books, occasionally is most noteworthy for some of the villains. The council scene at Aslan's How - once the hill of the Stone Table - just as Trumpkin arrives with Peter and Edmund is particularly impressive.- Last but never least, PRINCE CASPIAN introduces one of the greatest heroes and chivalrous knights of Narnian history: Reepicheep, chief of the Talking Mice."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian: The Chronicles of Narnia / By C.S. of Lewis/ Harper CollinsPeter, Susan, Edmund, and Luzy are suddenly pulled into Narnia from their own land of England by a distress call from the Prince Caspian.

Lewis has a lot to offer to readers."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Prince Caspian, the second Narnian Chronicle to be written and the fourth chronologically, is a slightly longer, more subtle book than its prequel \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", but a book I enjoyed just as much.Waiting at a station for a train to school Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are whisked back to Narnia, hundreds, maybe thousands of years after they had originally been the kings and queens. Their castle Cair Paravel is in ruins, the animals are mute and the land is filled with Telmarines, a cynical people who don't believe in the great lion Aslan or any of the great happenings of Narnia's past. Narnia is ruled by Miraz, a usurper to the throne. The real king, Prince Caspian, has fled. With the help of the old Narnians in hiding, Caspian musters an army to fight Miraz and take the throne that's rightfully his. Can he succeed? Will the children be able to help. Will Aslan return?It's an exciting book, taking you far and wide among Narnia and its creatures. We hear a lot about the dwarves in this book, and of the community of talking animals. We also hear of Narnia's surrounding lands, and of it's constellations. Reepicheep, the feisty talking mouse, appears for the first time in the series. Other characters who appear that are worth a mention include the Greek god Bacchus (I love Lewis' description of him), the bumbling Bulgy Bears, the wise and faithful badger Trufflehunter, a frightening werewolf and many a talking tree. This book also sets things up nicely for \\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", the next and one of the most exciting books in the series.Author C.S Lewis was a sincere christian, and his beliefs shine through in all his work. Prince Caspian is no exception. Here, Lewis seems to deal with the issue of faith and belief. In the age Prince Caspian is set in, Aslan isn't visible, just as God isn't visible to us. There are a lot of people who won't believe in what they can't see (like the Telmarines) but even among them there are some who hear about the truth and are excited by what they hear (like Caspian). You can see the same thing when Aslan appears to Lucy and asks her to follow him, yet no one else can see him until they believe what she has to say. Another theme I noticed is that of how people respond to hearing about their savior. The Narnians respond in many ways, just as people respond in many ways on hearing of God's word. Some are cynical (like the Telmarines), some are faithful (like Trufflehunter), some are doubting and need to see some evidence (like Trumpkin), and some refuse to believe until the bitter end (like the mean dwarf Nikabrik).All of the Chronicles of Narnia are written for children, but I think some children might struggle through this, particularly during the war chapters. Peter dictates a letter in chapter 13 which is a bit verbose for kids, I thought. There's a bit of intrigue that might goover their head too. When I was a kid and I read this, I brushed over those bits, but I appreciate them a lot more now.Prince Caspian is fourth in the \\"reading order\\", but the only book you really need to read before this one is \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\".

In \\"The Lion,\\" the four Pevensie children become kings and queen of the magical Narnian realm and reign for many years, but when they return home they find themselves back in their child bodies, on the exact same day that they stepped into the wardrobe many years ago. A year later, the children are waiting at the station for their train to take them back to boarding school when they feel a strange pulling at them - and all of a sudden they are back in Narnia!But something is different - their beautiful castle of Cair Paravel is in ruins, and the land seems ominous and empty. Realising that the time-difference between the two worlds means that a thousand years have passed in Narnia whilst only one has gone by in their own world, the children feel quite lonely and displaced: strangers in a familiar land that has gone on without them. When a mysterious boat carrying a dwarf prisoner pulls up on the nearby river, the children rescue the dwarf and learn the story of what has come to pass since they last ruled the land. After their disappearance life went on, but in recent years the Telmarine (ie human) Miraz the conqueror invaded Narnia and drove the \\"Old Narnians\\" into hiding. The Talking Beasts and the dwarfs have scurried underground, the nymphs and trees have gone into a deep slumber, and Aslan has seemingly abandoned them. But the Narnians have one hope: the Prince Caspian, who was raised on stories of their kind and now leads a revolt against his uncle Miraz for the country's independence. The dwarf's tale links up his story with the children's', realising that the moment of their departure coincided with Caspian blowing Queen Susan's horn - which would summon aid to whoever winded it. Now the group head off for Aslan's How, in order to join with Caspian and defeat Narnia's foes.The story of Caspian is a somewhat patchy one as the viewpoints are continually switching and changing - first from the Pevensies', then from the narration of Trumpkin as he tells Caspian's story, and at one stage even from the point of view of two Telmarine generals. However, Lewis juggles all these narratives delicately, though possibly does a better job in the first half than the second. The trek of the four children to Aslan's How can get a little tedious, even with tantalising glances of Aslan on the way, and the one-on-one duel between Peter and Miraz is a little anti-climactic after some of the other vivid battle sequences that Lewis has described in other books.However, almost as compensation, Lewis gives us several moments of startling beauty and goodness - most prominently the sequence when Aslan returns and leads any willing soul - either Telmarine or Narnian - in a joyous revel through the countryside. There are other little touches like this, such as when Doctor Cornelius describes Caspian's mother as \\"the only Telmarine who was ever kind to me,\\" or Trufflehunter the badger quietly declares: \\"We don't forget. We hold on.\\" Most of all is Caspian's reunion with his old nurse that was sent away from the castle when he was only a young boy - I was ten years old when I first read this book, and I still recall how immensely touched I was at their reunion.More so than any other of the books, with the exception of \\"The Last Battle\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\" is tinged with heavy doses of melancholy and loss. For the children to return so long after their reign in the Golden Age, to a world that regards them as little more than a fairytale brings home C. S. Lewis's themes of loss and the inexorable passage of time. Even though Cair Paravel is restored to its former glory by the end of the story, to find it overgrown and in ruins is as devastating to us as it is to the children. Likewise, the children's eventual departure is also touched with sadness - their reign has past and must be relinquished to Caspian; furthermore Peter and Susan are told that they are now too old to ever return to Narnia.But of course, Aslan is always the same and this is in fact the Christian theme that Lewis injects into this book. Each one deals with a particular Christian allegory or way of life, and \\"Prince Caspian\\" is predominantly concerned with faith. Whether it is the afore mentioned Trufflehunter who holds fast to Aslan and the old stories, or Caspian who would desperately like to believe in the stories, or the sceptical Trumpkin, Lewis deals with the matter of faith from several different levels. Even the children themselves are \\"tested\\", with Aslan only appearing to those that are willing to believe that they are in fact following him - again this alludes to the children gradually growing up. It is easier to believe in something when we are younger than when we get older, and Peter voices the question: \\"why does he hide from us? He never did that last time.\\" The fact of the matter is that he isn't a tame lion, and sometimes all we can do is simply have faith that he is there, even if we cannot see him."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Only in times of great distress may the true heir to the throne of Narnia sound Queen Susan's horn; its imperious summons must be obeyed. Our favoite sibling quartet, who discovered a fantasy realm at the back of a wardove (see book one of this extended series) are suddenly whisked away from a railway station, where they are to board trains to their respective boarding schools. Delighted to return to their beloved Narnia, where they ruled for decades (which passed as mere minutes of Earth time), the children are puzzled to recognizemajestic Caer Paravel--but in ruins! Ages have paased, but human greed, treachery and ambition are never out of style.Young Prince Caspian, the true heir to the crown, needs the help of the Four Monarchs to rid Narnia of his uncle/usurper. Even worse, men and talking animals alike doubt the ancient tales about Aslan, the mighty lion from Over-the-Sea, who sacrificed hismelf on the Stone Table to save those whom he loved. Yet did not die.Beneath the surface plot and childlike banter among siblings, defenders and scoundrels, SCL has included many references to Christianity--without mentioning God or Jesus. He also incorporates many mytholgoical creatures, which makes a curious literary blend. It's a challenge to provide equal action for all four kids, but young Lucy still enjoys a special rapport with her precious Lion. Sadly, this wil be Peter and Susan's last visit to Narnia, since they are growing up. Even Edmund redeems himself after his treachery in the first book, but can you ever truly kill a witch?. PRINCE CASPIAN proves a fast, action-packed read for kids from 12 on up."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"All of the stories in C.S. Lewis' excellent Chronicles of Narnia series are told in distinctly different ways. Prince Caspian could justifiably be said to be like an epic poem told in prose. It shares many qualities with other epics; most notably its beginning coming in the middle of the action. Prince Caspian, like other epics, contains a climactic battle. However, Prince Caspian (like all great epics) is not simply a book about battles. The great themes of Prince Caspian are those of awakenings, renewal and restoration.As the book opens, the Pevensie children (Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy) are suddenly called back to the magical land of Narnia from a British rail station. They return to find that the land of Narnia is suffering from the oppression of the evil Telmarine King Miraz who rules with an iron fist. The king's nephew, (and son of the murdered rightful king) Caspian, has discovered the truth about Narnia and has fled the palace in fear of his life. In his flight, Caspian encounters some \\"old Narnians\\" who used to live freely before the Telmarines came to rule Narnia. Under the Telmarines, the old Narnians have been facing extermination. After initial mistrust, the old Narnians agree to stand with Caspian in an attempt to reclaim his rightful throne from his uncle and to save those that are left of the old Narnians from certain death. A struggle then ensues.It is in the middle of this struggle that the Pevensies are called back to Narnia, where they once ruled as Kings and Queens. They encounter Caspian's loyal friend Trumpkin the dwarf. Trumpkin relates Caspian's story to them. The children agree to help Caspian. Together, the dwarf and the children set off to come to Caspian's aid.It is on this journey that the Pevensies and Trumpkin learn the old lesson that \\"The mind of man plans his way, But the LORD directs his steps.\\" (Proverbs 16:9) Forced to take a different route back to Caspian's camp than the one Trumpkin took from it, the children and the dwarf become confused and lost. They strive to the utmost limits of their human strength and find that it is not enough. It is in the darkest hour of this struggle that Lucy thinks she sees something on the horizon...a Lion.What follows is a test of Faith for all involved. Lucy, being the youngest of the children and possessing the most \\"child-like\\" faith, overcomes her doubts. She is then visited by the Great Lion Himself, Aslan (Lewis' allegorical representation of Jesus). In one of my favorite scenes in all of the Narnia books, Aslan and Lucy discuss the lack of faith shown by the others and what must be done:\\"Now child,\\" said Aslan, when they had left the trees behind them, \\"I will wait here. Go and wake the others and tell them to follow. If they will not, then you at least must follow me alone.\\"This piece of dialogue is one of the reasons why Lewis is one of my favorite authors. In the span of three sentences in a children's book, Lewis captures the essence of Christ's universal call to be His disciples. Another amazing thing about Lewis (and another reason why he's a favorite author of mine)...is that the book grows progressively more spellbinding and instructive from that point in the story on. Prince Caspian is, like many of Lewis' books, a whole education crammed into a tiny little package--all told in a warm and humorous way. I encourage you to get a copy today. Then read it. There is a lot to be learned from this book."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"In Narnia, the land between the lamp post and the Castle of Cair Paravel, animals talk.

Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA series and the 2nd one published, continues the adventures of the Pevensie children in Narnia. The story opens with Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy waiting at the train station to return to boarding school for the year where they are yanked by magic onto the shores of a strange forested island.Time, one must remember, does not move the same way in Narnia as it does in the real world; the Pevensies could spend 100 years in Narnia and return to reality to find that no time at all has passed. It turns out that hundreds of Narnian years have passed during the year that the children have been away and the Narnian world has been thrown into chaos -- the animals no longer speak; a new line of kings govern the land with a harsh scepter; the oceans have risen and the landscapes changed; the people have forgotten the ways of the old line of kings; and the stories of the old Narnia have been forbidden to be told. Beyond that, it seems forever since the last time the great lion, King Aslan, has been seen at all, and his existence has been dismissed by most as mere silly legend.This installment of the series pales only slightly to THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE. The story of our four Narnian protagonists shows us once again that their identities in Aslan's Kingdom have nothing to do with what they do and everything to do with who(se) they are. Lucy is faced with the toughest decisions this time around, as she is asked to choose whether she will follow Aslan even if the people closest to her consider her crazy for doing so. I am struck again by the ease of C.S. Lewis' storytelling voice. While he may not deliver the most complex plots or character arcs, the tone and pacing of his language makes me wish I were a child again and could sit in front of the hearth and listen to his stories aloud.--- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This is not my favorite of the Chronicles of Narnia. Not by a long shot. I remember I didn't enjoy it that much as a child, and I was somewhat surprised to find that it was not much better when I re-read it last month. To me, the action seems quite slow-moving. The writing seems much more wooden and dated than in Lion. The early stuff when Caspian is at the castle, learning about old Narnia, is not bad. But the main journeying part is dull. Also, Lewis seems more preachy in this book than in others. I re-read Lion before seeing the movie and thought it was fabulous. And I am looking forward to re-reading my absolute favorite from when I was a kid, the Voyage of the Dawn Treader."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Originally published as the second entry in the Narnia Chronicles, chronologically &#65533;Prince Caspian&#65533; is published in modern editions as the fourth in the series. It is not the most exciting in the series, but it&#65533;s still an enthralling story. Through Doctor Cornelius, who has true Narnian blood, Prince Caspian discovers that he is the rightful heir to the throne and that his uncle King Miraz is a usurper. When Miraz fathers his own son, Caspian&#65533;s life is endangered and he is forced to flee. Summoned by a magic horn blown in this time of peril, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy re-enter Narnia. Only with their help and the ever-present guidance of mighty Aslan does Caspian have any hope of saving Narnia from persecution and oppression under Miraz, and restoring it to the kingdom of peace it should be. The climax involves a thrilling and decisive duel.As with all the Narnia Chronicles, on the level of children the story functions as a perfectly comprehensible and exciting fantasy adventure, but on an adult level it imparts powerful spiritual truths about Christianity by means of numerous recognizable Biblical allusions. Lewis intended &#65533;Prince Caspian&#65533; especially to portray the restoration of true religion after corruption. But it also portrays spiritual warfare, showing the importance of our sufficiency being in Christ and not in ourselves. As Aslan says: &#65533;If you had felt yourself sufficient, it would have been a proof that you were not.&#65533; (p220) It further demonstrates the folly of atheism and importance of living by faith and not by sight, since God&#65533;s invisible nature does not mean he does not exist (p.150). The notion of Aslan&#65533;s perceived increase in size has profound spiritual implications about increasing one&#65533;s respect and awe of Christ: &#65533;But every year you grow, you will find me bigger.&#65533; (p148) Such important moral lessons about the role of faith in Christ are typical of Lewis&#65533; style in the Narnia series..."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This is the second volume published in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series (and, in my opinion, the second to be read even though it is not the second in the internal time sequence in the series).

The children aid the young Prince Caspian to obtain the throne and lead the talking animals back to their proper place: once more, a battle between good and evil."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"Imagine if you once saved a magical other world... only to return later and find that centuries had passed, and everything had changed.Well, since the movie adaptation of \\"Prince Caspian\\" is about to come out, it seems appropriate to revisit C.S. Lewis's classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.\\" While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia's secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it's no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of \\"Prince Caspian,\\" especially the second half. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don't get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn't believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia. Definitely give it a read before you see the movie."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"I will confess, first off, that while I read this book (as part of the entire series) as a child, I did not recall the story line, or any part of it. I will also confess that it did not strike me as exciting as the 1st book (The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, for us.) But, while this book was not as exciting for me, it kept my 10 year old son constantly eager for \\"one more chapter.\\"In the book, when the children (from The Lion...) are whisked away to Narnia, very quickly they meet someone who begins to set the stage for the adventure they are about to have by explaining some things that have happened since they have been gone. I was quite ready to get on with the children's adventures well before the explanation was finished.I am not saying that you did not need the background information, or that it was written in a manner that would bore a person; I'm saying that I was eager to see what would become of the children I was familiar with and who had just barely been reintroduced when the explaining begins.I believe Lewis started on the train station to better tie in this book with the last--right away he starts with characters you've come to know and, hopefully, love--but that is where he traps himself. Having started you off on their story, he breaks for half the book to tell you another boy's story.(My daughter just told me now that Lewis used the train platform to set up a theme of being drawn in--and that Lewis always felt that you saw things only from the \\"magician's perspective,\\" and not from the perspective of those whom the magic was done on or to.)At any rate, by the time the explaining is done, you are not only eager to be on with the adventure to find out what happens to our four famous heroes, but also because you want to know how the new boy makes out. (Only, now, you will have to wait a while to find out what happens to him. This reminds me of The Two Towers--how you have to wait half the book to find out what happens to Frodo and Sam and then read the other half about them while left hanging about the rest of the party--and I wonder what it is about second books in a fantasy series.)What I loved most about this book was what transpired when Lucy first thinks she sees Aslan. From there until the children are reunited with him, there is something in the way the children interact with each other, and in the way they behave, which shows that these characters are growing and changing through their experience, and it adds depth to some of them and a realness to others. I found myself even more interested in their well being after this section of the book.Lastly, we get to find out what happens to the other boy while finishing the tale of our four heroes. There is battle, the odds are not good, and everyone must play their part if good is to conquer evil again in Narnia.My son really enjoyed the fighting part, as most boys his age do, and he would always beg for one more chapter when we were done readying. If I said no, being forbidden to read ahead, he would pick up the book and read through the chapter titles and stare at the picture and review the story in his head (up to where we were) and try to imagine what comes next.And there you have it. While I did not like it as much as the first (The Lion...) book, I did enjoy a certain part a great deal. Meanwhile, the intended audience, my ten year old son, was \\"spell-bound,\\" so I have chosen to give the book 5 stars. Perhaps it is only a 4 1/2, but I cannot go as low as 4 stars, so 5 stars it is."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"&quot;The Return to Narnia!&quot; Those who have read &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; (Book 1 in the original ordering) know that those four words can invoke a rousing and passionate symphony that only those who believe in Narnia can hear. It is somewhat disconcerting, therefore, when the story opens with a rather clumsy squeak. The four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, find themselves unceremoniously _yanked_ back to Narnia after one Earth year and many Narnian centuries of being away. There is no party to welcome them, only apples growing wild to feed them, and only the ruins of a castle to shelter them.As the children have been gone for so long, some backtracking is necessary before their heroic adventures can begin. As he did in all the books in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, C.S. Lewis gives us a bit of Narnian history that puts the present events in perspective and is genuinely fun to read. This History lesson begins with the Telmarine invasion after the Golden Age of Narnia and ends with the battle between Prince Caspian and his evil uncle Miraz. It's a lesson so absorbing and believable that it makes Narnia seem more real than, say, Bavaria. The political intrigue sprinkled throughout the book is a fine bonus.What I liked most about &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; was the chance to see the two Kings and two Queens of Cair Paravel in action. Their adventures and their characters were given very little space or elaboration at the end of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;; so I was glad to be able to really see them as their royal Narnian selves. (Now that I've read further, I can say that &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; is even better for this purpose. After reading &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, I discovered why King Peter was dubbed Magnificent; and after reading &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, I learned why Queen Susan was called Gentle; King Edmund, Just; and Queen Lucy, Valiant.)And what would Narnia be without Aslan? (I LOVE THIS LION!) In &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, the major lesson that he imparts is that we must have faith and follow him, even when we may appear foolish to others. If we keep insisting that we can find the way by ourselves, then we only get lost. There are other morals throughout the book, most of them woven into the story, such as King Peter's courage in challenging Miraz to a &quot;clean wager of battle&quot; (read: one-on-one combat), &quot;to prevent the effusion of blood&quot; (read: the blood of his innocent subjects). Lewis can moralize better than any other children's writer I know.&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; is not to blame for being the second book in the series--therefore, the sequel that can't help but be slightly disappointing. Though I gave it four stars for the bumpy linkages in the plot, child readers will, if asked, say it deserves five."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This book didn't have the same novelty, and it seemed to be paced a little slower than the firt book in the series, but it was still very good.

That perspective has since changed, though I still feel that there are many weaknesses in the writing of the story, which should be pointed out.For one thing, the tale is divided into a number of sections, which differ drastically from one another, meaning that the narrative doesn't exactly flow. There are, I think, five distinct sections, each very different from the others. The arrival of the children, the backstory of Caspian, the journey towards Aslan's How, the battle with Miraz, and the victories of Aslan; the last being perhaps the most jarring and bizarre of the five, although there's obviously a reason for that.The first section of the tale; the arrival of the children, is largely set-up for the story. Not much is said or done of any consequence, other than a brief exploration of the area they've found themselves in, and a realization of where they are. They eventually meet a dwarf, who initiates the second section.Caspian's backstory is fairly interesting. We find out that King Miraz (who's actually a usurper; not the real king,) and his people; the Telmarines (basically human beings,) have pretty much taken control of the land away from its native peoples, and have been trying to erase even the records of their past existence. It's only through testimony by his nurse, and a half-dwarf that Caspian even learns about the mythical beasts who once peopled Narnia at all.This section of the story is perhaps the most disturbing if read by itself. The reason is that a few protestant communities genuinely believe that the real \\"church\\" was suppressed by the Catholic Church, and all records of it destroyed; a belief only supported by individual preachers, who arose in the last century and a half or so. One might easily conclude, at first, that Miraz is meant to be an allegory for the modern Catholic Church, and therefore, that this book is blatantly anti-Catholic, but I don't consider that likely, and I'll explain why in just a moment.The third section of the book is basically the kids and the dwarf wandering in the wilderness, in search of Aslan's How, where Caspian awaits. In my opinion, this section drags on a bit too long, but at least its message is quite clear; when Aslan (God) tells you to go someplace, you do it.The setup is this; to get where they need to be, the children need to get across a gorge, so they try to explore a bit and see if there's some route around it; some place where they could cross. Aslan wants them to go one way, and Lucy warns them about this, but none of the others saw him. They wind up getting themselves lost in the woods for a while, and nearly killed by the enemy, before turning back and going Aslan's way; across the gorge by a series of solid rocks that they hadn't been able to see at first.Sometimes, the answer to our problems is right in front of us, but the path just seems too difficult or dangerous. We take account of the wind and the waves, and forget to keep our eyes on the one person who truly matters. In retrospect, this may have been the high point of the story.In section four, some of Caspian's men betray him, and try to summon the White Witch, but they're killed before they can complete their spell. Caspian refuses to be a part of any of their black magic, trusting in Aslan, even though he hasn't shown up yet. Peter and the other kids do show up, however, and Peter offers to fight Miraz in single combat.This is the point where the anti-Catholic accusations are handily disarmed. Peter is clearly an allegory for Saint Peter; the first Pope, and all successive popes by extension, and Miraz, as I've said already, is clearly not a real king (not a real pope,) but a usurper (a heretic.) In many ways, the battle between Peter and Miraz has more of the tone of Athanasius against Arius or the Iconoclast heresy than the Catholic Church vs protestants, but regardless, the fact remains that if Lewis had meant this to be an allegory for an accusation against the church, he would probably have had someone other than Peter battle Miraz, and definitely wouldn't have kept referring to Miraz as a usurper of the throne. Miraz is a heretic who needs to be put into his place. That's how I read this allegory, which might as well be a history of the early church.The victories of Aslan are sprinkled throughout and past the fourth section, but are so drastically different from it, that I list them separately anyway. Of course, the wrapping up of the story is left to Aslan, as always, but there's also a very strange scene, where he trapses through a town with a crowd of magical folks, and starts magically transforming it back into old Narnia. Desks and walls turn into bushes and trees, very good people join his side, and very evil people metamorph into brute animals or plants. The entire scene is simultaneously whimsical and gruesome; a rare feat in a book like this, and the reason for this is obvious; God (Aslan) divides people just like this. To the just, he's a dream come true. To the wicked, he's their worst nightmare.The allegories are harder to read in Prince Caspian than they were in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, and I didn't really enjoy the book as much; the main reason being that it wasn't as exciting. The White Witch was an everpresent and menacing figure (at least at first.) Miraz is only in a couple of scenes, and even then, makes only a very small impression on the readers. Somehow, I just don't think that Lewis enjoyed writing villains, though he could do so competently if he needed to. I just don't feel he did that here.Regardless, this book is fair material for Catholics to read, though, as I said, not as good as the first. It's not all that exciting for the most part, but it has some fairly good things to say."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This fourth novel starts with the abduction into Narnia by the magic horn Susan had received in the second novel and she had left behind, lost if you prefer, of the four kids from the railway station while waiting for the train to take them back to their boarding schools after summer recess.They find themselves in their old Cair Paravel palace and the old treasure chamber where they recover their swords, bows and arrows, and other magic presents, except the horn that has been lost, misplaced if you prefer. On the following morning they save a dwarf to be drowned in the river by two soldiers who run away after a first and only arrow reached them.The dwarf Trumpkin tells them the situation. Narnia has been conquered by the Telmarines from Telmar. The legitimate king Caspian 9th was assassinated by his brother and the lawful heir marginalized, and finally was going to be executed because his usurping uncle had just had a son of his own.With the complicity of Professor Cornelius he escapes just in time and goes back to the old Narnians who had disappeared when the Telmarines had arrived. He is able to rebuild some kind of an army, but the usurper is on his tracks and war breaks out. The untrained and undisciplined old Narnians under the command of Prince Caspian are routed in no time and have to escape and find refuge in Aslan's How, a sort of monument built over the old Stone Table where Aslan had been executed by the White Witch to resurrect afterwards.During these battles Caspian had blown the magic horn that abducted the four kids.With the help of the dwarf they try to join forces with Caspian. But they get lost on the way because they don't listen to Lucy, the youngest child, because she is too young, and yet she is the only one to see Aslan who has come back, because she is the only one to believe in him. Edmund will be next, Peter quite later, and Susan will be last and reluctant.They come just in time at Aslan's How when a bitter dwarf was going to call the White Witch back with the help of a Hag or bad witch, and a werewolf. They suggest to propose a single combat to solve the strife and that proposal comes from Peter who is the High King of Narnia, and many other things.In spite of all logic the usurper accepts the challenge and is on the verge of losing when two of his courtiers cry treachery, kill the usurper and lead the Telmarine army into combat. The battle turns to Caspian's advantage when trees appear and walk and frighten the Telmarines. These come to a ford where there should be a bridge but that bridge has been demolished during the battle by Aslan and the girls with the help of some giant ivy.The army is made prisoner and Aslan reinstates Prince Caspian on the throne as King Caspian X. The Telmarines are proposed either to stay and accept the new rule, in fact the re-instated old rule, or to go to a land of their own. We discover that they were able to rule over Narnia because they were humans, marooned pirates in some South Sea island where they had found a door to Narnia.Aslan builds a door in the air with three sticks and suggests that the Telmarines go through back to their South Sea island. The do it only after the four children do it first, though the children will find themselves back on their railway station platform and the Telmarines in their island.This novel makes it clear that Narnia can only be ruled by a son of Adam or a daughter of Eve. This simple fact has to be understood and it is not simple. These primitive populations of dwarfs and other non human humanoids plus all kinds of magical beings, beasts that speak and trees that walk have to be colonized by people connected to Adam, humans. The first kings were four children, then the White Witch, one fourth daughter of Adam, took over. Then another human race, the Calormenes try to take over, but the kings and queens are still the four kids. And finally here some humans who got stranded in Narnia had taken over and had to be pushed back to their island by the four kids.Does it mean only human beings can rule the world, this one or the other world or worlds? Or does it mean that the only humans can rule this Narnia world respectfully, at least for the general ecology of nature and life, and yet all humans are not necessarily good for that, respectful of differences and of democracy, even if the only form of government can be a monarchy? Or, since Peter and Susan are excluded for the next episode because they are too old, does it mean only human children can rule Narnia?That's the aspect of the saga that is most surprising and it can only be explained by the fact that this saga is written for children and the four children are the go-between for the readers to be able to identify with the heroes, the action, and Narnia itself. And the aim is to nicely encourage positive values in these readers, certainly not sever them from what definitely looks like western established ideas. After all these novels were written during the Cold War and C.S. Lewis refused science fiction, a genre for adults. He stuck to fairy tales after all.But could the same situation have produced a de-westernized story that could have accepted that non-humans could perfectly well govern themselves in a democratic and humanistic way? We will of course never know.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"\\"Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but when you look back everything is different...\\"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sitting at the train station waiting for their train when WHOOSH! They are back in Narnia! Narnia is now under the rule of evil Miraz, but there is one who wants to return it to its former glory: Prince Caspian.I Liked:Once again, I find myself at a loss to describe my feelings towards this book.The story was interesting and didn't try to recreate The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I liked how the emphasis was taken off the race of people, but their hearts (Miraz was bad, not because he was Telmarene, but because he was truly evil; Caspian was good because he wanted to restore rights to the citizens of Narnia not because he was human). Also, for those who weren't gung ho about the heavy Christian allegory, take heart! Prince Caspian still has Christian themes, but it is nowhere nears as obvious as in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.I liked some of the growth we see in the four children. Peter hasn't really changed that much--he is still the take charge eldest, but Susan has a hint of what is to come and while I don't like where her character is going, I do appreciate the foreshadowing. Edmund has really matured; I think the scenes where he is the only one to back up Lucy were very poignant especially in light of his actions in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. And even Lucy doesn't come off as the epitome of perfection, which I appreciated.As always, Lewis continues to describe his land beautifully and populate it with interesting beings. I liked how Cair Paravel had become deserted and the landscape of Narnia had changed drastically.And since I listened to this on audiobook, I wanted to commend Lynn Redgrave on the narrating. I'll admit, I wasn't fond of all the voices she used, but her voice was definitely gentle on the ears.I Didn't Like:It's funny; as I relisten to these books, I begin to recall how when I first heard them (in my teens) I thought they were boring and dull. In many ways, over a dozen years later, my thoughts really haven't changed.A large portion of Prince Caspian is spent in the dreaded flashback. Four chapters are basically a story a dwarf tells the four children about Caspian. I am just not fond of this device; if it is that important, it needs to be SHOWN not reTOLD (and yes, Lord of the Rings has the similar problem with the chapter that never ends, \\"Elrond's Council\\"). It would have been much better, in my opinion, to just tell Caspian's story THEN have the children transport to Narnia (somewhat how the movie did it).Storywise, not a whole lot happens. Yet again, the children tend to be mostly bystanders in the conflict or the catalyst instead of actively getting involved. This isn't as bad as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, as Peter does have a duel with Miraz, but most of the conflict is resolved in the end by Aslan's appearance. I'm still not quite sure what the point of having the children there was in the first place. A lot of the story is hampered with Prince Caspian visiting all these animals, explaining his claim to the throne, and them immediately saying, \\"I'm on board!\\" Absolutely no tension whatsoever.Another thing I didn't care for was the almost complete lack of conflict. Peter has no trouble handing off the crown to Caspian. Caspian immediately believes all the stories about Narnia and has no troubles with four monarchs returning to help him. The \\"good\\" animals jump immediately at the chance to join Caspian's army. The conflict about Lucy seeing Aslan was one of the few exceptions and was welcome. I think it's possible to write a novel for young people without dumbing down the character interactions and taking away all complexities.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:None.Caspian's aunt has a baby.Peter has a duel with Miraz; there are several battles, but if you blink, you'll miss them.Overall:This is going to sound weird, but I found Prince Caspian boring and interesting at the same time. Interesting story told in a boring way. However, that is for a jaded almost 30 year old; maybe if I had read this as a young child or was reading to a young child, I wouldn't overthink it. As it is, it's still a decent story and mildly entertaining.Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"This is the second book in the Narnia series, and it is almost as good as the first. There are three things I really liked about it.The first is how Lucy is able to discern Aslan before the others do and leads them until he becomes visible. This a great way to explain both a preacher's role in guiding others to Christ and a way to highlight the things that small children are aware of that we often miss. It is a good reminder, and a great part of the story.The second aspect that I liked about this book is the timeframe of it. 1,000 or so years have passed in Narnia time since the first book. As we look at the world through the Pevensies eyes, much has changed for the worse. Just as the children try to right the wrongs they see and turn back the clock, Christians must do the same in our realm and pray Christ restores order to the world.The third aspect I really enjoyed about this book is harder to describe . . . but I really like how Lewis gets away with writing this book exactly how he wants to. Lewis uses white magic, black magic, dryads, dwarves, wood goddesses, and even introduces Bromios and his maenads as part of Aslan's army in the eleventh chapter. I love that Lewis was able write this as he wanted, to speak with clarity and courage and put things on paper that would never fly if it were written today. Its refreshing to read Christian fiction that defies the boundaries of religiosity and really dives into true Christianity. Its hard to imagine a modern Christian writer getting way with half as much as Lewis does . . . we don't even let the secular authors like J.K. Rowling off the hook these days.For the young, this is an exciting adventure tale that is told masterfully. For the mature, it is a fascinating and refreshing blend of theology and story. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"My fellow classic and fantasy readers, here is the book you've been waiting to read!This book has a great representation of a secret world. It's about four children called Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who, in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe, stepped into a wardrobe and explored a wondrous fantasy world called Narnia. Now, one year later, the four children find themselves in Narnia -again. They find that in Narnia many years have passed since their adventures. They shelter a dwarf who tells them a tale of a young prince called Caspian, and venture out into the now very different world of Narnia.When I thought there would be sanctuary for the children to settle down and rest, or a trustworthy friend to depend on, or strong aid to help them on their quest, there was trouble and destruction where there should be peace. The children are always adventuring, and that is a reason not to put down this unpredictable, suspenseful book, and that's also why I like it. WAIT-why am I giving this all away. I suggest that you read the book!"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia has always been an exceptional children's book series, and Prince Caspian is not an exception. Written by Clive Staple Lewis in 1949, this children's book was part of a famous series that is known by many people. The book is a fantastic allegory for following in your walk with Jesus Christ after becoming a Christian. However, C.S. Lewis is a writer who appeals to all religions as well as all ages. The title doesn't do much justice for the book at all, since the Prince is a minor character. Perhaps Return to Narnia would fit better.The book begins with the four children of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe (whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan and Lucy) coming back to the magical land of Narnia filled with mythical creatures. They happen to come back 1300 years after the Narnia of the earlier book, and also in the middle of a war between the old Narnians and a tyrant ruler of the Telmarines that wants to kill them all. Now the children must join the rebel Telmarine Prince Caspian in an effort to retake Narnia.The fact that I just summarized the first half of the book is a testament to the length of this book; it's short, requiring less than three hours to read. This does nothing to make the book any less enjoyable though. The book is delightfully simple as well, C.S. Lewis's writing style is easy to understand, but has a strange prose feel that reaches deeper than most writers today can comprehend. The theme is quite easy to understand, and it discusses having a belief in God, represented by Aslan, a majestic lion who represents the messiah Jesus Christ in the Bible. Throughout the book the children must learn to depend on Aslan, and not themselves. The book is a great allegory for Christian faith, and even a child can understand the implications.The characters can be interesting as well, excluding Caspian, who is a young prince who leads the old Narnians in a battle, and that's about it...he has little dialogue, but he is shadowed by the four children. The children all have their own personalities, and are extremely likable, except Susan who, like doubting Thomas of the Bible, won't believe what she can't see including Aslan himself. If you plan to read the entire series remember that fact, it's important. Peter and Lucy have remained relatively unchanged. However, the change in Edmund, the sibling who betrayed his sibling in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, is also a great aspect, and is a delight to watch. Newcomers Trumpkin and Reepicheep, who are a dwarf and a fighting talking mouse respectively, bring in two amazingly well developed characters that are delightful in every aspect.Although it may pale in comparison to other books in the series, I have no real complaints about this book, maybe it's a little too short, but it really shows the theme of the story well, and spins a great and epic tale. If you like any sort of fiction at all, be sure to read Prince Caspian. It's certainly entertaining and deep with insight, and I don't even need to day \\"for a children's book\\".4.5 stars out of 5"},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"PRINCE CASPIAN sees the four Pevensie children whisked away to the magical realm of Narnia where the four of them reigned as kings and queens for many years. Though only a year later for them, many eons have passed since the hunting of the White Stag at the end of the previous book.Cair Paravel is now in ruins and disrepair. The entire island in which it sits is deserted and thought by the inhabitants of Narnia to be haunted. Therefore none of the now-ruling class of Narnians -- Telmarines, humans originally from our world -- venture there unless to execute some criminal, rebel, or perpetuator of the old myths of four human children enthroned at Cair Paravel and a magical, mystical Lion named Aslan.And such was the case when our four heroes rescued a dwarf named Trumpkin from the hands of his Telmarine captors. Trumpkin then relates the exciting tale of Prince Caspian the rightful heir to the throne of Narnia and a classic tale of a jealous uncle, usurped authority, impending doom, and the possible return of the golden age of Narnia.PRINCE CASPIAN is every bit as enjoyable and addictive as THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE. Each page is as entertaining and captivating as the one before. And what so many people miss when reading these books is C.S. Lewis not only weaved some wonderful children's yarns but also threw in some hard-core theology and did so in such a way that even a child could understand."},{"Title":"prince caspian: the return to narnia","review":"\\"Prince Caspian\\" is very good and very exciting. You find yourself wishing you could travel to Narnia! Near the end there is so much strange magic happening it's kind of ridiculous, but it's okay, because all of it is for good. It's wonderful when Caspian's childhood nurse is reunited with him. There are so many different moods in this small book: happiness, anger, sadness, fright, and bravery. You see different beliefs in this book: belief and disbelief in the days of Old Narnia. Then there are the Telmarines, who seem to believe in the days of Old Narnia, but they don't want to. As Prince Caspian is delivered the shocking news that King Miraz will probably kill him so that he is no longer heir to the throne, Cornelius already has a plan in his mind to keep the prince from danger. You soon find out what has happened to Queen Susan's horn; Doctor Cornelius had found it after years of magic spells and terrors. He hands it to Caspian.\\"That,\\" said Doctor Cornelius, \\"is the greatest and most sacred treasure of Narnia. Many terrors I endured, many spells did I utter, to find it, when I was still young. It is the magic horn of Queen Susan herself which she left behind her when she vanished from Narnia at the end of the Golden Age. It is said that whoever blows it shall have strange help--no one can say how strange. It may have power to call Queen Lucy and King Edmund, and Queen Susan and the High King Peter back from the past and they will set all to rights. It may be that it will call up Aslan himself. Take it, King Caspian: but do not use it except at your greatest need.\\"It turned out the horn had the power to call back both the Kings and Queens of Old and Aslan.

Lewis's classic novel, the sequel to his even more classic \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.\\" While it has some drippily allegorical moments near the end, Lewis does a pretty good job with what must have been a difficult sequel.When his aunt gives birth to a baby boy, young Prince Caspian finds himself on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz -- and in the hands of Narnia's secret army of dwarves, centaurs, talking animals and nature spirits. Soon Caspian has an army backing his claim to the throne, but in a moment of desperation, he is forced to blow the magic horn of the legendary Queen Susan -- and subsequently pulls the Pevensies back into Narnia.But while only a year has passed on Earth, centuries have passed in Narnia, and the kids find that it's no longer the place they left -- they and Aslan are distant memories, and their castle lies in ruins. And as they are led by a very skeptical dwarf to help Caspian, Lucy keeps glimpsing Aslan along the way -- a sign that things are about to change drastically in Narnia, both for the human and magical inhabitants...The Chronicles of Narnia were probably the first books to feature what is now standard in the fantasy genre -- an ordinary person gets dragged into another world. Just take a look at successful, unique authors like Diana Wynne Jones and Garth Nix to get an example of how Lewis' stories have influenced the entire genre.If you don't like allegory (religious or otherwise), then steer clear of \\"Prince Caspian,\\" especially the second half. While Lewis's beliefs are presented in a more complicated and subtle manner in his other fictional works, here the parallels to basic Christian beliefs are very obvious. Reportedly even Tolkien, one of Lewis's best pals, found the allegory annoying.But if you can get past the slightly ham-handed treatment, it's a lovely little read. Lewis interweaves mythical elements -- dwarves, nymphs, talking animals, witches -- with the chatty, slightly precious style of traditional British storytelling. But this one is a bit darker and more action-packed than \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe,\\" with some unexpected twists in the middle of it all. The scene with a strange witch and a werewolf is downright chilling, in fact.But Lewis' plotting does sag near the end, during a drippy scene where Aslan wanders around fixing life for Narnian subjects. Fortunately after that, he gets back to a mystery that hangs over the whole book -- just where did all these humans come from, if they were such a rarity in the previous adventure?Peter seems a bit more jaded than before and Edmund a bit more mature, but sadly the girls don't get enough to do this time around. But Caspian is a likable and believable prepubescent king-in-waiting, and surrounded by a bunch of unique Narnians -- a gentle yet fierce badger, a hostile dwarf, a fiery mouse, and the delightfully skeptical Trumpkin, who doesn't believe in lions.Despite a few rough spots, \\"Prince Caspian\\" is a slightly darker, more intricate story, and its finale marks a turning point in the Chronicles of Narnia.

With well-crafted characters that stay with you long after reading the final word on the last page, and an uplifting testimony to God's grace, mercy, and love, Ms. Noble has written a moving and gripping story, one that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"When the Far Hills Bloom (California Chronicles #1)","review":"It's 1860s California and the Byrne family is about to lose their home, Rancho de la Paloma because they have had to use all available finances to fight to prove its boundaries. Aislin Byrne has been friends with Jamie Dearbourne from the neighboring rancho all her life and it was always believe they would marry, so when he asks for her hand just before he leaves to go fight in the Civil War, no one is surprised. But when word comes of Jamie's death, it seems it will be necessary for Aislin to marry Jamie's brother, Spence, in order to help save both their ranchos. Then, when word comes that Jamie might not be dead after all, Aislin joins in the search and will be honor-bound to marry him even though she has found it is Spence she really loves. Aislin's father doesn't realize that his supposed friend, Hugh Dearbourne, father to Jamie and Spence is actually sabotaging his efforts to save his home and everything he has worked so hard to achieve. Jamie and Spence soon join forces to break and deliver wild mustangs to the army in order to save the rancho and in doing so, attempt to find out the truth about Jamie as well.This is an outstanding novel, superbly crafted and richly textured with may surprising twists and turns. Published by Bantam's Christian/Inspirational imprint, Waterbrook Press, this novel will appeal to historical romance readers everywhere. Although the character's beliefs are quite evident, they never overpower the story, and simply help motivate Aislin, Spence, and others to keep going even though the going gets tough. Diane Noble is one of the best writers of &quot;inspirational&quot; romance today. Her thoroughly researched, compelling stories are worthy of a wider audience than they will receive simply marketed as &quot;inspirational&quot; novels. This book shouldn't simply be read by the &quot;Christian&quot; audience as the beliefs expressed by the characters are universal. I understand its the first of a trilogy, but this one certainly stands on its own."},{"Title":"When the Far Hills Bloom (California Chronicles #1)","review":"&quot;When the Far Hills Bloom&quot; has everything I look for in a great novel--high drama, unexpected twists and turns, heart-tugging romance, and genuine, true-to-life conflicts.

Halter, an able writer, seems particularly interested in the internal workings of these female characters, giving them a voice. As an undertaking this is worthwhile as it expands the text and offers an interesting view into these individuals inner lives.Some reviewers object to the licence Halter takes with Sarah's life, particularly as it relates to her being the daughter of a deposed king in Ur. While there exists no basis in the text for this view, beyond Sarah's original name of Sari, Halter generally makes it work. Moreover, his idea of making Sarah directly responsible for her own barrenness and using that as the central tension of the novel proves both interesting and gives the story considerable life. Too often in biblical fiction authors place too little control in the hands of their characters and too much in the hands of an unseen divinity.While I enjoyed that aspect of the novel, as well as the author's gift for incorperating archeological and anthrological details into the story, I found the novel fell short in a few ways. Most interesting and perplexing is the author's choice to place the bulk of the story before the birth of Issac. Halter can obviously do as he chooses in his own work, but I felt a bit cheated at not seeing enough of Sarah as mother.Nonetheless, Halter's prose remain contiunally excellent, particularly how he switches from the first to the third person almost seamlessly. Over all, an enjoyable and worth while read.That said, I would be remiss not to make a point regarding the issue of Sarah's relationship status as it relates to Abraham. While it is true that Abraham claims Sarah to be his half sister when he speaks to Abimelech, the text is silent when it comes to his veracity. Also, he does not make this same claim to Pharoh in the same instance. Moreover, the Abraham story mirrors a simmilar story when his son meets Abimelech and claims his wife as his sister. While the hebrew is somewhat ambiguous on the point, most Jewish cometators dating back centuries actually look to Genesis 12:29 to prove Sarah's father was Harran, making her Abraham's neice. Again, the text, however, remains unclear on the point."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"\\"Sarah\\" is the story of the famous prophet Abraham's wife, famously barren until old age when she gives birth to Isaac, leader of the Hebrews. Sarai is the beloved daughter of a lord of Ur, roughly located near modern day Bagdad. Sarai rather improbably escapes from a prearranged mariage, meets and falls in love with Abraham in a night, and years later escapes her role as a high priestess to join Abraham's tribe and wander until they find \\"Canaan.\\" Halter gives Sarah the mind and heart of a very 21st century woman, which drives her to express frustration when Abraham's mind veers more and more to the One True God, jealousy when Hagar bears Abraham's son, and coldness when a plan to outwit Pharoah in Egypt goes awry. The important thing is to suspend all disbelief when reading this story. It's pure and simple fiction, and highly improbable given the times and culture. I too read \\"Red Tent,\\" which was far better, and gave me a much more realistic feel for the cultures of the time."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I don't typically write reviews to compare one book to another, but since so many have already said, \\"If you loved The Red Tent, you'll enjoy Halter's Canaan Trilogy.\\" I'm not disagreeing with that statement, but Sarah lacks the emotional depth and heart of Diamant's epic.We meet Sarai as a child on the brink of womanhood, and the first half of the book observes her luxurious life in the city of Ur and her first encounter with Abram. The second half deals with her marriage to Abram, his developing relationship with Yhwh, and their travels throughout Canaan. The epilogue quickly covers the latter part of her life after Isaac is born and the Covenant, etc. It seems like Halter breezes past what could possibly be the most significant aspect of Abraham and Sarah's relationship with God.However, the early parts of the narrative do shape who Sarai becomes as a woman and wife. She is often stubborn and jealous, and her feelings toward her husband, her life, and mostly her \\"miraculous beauty\\" seem to go from one extreme to another. She is a complex woman who has had to deal with difficult decisions throughout her life, and the burden of being barren and beautiful.Overall, it was an enjoyable read filled with detail and atmosphere. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy, but The Red Tent will always remain the epitome of Old Testament fiction in my mind.To see my opinion of the entire trilogy, view my review of Lilah."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I had read the Red Tent and loved it.This book didn't quite live up to that standard, but was interesting fiction nonetheless. I thought the writing a bit simplistic, however it seemed to fit the story.It's worth a read if you are interested in biblical fiction."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"While as entertaining as any \\"Romance\\" novel, Sarah becomes a \\"modern woman\\" in this fictionalized account of the story of Sarah and Abraham. If you like Romance Novels, you will like this adventure packed, sexually broad novel. In this version, however, the story of Sarah is pointless."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book was better than I expected it to be, but then again I was not expecting all that much. Like other reviewers have noted, this is not a factual read. It is what I like to call a \\"theological fantasy\\". Characters are based on real individuals and events albeit loosely at times. The story is told from Sarah's perspective and the male author does a very good job using the feminine voice. I'll be perfectly honest in letting you know that I did not even know that it was a male author until I had finished the book - I simply had not read the author bio nor had I noticed his picture on the book jacket. The only thing that I really did not like too much about this book was that the author -at times - made Sarah seem incredibly self centered and vain (bordering on conceited). Worth taking out of the library if you are interested theological fantasy."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I was a bit skeptical about whether I would enjoy a novel based on one of the characters of the Bible, but I was really moved by Sarah's story. The author, Marek Halter, beautifully recreates the world of the ancient people of Sumeria, including Sarah and her family. A beautiful young girl, Sarah panics and refuses to marry the man her father has chosen for her. A chance encounter leads her to Abraham, a young man from a tribe of nomads who sculpt the idols that Sarah's people worship. Although she is drawn to him, they do not consummate their relationship until several years later, when Abraham returns to Sumeria to find that the girl he once knew is now the high priestess of Ishtar and the most powerful woman in her society. But Sarah has a premonition, and feels called to leave her life of great luxury in Ishtar's temple and join Abraham and his tribe.Abraham claims that God speaks to him, although no one else can hear it, and little by little, his people come to believe his prophecies. Sarah, however, remains skeptical, and it is only after many years that God reveals himself to her as well, and brings her the same power and grace as her husband. She has many adventures along the way, including a marvelous episode with the Pharoah, which read like a great scene from a movie.This is a novel about an amazing woman, and it truly takes you back in time to the long-ago world that she lived in. It also gives you some clues to how and why our spiritual way of thinking came to be, although it's not a book about religion at all. This was a very thought-provoking read and an entertaining one as well, like watching a good epic mini-series with a female hero. I highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This is an interesting tale--I read through it slow and steady, never really that excited about it but a little curious. I actually bought the less clean version than the rest of the book club--which was embarressing! So be careful which one you get. This version is very, very sexual and graphic--which is just not needed because the story line itself is good."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"My personal preference is that the storyline would have more closely followed the biblical version, but I enjoyed this story. Sarah seemed to be, in some ways, portrayed much more selfish than I have always imagined her to be. It did stretch my imagination to see her in other ways. I'm not certain whether I would recommend to others or not..."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This is a beautifully written and rich account of the author's impression of the life of Sarai, the matriarch of the Nation of Israel.It begin's with her initiation at the age of twelve in the city of Ur, where she is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy nobleman ,after her 'first blood'. She is then given as a bride to a brutal Chaldean nobleman, and flees from his clutches, where she encounters Abram, a young and dashing man from a nomadic tribe near Ur. She is brought home by her father's guards in disgrace, and later takes herbs from a local witch, which destroys her fertility.She is ordained as a temple priestess before being rescued by Abram, and becomes his wife, journeying with him and his clan to Harran, in modern day Turkey, to Canaan (Israel), and a sojourn in Egypt.Her beauty does not fade after many years, but she is embittered by her failure to bare children.Later we are shown her closeness to her Egyptian handmaiden, Hagar, who she later shows jealousy towards, when Hagar gives birth to Ishmail.The novel introduces new elements such as the lust for Sarai of Abram's nephew Lot, and Sarai's dislike for Abram's servant, Eliezer of Damascus.The end, from Sarah's miraculous birth of Isaac, until her last days, is rather rushed.The nudity and erotica was tastefully done and I had no problem with it.As a believing Jew, I can forgive all of the departures from the Biblical narrative (of which there are many) as artistic license, except for the theme that Yahweh was only Abram's G-D and not Sarai's which left me feeling uncomfortable, because acknowledging that Sarai/Sarah was a great prophetess of Yahweh, would have added and not taken away from the narrative.I don't know why otherwise brilliantly written Biblical-based fiction, such as this novel, and Howard Fast's 'Moses Prince of Egypt' seem to deny the devout steadfastness of the early Hebrews to monotheism and the worship of Yahweh.This element is frustrating and somewhat spoils otherwise beautiful writing. It is possible to produce a beautiful, vibrant and rich novel, and fill in the gaps, without taking away from the basic accounts given of Biblical history."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book was wonderfull!! alot like the Red Tent style. I couldn't put this book down and was sad to see it end."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"\\"Sarah\\" was a good novel. I've read a few of Halter's other books, and he will never quite be to par with a \\"celebrated\\" author, but he writed a good novel. Sarah had a few anachronisms I did not care for. Halter tried to create ancient Canaan and Ur in his book, which came out ok. He needed to do a bit more historical research to bring me into an ancient city and envelop me in its culture. It's very easy to get through, and at many times, it was hard to put down. The narration held my attention well, but was not particularly captivating. We will never find a book as good as \\"The Red Tent\\", and this is definitly not one, but it is good, and unless you are a very discriminating reader, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Maybe because I finished reading Dorothy Dunnett's Lymond Chronicles just before reading \\"Sarah\\". The comparison between these two historical fiction writers is night and day. Dunnett is truly a historical writer. Halter is not. Halter has a finite list of words he (she?) employs, whilst Dunnett's is limitless and far more entertaining.I feel the author didn't develop the characters well (I couldn't ever really like Sarah and the author never adequately explained to my why Abraham loved her), paint a vivid historical picture for me or accomplish much with this story.Halter does not give the reader a good time frame. He uses phrases like \\"some time later\\". But does that mean some years, seasons, months, weeks, days, or hours? It bothered me that I could not tell what kind of time lapse was occuring.Don't bother spending your money on this book. It's not worth it. Check it out at the library if you feel you must read it."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Though I no longer consider myself a Christian, I've read quite a few biblical adaptations. Like Anita Diamant's The Red Tent and Orson Scott Card's Women of Genesis series. But this is a serious disappointment as well as an all-round bad novel. Give it a miss and don't worry about the others in the series either.It begins rather auspiciously, with Sarah being raised as a king's daughter in the city of Ur, then going on to become a priestess and running away to get married to Abram....yeah. It makes very little sense, particularly how Abram and his brother manage to get into the temple and steal away Sarai so she can get married and live outside the city with the dirt and filth of animals.But perhaps the most absurd thing about this novel is the way Sarah's inability to concieve is portrayed. It appears that Sarai made some sort of deal with God that she would remain young and beautiful but she would be unable to concieve. This has some rather strange consequences, such as when Abram walks around an old doddering man with a woman who appears young enough to be his great grandaughter. And there's also when Lot grows up and tries to make out with Aunt Sarah, who has been like a mother to him.This is taken to it's logical conclusion, sort of, when Sarah tells God that she would rather have children that be beautiful, and her youth falls away in what was probably meant to be a moving scene but instead was rather disgusting.Orson Scott Card does a much, much better job with Sarah in his novel, despite the fact of the apocraphal Morman text in the first chapters."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I love historical fiction about strong women. This book met my high standard. I was familiar with the biblical story of Sarah and was pleased to have a fictional picture of her in this book. Definately along the lines with \\" The Red Tent\\"."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Barbara Cartland writes The Red Tent. I would put this book in the romantic fiction genre rather than literary. The author attempts to wrap a bodice-ripper in the robes of the Bible in order to ride coat-tails of better written creative fiction based on Biblical characters. Use of sexual words are gratuitous and, even worse, fail at being stimulating. It's a nice story but not gripping. I loved The Red Tent, but did not finish this book."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Although the book \\"Sarah\\" and the other two books of the Canaan Trilogy are historical fiction, they are great. They suck you right into the times and certainly reveal much of the history of the ages in which Sarah, Zaphorra and Lilah lived. Tremendous reading."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"As with the other Marek Halter books, this one is a very quick and enjoyable story. You wont want to put it down."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I swear, i expected a lot more from this book. The blurb on the inside cover intrigued me, so i checked it out from the library.I'm not even going to get into the biblicial inaccuracies here. I'm more concerned with the fact that the store seems to center around Sarah's continued beauty despite the passage of time, almost like God takes her fertility, but lets her keep her beauty. Apparently it's so stunning that even her adopted son tries to force himself on her.The story was just flat. There was just not enough insight into Abraham and his belief in God, and Sarah's lack of faith in him(as the bible would have it). I did not feel for the character's. The character i did feel for was Hagar, being forced out after Isaac is born.Just not interesting."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Most people already know the tale, and it is hard to write down what has not already been said. But I will say:This is the story of Sarai, the daughter of a prominent lord of Ur. Betrothed to a man she does not know, Sarai flees. After she is returned home, she slathers on an herb that makes her forever sterile, and becomes a priestess of Ishtar. In time she meets her childhood \\"crush\\" and runs away with him. Our new \\"Sarah\\" shortly becomes alone, as Abram leaves to set out for a new land in the name of his God. The characters are anything but perfect, and more respectable because.I enjoyed this story, despite some of the reviews I had read. Perhaps it is not historically truthful to the tale of Abraham and Sarah, but then again, some people don't believe the Bible in the first place, so who really knows? It's interesting enough just to hear the experiences of these individual icons, and relive their fates and trials as lovers and confidants. This book was not hard to finish, nor hard to read. There is no \\"confusing\\" religious aspects or boring side stories. It is all straight and to the point: the creation of Christianity through the eyes of a doting beauty on her prolific husband. And it's done in such a way where you don't care if Abram's God prevails, or if they make believers of the Egyptians or Sumerians. You just want Sarah to be happy.And I really love the \\"complete distortion of facts\\" review. No one made you read this book, so don't act like it was written to personally offend you and your beliefs."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"A truly indulgent read for anyone interested in Biblical History (Fictional) from a feminine standpoint.The tale of Sarah; originally Sarai of Ur, begins when she is thrown into an arranged marriage; right after she is introduced to womanhood. A defiant and highly independant child, the thought of being handed over to a stranger by her Father terrifies her. Sarah sculpts her own destiny from there on and begins a bold journey into new lands with a new people and above all a new \\"One God\\". Sarah's story provoked a great deal of basic empathy from me, while keeping me up after my curfew to read just one more page :).I wished that the conclusion of the story hadn't been so rushed, after much detail and imagination went into the main body of the story, however it is a good excuse to read more.The strength of Marek's writing stirred something deep down inside me and has inspired me to investigate more books about the old ways, and how religions came to be in our world.A guaranteed inspirational read :)."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I hate the idea that really &quot;literary&quot; novels have to be hard to read, so I applaud Marek Halter and his publisher for bringing out a novel that's thoughtful and well-written and yet also entertaining and vivid. The heroine of this novel, Sarah, is the Sarah of the Old Testament, but she comes across not as a one-dimensional religious figure but as a bold, highly intelligent woman whose beauty is as much a curse as a blessing. Her relationship with Abraham and his family (whom she joins after leaving a life of great wealth in her home city) has the feeling of real family life, with all its conflicts, and while Sarah is not always perfect--she can be jealous, doubting, vain and despairing--you always empathize with her and keep rooting for her.This is a very good novel to share with female friends and discuss in book groups. If you're into the Bible, you'll enjoy reading an expanded and vivid version of the story of this great matriarch. If you're a secular reader, this book is just as entertainig as any finely written historical novel, with an unusually exotic setting and compelling characters."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Anyone expecting to find the biblical Sarah in this novel or even the imaginative elaborations that the rabbis placed in Midrashim, will be disappointed, because everything about Sarah in this tale are not in these documents. This does not hurt the Halter version in any way. His notion of Sarah's personality and how she may have lived and acted is interesting.We are introduced to Sarah, or actually Sarai, as she was known in her youth, for the first time in the Bible when Scripture says that her husband Abraham, called Abram at the time, began a journey toward the land that God would show him, which later turned out to be Canaan, now called Israel. The Bible says that he took his wife Sarai with him, but nothing more is told about her at this time. The rabbis debate exactly when the event occurred, but virtually all agree that it was when Abram was 70 or 75 years old. This would make Sarai, who the Bible states was ten years his junior, 60 or 65. The first incident when Sarai is described is when the Bible states that she was barren and she gave her husband her maid Hagar so that he could have a child through her. Traditional chronology places this event when Sarai was about 75 years old.Halter begins his tale when Sarai first began to menstruate, when she was twelve, when her father decides to have her married. Sarai does not want to marry the man her father chose. Halter introduces Abram during the same year, and there is love at first sight. Sarai's father and brother make sure that Sarai will not marry Abram and she is forced to become a dancing pagan priestess for some years. Abram returns, helps her escape, and takes her as his wife.Halter describes Sarai as a strong willed woman. Her relationship with Abram is ideal, although she does not think that God is speaking to him and uses an idol. The couple has marital difficulties when she gives her maid Hagar to Abram.Halter's rewriting the biblical tale of the near sacrifice of their son Isaac is also interesting. According to Scripture, Sarah, as she was then called, did not know that Abraham was taking Isaac to sacrifice him to God, and an angel stopped him from doing so. Halter writes that Sarah saw her husband leaving their tent with Isaac, figured out what he was up to, followed them unobserved from a distance, and she, not an angel, stopped her husband from killing their son."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I really enjoyed Sarah for the majority of the book, but I am surprised at the people who call her a heroine or a \\"partner\\" to Abraham. In this story, the character of Abraham continually uses his wife to serve himself and his own purposes. Toward the end, he never acknowledges her agony or struggle as being brought on by her love for him in the first place. I felt the story was incomplete and didn't do justice to her struggle."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Biblical fiction doesn't get much better than this engrossing tale of Sarah, the wife of Abraham and the mother of the Israelite nation. For people of many faiths, Sarah is a tantalizing figure, and Marek Halter brings her vividly to life in this colorful portrait.As with Anita Diamant's THE RED TENT, Halter uses the image of menstruation or \\"bridal blood\\" as the axis around which the story revolves. After a brief prologue, the story opens as Sarai (her name before God changed it to Sarah) wakes to find she has begun menstruating. Although prepared for it by her relatives, Sarai despairs because in her home culture of Ur, a girl becomes a bride after her first period.On her wedding night, sensing that her prospective bridegroom is wildly attractive yet desperately cruel, she flees the festivities to the outskirts of town. Muddy and disheveled, she meets the young Abram (later renamed Abraham), with whom she finds an instant chemistry. Discovered, Sarai returns in disgrace to her father's house for several months. Fearing becoming betrothed again, she resorts to the herbs of a local witch, dosing herself and becoming infertile. Since she no longer menstruates, she is chosen to become a high priestess. Blood continues to be a motif through the endless sacrifices made to the gods of Ur.Several years later Abram returns and Sarai escapes again, this time to marry him. Abram, interestingly portrayed as a partner with his family in making household gods, hears a voice from \\"The One God\\" that calls him to begin a journey of whose end he is unsure. With him is his nephew, the orphaned Lot, who develops a rather incestuous, unhealthy fascination with his foster-mother Sarai (a good illustration of Halter liberally adapting the biblical story to provide more intrigue).In a time when women were valued for the number of sons they could produce, Sarai mourns her infertility, but Abram assures her of his love. Strangely, as Sarai ages, her beauty remains unmarred by the passage of time. This is a rather spooky and fantastic addition to the story by Halter: \\"The weight of this silent miracle, though at first it delighted her, was beginning to terrify Sarai herself.\\" Her beauty leads to a plot development straight out of the biblical text, when the couple and their entourage pass through Egypt, and Abraham, fearing for his life, passes Sarai off as his sister. In some steamy passages, Pharoah takes her to bed. She is returned to Abraham after Pharoah dreams that God wreaks havoc on him (another liberty with the scriptural text) and relationships between Abram and Sarai are strained for some time afterwards.Abram's eventual desire for a child culminates in several tense plot developments that readers familiar with the Old Testament account will recognize. Blood continues to be a motif throughout the book, culminating in the tense scene where Abraham takes their only son Isaac to sacrifice him to God. Sarai, now Sarah, observing the scene, pleads with God for her son's life --- and Abraham stays his hand.Halter writes good descriptions of the time, including food, geographic settings, and the various clothing worn by the characters. Unlike many more conservative biblical novels (think the wonderfully nuanced portrayals by Francine Rivers's \\"Lineage of Grace\\" series), Halter is frank in his depictions of the sexual attraction between the two, and in his portrayals of sex between various characters throughout the book.This is the first book in The Canaan Trilogy, exploring the lives of biblical women through fiction (the second, ZIPPORAH, looks at the little-known life of the wife of Moses). Book groups will welcome the reading group guide, included at the end.--- Reviewed by Cindy Crosby.

If I had read this story thinking of it only as fiction, it would have been better than reconciling this book with the known work in Genesis. The writing was choppy and knowing how much the author had to fill in, I just could not enjoy it as biblical fiction.I also felt that the more prurient parts of the tale turned the sacred into the profane or secular. I didn't take anything away from this book other than some knowledge of the culture in Ur (and some irritation!)."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I read this book and found it exceptional. It has an interesting perspective on the Biblical truths of the story of Sarah and her husband. I definitely reccomend this book!!"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This is a wonderfully written book that gave me a whole new perspective of Sarah. Rather than seeing her via Abraham, as we do in the bible and in various other retellings, Halter gives us Sarah's perspective. Through Sarah's eyes we delve deeper into a possible truth about the biblical times in a way few other authors have dared to attempt. I highly recommend this book for its writing, daringness, creativity and theme."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This is an interesting, well-written book of fiction about Sarah and Abraham. I enjoyed its fast pace and the excellent descriptions of life at this time.Sarah is a fascinating figure born to great wealth, giving up all to marry Abraham. Her interactions with her family, especially brother and father are most meaningful.Focus on the positive and you'll enjoy this story. I look forward to the second book in the Canaan Trilogy, \\"Zipporah\\"."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"A very well written portrait of a rarely highlighted charactor from Genesis. The author did a great job of showing a fully human version of Sarah, and an interesting glimpse of life from this time period."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I am normally a fan of the Biblical Fiction books such as The Red Tent and The Queenmaker but Sarah did not live up to my expectations. Unlike the two books I previously mentioned, Marek Halters writing in Sarah was very choppy which made the story hard to follow. He would skip years at a time between major events in her life, which left me confused and wondering what happened to get us from point A to point B. There are so many good Biblical Fiction books out there, don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"When I picked up this book, I was looking forward to peering more into the personality of Sarah as I had in some of Francine Rivers books and the characters of the bible she wrote of. I had pick up this one and the other 2 of the Canaan Trilogy to read during my recovery from surgery. As I started to read this I thought maybe the author had done some research on the life of Sarah, since I was only familiar with her life after being married to Abraham, and was astonished at his writings of her life as a child. I decided to continue with the book to allow the author to show what he truly knew about scripture and was thankful that I had studied Genesis myself. All I can say is that this is truly a Fiction book and read actual fact on the truth of Abram and Sarai in the Scriptures. Although the author told accounts from the bible and he did show that Abraham did truly love the Lord, there is a lot of things that are twisted in this book. I returned the other 2 books of the series without reading."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I don't think Marek Halter ever looked at the Bible. (See below for truly great novels on Bible Characters.) He certainly is confused about Sarah. The book starts out with Sarah finding out she is bleeding for the first time and disgusted. Later in the book, Lot (Abraham's nephew ) makes a pass at her (when she is 60 years old)! What a disgrace this book is. It was disgusting and portrays porn scenes almost from the beginning. Recommendation: Read \\"Sarah\\" \\"Rebekah\\" & \\"Rachael & Leah\\" in the \\"Women of Genesis\\" series written by Orson Scott Card. Also read \\"Gods & Kings\\" by Lynn. N. Austin. This is the first book in her series called 'Chronicles of the Kings\\" - You will be so blessed by these 5 books. All Lynn Austin's books are truly a blessing and deeply engrossing."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I find books like \\"Sarah\\" to be disappointing. When you finish it, you put it down thinking, \\"That did not enlighten me at all about the true story.\\" The story of Sarah and Abraham is very true yet Halter's version left much to be desired. The author took way too much liberty with the story. For example, until she meets Abram, Sarai is a priestess of a pagan nation. While the possibility of this is present, it's a story-line plot that is highly unbelievable. I hope no one reading this takes it for fact.Quite adult nature in content. In some places its a page turner, but I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book. It's truely fiction and overall probably a waste of time."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"The cover is attractive.

And that is indeed the way it is written in the Bible!"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. As soon as Abram found 'religion,' he and Sarai were characterized as completely mentally unstable. To me it made Abram someone who hears voices in his head and Sarah's fate witchery."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book is a very interesting insight into one-person's imagination of how life could have been for Sarah and other women of that time. The author is well-versed and knowledgeable in the subject so it turned out well. It is mainly written for clean fiction reading.If you want historical fact about Sarah and Abraham, read the Bible. The first five books were written by Moses thousands of years ago (Yes, Moses wrote the first five books. He enjoyed the finest education while he was a Prince, a Pharoah's son.) and are historically accurate, as many archaeologists will tell you. Many of them, digging up ruins to prove the Bible wrong, have themselves been proven wrong and have long since become believers in God and converted to Christianity.

The front cover inside is showing the bindings and the front and back cover just show grey cardboard not a very finished product. The read is/was excellent I would recommend it highly"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I so much enjoyed &quot;Sarah&quot; that I read it in twenty-four hours. The day before I read the &quot;Red Tent&quot;. If you are searching for a historically accurate portrayal of the story of Sarah and Abraham you won't find it here. What you will find is an entertaining historical novel focusing on the women in biblical times. The male author does a really good job (contrary to one reviewers opinion) of writing in a famale voice. I felt he understood the trials and tribulations of women at that time very well. This book is about Sarah so to say it would have been better if it had been written about another character is ludicrous. The ongoing debate between reviewers about the relationship between Sarah and Abraham is also ludicrous given that there is no way to know exactly if they were related or not. The Bible is filled with historical inaccuracies and exaggerations as it was written by men who had an agenda of their very own to protect. The point I'm trying to make here is that this is a fictionalized version of the story of Sarah and Abraham. It is enjoyable, fast paced and gives an overview of life at that time. If you are looking for biblical truths you won't find it here and no amount of arguing will change that."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I really enjoyed this novel--it's not only entertaining as an afternoon read, it gives the reader a lot to think about without ever being didactic.Ignore the reviewers who argue over whether Sarah was Abraham's sister (they had a child together, so I'm guessing that unless the Bible sanctions incest, they were not. And honestly people, did you even bother to READ the book?)This is a very well-written book that takes a look at the life and times of an influential woman, without ever losing sight of her essential humanity and the beauty of her spirit. Sarah's constant wrangling with God's will and with whether or not to believe in an invisible God speaks a great deal to what all of us deal with in our own lives, even if we don't go to church or synagogue regularly. It's also a terrific love story between a very intelligent, mystical, headstrong man, Abraham, and his bold, intelligent, practical wife, Sarah. I am glad to see a book that celebrates the love a man can have for a woman who is not only beautiful, but who challenges his worldviews and acts as a total partner with him in his journey to find God. I highly recomment this book to anyone who likes a good novel, especially a historical one."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"There are so many \\"stories from the Bible\\" novels out there right now, and I have read most of them, but Sarah really stands out from the crowd, and while it's based in the Biblical story, it never hits you over the head with religious dogma.Sarah is really the story of the journey of Sarai from a pampered daughter of a rich lord to the wife of the nomadic prophet Abraham of the book of Genesis. She's known for her beauty, but is remarkably gutsy and intelligent, and acts as a full partner to the charismatic and determined Abraham. There's a wonderful love story to be found in these pages, the love of two bold and adventurous people who risk everything for each other and for what they believe in.The descriptions in this book are marvellous, from the opening pages in the great Babylonian city of Ur to the palaces of the Pharaoah and the wide open fields of Canaan. The author has a talent for bringing places and people to life without loading down his work with lots of adjectives and flights of fancy--all the images are vivid and real, and it makes for a great \\"curl up and enjoy\\" kind of read."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book cover caught my eye and the quote on the cover comparing it to The Red Tent convinced me to buy it. I too read this book in 24 hours, not because it was engrossing but because it seemed to lack substance and depth. The problem has nothing to do with the fact that it was biblically inaccurate; The Red Tent was not very accurate either starting with the Leah character whose eyes, according to the old testament, were her best feature, not an abomination. It was the fact that the plot focused almost entirely on Sarai's beauty and her lamentations of all the hardships it cost her. The plot was very underdeveloped and full of holes. The Sarai character came across as incredibly vain and was not very endearing. There were also not a lot of details about the setting. There was a lot of mention of various gods but not a lot a lot about the culture it seemed. What I liked most about The Red Tent was the lush detail and the sense of a world come alive. All the small things from the preparation of meals to the varying tasted of the different kinds of beer served to the men really drew you into the story. It elicited an emotional response from me where as Sarah did not. If I had not read The Red Tent a couple times before I read Sarah maybe I would have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, this book came across more as a fluffy romance novel than a piece of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the read of \\"Sarah\\" by Marek Halter. Based on the Bible story of Abraham, who through the miracle of God's voice, led the Hebrews through years of wandering the desert and the trials and tribulations they faced. This novel is told though not through the eyes of Abraham, but through the eyes of his wife Sarai(Sarah), who's inner strength and powerful wisdom may have been the inspiration of countless generations to follow.In days of long ago, in times of wondrous miracles, and beliefs in pleasing the Gods, and when women were not treated as highly as men, Sarai, the daughter of a wealthy man was destined to marry the man picked for her by her father. At only 12, she was the apple of her father's eye for the beauty she was. But there was more to Sarai then just her beauty. After being subjected to a humiliating bathing ritual, in front of her intended husband, Sarai, perhaps the first to defy her father runs off to the town below her luxurious home, and meets Abram, a man who in class is below the standards set by Sarai's family,but one who will dominate her thoughts for years to come. She also drinks a potion that will make her barren and unwanted by the man her father has chosen.Years later, she has grown into a woman of unmatched beauty and considered a High Priestess. One that has power to bless the men going off to war. Once again Abram comes into her life, and she leaves her people to share a life with him. A life of wandering and miracles.The story follows the lives of Sarah and Abraham(names God has given them),their great love for each other and others such as Lot , Eliezer and Hagar. How Abraham's followers put their complete faith in him even through the toughest of times. And Sarah although a tower of strength and miracle of nature(with beauty never fading), Halter gives her a very human side as well, sometimes with anger or jealousy. Her journeys take her from riches to rags to riches and back again.The book is a fast and enjoyable read. Sarah's story was that of a woman to lead and to be admired. I thought there were many instances that although took place and were specific to ancient times, could be made into a story for modern times. Times change, but people are people. It(paperback edition) also has a Q & A with the Author, and a guide for group discussion. This book is the first of a trilogy of novels based on women from the bible, followed by \\"Zipporah\\", and \\"Lilah\\". After reading this one, I'll say that although based on stories from the Bible, these are no Sunday School lessons. The material is quite adult, akin to a romance novel. Also included in the book is a nice map to follow the long journeys.Enjoy the read.....Lauriealso recommended:ECHOESSemele: A NovelEthan Frome"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Marek Halter's SARAH is already a bestseller in France and has been translated into ten languages. The debut of SARAH in the United States will lend credence to Halter's sensitive treatment of women in the Bible. His plans for the two subsequent books in the trilogy are the stories of Zipporah and Lilah, lesser known than Sarah, wife of Abraham, but with tremendous impact on the shaping of society.SARAH is the story of civilization's first rebellious teenager who became one of the world's most powerful women. An interview with the author reveals that he sees his women as those \\"beside,\\" not \\"behind\\" great men. The book emphasizes Sarah's working side by side with Abraham to create a life filled with his religious beliefs. Sarah was not a believer in Abraham's God until late, after her early mistakes came back to haunt her unfulfilled life.SARAH begins in the region now known as Iraq, the cradle of history, between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. The region was then known as Sumeria and the city-state where Sarai lived was known as Ur. She is the daughter of a powerful lord of Ur, a beautiful child who comes to womanhood in the first chapter. Her father arranges a marriage with a suitable man when she is twelve years old. The young girl is terrified of the prospects of the marriage bed and flees. Overnight, she runs from safety in the walled city to unknown terrors beyond it. On a riverbank she meets Abram, a poor but exotic member of a nomadic tribe. She spends the night with him and longs for his kiss. But soldiers discover her in the morning and return her to her father's house.Halter has a unique way of entering his heroine's mindset and allowing the reader to see and feel the turmoil swimming in her head. Sarai's beauty is the quality that sets her apart from other women and allows her to once again return to family's favor. But her fate rests solely with her father. He again arranges a marriage, not as opulent with preparation as the first. Sarai is terrified. She cannot erase the memory of her night with the young nomad, Abram. Terrified, she sneaks away, buys a powerful potion from a witch and drinks it. She has made herself barren, unfit to wed. She becomes the powerful priestess of the god, Ishtar, idolized by residents of the entire city. During this period she meets Abram for the second time and follows her heart to remain with him.The Bible has inspired Halter with stories of its feminine heroines. He feels that women were at times the true founders of world history. He takes liberty with Sarai's life, introducing stories about her that cannot be documented. But the sensual, exotic role she plays in Abram's story is one of both support and leadership. Aloof at times, her beauty both enhances and betrays her power in her newfound home. She has qualities that all humankind possesses: tenderness, love, jealousy, self-loathing, self-servitude, kindness and leadership. Sarai becomes Sarah, in final recognition of her husband's one God.SARAH is the story of a modern woman, one who learns and profits from her mistakes. From her experiences, she is able to lend strength to the others in her care. This is a story of desire, intense emotion and consequences of sins committed to justify those feelings. I look forward to reading the second and third books in the Canaan Trilogy. Halter's message is one of hope for future generations through reflections upon a rich past.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I was so disappointed by this book. I read a review somewhere that said if you liked the Red Tent you will love Sarah. I cannot disagree more. The book was just flat. The characters were not well developed and the plot dragged. There was so much made of Sarah's beauty it was daunting to get through the chapters. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I read the book last night in about four hours. It was well-written enough that I wanted to see what happened next, and after finishing Lawrence's Women in Love, this was a welcome break.It's a quick and entertaining read, but do not expect it to bring anything new to the table. This type of story has been written many times before in historical fiction, both biblical and general, including perhaps most famously The Red Tent. Also, you might be interested in reading James Michener's The Source since that book addresses the changing religions and their development in the same general area.There was much more time and detail focused on Sarai's childhood, and early adulthood. It is not until about halfway through the novel that Abram leaves his father's tribe, and starts his wanderings westward. Their actual marriage could have been developed a bit more, since they don't actually seem to interact that much as a couple outside of sex (for example, in the later parts of the novel, Abram and Sarai go for long periods without speaking).That said, as long as it is only seen as a quick,easy, fun read, the novel delivers and satisfies."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"The story was good, but I think the English translation leaves much to be desired. The wording is very simple at times, and the descriptions are just not that imaginative. I found some glaring typos in the paperback edition. Furthermore, (I'm nit-picking a little, I know) \\"the small of her back\\" was way overused, and the phrase has lost all of its romantic power for me now.Like I said, the story was good, but I was expecting (as mentioned on the cover) that this book would be similar to the Red Tent (which I loved). Plain and simple: There are similarities between the two books, but Sarah doesn't have the same language and descriptions."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"While I do agree with the fellow reviewer who found this book hard to finish, I feel as though I should point out one thing. It is fiction written for fictions sake. I highly enjoyed The Red Tent but found The Gilded Chamber boring. With Sarah I just didn't enjoy the writing style. Fiction should be for story telling, if you want fact go for a biblical studies book. Personaly I just want a well told tale, but did not find it in this book. Seemed choppy and hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Sarai was born to one of the great lords of Ur. Hers was a life filled with wealth and beauty until the fateful day when she became a woman. Suddenly, she was expected to marry a man she'd never met and serve him as a virtual slave, his every whim her command. It was not to be borne!Sarai flees her father's house and plunges into the countryside, where she stumbles across Abram, a simple man to whom she is strangely drawn. Although Sarai is caught and returned to her father, she takes a concoction rendering her barren. Her unique states propels her life along a different course and she becomes a priestess of Ishtar, Ur's goddess of war.Once more, Abram enters her life and Sarai joins Abram at last, becoming his wife. Although the young couple seems happy enough, Sarai remains barren and no child is born to them. Sarai offers Abram her handmaid, Hagar, to give him the son he so desperately wants. A quarrel eventually breaks out between the two women, as they compete for position in Abram's world.Told from the point of view of Sarai herself, this book is a unique glimpse into what life in Biblical times might have been like. At times, the story is raw and brutally realistic and at others, Halter's words create visions of inspiration for the faithful. Well written with great characterizations."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"The book read well however I felt it was too fictional. I love historical novels and read them all the time. I felt that the author took too much creative license.It would have been nice to see some afterward regarding what could and could not be historical.

The writer takes lots of license in his story line, incorporating Biblical history only enough to make it relevant. A lot of Sarah's background is assumed-which is expected somewhat because the Bible does not spell out a lot-but key facts are left out..such as the fact the the Bible says Sarah and Abram were half-siblings.It's an easy read, containing more sexuality than might be desired, but it keeps your attention. Book one of a trilogy. I hope the other two have more facts in them."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I wish I could give SARAH 3 and 1/2 stars.It has a promising start, good middle, and a bad ending. It's too rushed.The author does a good job \\"recreating\\" Sarah. She is a complicated, real, well thought out character. Abraham, on the other hand, is not a likeable at ALL. I thought he seemed like a real jerk. But the depiction of him seems real, and despite his self centered jerkiness, it makes for interesting biblical fiction, but I can see how this might turn off some readers.The book is somewhat comparable to THE RED TENT. Though THE RED TENT is sooooooo much better. If you loved THE RED TENT, you will find SARAH only a wee bit satisying."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book is a great piece of historical fiction. Some reviewers seem concerned about possible historical inaccuracies, but historical fiction is just that - fiction! The author did a great job of telling his interpretation of the story behind the woman in the Bible. I found it entertaining, heart-wrenching, and very real. Side note: as a Christian, I wasn't offended by way the author treated the Biblical story of Sarah. There's a lot we don't know about Sarah from the Bible, so his story is as good as any other as far as I'm concerned. But I would echo some of the reader's concerns about some graphic passages in the book; the sexual nature of some of the chapters makes this book inappropriate for young readers and may offend some Christian readers."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This was a great woman perspective. I was amazed to find out that the author was a man. I really enjoyed Sarah's version."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This is the first historical / bibilical novel I have read in awhile. I think the last one that I really read was \\"The Red Tent\\" by Anita Diamante about Dinah and I had loved that one novel so much that I actually dug up a copy of the bible to find that one small passage where Dinah is mentioned.This book was similar to that one in so many ways. Sarah (Sarai) is quite a major character in the Old Testament but is portrayed as quite a shallow character. This novel by Marek Halter takes a little artistic licensing and delves into her character. We see a probable history of her life in Ur, an account of her decisions, the hows and whys she did things the way that we see her doing them in the Bible.Mr. Halter fills in the gaps in her life with rich period details and made me empathize completely with the character I used to feel apathetic about. After all, most of us probably only remember the bad things about Sarah: sleeping with Pharaoh, casting off her handmaid Hagar, and doubting Abraham and God when he tells her she will finally have a son. Yes those things happened in the Bible but like so much else in life there is always a reason and most people don't set out to do wrong intentionally.This is an excellent book for those who want to dig a little deeper in the Bible and that era."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"As aforementioned, this story is best if you suspend all disbelief.

Sarah falls passionately in love with him and shares her story of her life with the infamous Abraham and the birth of Isaac, the most wanted son.Halter did a fabulous job with this novel.

Though it begins before the story within the biblical witness it is a credible re-imagining of who she may have been and the reasons she lived as she did. In it we are able to glimpse a small piece of culture from that part of human history. I read this several years ago and am now reading it in a book club I have in a women's group at the church where I pastor."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Marek Halter's \\"Sarah\\" is based upon the well-known story of the wife of Abraham, father of both the Islam and Jewish races. Up until the very end of this novel, Halter succeeds in \\"fleshing\\" out the story of these two Qu'ran and Old Testament personages, bringing them to life along with that of their distinctly ancient Middle Eastern environment. Unfortunately he choses to frame his otherwise third person voice with a soliloquy spoken by Sarah herself in the beginning and ending of the novel which confuses the entire mood of the tale and makes the conclusion seem extremely rushed and almost trite.If only Halter had stuck to the pace and third person narrative. Instead, as the portion of Sarai's story begins to follow the more familiar Biblical story from Genesis, Halter uses Sarah as she awaits her death as a first person narrator looking back over what transpired with Hagar, Ishmael, and even Isaac with the quickening speed of a snowball gathering momentum on its way downhill. All this in just a few pages! In a real sense, Halter cheats the reader of all the emotions and nuances that this part of the story most definitely should include. He doesn't live up to his promise--he made his young Sarai too believable and then abandons her in the bullrushes. Perhaps after all the hard work he did in crafting the more detailed story of the younger Sarai, he realized that if he kept up his pace, his novel would be three times its size.Nonetheless, the novel without the narration of the older Sarah works very well. The alien idea of the Bride Blood is as compelling as the mysteries unfolded inThe Red Tent: A Noveland makes for a great starting point. In fact, the attractive cover of the book --a detail of an Orientalist oil by 19th century British painter William Clarke Wontner-- immediately conjures up a valid preview of the inner pages. The reader knows they are in for a treat-- more than a glimpse of the life of the young and beautiful Sarai, daughter of an opulent lord of Ur, living like a coveted treasure along the banks of the Euphrates River--one of the cradles of Western and Biblical tradition.Halter does not disappoint; his Sarai is a child of passion. When it comes time for her to marry a man her father specifically selects to compliment Sarai's status and beauty, she resists, frightened of becoming a woman. She flees the safety of her fine apartments to have the harsh reality of the world smack her in the face and onto the ground. A chance meeting with the nomad boy, Abram, just a few years older than herself shelters her from a night that could prove perilous to a young virgin and germinates a seed of love. Dragged back to her father by soldiers, she decides that there is only one option to keep her from the marriage bed of any man who isn't Abram.As the well-versed reader already anticipates Sarai's eventual fertility issues, he/she will groan aloud and wish that there was some way in which Sarai's fate could be changed. Alas, what is written stands and Sarai becomes the handmaiden of the goddess Hathor--a woman renowned for her beauty and ripe albeit still virginal sensuality. When she happens upon Abram again, she knows what she wants and willfully goes about changing her fate despite her knowledge of her inability to conceive a child.Halter's Yahweh adds a somewhat unfinished paranormal element to an otherwise straightforward novel. Not actually a character, the God's presence endows Halter's Abram with a frenzied drive. Difficult to interject a supernatural being into the mix of real people with real passions, Halter falls into the trap of becoming merely a chronicler reciting events from the Bible. He make no effort to add a human nuance to this part of his saga, instead relying on \\"gospel\\" to add credence to what must then be looked at as a novel of faith. Sarai's infertility is underscored by her inability to age--a detail that adds interest and a sad melancholic dimension to her character that would work better if Halter had continued his detailed account.As he moves his narration into the final stretch, relating the Hebrews' encounter with Pharoah, the Hagar/Ishmael story and finally Isaac's birth and almost sacrifice, his voice parrots the Bible rather than builds on what he has already constructed as the passionate main character of Sarai. This results in a hurried conclusion that makes the reader wonder if an overeager editor just left most of the detail out or if Halter simply became bored.Bottom line? \\"Sarah\\" (the first novel in the Canaan trilogy) could have been a fantastic story filled with rich characters and enough drama to make any of today's popular soap operas seem lame in comparison. Sadly, author Marek Halter tires around four fifths into the book. When the getting should be good, Marek fails to deliver. Instead, he relies on a rushed retelling of the Bible's Sarah, Abraham and Isaac tale cut down to a scant number of pages that just don't do the rest of this book justice. Recommended anyway for its depiction of ancient customs and the fully nuanced character of the young Sarai.Diana Faillace Von Behren\\"reneofc\\""},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"very much worth the money. great read. it does put a different look in a lot of things. really did enjoy the author keeps you in the book"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"Since my name is Sarah, this book was given to me a few years ago. I just read it and absolutely thought it was brilliant. As a woman of the Word (Scripture) I was pleased to see the calling of Abraham and the choosing by God of a people was not lost in this exciting and very romantic novel. It was spiritually uplifting and beautifully written. Some similar Biblical novels tear down the fabric of the persons and events. Not so with Sarah. Zipporah is next. Thank you Mr. Halter."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This book was so adventurous that I could hardly put it down to move my household belongings 2.5 hours to my new house! Halter put a face and personality to Sarai(Sarah) that I had never thought of."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I read this book as a book club selection, and that's the only reason I bothered to finish it. This seems to be a \\"woman's book\\" written by a male author, and though that doesn't make it unique, in this book, I thought the author included many unnecessary, gratuitous details. The book was supposed to have been based on an Old Testament Bible story, and I have my doubts that the author stayed true to the Bible, either."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"This was a very entertaining read. I can appreciate the liberties the author took and his interpretation and mixing up certain events, but I thought he spent too much time on the speculated history of Sarai and what actual record we have of her life was glossed over except for the pharoah bit. If the Bible says the pharoah didn't sleep with Sarah, let's keep it that way. The most important details we have of Sarah from the bible are crammed into the epilogue (along with Soddom and Gomorrah, and Abraham's near sacrifice of Isaac) and the author spends too much time on her brooding and jealousy only to wrap it up with a quick \\"...and she got everything she wanted, the end.\\" Halter could have kept to the original story while doing Sarah justice and making an entertaining tale. I would also have liked to see Yahweh as a stronger character and not just a point of contention between Sarah and Abraham (which he undoubtedly was, but come on...if you want to tell a bible story, you can't make the central character of the whole book look like a figment of someone's imagination)."},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"I've read \\"The Red Tent\\" and \\"Apostle Paul\\" and loved both of those books. This is written in a similar vein. Those books and this are clearly fiction so criticism of the book's use of history to create a novel in unfounded. Until this week's outbreak of violence I had planned to visit Egypt this fall. Reading a book doesn't quite do it, but the descriptions of Abraham and Sarah's journeys through Egypt and the Holy Land make me even more convinced that I still want to visit there. The book is a literary trip through a land teeming with history and it's a love story to boot...isn't that what reading for enjoyment is all about?"},{"Title":"Sarah","review":"as much as i was looking up to reading this story, as much as i got disappointed at the display and untrue naration of the story of the prophet Ibrahim and the revelation of the message to him from Allah and his relationship with his wife not to mention how the book massively destructed and faked the true beloved and most sacred character of the prophet Ibrahim and his wife.the book showed a story with bended and untrue events of the story of the Prophet's life. it also portrayed a very weak, non-honorable and completely non-true and non- fit of a prophet. the descriptions were all on to the sexual relationships of sara and her beauty and the story was all on that which actually doesnt at all support the true very pure and innocent sara (wife of the prophet).this book has no aim but to distort the events of the story. it doesnt add any value to the person reading, it gave me pain actually because it lacked the truth and it lacked all the true factors that make a story well done.i dont recomment anyone read this story,,,, may Allah prevents such writers from writing things out of their own creations and imaginations and linking it to realistic stories and to realistic people who are too moral, and too inspiring as leaders to be followed.May Allah be with us"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #2: The Long Way Home Part Two (Variant Cover, Dark Horse Comics)","review":"Warning: Thar be spoilers ahead!Remember each week those exciting words (which alerted us that we were about to get a new exciting episode of the best show on TV)? \\"Previously on BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER . . . \\" The new comic series seems to be doing something along these same lines. On the inside of the outer cover are printed the following:\\"This story takes place after the end of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER Season Seven.\\"The Slayer population of the world has gone from two to nearly two thousand. Almost five hundred are working around the world with Buffy's organization in squads--or \\"terrorist cells,\\" according to the American military. Buffy, Xander, Dawn, and a passel of Slayers are currently bunked out in a Scottish castle, where the latest mission revealed a strange symbol carved into human bodies.\\"Also, Dawn's a giant.\\"This may be a summary that is rewritten each month to reflect what has happened in the previous issues.The first episode in Season Eight established the situation; this one begins moving the story forward. The U.S. military (or rather, a military leader who has on his chest the strange symbol referred to in the monthly summary) has authorized Amy the witch and her army of zombies to go after Buffy and her cohorts. After the story begins with three very different approaches to training the new slayers by first Giles, then Buffy, and finally Andrew (who actually couldn't be said to be training them at all) we find Xander explaining why Dawn took the form of a giant when it was possible she could have assumed other forms instead (obviously, she is trying to get her sister's attention in the most blatant manner possible). The catch is, does Xander really tell any of this to Buffy or is it all just part of what we later learn is a spell-induced sleep in which she experiences an unbroken nightmare. And in a fairy-tale twist she can only be awakened by the kiss of true love. We can, of course, imagine a line of possible candidates for that: Angel and Spike fighting to be first in line. Well, of course Buffy will be awakened, and sooner rather than later. Can't imagine her being asleep at the end of the next episode. The tricky part is how one defines \\"true love.\\" That needn't mean romantic love. My gut tells me that the kiss won't come from any of the usual suspects. My money is on Dawn. Yeah, I know. No one likes Dawn. But the brute fact is that except for struggling to save her in Season Five, Buffy has been a truly awful sister. Not in a Cinderella step sisterly way, but in the completely neglectful, can't-spare-her-a-minute way. But early in Season Six, Dawn seemed to miss her more than anyone. Like I said, my money is on Dawn.The issues ends with Buffy asleep, the castle under assault by hundreds of zombies they can't keep at bay, Amy gloating that she could handle slayers with ease, so there was no one there who could take her on. The final frame is of someone who says that they would \\"like to test that theory.\\" And thus Willow makes her first appearance in the story.I am going to say something that I don't think I can say often enough. I don't want Joss Whedon writing comics. I want him creating new television shows. I suspect he enjoys the control that a comic gives him. I am sure he is tired of battling studios and networks. I can understand that. But once the battles have been waged and the BS has been waded through, Joss Whedon has been able to create some of the most extraordinary, most timeless television that has ever been made. He needs to get back to it. That being said, I am so much happier with him doing BUFFY Season Eight than either his X-Men project or the Runaways (and mind you, I like both the X-Men and the Runaways). There are others who can tell further stories about the X-Men and the Runaways, but Joss Whedon is only one who can give us authoritative Buffy stories. So I am acquiring these with joy and my heart and impatience in my soul. But I want him back in television. We've had some great TV since BUFFY and ANGEL left the air. LOST, 24, VERONICA MARS, and especially BATTLESTAR GALACTICA have filled the huge gap BUFFY left at its departure. But LOST needs to start winding down (whether it will has to be seen), BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (the only show to completely match the brilliance that was BUFFY) has possibly only one more season left and at most two before Ron Moore brings his series to an end. 24 is definitely in decline. VERONICA MARS might be cancelled. In short, JOSS! WE NEED YOU TO COME BACK TO TELEVISION! But in the meantime, I'll wolf down every one of these issues."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #2: The Long Way Home Part Two (Variant Cover, Dark Horse Comics)","review":"Buffy fans will be expecting a lot after seven stellar seasons on television and the success of the first issue of \\"Season Eight.\\" So the question here is this: Does Issue #2 deliver?In short, yes.

When it comes to comics, you'll either buy them or you won't. Generally, they are more expensive because fewer of them were produced than say the original cover.That said, these Buffy covers aka the variants, usually only cost $1-2 more than the regular cover (if that) depending of course how old the variants is and when it first came out. So this one, the #2 variant can go as high as $10 (ungraded by the CGC that is) yet the newer ones cost the same as the regular cover ($3).What I don't yet understand is this, if Buffy season 8 is doing better sales than Angel season 6 (After the Fall) why do the Angel variant covers cost so much more?

What's the difficultym just have someone kiss her who's in love with her! A real curse would have been that she couldn't wake until someone who *despised* her was persuaded to kiss her. They covered this thoroughly in Fairy Tales 1.02.I also wonder why Andrew, our wonderful Andrew, is still stuck in his supernumerary job training potential slayers, as if any slayer worth her salt wouldn't rebel on learning she was expected to take classes from a twit, I wonder why Andrew's monologue about EMPIRE STRIKES BACK has him referring to \\"Billy D.\\"--evidently some sort of sassy Andrew shorthand for \\"Billy Dee\\" (Williams, as Lando Calrissian), but why represent the two spoken words Billy Dee as Billy D.?

Benjie had smoked some marijuana with a friend and thought it was cool, but then one day he cuts class and is hanging out with a group of older boys who are using heroin. Not wanting to seem like a scared little kid, Benjie does it, too. Before long, he is a heroin addict, although he insists he can stop whenever he wants.This story is told from many points of view--Benjie keeps insisting he's fine and complaining about everyone else around him. Benjie's family is overwhelmed by his addiction, especially when he steals from them. Benjie's friend is upset by the loss of his friendship, and one of his drug dealers feels compelled to explain why he is not at fault for Benjie's addiction. Two of Benjie's teachers, a white man and a black man, are both upset but argue over the right thing to do. In the end, the decision about whether to try to kick the drug habit is Benjie's alone. But is a thirteen-year-old kid strong enough to do what's right?I liked being able to see the different points of view in this story, and to see how one person's drug addiction affected everyone around him. I also liked that there were no easy answers and no real good guys and bad guys. Even the two teachers who had so much conflict between them each had their reasons for what they were doing.I found the writing itself distracting. The story was written with accents and slang that disrupted the flow.

He's so stubborn that he keeps on denying that he don't get hooked on drugs. After all, he quits drugs because his stepfather saved him.

Their talk revolves around 13-year-old Benjy, but they end up talking about life in general. Their neighborhood has crumbled, their municipal (and religious) leaders are mired in corruption, and business has stagnated. Life seems hopeless, but I find that the only one who tries to keep his head up is the stepfather. He's the smartest one in the book. He desperately wants to send his stepson to live on a farm, away from all the bad influences of the city.The end of the book has a tirade from the stepfather that I think is a must-read for kids. A White social worker says that the boy needs some good heroes to look up to.

Thirteen-year-old Benjie is like a lot of ghetto children: he's black, he's poor, he hasn't got a father, and he's heavily using heroin. Oh, he's not addicted. He can stop anytime he wants. But his mother and her boyfriend are getting fed up because he's stealing all their stuff and selling it for drug money, and his friends have noticed a change in his behavior too. When the teachers see him stoned at school, they send him up for detoxification andtreatment.The story is told from several points of view: Benjie, his mother's boyfriend who wants to think of him as a son, two of his teachers who fight with each other but deeply care about their students, and his best friend who's concerned about him. The shift in viewpoints can be jarring. I think it's meant to show how heroin not only destroys the person who's on it, but the people around him/her too.I liked this book. While I couldn't identify with the characters and the dialect was somewhat difficult to read, I got a good picture of what was going on. I really liked Benjie's teacher Nigeria Greene.

Now, after going through it a second time my impressions of &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; have not changed. Joseph Finder captures the reader's attention with a daring jail brake from a South African Prison. If this novel was a chess game I would say this opening was to the point. I was hooked. Add a rather inventive plot concerning the revenge of an incredibly wealthy man by the destruction of a clandestine computer system which practically runs our planet, and this story picked up steam in a hurry. Where it did run into a snag was in the character of Sarah Cahill, the FBI agent that ultimately saves the day. Her character seems too weak and hardly at all a match for &quot;The Prince of Darkness&quot;. It would be nice if a female characters in Sarah's position could be portrayed as strong and confident. The fact that she is able to foil, perhaps the greatest professional terrorist of all time is a fluke at best. The ending of this novel ruined all the good work that had gone before. This one looks like it was made for television. The truth of the matter is that professional operatives are rarely stopped, and when they are, it is by law enforcement individuals that are equally as brilliant. Two evenly matched oponents in a real life game of chess, that is what makes novels in this genre work"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"It's unfortunate that this book is out of print-- I suppose that to some it might seem that the events of 9/11 have rendered this tale of a terrorist attack on NYC moot.Not so. Finder's story, set after the first attack on the WTC, is a bit spooky in how it manages to anticipate some of what did occur years later. Details about the world of terrorism and counter-terrorism that may have seemed merely nice detail work originally now have a special kind of resonance. For that reason alone, this book would be worth a look.But that's not all it has to offer. Finder combines the tech-savvy detail of Clancy with the personal drama and driving suspense of Ludlum. We get a whole cast of characters that are drawn well enough to engage us in the story without stopping the narrative push.Action, surprises, twists and a grippingly real premise-- the book manages to entertain and give you something to think about when it's over. A great read. I can only hope that the release of Finder's new novel Paranoia will fuel interest in his earlier works so that this sees print again, because it deserves to be out there."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This is the second book by this author I have read, and both have been very enjoyable. When an exiled US industralist decides he wants revenge on the people who ruined him there he hires the best terrorist he can find to do the work.&quot;the prince of darkness&quot; as he is known in the trade (by the few who know him at all) is an intelligent and totaly amoral character. On the law enforcemnt side in the US we have Sarah Cahill a former expert in terrorist actions in the FBI.This book it has to be said, is full of anagrams, but then I suspect that the world of law enforcemnt is full of them now - and being somewhat of a techno-thriller they go with the genre.One of the things I liked about this novel was that none of the main characters are invulernable. They are people with lives of their own in an extraordinary situation. Sarah is not as 'strong' as her terroist opponent - but that only makes her more believable.I'm looking forward to more books by this author, and if you like thrillers this book is worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Having read the very positive reviews of the book I expected a gripping thriller with a very imaginative plot and an author who has a deep understanding of the world he is writing about.But this is far from what one gets in this book. A very shallow cast of characters is welded into a story which becomes totally predictable after the first 20 pages. Perhaps the author should have talked to Mark Rich - the real-world commodities trader who fled to Switzerland to avoid a prison sentence for tax evasion in the US - before crafting the sinister Malcolm Dyson, who is longing for world economic destruction from his Geneva home and Zug offices, and get a real handle on the life of a fugitive. Or is this ridiculously exaggerated resemblance to living persons purely coincidental?All this would still be excusable if it were not for the author's obnoxious tendency to hide his further lack of understanding of suspense by introducing and explaining zillions of unnecessary acronyms used by the intelligence and finance community on every other page of the book. And to make matters of his pseudo-knowledge worse he also embarks - like a condescending schoolmaster - on a crash course in recent history by throwing in some side stories on the Oklahoma, the World Trade Center and the Lockerbie bombings and the hostage taking in the Grand Mosque in Mecca. Nevertheless, I now know that the &quot;...American Euro-Copter AS350B ASTAR [was] formerly known as the Aerospatiale ASTAR 350B...&quot; and that a &quot;...NOTAM is a Notice to Aviators and Mariners which delcares a certain area off-limits.&quot;As for only one of the numerous weak links in the story: It takes a high degree of ignorance of the financial community to imagine the CEO (&quot;...or chief executive officer&quot;) of one of the world's largest banks running around with SWIFT authenticator keys (which is - I suppose - what Finder alludes to when describing the &quot;Network&quot; and which is one of the very few widely used financial acronyms which the author does not mention in his book) and having these code keys snatched under his nose by a high class D&amp;S (&quot;...or dominance and submission&quot;) callgirl.In summary, this book can only be recommended to somebody who desperately wants to know what CBT and some other 250 acronyms mean. And reader beware: CBT - as explained on page 292 of the paperback version - does not stand for Chicago Board of Trade!"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"What's with the above reviews? Doesn't writing or story matter anymore? Details? Yes, this book's got details. No piece of information is too trivial for Finder. How can anyone slog through this tripe? Reading this book is like banging your head against the wall. International intrigue has never been so boring. The only suspense here involved skimming through the three-page chapters looking for ANYTHING of interest. Take a nap instead"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This book reads more like a bad documentary on terrorism than an interesting novel. The author's constant attempts to show how much factual information he has about &quot;secret information&quot; is distracting from the plot and appears only as a cheap sellout to make money.The plot was pedantic and the characters were cardboard. I would suggest avoiding this poor imitation of &quot;Day of the Jackal.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Very strong start, interesting idea. But the love interest was silly, the sex too graphic, the stupidity of the police/FBI unbelievable, and ultimately the story itself is disappointing. It was as if he created a great bad guy but didn't have a real reason for him to do what he did. Finder should have worked on the plot more, and left out a lot of the See How Much I Know? and See Where I've Been? information. He overdescribes almost everything. He's a good writer who needs more discipline."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This book started off great with an intriquing prison break and a demented vengeful James Bond type villian but veered off course quickly. The characters were uninteresting except for the ex-spy. The dialogue had the same voice. The prose was bland and the flow of the book was halted by arcane details. It seemed like a poor imitation of a Michael Critchon or Ludlum book - they were the masters at intreweaving facts and details with the story. The story was totally predictable and the major twist with the lead FBI character was hacky and unoriginal. The only fun part was that the book was written in 1996 and technology has changed so much since then. People talking about pagers, CD-Roms and Walkmans and a computer being so advanced because it has one whole gigabyte of memory was kind of funny."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Imagine a thriller set in New York City. It's a story about an impending terrorist attack on Wall Street. The cast of characters includes a chameleon-like terrorist-for-hire reminiscent of Frederick Forsyth's Jackal, a fugitive financier thirsting for revenge against the banker and the system that forced him to flee the U.S., a brilliant American investigator whose life is complicated by a jealous ex-husband and a precocious 8-year-old son, a prominent and wealthy banker with a taste for masochistic sex, and a crusty New York City police lieutenant who knows all the tricks ever tried.Now imagine this cast of characters acting out their roles a decade and a half ago, five years before 9/11 -- when the book was published. Given the tragic turn that history took in September 2001, you might suspect that The Zero Hour would come across as lame. It doesn't. In the skillful hands of Joseph Finder, for whom this was the third of what by now is a total of ten thrillers about espionage and business, The Zero Hour is compelling. In fact, it's fascinating to look back across a gap of just 15 years and realize how much our world has changed. Then, New York's Joint FBI/NYPD Terrorism Task Force was sorting through the disquieting lessons of the first World Trade Center attack and the Oklahoma City bombing.The Zero Hour tells the tale of a South African-born terrorist best known as Henrik Baumann or \\"The Prince of Darkness.\\" We never learn his birth name. Baumann has been sprung from a high-security prison near Cape Town to do a job for hire -- unquestionably, the biggest in his long, blood-streaked career and, necessarily, the last. As he moves ahead methodically to complete his assignment, Baumann eventually squares off against FBI Special Agent Sarah Cahill, who has been put in charge of the Joint Terrorism Task Force's operation to thwart his attack. To reveal more of the story would be cruel.This is a complexly plotted and highly satisfying novel of suspense. What elevates The Zero Hour out of the pack is the extraordinary technical detail that Finder weaves into the story, revealing a level of understanding of the practical side of his story that only very thorough research could produce.()"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Don't be fooled by Kindle publishing date. This book was written in 1996 and not nearly as good as the more recent novels by Joseph Finder."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"I personally love Joseph Finder novels - most are based around corporate business, but The Zero Hour is focused on terrorism...This novel was written pre 9/11 though there are some passages that reflect what occured on that dreadful day...Finder through his usual deep plot and deep character development shows that in the real world you cannot be open to strangers (even though you feel comfortable around - may not be who they think they are).In brief, this book is about a man who wants to get even.My favorite passage (which wraps up the novel beautifully) can be found on page 232:\\"Malcolm and Alexandria Dyson's marriage had long colled, but she had given birth to Pandora, and Pandora was Malcolm Dyson's whole world, the center of his life. He loved his daughter as much as any father had ever loved a daughter. He was obsessed with his Pandora; he could not talk about her without lighting up, without a smaile or a glow.\\"Malcolm Dyson was a paraplegic now who carried his anger around in his m otorized chair. Once he had lived for forturne; now he lived for revenge. I'll never walk again, he had once thundered at Lomas, but with Pandora gone, why in the world would I ever want to?\\"I love that passage...And I love how Finder writes so beautifully to the point where you as a reader feel compassion for the \\"evil\\" people . . .:) I loved this book and I know you will to! without a doubt this book deserved 5 stars!! * * * * *"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"The Zero Hour is the third in Finder's collection of four (to date) outstanding novels which, upon investigation, reveal some of the most enlightening political info and predictions of our time. His first book, Moscow Club, accurately predicted the Soviet coup just before its occurrence. His second, Extraordinary Powers, accurately predicted the exposure of a high ranking CIA mole. His third, Zero Hour, explains the pitiful security of the world's finance system (and thank God it hasnt come true yet!), and his latest High Crimes pre-dates by three years a remarkably similar tale as the one recently uncovered concerning former Senator Bob Kerrey's command in Vietnam. A truly informative and knowledgeable man with a knack for fantastic presentation, Finder's books are some of the finest around. Pick them up, and you won't ever want to put them down."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Very engaging and well written. Baumann is one of the best-written villains I've seen in a while: intelligent, cold, methodical and unemotional. The plot is clever, with the conspirators targeting the world's financial center, rather than relying on the tired old threat of &quot;mass destruction.&quot; Very detailed and well researched.I agree that the ending suffers a little slippage as villain and heroes get a little too verbose in the &quot;climax.&quot; And readers of suspense novels may recognize some plot contrivances early on. But these are minor faults in an otherwise very entertaining story. Looking forward to Finder's next offering."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Gripping and fast paced story with amazingly realistic presentation. Kept me turning page after page until early hours of the morning. A moderate understanding of computer terminoligy will help you appreciate this book best.

I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY READ IT, BUT I WAS GLAD TO FIND A BOOK BY FINDER HE HAD NOT READ."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"I know that the CIA and the FBI are always fighting like brothers, but you have to give a break to the FBI, for example:The Chief of Anti Terrorist department of the FBI knows that somewhere in the US is an african terrorist who escaped from jail in Africa, he (the FBI agent) knows that the terrorist is dangerous is armed and he knows that the FBI is chasing him, so the FBI agent saw a guy behind his car, he is alone and unarmed and say:\\"Hold your hands, FBI agent\\". What do you thing that happened to the FBI agent?After that, and knowing that the terrorist just killed an FBI agent, another FBI agent chase the terrorist alone, no back up, the terrorist enter to a chinese cafe and when go inside the FBI agent saw that the cafe is empty, so he asked a waitress: \\"Where is the restroom?\\" What do you thing that happened to this agent?Now, the star of the book, Sarah Cahill, she worked for the FBI, then she worked for the Anti Terrorist Forces of the FBI, she know something don't you think? She went to Central Park with his 8 years old kid and while her kid play base ball with another unknown kid she started to read, then when she finished she didn't see her kid and after 10 minutes or so she saw that four or five kids are knock him and then, in New York, in Central Park came a man from nowhere, save her kid and since then both are lovers, when that man appear to save the boy I knew who he was.At the end of the book, that is as worst as it can be the person who solve the case wasn't the FBI, was a police from the NYPD, please give some credit to the FBI.Now two big lies:First: If you want to track a telephone conversation from house to house you need at least 15 to 20 minutes, but if you want to track a call from a cellular phone with 30 seconds is enough.Second: In the book is written that if you want to destroy the World Trade Center you need an atomic bomb DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?Thinking better, if I were an FBI agent I will sue this book.Now the story of the book, here you will see how work the cellular phone, all the terrorist acts to the US since 1970 secret or not, and all the TOP secrets of the FBI. I don't know why the US want such agency, but thanks God that this book was written before 2001, because if were written after, in the book the FBI Agency would be closed."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Finder has a background in Government and Business that helps make this exciting thriller seem all the more plausible. It is also very interesting to read a novel about blowing up a building in New York that was written pre 9/11. At one point he writes that the only thing that could bring down the towers would be a nuke. Would that were only true. He creates a wonderful villian in Henrik Baumann, and keeps this novel a page turner. Not as good as the best Follett or DeMille, so I did not award this strong tome 5 stars. Nevertheless it is a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"Surprisingly good. Incredible ending"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This book was the second Finder I read and I have been amazed by both. Finder's thoroughness into the mind of the criminal is what helps to create the neccessary intensity of the novel.

The fast-paced action and the uniqueness of the scenario's create a book that is beyond worth reading; it should be on everyone's list."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This is the first of Finder's novels I've read and I must say, I'm hooked!

I was just finishing it as I heard of the bombing in Saudi Arabia and the Arizona militia arrests. I read most best-sellers in the &quot;suspense and thriller categories&quot;, and found Zero Hour to have much more substance than most.Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"This book is awful! It has a somewhat promising beginning where a government agent-cum-terrorist escapes from prison, aided by some nebulous multi-zillionaire. But interest wanes quickly when the reader is inundated with irrelevant details and descriptions about various gadgets and technologies, along with references to previous terrorist attacks, quasi-historical events, and an endless stream of superficial characters.The whole story could be written in a few pages. It's almost as if the author were paid by the word. Endless unnecessary details that have nothing to do with the plot or the character development. Virtually all characters except the two main ones are described with no depth, yet we get overwhelmed with trivial details, like whether or not they take cream in their coffee or wear polyester undershirts.We have the stereotype of the recently divorced single-mom detective. The recently retired ethnic detective. The jealous ex-husband. The overweight computer geek. The disgruntled millionaire. The extremely good-looking and brilliant former spy, now terrorist (descriptions of whom are borderline homoerotic). On and on and on ad nauseum.Another thing that griped me: the author uses the word \\"phlegmatic\\" numerous times. I suppose to show off what a word maven he is.I am surprised this book got so many good reviews. It [is bad]."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"I was looking for a story about assassins when I picked up this book. Its premise around a terrorist, sometime assassin, did not fit my interest but I could not put the book down.In this match of wills between the terrorist, Henrik Baumann, code name \\"Prince of Darkness\\" and FBI Agent Sarah Cahill and her task force is an engaging thriller. The author invites us into the minds of Baumann and the FBI task force. Contracted by a businessman seeking revenge on the United States, Baumann, a cold blooded killer, meticulously plans and executes a devastating attack on American soil. He leaves behind him a trail of bodies of those who get in the way, and the FBI is not immune. Agent Cahill, among others, will pay a steep price during the hunt.The author has a tendency to give information dumps to explain how things work from customs agents to bomb triggers. Sometimes those sections get cumbersome and slow down the story. Some of the \\"new\\" technology is actually dated as of this writing.Agent Cahill and the task force use intellect and vast resources in the race to close in on Baumann. The Prince of Darkness is aptly named as he uses murder and subterfuge as formidable weapons to finish the contract, and he has always completed contracts. The end game is thrilling, heart stopping, and satisfying.I plan to read more of this author's work."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"It's been some time since I've read a novel that really could give you chills.

You have prison breaks, terrorists, low down scummy business tycoons, the CIA, and a good smattering of Joe everyday cops. An interesting and exciting mix that keeps the book fast paced.

Maybe it was my anticipation that spoiled it. The beginning jailbreak was heart-stopping and thrilling - everything I've come to love about all of his other books. But then it quickly bogged down in endless and exhaustive details that slowed the pace to the point of distraction. It's almost as if the explanations ate up all of the words he could have used on character development. Sarah Cahill comes up short, in my estimation, of a well rounded character. She didn't seem quite strong enough to handle all that was thrown her way. And the minute she met Brian, who couldn't figure out that he was Baumann? And the acronyms were like too many jimmies on a cupcake...you know,the kind where you're crunching too much to enjoy the frosting. And annoying as they lodge in that space between your teeth.I've loved Mr. Finder's foray into corporate intrique...he is a master at this and so little is written, in his style, about the corporate world. I must have sold thousand of copies of Company Man, Paranoia, Power Play to friends that I insisted read his work. Sadly, I won't be referring them to The Zero Hour. But I hope Mr Finder dives back into the world of corporate intrique soon. I missed his signature wit in this book...couldn't find any breaks of wry humor.

ZERO HOUR was written in 1996 and while reading it I saw Finder's talent but also saw how far he has progressed in writing. His novels are so much better now. ZERO HOUR is still very good.A South African prisoner, Baumman, escapes from captivity with the help of a rich man named Malcom Dyson who wants to hire him. Dyson is living in Europe and holds an immense grudge against the United States. He hires Baumman to carry out a terrorist bombing that will destroy the financial infrastructure of the world. Sarah Cahill is a single mom and an FBI agent with bomb expertise. One of her informants is murdered and this informant has ties to a high ranking Wall Street banker. On Sarah's end, the pieces slowly fall into place that indicate a bomb attack might be coming. Baumman plans his attack very carefully, but makes a few mistakes, and because of some random events, the FBI figures out his plan. The rest of the novel is a cat and mouse game as the FBI is always seemingly one step behind Baumman.Finder's novels have always been extensively researched, and ZERO HOUR is no exception. However, in this novel, Finder followed a pattern of introducing an subject, then explaining how it worked or its history (the research) then moved on with the story. Because of the inserted research, the story didn't flow seamlessly. I still enjoyed it however, even if it is a by the numbers spy thriller.The FBI references previous bomb attacks a lot while trying to figure out where Baumman is going to strike next. They reference the Timothy McVeigh Oklahoma City bombing as well as the first World Trade Center bombing. While reading, it gave me a weird feeling knowing about the soon to occur events of 9/11. Finder includes this paragraph after a character asks if a certain amount of C-4 explosives can bring a building down. The character answers: \\"Yes, some buildings yes, some no. Not a huge building like the World Trade Center.\\" He knew there had been four studies done on the engineering aspects of the World Trade Center complex, which determined based on vibration analysis that the World Trade Center buildings could not be brought down by an bomb short of a nuke.I believe all Finder fans will enjoy this novel, as well fans of the genre."},{"Title":"The Zero Hour","review":"I work offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and am constantly trying to forget the rigors of the day by escaping into a good book and &quot;The Zero Hour&quot; was definatelly able to remove me from the risks of the day and and plant me into another time and place amidst someone elses woes. I was amazed at the backgroud information that Joseph Finder had to do to get, which I thought, was highly sensitive ideals, operations and inner-workings of our government's superspook entities. I was constantly thinking that Mr. Finder was on the edge of divulging sensitive information about building explosive devises, other terrorist tools and subjecting his self to government sensorship.

So I took another chance that his previous books would be the same. This story is fresh and quick paced. Finder is the best for drama and suspense. There ae surprises at every turn.

Zero's identity is unknown. And get this, the Zero character knows Cahill intimately...very intimately.I could tell you how this happen but it would spoil the smile you woukld get when you find out how it happen in your reading of this book.This is a fasten-your-seat-belt suspense and a guaranteed page-turner. You will kick your later if you don't read this. If you want to wait for a better review of this book to make up your mind, it is your choice...but I would not !!!

The first third of the book does drag a little(although it's not boring per say) and is pretty heavy on background and character descriptions etc....however the last two-thirds of this book are definitly worthy five stars. Straub's imagination is unlimited, and he writes in such a dark and creepy manner that it's no wonder he is the only man Stephen King would co-author with. This guy, just based off a couple of books i read, is a big leaguer. I rated 4 stars, because of the longgggg beggining, but even with that included this book is worthy of four and a half. Read this!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This was one of the better books I've read from Peter Straub. I'd recommend it to anyone and would love if they would make an audiobook for it."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland is a wonderfully imaginative novel by master storyteller, Peter Straub. Without fail, Straub has delivered a tightly written, complex story that's dark, gothic, and hallucinatory with something for everyone: horror, suspense, and mystery.Much of the story is revealed in flashback and sometimes in flashbacks within flashbacks.Long and complex, this multilayered supernatural is story written with pure precision, a coming of age story of an adolescent's wondrous, mysterious and terrifying journey into manhood. The young protagonist, Tom, is the type of hero the reader roots for throughout the story. The story begins at a private prep school for boys where two freshmen, Tom Flanagan and Del Nightingale find each other and form a strong friendship through their fascination of magic. The boys soon discover that magic is far more than the art of illusion.As with Robert McCammon's Boy's Life, Shadowland should be classified as fantasy/supernatural because this work transcends horror, it becomes a classic coming of age story. This is superb storytelling by Straub. Literary and rich in detail, I highly recommend this outstanding novel."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's Shadowland is a rolling ride into undefinded horror that leaves the reader quaking. Prep schools are a nightmare in themselves (for the attendees)Arizona prep schools are something else. Despite the stigma associated with the schools, many fast friendships can be formed among the students. Del and Tom form such a friendship, sharing a childlike curiosity in magic, learning to execute those ever difficult card tricks, dodging a headmaster from hell, and trying to understand why the entire school is suffering from nightmares.Shadowland is an estate owned by Del's alcholic and slightly mad uncle, a retired magician. Shadowland is a world in itself, as the name implies, for nothing is what it seems. Others live at Shadowland, ones that the boys are not aware of, but suspect. Del's uncle spins tales of wonder, frightening and magical, and everything appears to be tied into Shadowland and it's surrounding areas.Shadowland is frightening, terrifying, and a nail biting bit of fiction that will keep the reader on the edge of their seats. Ranking right up there with the kings of horror, Straub has produced another masterpeice!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This book was re-issued when I bought it a few years ago. i enjoyed the talisman, so I tried this book. This follows boys at a magic prep school--trying to remember--been awhile---taunting from other students and a grudge against one of the teachers. Clear character descriptions, def. recommended.also recommend \\"Honest Illusions\\" by Nora Roberts if you like fiction stories about magic. Different genre, but worth reading."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"First read anything by Peter Straub when he wrote the Talisman with Stephen King. Was curious and so I got this book. It was one I could not put down and really didnt want the book to end."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I first read Shadowland when I was 14 or 15 and loved it. Since then, I've re-read it maybe a dozen times or so and never get tired of it. I've loaned it out and bought it again many times over. I would recommend this book to any fan of magic or modern horror. It is one of my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"One of my favorite Straub novels. A novel that transcends the usual horror conventions and weaves a story that captivates and haunts."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Probably a little long, so a bit on the dull side at times and takesperseverance to get through this creepy and eerie story of two boysinterested in magic.An older magician relative has the boys stay with him for a whileto teach them, but are his skills actually more to do with real magicthan illusion is the question here."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I re-read this book about once a year. It is a fascinating interwoven story of fairy tales, magic, coming-of-age and the loss of innocence. I have probably read it about 12 times and am still amazed at the way Straub manages to make every little story fit into the bigger story in at least two ways. I believe this book is incredibly under-valued. Once you read it, you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland, by Peter Straub, is a piece of really excellent high-end horror. The book begins in a private prep school for boys. In this school, Del and Tom, two freshmen boys fascinated by magic, find each other and form a strong friendship. Together, they learn card tricks, try to figure out why the whole school is having nightmares, dodge the crazy headmaster of the school, and do the sort of pal-around that only boys of a certain age can do. Their school year culminates with a big talent show in which Del and Tom plan to perform a magical exhibition. Circumstances in the story keep this from happening and the boys retire for the summer to the estate of Del's uncle, Shadowland.Del's uncle is a half-crazy, alcoholic, retired magician. He sets about teaching the boys magic. His magic, though, consists of more than tricking the eye with a slight of hand. At Shadowland, nothing is as it seems. An hour can feel like all day. The sun can set at 11am. You can find yourself suddenly half-way across a continent, just to find that you haven't moved from your spot at all. There are others living at Shadowland that are unseen, and whose existence is denied. There are rules that are made in the hopes of being broken. As Del's uncle spends the summer recounting his life, in all it's horror, to the boys Tom realizes that the horror is only starting. As he sees things that can't be real, but are, and he sees the immediate horrors being committed at Shadowland, Tom realizes that he has to leave, and Del must come with him. Unfortunately, for Tom and Del, Uncle Collins has realized something about Tom that even Tom doesn't yet know - and he wants it for himself.In Shadowland, Peter Straub has written a brilliant piece of fiction. There are plots, subplots, and subplots within those. Nothing in this book is without purpose to the story. Straub's writing, which has a definite British bent, despite the story being set in the United States, is very literary and rich. More complex than Stephen King, Straub is still very readable, especially to those who like a thicker story. No one who enjoys literary horror will be disappointed for having read this book."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Straub burst into fame with his previous book &quot;Ghost Story&quot; but this book has always been my favorite. It has stories within stories, details in one part that take on ominous meanings later in the story, and a weird meshing of magic and Grimm fairy tales. What is real and what is not is a constant question and never fully answered. It does lead to a very stunning though violent ending. It is also a coming of age book but so different from many others of that type. Truly unique which may be why it confused people at first because it fit no clear cut category. With its stunning deatil and visual images, I am amazed no one ever made this book into a movie."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I first read this in 1984 at a christian youthcamp 'retreat' with compulsory 'outdoor activities' in subzero weather. It was there that I got hooked on quote marks and phonics. It was there that I began to see that adults could be as clueless as children.I return to this book at Christmas when the weather looks bleak. As a coming of age novel, it speaks more clearly to me than some classics I could name.One cautionThe first pages confuse. Mr. Straub likes to spin you around before telling you a story. It breaks you out of your world and preps you for his. I'm lucky to find such a great story teller."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Tom Flanagan and his more affluent friend, Del Nightingale, receive an invitation from Del's uncle, Coleman Collins, to spend the summer with him. Collins is perhaps the greatest stage magician in the world, and both of the boys love magic. Collins promises to teach them both some new tricks. In fact, he promises to pass all his secrets on to the worthier of the two, which couldn't please Del more, since he wants to be the greatest living magician. Of course, one should always be careful what one wishes for...This is an extraordinary book, something that might come from Walt Disney, if Disney was capable of coming up with anything either adult or horrific. It is best described as a nightmarish fairy-tale, full of magic - but mostly from the dark side.As is typical of Straub, the story is constructed in convoluted and highly complicated form, all of which builds nicely to the conclusion of the main story at hand. The action begins in an Arizona boys' prep school, moves to an isolated mansion in Vermont, and includes numerous stories of Collins' highly checkered past throughout war-torn Europe, each tale of which increasingly fuels a mounting sense of dread - for Coleman Collins is much more than he seems; much more, and much worse.I'm amazed no one ever attempted to make a movie of Shadowland, for it is highly cinematic in style. It isn't as good as Straub's preceding masterpiece, Ghost Story, but is still a worthy successor and a great, involving read. The characters are well-realized, the action intriguing, and the atmosphere and actual magic of the piece are striking."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is a classic book by Straub, one of his best! The structure is great breaking the book up into sensible categories and the voice of the book is outstanding.The best parts of the book is the stories within the stories. I particularly love the times in the book when the \\"now\\" adults are reunited and the times spent at Carson. But the greatest parts are the fables told. Straub really flexes his creative muscle during these parts of the book.Why 4 stars? Because the book almost fell apart near the end. I think the novel may have been written about 100 pages too long. But the whole time I read this book I was very curious to how it really ends."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Rates in my top five all-time favorite books. This one delivers it all. Caught somewhere between a fever dream and the cool, longing whisper of a childhood memory, this book does what so few can: creates a narrative that is truly unique. As a film director, I have watched and read--&quot;absorbed&quot;--so many stories, that it is impossible not to see lazy &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; storytelling in almost everything. How often have I picked up a book or watched a movie with an interesting premise only to find that it is just like every other book or movie. Not so with Shadowland, which kept me forever off balance--but not enough to lose me. I was lost and riveted at the same time.With absolute precision, Straub brings to life the adolescent's journey into manhood; how even everyday life can be a wonderous, terrifying mystery. By reframing this subtext within the confines of Shadowland itself--the magician's mansion--Straub creates a level of uncertainty and terror that you will feel lingering with you long after you've closed the book.I can't imagine that this book will suit everyone's taste; but for anyone who likes their fiction to remain elusive, revealing, suprising, this is a book that will haunt you for years to come."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"What a work. I originally read it a decade ago as a kid, I recently picked it up again, and wow, it's even better this time around. Another reviewer noted that it's a shame this book doesn't get more attention among the works of Peter Straub - that reviewer is absolutely dead on. I'd still have to rank it, among Straub's books, a close second - how can you top \\"Ghost Story?\\" Well, \\"Shadowland\\" comes very, very close to doing just that.I imagine this is the kind of book that, as a writer, after you finish it, you kind of lean back in your chair, smile, and say, \\"Ah, I really am that damn good.\\" It has incredible settings. The prep school in Arizona pulls off as interesting dichotomy: it feels, for a large part, like a true-to-life coming of age story, rich in detail and characterization, that you would expect from the era it is set in. But it also has that dark, supernatural twist, and that aura of \\"something is terribly wrong\\" that makes it such a delicious read that brings to mind Graham Joyce in his element.And Shadowland itself! Shadowland, that great estate! Shadowland equals and, dare I say, surpasses in places, masters like Neil Gaiman and Clive Barker in fashioning and sculpting a truly gripping and fantastic world. The sights, sounds, spectacles, and characters of Shadowland are fantastic.I'm not going to outline the plot in any real depth, it's been done on here already. The book is one of the greatest of the \\"horror bildungsromans\\" in existence. It is told in a narrative form that flashes between the past and \\"present,\\" which I did not find confusing at all. I think it seemed like a natural and rich way to get at the story.The main characters are Del and the protagonist Tom. Both are marvelously fleshed out. Coleman Collins is a great character, a man who seems to be a gregarious if somewhat somewhat rough-around-the-edges and mysterious magician. Early in the book he comes off sort of as a hard-drinking, \\"black-sheep-uncle-of-the-family\\" with some sordid elements. He tells the boys (and the readers) great stories, takes them to wondrous places in their minds, and puts on grand shows and illusions in his elaborate and huge house of tricks. Later however, it appears he may be far more sinister and calculating than expected. The mysterious and lovely Rose is another fascinating character, whose introduction into the story adds a major wrinkle to the plot. Skeleton Ridpath is an effective villain whose later appearance is a surprise once it is understood, and horrifying.I could go on and on, but the point should be clear by now - this is a great book, a work of art in my opinion. Do not be put off by other reviews that compare it to Harry Potter (Shadowland came first by more than a decade and is more complex, darker, and more intelligent) or reviews that complain about the book because it does not have a straight arrow, linear narrative style. This is a satisfying read that has a lot of treasures to offer up. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"With the publication of Shadowland in 1981, Peter Straub enhanced his already impressive reputation as a modern master of the horror/dark fantasy genre. Although more subtle than its predecessor, the modern classic Ghost Story, the book's exquisite pacing was more effective in pulling readers into Straub's surreal fantasy world, making them wonder if such a place might not exist after all.The novel is the story of the friendship between two young men and their encounter with a sorceror supreme. The magician, one Coleman Collins, exposes the two boys to a variety of bizarre and perilous situations, all designed to test, but also prepare them, for the time when one of them will inherit Collins' mantle of king of the magicians. The story moves quickly, as Tom Flanagan and Del Nightengale make the acquaintance of the strange denizens of the magician's mansion, Shadowland. There, they meet the charming Brothers Grimm, as well as Collins' warped servants, who go by the unlikely names of Mr. Peet, Roof, Rock and Seed. They also must deal with the evil \\"Collector,\\" a mirror that steals souls.The boys struggle with the malevolent forces which surround them and confront the dark side of their own personalities to prove themselves worthy. But Collins proves to be jealous of his power, causing a challenging summer of wonderment to climax in unspeakable tragedy. Pupil faces teacher in a final, bloody confrontation, winner take all.The phrases \\"I couldn't put it down\\" and \\"Read this one with the lights on\\" are overused in describing horror stories, but in this case they are a perfect fit, as Straub succeeds admirably in his professional goal \\"To take the classic elements of the horror novel as far as they could go.\\" Enter Shadowland, and explore the boundaries of your own imagination."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"An innovatively written tale spreading across the territory of horror and dark fantasy, Shadowland is equally driven by concept and by characters, and is an indispensible addition to the library of any devotee of the fantastic or just excellent novels in general.The style in which the book is narrated is unique, something I've never encountered elsewhere. It's written by a character - now an author - who played a small role in the events during his youth, and who has, years later, gathered the rest of the story through extensive talks - sort of half-interviews, half-conversations - with another character, Tom Flannagan, who played a more direct role in the events being recounted; a lesser role is played by further talks with other characters who were more or less peripheral to the big events. The fact that the author character is never identified by name lends an additional dose of eerie authenticity to the tale.It starts out - after a pair of prologues touching on dreams of ancient wizards, and on the world of stage magic where some of the acts may not be 100% illusion - in 1950s Arizona and the start of the school year at a private school, an institution very austere and unforgiving even for the era, where the teaching staff is mostly unpleasant and many of the older students arrogant thugs, and a hard year is set for Flannagan and Del Nightingale, the two main players of this part of the novel. The novel's narrator is present for the events of this section, and plays a fairly signifigant side role, as he, Flannagan, Nightingale, and several other first-year students at the Carson Upper School form friendships and try to make it through the year, which includes not only the familiar, worldly difficulties, not other, more exotic, troubles lurking in the background. One of the interests Tom is introduced to early in the school year is magic, which is Del's passion, and something he practices most of the time he's not in school, achieving a high level of skill at. Uncannily high, in fact...After many threads have woven together and subplots have beun to meld, we find ourselves ready for the next act, as summer dawns and Del invites Tom to come along with him for his annual trip to his Uncle Cole's estate in New England. Coleman Collins is a rich recluse, at one time a world-famous stage magician, and now mentor to Del during the summer months. It's here that the main thrust of the novel takes place. Tom meets, for the first time, the array of people Del's come to know during his consecutive summers at the estate: Collins's small band of roughish - servants? friends? lackeys? - Tom isn't quite sure; a forlorn and beautiful young girl named Rose; and the mysterious Coleman Collins himself. Many characters aren't necessarily what they seem, and during the school year and, especially, during that fateful summer that follows where Del and Tom co-apprentice under Collins, we encounter wonderous beauty, riveting tension, the telling of fantastic fables within the larger story, and a character who's slowly revealed to be one of the most believably and disturbing evil characters in horror history. The twists and turns are many: some bring unexpected brightness to the tale, some are very dark (one in particular hits like a sledgehammer right to the heart). Some aspects of the book - the true motivations of certain characters; the spiritual/theological meaning behind certain revelations - are wide open to individual interpretation, and that can actually be a good thing: sometimes things are better off not spelled right out, but left for the reader to make up their own mind on (the identity of the 'dream wizard' early on, for example). Some may think the first section of the book - the school year, which is largely a 'lead-up' phase - occupies too much page space, but I like the time the book took in establishing its characters and in letting the more mystical elemets seep in gradually.You feel like you know the characters deeply in this book, and come to truly care about their fates; the magical elements feel real, and sometimes it seems that the weirder the magic gets, the more genuine it feels. As I said earlier, this is a must for fans of horror or dark fantasy (maybe of fantasy in general), and also recommended for fans outside of those fields. The only caveat for readers not into horror or dark fantasy is that when Shadowland gets dark, it gets DARK. There are some frightening and wrenching moments in here, but in the end all the book's elements blend together for a tale that's haunting in more ways than one."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I completely agree with a previous comment about this novel making a great film. I would love to see some of those fantastic scenes played out on the big screen.It does jump around a bit, but I think that this is SUPPOSED to confuse us a little to add to the general feeling of &quot;what is real, and what is not----where am I?&quot;. I finished the novel in 2 days and was left with the sense of delicious gloom that made me want more---and I confess that thoughts of &quot;The Collector&quot; disturbed my sleep just a little."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I read this book when I was 14, and reread it many times since.

Those reviewers who suggest a Stephen King novel over Shadowland obviously have problems with stories that have depth and plots that you are not smacked in the face with.This is an amazing story about friendship, and leaving your childhood behind. It made me laugh, cry and streched my imagination in the most wonderful of ways.So far though, no one has mentioned poor Skeleton Ridpath who I remember feeling sorry for...Guess I've got to re-read this and perhaps I'll feel differently.Fans of Clive Barker will definitely enjoy Shadowland, Ghost Story and Julia"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Before I read &quot;Shadowland&quot; I went through some of Amazon's review finding comment like&quot;SHADOWLAND at first seems utterly confusing, but by the end everything comes together in ways that will amaze and delite&quot;and&quot;unlike many novels of this genre, the ending is not simplistic or disapointing&quot;I also think that the story is confusing here and there but I was hoping that there was to come the promised not-disapointing ending. Unfortunately I was the one to be disapointed. I must admit the story really keeps you in suspense, however, maybe I didn't get the message, but in my opinion the ending ain't one of the strongest. While reading I had some supposition how the plot would develop and I how things would come out in the end but -as mentioned above- the ending left too many things open (e. g. who/what is Rose?). Though &quot;Shadowland&quot; is entertaining, in the end I felt like having wasted my time cos it wasn't worth it. Well, there surely are books much worse than &quot;Shadowland&quot; but if you have a better one, don't hesitate to read that one first!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I have been reading since a young age, and this is quite simply my favorite book. Some books tend to meander all over the place; others tend to load up on the details to try and fill out a sparse story wihch would be better off a short story. Not so with Shadowland, a truly monumental literary accomplishment which is completely under-rated. The massive amount of details in the story help to bring the story to life, to bring the reader closer into the story.Shadowland is not for everyone. But if you are on the same wavelength as the story you will find what is easily the finest piece of writing in existance. The magnitude and depth of the story, the only other books I can think of comparing would be Tarot by Piers Anthony or the Dark Tower series by Stephen King; IF he gets the totally extraneous side plotline books out of the way!It is a true shame that Straub's other works get more attention, I consider Shadowland to be his absolute finest masterpiece. This book really does belong to the ages."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's \\"Shadowland\\" is a coming of age story with fantastical events, horrific twists and classic tragic plot turns. All these elements beg the reader to want to love this novel, but in the end the story comes across empty somehow (even if the last 150 pages is a terrifically executed wild ride).As adolescents at a boarding school Del Nightingale and Tom Flanagan form a bond through a mutual love of magic. The boys, who spend a summer at Shadowland with Del's uncle ( a grand wizard of magic), soon realize that their bond was no accident and all the events leading-up to their final summer together were not just random series of events. Shadowland tests their skills, morality and friendship in ways they never expected.Peter Straub's introduction explains that much of \\"Shadowland\\" was conceived as a tribute of sorts to fairy tales. That influence is felt through out the book in its style and stories within the action (King of Cats, mermaids, The Brothers Grimm, The Goose Girl, evil sorcerers...). It is fun to try and catch all the references, although I must admit I am sure I missed 95% of them. Unfortunately, it is the need to present \\"Shadowland\\" as a fairy tale that really pulled the book down for me. Fairy tales are stories told by a third party who is telling a tale passed on to them, and \\"Shadowland\\" is no different. The story is told to us by a narrator who is communicating what he was told by our hero Tom Flanagan. Because we are not getting the information first hand (although the action is written as if the reader is present at the time it happened), there is a detachment to the horror and the reader questions if what is happening is real. Because the novel's plot is based on magic, there are illusions and hallucinations to further confuse the reader as to what is happening. It is this confusion and lack of identity with the characters and events that made an intriguing plot somewhat dull and uninspiring.Although it contains terrific writing, \\"Shadowland\\" falters due to the authors sweeping attempt to do too much which gets in the way of presenting an effective story. I wanted to like the story but it never lived up to expectations."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is his best. We follow our narrator and actual protagonists through their Freshman year at Carson, a mid-level prep-school in the 1950's. We go through a very traditional turn before... either.This is a great book, featuring the idea of magic in the everyday world as well as in the world of fantasy. It belongs in the fantasy/horror genre, but like Robert McCammon's \\"Boy's Life\\" would later, it transcends it and uses the conventions of the genre to become a universal coming of age story. As I said above, this is Straub's best work, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub weaves a mind-blowing web of horror and emotion in this unsettling tale of darkest magic. As with his subsequent novel, The Talisman co-written with Stephen King, Straub demonstrates his unnervingly clear vision of magic at its most real, devastating and climactic potency. Quite simply, this is a book that can be re-read just to absorb Peter Straub's mastery of story telling and literary atmosphere."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is my third novel by the author, and while it was pretty entertaining, I thought it was just a bit too over-the-top for my taste. The first part of the book, the first hundred and forty pages or so, was the most conventional. Author's choice of narrator was a bit baffling, but it wasn't a huge distraction. His tendency to describe what the characters are wearing, though, was annoying. Things get really confusing when Tom and Del go to be with Del's uncle, a magician, for the summer. It's here where things got quite confusing, but thankfully pretty soon I got used to it and could keep up. From here on, the novel was always over-the-top, one strange occurrence after another. The only thing that broke that pattern were some of the stories the magician told Tom and Del, which I liked very much.Overall, Shadowland wasn't boring, but it was way over-the-top for my taste. I prefer novels that blend realism with the fantastic (like the author's \\"lost boy lost girl\\"), without getting too into the fantastic. I don't regret reading it, and I had no problem finishing it, but at the end of the day, it really wasn't my kind of novel. I'll definitely read more from this author. The Hellfire Club sounds more to my taste."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Straub is a master of his craft. This book is very, very hard to put down - a real \\"page-turner,\\" to use the old cliche. I recommend it highly. Probably my second favorite of all his books, after GHOST STORY."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland was one of the first horror books I read growing up (I think I may have been twelve at the time that I read it). Along with some of the early works of Stephen King, it was one of the big reasons I became addicted to the genre and later became a writer. Shadowland is a richly written, complex books that I quickly became engrossed in. Shadowland follows two friends Del and Tom in boarding school. Both boys are into magic and dabble at it while they are in school. After the school year is over, they spend the summer at Del's uncle's house. Uncle Collins is a crazed, retired magician who gives the boy's a tutorial in real magic. As the book evolves, it starts to become clear that Uncle Collins isn't all in the up and up, something that Tom begins to pick up on. He comes to the conclusion that if he and Del are to survive the summer at Shadowland, they are going to have to escape. The only problem is that Uncle Collins has taken a keen interest in Tom and isn't about to let him go.Shadowland is one of those books that perfectly fits the description of \\"hard to put down\\". Straub does a brilliant job of making the characters come alive. I've read many of Peter Straub's novels and this is my favorite. He did an excellent job of weaving in sub-plots and creating a story world that was both highly entertaining and very rewarding to read through. A definite horror classic, I would strongly advise to pick up a copy if you haven't already read this one.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This is an exceptional novel, although it is difficult to classify.

Tom also falls in love with Rose, a girl he meets there who is controlled by Del's uncle.Part 3 Del, Tom, and Rose decide to leave. But during their escape, they get caught and sent back to the house for their punishments. Del's punishment: Getting beaten up by his uncle's massive servants. Extremely strong. Tom's punishment: Crucifixion. With nails.Read the book to find out what happens next. I highly recomment it! JUST LOOK AT THE FRONT COVER OF THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Ugh.... I don't know why I bother with Straub. He's got such great ideas, but his books are so frustrating.It's a great story (if a bit odd at times), but put together rather oddly. And as usual with him, it just feels like you have to fight the book in order to be able to understand what's going and to figure out what he's trying to say. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could finally put the thing down and move on. The sad part is that I actually did care what was going on and in the characters. It was just hard to read."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"If you are a fan of Stephen King or J.K. Rowling and have read all their stuff too many times, this is a fair substitute. The plot isn't as strong as it could be, but sometimes, you just gotta read for the writing. And Peter Straub has a pretty good imagination."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This book was recommended in a news article as one of the top 10 scary stories written. I really question that review. I never felt drama or fear. I never connected with this story. To me, this was a long story where the author tried to impress the reader by weaveng creative, colorful fantasy fairytails in a \\"horror\\" story. Not worth the read."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub tells the story of two prep-school classmates, Tom Flanagan, and Del Nightingale who spend a summer apprenticed to a master magician.The novels first part chronichles the formation of their friendship, and their involvement in both stage and occult magic. This segment is fairly conventional, and well told. It succeeds in effectively building an atmosphere of menace, and thoroughly introducing the characters and themes that will be futher developed in the second half of the book, which is much more complex.In the second half the book, all the laws of nature are uprooted, and magic and menace become the rule rather than the exception. The setting is confined to an estate in vermont, Shadowland, which is the domain of the wizard Coleman Collins. Coleman's origins are spelled out in an elaborate series of hallucinations, staged events, and magical illusions, or some indefinite mixture of all three. Straub is very effective in creating this fantastical setting, and in initiating the characters, and the reader, into his world of magic.Unfortunately, this is where the story, and the horror, break down. In a story featuring a protagonist who can fly, transform himself, levitate objects, start fires with his mind, etc, it is a bit hard to generate any kind of menace or horror. (it is especially galling that a character who can fly is kept captive by a tall fence-) Thus what should be the climactic conflict pitting master against apprentice comes across rather flat, despite a phantasmagoria of imagery. The images can be interesting, perhaps even scary, but their ephemeral nature undercuts the significance of the consequences of this action.Don't get me wrong, Straub weaves a rich tapestry that is compelling in places, but ultimately, in the big picture, falls utterly flat as horror, despite its richness and lyricism.If you want clever references, occult themes and an intricate plot and a satisfying finish, perhaps you should read Foucault's Pendulumn, by Eco Umberto.If you want a horror story with occult themes, look elswhere."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"&quot;Shadowland&quot; is two stories in one book. The first is set in a strict prep school, the second is set in the confined house of a madman. Though this book had strong imagery and allegory, I found the story to be too complex. Straub tried to tackle too many issues at once and just barely scraped by. The characters are developed well, but I was unable to grasp the emotion of the love between Tom and the mysterious &quot;Rose.&quot; If you'd like to read a book with a well-written love affair that is also black with horror I recommend reading &quot;Wizard and Glass&quot; by Stephen King. Overall, I found Shadowland to be too long, and the ending is unsatisfying and abrupt."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was the first Peter Straub I have read, and since then I have also read Houses Without Doors. Peter Straub is often refered to by those who need labels for things as a &quot;more intellectualized Steven King&quot;. There is some truth to this, but not a lot. Straub's writing is less colloquial, less immediate, than King's, and he lacks King's instinctive (some might even say addictive) sense of humor. In other ways, though, many similarities can be drawn between their writing, which is why, although it has been called a lesser work, I enjoyed the Talisman (and Black House, too).Back to the matter at hand.Straub's writing is quite beautiful. There is a penetrating lyricism in it. In his hands, the mundane becomes as terrifying as the bizzare, and a simple glance at a passerby out of a train window can be as numbing, or more, as the macabre violence that eventually follows (and, rest assured, it is indeed to follow- one scene towards the end literally turned my stomach- you Will realize what scene I refer to when reading it, I am sure).The story is of two friends at a decaying authoritarian prep school in the Southwest. The second story is of these two boys' apprenticing under one's uncle, an aging magician who is on the brink of madness.There is such a clean break of setting between the two large sections that it creates some problems- which Straub effectively fixes.Almost.A web of interconnected images and characters connect the sections to each other, and these are well acheived and fascinating. However, the division is almost unbridgable. The novel works as a whole, but it is a whole that is like two countries, the first of a undercurrent of crackling, quasi-Dickensian unpleasantness and uncertainty, the second of surreal, neo-Fairytale horror. While the bridge between them is a strong one, it is still possible to fall off the side, and one of the dangers of reading this book is that, such a clean break being drawn, the reader might put it down to take tea after the first half and not pick it up again. Lest this sound pejorative, let me say that the reader who does this will miss a hell of a good conclusion.Now that I have gotten my complaints out of the way...The characters are strongly drawn and effective, acting out a story which is ultimately about the seduction of the forbidden and the loss of innocence. Magic is the catalyst for and the observer of these transformations, and when the bottled up energy of the first section explodes in an apocalyptic climax, Straub spares no punches in the surreal fervor- midnight covens in the woods, characters who may be either real or not, supporting roles for both the Brothers Grimm and Humphrey Bogart, etc.While there are some uncomfortable things happening structure-wise, this book is worth a read. In the end, the divisions that throw you at first are rubbed away by the protaganist's conclusion that &quot;Shadowland&quot; is not only the name of the old magician's estate, but it extends to the happenings at the school, and, overall, to a state of being that characterizes the book perfectly."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Shadowland is a ambitious novel, and Peter Straub deserves praise for having attempted it at all, let alone for having seen it through to its publication in 1980. Yes, this is a diplomatic way of saying Shadowland is a good concept but the idea doesn't quite find full realization on the printed page. It is a rare example of when a screenplay might have been able to flesh out a plot better than a book can. Maybe one day it will find its way to the big screen, and in the right hands it could be powerful.Shadowland is Straub's tip of his hat to the genre of dark fairy tales, magic (and magick) and the gritty fantasyland we all love deep down in our souls. When Tom Flanagan, and Del Nightingale, two teenaged friends from a stern, second-rate Arizona prep school, each preoccupied with stage magic, travel to spend the summer at a foreboding New England house called Shadowland, guests of Del's notorious uncle, Coleman Collins, a retired theater magician, they are soon sucked into Coleman's demented and fantastic world in which magic tricks are quite real, time exists in a vacuum, and creatures from tall tales walk among them. The novel soon becomes a story about moral good versus self-serving ambition, the corruption of dark desire, and the loss of innocence and identity.Shadowland is a tragedy. It is slightly sad from beginning to end, and only in a few masterfully-composed chapters is a reader paroled from its morosity long enough to be swept up in the wonder of what is possible at the magical estate. Fatal train derailments arranged for convenience? The animation and sexual possession of the inanimate? The enslavement of the living? Murder? These are waved away and dismissed by Coleman as side effects unavoidable in the amoral life of a master conjurer, for whom all the world is but a tool to be used for his pleasure. In this does Shadowland's horror lie.Perhaps most of all I liked the sly side references to past Straub books that were seamlessly woven in here. Did anyone else catch that the upperclassman who came in to speak sternly to the new boys at the school was none other than Miles Teagarden, tormented protagonist from Straub's If You Could See Me Now? Those with a knowledge of that brilliant but emotionally-taxing 1975 book would recall that after the tragedy in 1955 that was the focus of If You Could See Me Now, Miles was sent away to what he'd told us was \\" a prison-like boarding school,\\" and guess what? That school is the same one Del and Tom attend! Nice, Mr. Straub!Shadowland is a de rigueur stopover for anyone serious about the literary works of Peter Straub, and it's fairly readable and sound for its genre, but as far as recommending it to the average reader...there I'd hesitate. For its limitations and occasional failings I rate it three stars overall, but for sheer ambition as far as what he was trying to say, Straub deserves more than five stars. Simply put, he has a wondrous imagination!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I just finished this book last night. I had only read Straub with King before. I was hoping this would turn out better - it had such a build-up that I thought the end would amaze and delight. But the ending left me cold. This book about magic was definitely full of illusions: it had the illusion of fully formed characters, a cohesive plot, and an exciting ending. But if you look a bit deeper you find that it's just a trick.And a big problem for me is that there is very little \\"magic\\" going on in this book. Collins tells stories and gives performances and confuses the boys but no actual learning of magic is discussed apart from some card tricks. Also I felt that there was too much separation between Del and Tom at Shadowland. In fact Del is pretty much nonexistent in the second part of the book. They were inseparable in the first part it seemed and barely talked in the second.I'm glad i read this but it could have been better. As for horror, it is not horror but more dark fantasy."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub's Shadowland is one of the pinnacles of the horror/ fantasy genre, a symbolic, unsettling, expertly-written journey into the country of magic, a coming-of-age story that surprises, enlightens, and terrifies -- sometimes all at once. It follows the journey of two boys, Tom Flanagan and Del Nightingale, first in their experiences at school, discovering that magic is far more than the art of illusion...and then their travails at the house of Del's uncle, the legendary (and dangerous) Coleman Collins, aka Herbie Butter. Much of the story is revealed in flashback form, and sometimes in flashbacks within flashbacks, a literary device Straub loves to employ, and uses to great effect here, choosing just the right moment to provide a little illumination, a little atmosphere, or a little terror. As I noted above, the story is about magic (magic here being symbolic of manhood to Straub's young protagonists), about its discovery and its uses...as well as its perversions. Indeed the entire novel is largely a work of symbolism and allegory, echoing the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm (who even make an appearance in the story) and, to a lesser degree, Hans Christian Anderssen. Straub loves to drop such literary allusions all over his novels, and in Shadowland he does it very well indeed, using his mythic backgrounds to echo and inform the story, providing color and shading much as a painter does. Often a fairy tale that has just been related will happen again as part of Tom's experiences, or the opposite will happen; sometimes the fairy tales are part of a tableau, staged by Coleman Collins for Tom and Del's benefit. Sometimes they become literal events, as they do in the case of Rose, about whom I will reveal nothing save to say that the revelation of who (or what) she really is will shock you down to your toes. This is a novel, as I also said, about comings-of-age and awakenings, both sexual and otherwise, with magic used as metaphor for this to a large degree (the sequences where Tom lifts the tree and flies being key examples of what I mean; his exhaustion afterwards is almost a sexual one), though there is a true sexual awakening for Tom in Shadowland that is just as telling in its way, and just as revealing about Rose's character, as all of the allegorical goings-on that I've been going on about (at some length) above. It is a dangerous moment for both of them, and Straub pulls it off beautifully, missing not a beat as he relates what could have been a clumsy passage in other hands. And speaking of danger, the villains in the story, from the enigmatic and menacing Collins to the troll-like Wandering Boys, to the ugly and utterly evil character of Spider (surely one of the best villans in all of fantastic literature) are portrayed to perfection, adding not just menace to the story but outright moments of terror; there are also three encounters with a mysterious character known only as M., whose confrontations with Tom echo certain elements of the New Testament, and which give the reader one of the clearest indications where Straub is going. Of course it's also worth noting that not all of the story is quite so serious and grim; there are moments of fine, if twisted, humor, as there are in all of Straub's novels. In one memorable sequence, during a hallucinatory magical revue put on by Collins in his Herbie Butter incarnation, Del and Tom meet up with Bugs Bunny, Jesus, and the Apostles (who sing a rousing rendition of -- of all things -- &quot;Fish For Supper&quot;!), all within a few pages. I could go on and on -- I haven't even touched on the novel's more hallucinatory aspects, or the wonderful depiction of life at a boys' school in the novel's early stages, surely one of the best, most realistic descriptions of such an experience I've ever read. There is also Collins' amazing tale of his days as a surgeon in World War I, and how he discovered magic under the tutelage of Speckle John, which will amaze and startle you as much as anything in the book. To sum up, Shadowland is essential reading for anyone interested in the horror/fantasy genre. I read it as a teeneager, and as I've grown older it's gained more and more resonance with each successive reading; I have no doubt that it'll do the same for you."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"This got me started on Peter Straub. I read Ghost Story, Koko, Mystery, and If you could see me now all because of Shadowland. I could not put this book down. It is easily the most unsettling book I have ever read and I don't think Straub has reached this level of intensity ever again."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"As mentioned, the plot of this novel is quite hard to summerise. It is a book of two halves, the first part a brilliant, page turning tale of a sadistic school which hints at the horrors to come. The second part and the crux of the novel is set at Del's myserious uncles huge estate 'Shadowlands.' Here stories within stories mix and mingle, and nothing is what it seems. The hero, Tom, is brilliant creation who you cheer for all long. Long, complex and brilliantly written this is a multilayered fantasy masterpiece."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Like many other reviews for this book, it has been several years since I first found this book in my attic. My first attempt at reading it was not entirely successfuly, given that I was quite young then. In a subsequent attempt, I found this book otherwise. It has been one of the books that I consider milestones in reading; books that take you to a higher level. To summarize, it has a captivating story, complex charater portrayals, and a seemingly timeless 'feel' to it. Peter Straub takes you on an adventure which has few parallels. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I agree with most of what the previous reviewer said about SHADOWLAND's feeling of unreality. Straub tells a straightforward yet allegorical tale of loss of innocence, friendship and sacrifice in such a way that the entire book seems like a &quot;fever dream,&quot; like some enchantment cast upon a knight of the Round Table by Morgan LeFay. The effect is unsettling and disturbing. This is certainly one of the most haunting, complex and downright literary &quot;horror&quot; novels ever written. Straub manages to say more about the human condition through &quot;that battered old sword of storytelling,&quot; as Tim Underhill would say, than other writers of this genre would ever dream."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub always has some interesting ideas but I don't think he handles them all that well! Others disagree... This novel about a couple of schoolboys who discover the secret of the heir to a lineage of wizardry has good suspense and some haunting moments, but the ending is VERY disappointing. This would actually have been a better novel WITHOUT the magical aspect, which is largely irrelevant! The brutalized-by-WWI explanation is a bit weak too, IMHO."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Peter Straub is a very intelligent thinker when writing about occult matters. However, I found this book very confusing at times--wondering what was happening. In many places Straub could simplify his language rather than drawing out the entire plot with unneeded pages of action and details that bare no significance whatsoever. Like at the end, where you want the novel to end, he builds it up without giving a very specific ending. He wastes time on imagery that we simply don't care about, whereas in other areas of the book he is very stingy and cheap with details--making it very hard to understand what is happening.His allusion to other Literature is very thought-provoking, though it helps to have read these stories beforehand, otherwise you might get a little lost in the symbolism in his story.Finally, if you don't know who Eliphas Levi and other characters like Aleister Crowley are, you will be doubly lost. They are writers on the occult and some, like Crowley are practitioners. However, I find it remarkable how Straub includes non-fictional characters in a fictional story and uses this as a basis to interject his own personal thoughts on them. Straub gives us his opinion on various things like Christianity--that the true religion is Jesus' learnings, not the modern day preversion of priests and ministers. He draws many parallels and employs the use of metaphor heavily throughout Shadowland.The story becomes cliche when the characters take on a Jesus versus the Devil theme later in the novel. It becomes rather gaudy when Straub tries to create an allegory to Christ and his crucifixion, by actually using one character to represent Judas--who is later referred to as \\"a Judas.\\" If that wasn't enough, the main character is crucified and must find the power within to resurrect himself, so to speak, from the in and out states of consciousness he experiences.If you're familiar with any of the author's works, the occult, or Stephen King's works, I highly recommend Straub's Shadowland. It is a good story in and of itself, though it takes a while to digest, and many people will probably put it down after the first 100 pages where it appears to resemble a Harry Potter story for grownups."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I have read some Peter Straub books that I absolutely love, like, for instance, Ghost Story. Then there is this book. The magic of this book is that when it is over, you still have no idea what is going on. That is truly magical. I thought the characters in this book were weak and the story moved along at the pace of a retired snail on holiday. There are much better books out there. I think I will be haunted by the horror of how bad this book was forever."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"I goofed! In my original review, I made references to a character named &quot;Spider&quot; -- who does not exist in the novel! You'd think someone who'd read the bloody thing as many times as I have would know better! Oh well...The character I meant to name was, of course, Skeleton Ridpath, son of the school's football coach, the &quot;heavy&quot; of the piece and a major character. I called him &quot;Spider&quot; because...well, never mind. You'll find out on your own. My apologies for any grievous mental confusion I might have caused."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"Why is it that I always end up believing the hype about this guy and never learn from my mistakes? I don't know. I've wasted far too much money on Straub books and Shadowland is, I hope, my last time. I realize he's considered one of the best and has lots of fans, but I just can't get past page 50 of any of his books without yawning so frequently I have to stop reading for the tears in my eyes. Few writers have managed to put me to boredom-induced sleep like him.Shadowland: Right from the start, in typical Straub fashion, I hated the characters, the locations, and the circumstances. Arizona has never seemed more \\"dry\\" to me than it did in this book. It's written so that right off the bat you're wondering halfway through the page \\"who's saying this to whom, where, and in which time frame?\\" His descriptions of places, events, and memories are so ridiculously mixed and confusing it's practically retarded.Nothing made me latch on to the characters except my never-ending desire to see them all killed by page 50 so the misery can end. Arizona? His version you might as well nuke because it's a mental degradation to the reader's brain.Have you ever read a book and found yourself so bored you unconsciously began thinking about the binding, the quality of material used for the pages, the type of ink it was printed with etc. while your eyes are still reading? No? Then read this and find out what it's like. Because there's nothing better than realizing you just spent the last 30 minutes reading words that you instantly forgot and then had to backtrack to the point you lost interest and start over again."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"THE END IS REALLY FREAKY WITH THE GORE ALL OVER THE WALLS. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"At the age of, oh I don't know, I'd say 13; I picked up Staub's Ghost Story and just could NOT finish it because it was so...well, boring. So now, 21 years later, I decided to give Pete a try again. After all I reasoned, maybe I was just too young. Maybe the nuances were lost on me. Maybe I didn't get it. And I must report, Shadowland had me SCARED TO DEATH. Yup terrified that I could lapse into a coma any moment out of utter boredom. Ok it did pick up about 2/3's of the way through and it was interesting, as well as creative, well written and stylistically sophisticated. (not that I'm a writer...those are just my impressions). An interesting book by a skilled and talented author. But it was not, repeat NOT scary which is truely unfortunate because it possessed several elements that, properly nurtured could have produced a terrifying story."},{"Title":"Shadowland","review":"You will recognize each word. You will understand each sentence. But you will have no earthly idea what is going on.The problem with this book is that the events are described too vaguely. You'll read a sentence and wonder if it's a metaphor or a hard description. For example, if he says an audience's faces are animals staring at the main characters, is that just a metaphor or do they really have animal-faces? This kind of thing happens over and over and makes it a real chore to read this book.When I got to the last 50 pages, I finally fixed myself a pot of coffee, and after having set it aside for a couple months (finding the 2000 Election more exciting to follow), I resolved to finish the thing. It was a 50-yard dash up a cliff. (That was a metaphor, folks).All I can say is that it isn't worth the time invested. It's got an interesting concept, but it has boring characters, a boring plot, and a boring conclusion.One exception: The very beginning of the novel, which is set in a boy's school, is written in a more conventional style. You will be able to follow what is going on, but once you get to the meat of the novel - the Shadowland - you might as well hang it up. You'll find yourself struggling through pages, rereading paragraphs, flipping back to ask yourself, &quot;Have I missed some pages?

Employers don't like it much when an employee doesn't come in to work when they call out sick, but they like it even less when the employee doesn't call out at all because they're too engrossed to pick up the phone.The best way I can describe this story relative to current fiction would be to say \\"think of Harry Potter in Hell ...

Discover the secret code that unlocks the hidden meanings throughout the writings of the Bible. Understanding the metaphysical interpretations of the Bible's psychological dramas is thrilling. This book helps us to understand the parables and things of the spirit as discerned by the spirit. Dr. Addington's goal is to show us that the Bible is a storehouse of inspiration designed to fit every human need, a treasure trove of usable ideas, an infinite souce of wisdom, and most of all, a book of life."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"I first discovered this book while scouring used book stores to review written material in reference to my Bible studies. It caught my eye because this is the exact title I was going to use for my own thesis. It is the compilation of Mr. Addingtons years of work in which he uses his extensive knowlege acquired through years of Bible teaching and studies. You follow him through his discovery of a code existing in the Bible in which one is able to follow the 'path of enlightenment'. This path of enlightenment is the same path which the 'mystics' used in their religion .. if one can call it that. The book is written and explained in such a way as one is able to check and correlate all of which Mr. Addington states. The book brings the true meaning of the Bible out of its cloak of death and judgment into the light of ones' ability to change oneself into the 'perfect' person by a method which one can easily understand."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"If you want to read the bible and not feel lost with all the characters and names, this is a wonderful resource. It will open your eyes and mind.Janette G."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"While it is interesting to note the 'hidden' codes in the bible, actually I didn't find anything in it that I didn't already know. For one thing, the metaphysical suggestions could be found in any other related literature about the power of thought! But what I found difficult to follow was the lists and lists of names (nature)interpretations, in the author's writing, that unless I was to sit and make a conscious effort to memorize these names, I kept getting side-tracked.While having an interesting concept of another meaning hidden underneath (allegory), and relating it to the state of one's 'mind' (consciousness), I personally saw no particular enlightenment in that approach as compared with the enlightenment that I found many years ago when I first started studying the scriptures. I was quite aware then as to how to interpret the scriptures literally when appropriate, and metaphysically when appropriate. That didn't seem very difficult to me, especially when making a concerted effort to study the bible regularly. So in my way of thinking, the bible can be interpreted more than one way and regardless of how one interprets it, there is a message for everyone who is ready to receive it....\\"let him who has ears, let him hear\\"....But the big disappointment to me was the almost lack of any mention of the New Testament, which I found very strange? Since the Christian tradition is based more emphatically on the New Testament writings and particularly the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, I was somewhat surprised by those ommissions. The author did, very, very briefly mention a few quotes from Jesus, and a couple from the Apostle Paul, but other than that, nothing! I was so hoping he would have expressed his thoughts and 'discoveries' as related to the death, burial and ressurrection of Jesus, along with all the other books in the New Testament.What I wanted to know was, how would he explain the New Testament writings using the same metaphysical explanations that he went on and on about regarding the Old Testament. That had me puzzled, therefore I could only give the book three stars.Perhaps Mr. Addington should have written another book to complete his work."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"The Bible is written with layers of information. To access to the various layers, different keys are required. Jack Addington definitely handed the reader a unique set of key to dig deep into the inner teaching of the Christ. Knowing the meaning of the proper names and what certain thing represent metaphorically in the Bible opens up a completely new dimension of its teaching. What didn't seem to make sense does make sense with these new keys. (I translate between English and Chinese. I can totally see how meaning of names be so completely lost in translation.) Thanks to people like Jack that we could start to really \\"reading\\" the Bible for the first time."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"this was needed for a class I was taken but the class was cancelled until later so I moved on reading a different book for now. this arrived fast and packaged well........thanks"},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"If you want to open your mind and heart and see the scriptures in a broader more beautiful light- this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hidden Mystery of the Bible","review":"I am fascinated by the relationship between thinking and feeling. I understand that cognitive-behavioural psychology is based on respecting this relationship, and is one that has helped me temper my own perception and attitudes towards life. In that regard, this book granted an apporach to reading the bible as a generalized evolution of any individuals conciousness through the valleys and mountains of challenges in the world of mental and emotional existence with respect to worshipping God. This book left me pondering how Moses (or anyone who has the wonderful experiences of drawing closer to the Lord) might have chosen to go about preserving their lifetime of experience in the form of a poetic drama that would stand the tests of time. As I put myself in this persepctive of 'any invidual', the things portrayed in the book, read like a narrative of my own struggles in life trying to put the \\"hard times\\" into perspective (e.g. why is their suffering from a loving God.) Having to choose to go on following God, even in the face of sacrficing \\"reason\\" were both the best & worst moments of my own life simultaneously. After reading this book, I was left with a feeling that said to me \\"you see, you are supposed to go through those confusing, painful and sad times right along with the good ones because its part of learning the power of your own discipline over your own mind through your will.\\" I will read another book by this man, just because of this one.Questions did come up for me, but I'll just go read more books and ponder those questions further.

Sure, it's all unprovable, but if you find the subject intriguing then you'll enjoy this book. (Others you might look for are Alan Landsburg's \\"In Search of Ancient Mysteries\\", Zecharia Sitchin's \\"Genesis Revisited\\", and--the best of the bunch, in my opinion--\\"Paradox\\" by John Philip Cohane.) No illustrations, but worth shelling out a couple of bucks for."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Threatening Anthropology tells how the FBI and senate committees spied on and harassed hundreds of anthropologists working for racial equality. Price gathered a lot of new documents and information and his analysis left me thinking in new ways about McCarthyism and how the FBI was used to enforce racist policies in the 1940s and 1950s. Price uses thousands of documents to show that the FBI was used to persecute pioneering scientists threatening widespread bigotry.Threatening Anthropology is a consuming, thought provoking book. Because there is a lot of dense information I thought I would slowly work my way through this over three or four weeks, but the writing and subject matter pulled me right in and I read it in a few days like I would a well written novel. Price really brings the reader into the story by richly describing the historical setting and then delving into dozens of individual stories telling how several dozen anthropologists like Melville Jacobs, Richard Morgan, Gene Weltfish, Ashley Montague and Margaret Mead were followed and harassed by the FBI because their fights for equality was seen as some sort of foreign communist plot. Price uses extensive FBI documents and correspondence to establish this story and brings an anthropological perspective that made me rethink what McCarthyism was.I used to wonder if the McCarthy like witch trials could happen again, and Price's detailed analysis and current political developments leave no doubts in my mind that we could do this again very quickly. This book has a lot to say to us all today and deserves to be read by anyone concerned about the abuses of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security in the war on terrorism, and the past examined here looks a lot like the present. As Price says in the final pages of his book, \\"Today, much as in the past, free thought, civil liberties and academic freedom are curtailed under conditions of fear as America appears to be preparing for another lengthy ill-defined war.\\" But Price doesn't leave us there, he gives us hope by analyzing past defenses against McCarthyism for us to use in the present."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Threatening Anthropology is a beautifully written, meticulously researched account of how J. Edgar Hoover, Senator Joseph McCarthy and others attacked anthropologists educating the public on scientific findings supporting racial equality. I passed this book on to non-anthropologist friends who found it to be a real page turner and were moved by the impassioned story Price artfully tells. This is a rare book that is carefully written for a board public readership, yet is so thoroughly researched and footnoted that historians and other scholars will find this to be an important contribution.This book will send shockwaves through the anthropological community. It should lead anthropology's historians to rethink their silence on the events documented here. How can it be that we learn so late that so many anthropologists from Franz Boas until now have been tormented by FBI spies? Have others known of these events and remained so silent for so long?While I studied anthropology during the decades discussed in this book I had no idea that my colleagues suffered the attacks detailed here, but I felt the pressures to avoid controversial advocacy that are documented here. Price may go too far in his criticism of postmodernism's contributions to anthropology's current crisis, but I find the historical positioning of his critique provocative.Threatening Anthropology should be read by all Americans concerned about the growing powers of the FBI and CIA."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Lots of good documentation allows Price to establish just how far the FBI went to torment scientists challenging racist and sexist popular views. It is as if J Edgar Hoover spied on Margaret Mead, Oscar Lewis, Ashley Montague and every other living anthropologist just because they believed that all people are equal. All the FBI files used in this book left a real chill with me, but it also left me more committed to speaking out and being more of an activist.A good book for any general reader questioning the Patriot Act and who wants to know why the FBI had its powers limited before Congress passed the \\"Patriot Act.\\""},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Threatening Anthropology is an important book--one that I hope will signal a signicant change in the way the history of anthropology is written. Prior to Price, historians such as George Stocking have taken an apolitical view of anthropology's history. This is unfortunate in large part because many founding members of the discipline were politically active and engaged. The anthropologists paid a heavy price for this political activism--a point that Price drives home effectively. Encyclopedic in approach, Price does a great job outlining how politically active anthropologists were persecuted and lost their jobs--while the American Anthropology Associaltion looked on and did nothing. Based on extensive research via the FOIA, Price is to be commended for his efforts. While Price has focused on the larger issue of the Cold War, for those who want a case study see William Peace's biography of Leslie A. White. Hopefull the work of Peace and Price will inspire other anthropologists to take a closer look at the history of anthropology. Taken together, Price's and Peace's work will signal a new era in writing about anthropology's past."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Few books can affect a reader so profoundly as this one has me. Price's book has received accolades -- \\"destined to become a classic,\\" and \\"belongs on anyone's shelf.\\" I wandered into the pages and, to my surprise and relief, found myself revisiting the underside of what I thought I had observed all along. Names were named, some of them among real live faculties I had known. I experienced a personal Eureka! when I learned that Jacobs and Stern, authors of that Barnes and Noble introduction to anthropology that I read in my formative years, had both been blacklisted. Now I must read that old paperback again and retrace where my interests might have started off in naive directions. I look forward to this self-study in self-censorship for the postmodern age.I was overjoyed that Price did not stop with the accepted, formalized \\"end\\" of McCarthyism, but rather explained the brief re-emergence of relative \\"academic freedom\\" through much of the '60s-'70s and '80s, and the more sophisticated, perhaps more dangerous downward spiral today. The book helps those of us who entered college at a time when Ashley Montagu, Kathleen Gough and so many others were in the news over issues other than their research. Price has prepared a thoroughgoing catalogue of official harassment targeting scholars who operated on now-popularly-accepted assumptions of global human worth and equality.The paradox is that, while anthropology has to rely on those assumptions if it is to operate as a field of intellectual endeavor, our audience -- any public -- does not, but they pay us anyway. Popular reactions to most anthropological contributions range from wonder to outrage. Anyone with basic grounding in anthropology would probably tell you that the field has always pushed the limits of acceptance within host countries, most of which have been main players of Western industrial civilization.As with the job interview, it is always important to understand who holds the purse strings. Western anthropologists have long pushed the limits of societal acceptance, and that has always had consequnces. Today's \\"globalization\\" of anthropology finds many individuals from societies that were traditionally the subjects of anthropological study, pushing those limits from new and refreshing directions, and, of course, the resulting consequences are also \\"globalizing.\\"We are such good people; why are we then so villified? Tired old explanations of \\"cultural lag\\", ethnocentrism, and differing viewpoints still work. But Price's contribution is a detailed catalog-summary with specific cases showing particularly what makes the United States Government antsy about anthropology. Until \\"Threatening Anthropology,\\" no one source discussed in context the prevailing governmental assumptions, and the various selected facts, political spins and, yes, myths on which government agencies often rely for those assumptions. Our tired, old explanations have finally got some help, as someone focused on the intersections between anthropology and host society as they are expressed in the United States.I have recollections from my own past when, during euphoric rushes of \\"academic freedom,\\" I presumed to speak from an anthropological perspective in ways that might draw the attention of, say, the FBI. Many of these run perilously close to Price's examples. One still wonders, but at the same time one has a grander perspective on why offers have not poured in from academia.Price's volume is indeed chilling. The prevailing situation within anthropology since well before Boas has been chilling. I keep in mind the smaller-scale analogy of covert ostracism on a band or tribal level. At least within our society there are other avenues of endeavor, and we can retain a view of that old anthropolgy \\"avenue\\" and see what's happening and what has happened to our former colleagues.Price does rather well with his conclusions. I am in some agreement with him over postmodernism insofar as many of its adherents appear to encourage the view that anthropology is only a part of Western science, and that as such it cannot do justice to any cross cultural perspective. Postmodernism in its \\"deconstruction\\" of positivism does appear to feed the late 20th century and continuing vogue for discounting what Mooney (The Republican War on Science) calls the \\"fact-based\\" perspective as irrelevant for today's policy-making. Such a notion would have frustrated Philleo Nash. I know it gets a double-take from me.I also agree whole-heartedly that organizations like the American Anthropological Association would do well to treat future governmental meddling with individual scholars' employment -- present and future versions of McCarthyism -- with less timidity. All organizations need a clear understanding of just what constituties grounds for employee discipline, and they need to know that other power centers back them up.Last time around the witch hunts came and went, leaving lasting scars. The issues are lively, and generate shouting-matches to this day. It was a political choice for organizations to remain in the background as \\"apolitical.\\" It would be no more a political choice to stand behind individual anthropologists and help them make reasonable stands should they find themselves going against those big guns."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Price hits his readers pretty hard in this brutal tale of shame. This will enrage some readers, but he's justified. He fights like Hotspur and marks out a clear lineage of blame & dishonor. Too bad so few who lived through the years described here are alive to read this account."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Strong scholarship supports this new explanation of attacks on academic freedom and activism in the 1950s. Very impressive research and well written. The volume of FBI records produced here is stunning, and this gave me a new view of the current chill at Yale, Columbia and elsewhere."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"Like another reviewer, I was unable to put down this outstanding and exceptionally disturbing book, a work of scholarship which has a much wider audience than anthropologists alone. I won't repeat the points made by others that Professor Price's work has clear political applications in the present day in academia generally. What I found engrossing was a side of anthropology which rarely or never emerged in my university courses, particularly in those which brought up sociology and anthropology's relation to literature (my own area of study). In the seminars hermeneutics was the focus and the specific emphasis was on signification cross-culturally. I think students (or at least I) got the impression that anthropology was indeed, as Professor Price notes, a science which shuns cultural hierarchies, but that technique was the crux of the authorial problem and that philosophies informing how these techniques came about were in second place. This isn't to say that the committments and philosophies of anthropologists could somehow be subordinated to the idea of the true text, but that an objectivity separate from ideology was, if not possible, at least desired.I can't remember whether I thought this was reasonable at the time, but in retrospect I see that my notions of how the anthropologist goes about her or his work was certainly limited. This book inspires me to read more in the history of this field and to go to the primary texts which the author provides in such rich abundance."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"This book deals with a very important and timely topic. The Cold War had a major impact on academia, and Price is to be applauded for undertaking such an extensive archival research project to document how these dynamics were manifest in anthropology. His greatest weakness, however, is an uncritical acceptance of the egalitarian rhetoric of the Soviet Union and the US Communist Party as signifying a genuine committment to humanitarianism and equality. This grossly inaccurate assumption underlies Price's key theme in the book: that the FBI and other security agencies in the United States (aka the bad guys) persecuted leftists and communists (aka the good guys) solely as a means to maintain existing race and class hierarchies in the United States. Anyone with a passing familiarity with the violence and aggression of communist party politics in the 1930s, or the history of the Soviet Union (including its genocidal approach to ethnic minorities within its own borders) should realize this is quite a crock. Price is certainly not alone in his myopia in this area: his assumptions reiterate many cherised illusions of the Left. While these shortcomings may have been forgivable in the past when knowledge about the Soviet Union was more uncertain, any contemporary scholar who ignores the overhwelming array of evidence and testimonials that have emerged from Soviet archives since the end of the Cold War renders himself and his work largely irrelevant to contemporary academic debates in this area. In that sense, Price's work fits in well with earlier anthropological activists, such as those who militantly defended the Rosenbergs as innocent victims of anti-Semitism and US Cold War hysteria. Soviet archives have shown, of course, that the Rosenbergs were quite guilty and their defenders in academia were willingly duped by the barrage of Soviet propaganda released on their behalf. Price continues to reiterate the same theme in his work, never once considering that a peek in the Soviet archives might offer interesting revisions to his assumptions. Did the KGB maintain files on Franz Boas, Margaret Mead and Gene Weltfish? This book would make a much greater and more lasting contribution to Cold War scholarship if the author had even a token awareness of the Soviet side of things. Unfortunately, like so many leftists, he is more intent on using FOIA to bash the United States rather than to undertake a serious analysis of the way anthropology became suspended (or distorted) between rival superpowers during the Cold War. For an insightful and disturbing account of how these dynamics have influenced other social sciences, see Harvy Klehr and John Haynes recent book \\"In Denial: Historians, Communism and Espionage.\\" It is much more enlightening than Price's work."},{"Title":"Threatening Anthropology: McCarthyism and the FBI&rsquo;s Surveillance of Activist Anthropologists","review":"The author's intent -- to examine the impact of McCarthyism on anthropology -- is a good one. Anthropology attracts a lot of liberal minded people (someone told me that they tend to register Democrat over Republican by a 30-1 ratio). However, what is disappointing about this book is that Price didn't seek out to interview more of the people who knew these anthropologists, as well as people in government who actually wrote such reports. For the most part, reports/texts are largely taken at face value, whereas in reality reports may have been received in greater or lesser degrees of seriousness and credibility. Thus, the tendency is probaby to exaggerate the degree of victimization."},{"Title":"Columbus and the world around him","review":"This was a good book for the facts but the writer chooses to be byist against the Europeans.

Similarly, he didn't comprehend that these items have been given a special value in our society. This story might be better appreciated by a child with knowledge of those concepts.

Peters traces the history from myth, religion, and recorded history (going back to Adam), and provides many interesting and flowing anecdotes using primary source material throughout the 1400 years of Hajj history. Here one will learn more about the steps of the pilgrimage and the layout of the Ka'ba (the building which Hajjis run around) than most Muslims know. Of particular interest is Peter's numerous stories of Hajj through Western eyes- Western Muslims, non-Muslims going to Mecca when it was still allowed, or non-Muslims sneaking into a city to make Hajj, though if they are found out it means death. The Westerner descriptions provide that etic, outsider perspective which is valuable for those of us who are not from the Middle East, as we grapple to understand religious events and customs and relate them to what we understand within ourselves and our culture."},{"Title":"The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places","review":"This is a fine academic study woven from the many writers who have recorded their experiences on hajj over its history. The only phrases which might be found objectionable to any Muslim come from the primary source readings, where a variety of viewpoints were deliberately sought. If some intruder like Richard Burton throws off a snide or irreverent comment, I think Muslims will know what to make of it. The author draws an interesting and informative history of one of humanity's greatest phenomena thru history up to the Saudi hajj of 1926. I would like to see this brought up to date."},{"Title":"The Hajj: The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places","review":"I read this book back in 2003.

Everyone who reads this book is affected in a similar way. While the statistics are solid and powerful, the book is accessible to everyone on every level. Someone who has no previous exposure to the American criminal justice system can easily gain a large knowledge base while criminal justice scholars will find the book to be a powerful summary of much that is wrong with the current system and its function (or, more accurately, disfunction) within society. From the motives that drive government officials and police officers to the effects that labeling individuals as criminals at a young age to the amount of tax dollars spent and manipulated every year by the government and government-funded agencies, the book clearly and effectively drives home the point that each and every individual in this country is, in one way or another, a victim of the &quot;War on Crime.&quot; The book is not preachy and does not make the reader feel as if they are being lectured but rather opens the reader's eyes as a view of the bigger picture inevitably hits home. Regardless of whether you consider yourself liberal, conservative, or just plain politically apathetic, reading this book will lead you to immediately develop an acute awareness that the American battle plan in the &quot;war on crime&quot; cannot prevail. The book thoughtfully and entertainingly compiles fact and truth in the form of statistics, research, and illustrative anecdotes in order to expose the real enemies in the war on crime. The American public is frequently made to believe that when it comes to our country's well-being, it's &quot;us&quot; against &quot;them.&quot; I think Chambliss would agree with that; however, in every war, those standing on the battlefield where weapons have been drawn must choose a side and Chambliss makes clear that many people have unknowingly been given misleading ideas about who the &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; are.Simply stated, the effect of the book is to place every reader within the plot of a classic children's story. Too many have lived for too long with the fear that the sky is falling, not realizing that all are actually being cleverly lured into Foxy Loxy's den.If everyone in this country were required to read this book, America would be a better place."},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Reflexology: Therapeutic Foot Massage for Health and Wellbeing (Complete Guide)","review":"This is the best overall presentation of reflexology that I have found and I have been studying and applying this discipline for many years.

What are the known bugs?2. Are you going to release a more clear and accurate player's manual?If you decide to use this software, you are going to have a lot of students asking you a lot of questions. The students will be confused because what is stated in the manual is contradicted in the simulation. For example, the book says not to allocate a resource over 100% otherwise they will suffer a penalty. Well some of our teams did this, and they got a higher ranking as a result. The book is flawed. There are many other examples of this.I have emailed the authors a list of concerns and bugs, but they have yet to respond. They probably realize the errors and bugs, but don't want to publicly acknowledge it. Well unfortunately now the word is going around that simproject is vaporware.Its a great idea and potentially an excellent teaching tool, but the simulation is just buggy. The bugs will cause you as an instructor headaches."},{"Title":"SimProject Player's Manual and Access Code","review":"I am a graduate student and a software developer with 5 years of experience in the industry. It may not sound like much but I believe I had experiences that allow me to form some semi-solid opinion about it.Normally, I would not bother leaving reviews but this product is out of bonds!Both the simulation and the book are very 'buggy'!The book is, in effect, a manual for the simulation. It has contradicting ideas and statements all over. I gave up reading the manual after 20 pages. It is not just my opinion. My professor said not once that the book is a disaster. Many of my class mates expressed the same idea.Simulation itself is something of the same sort. For example, the whole project is broken down into periods with specific tasks in each period. After decisions made by players/teams the software posts results of a project period simulation. The ultimate goal is to achieve the 'milestone' at the end of each period. Now, without much knowledge about the simulation (which, by the way, is very hard to come by in the ambiguous book and simulation itself, as you will see in a bit) the question is 'how on earth you are supposed to plan ahead and build your strategies if the software tells you that a project team member's efficiency is 95% for a particular task and the task is done within allowed time 100% and the milestone is not achieved?!Reasons for failures..., no, they don't bother to explain.If any of programmers or designers of the SimProject read this, I hope nobody will buy the product untill you fix your stuff! Nothing personal, but the quality of your product is bad!"},{"Title":"SimProject Player's Manual and Access Code","review":"Careful with buying a used copy of this book. The code provided in the book only works once, and without it, you can't register for the simulation, and you'll have to buy a brand new book in order to do so.If you are thinking of buying a used book, realize that the previous owner may have already used the code, and it will therefore not work for you."},{"Title":"SimProject Player's Manual and Access Code","review":"The Good: The Sim Project is a good tool for people who dont have any project experience whatsoever. It moves the \\"player\\" through the process of resourcing a project, what the cost or value of the various resources do to the outcome of the project, and it allows the user see the outcome in the tool that is perhaps most widely used to track projects, MS Project.The Bad:To use the book and the game there must be an instructor involved. You can not purchase this book and expect to use it outside of a class setting.The code that is used to access the site is good for only one simulation, and once the simulation has begun you can not change the initial parameters to see how it would turn out using different decisions.Cost is another factor at $40 for one round of play seems a bit much, but remember that this is an academic text. However the real item you are paying for is the code to access the site. The book can be downloaded from the site, and should be to get the most recent version.Overall: Good simulation, Good view of the project process, Brings people together to work the process, Gives students an understanding of real life scenarios without a professor having to manufacture the materials."},{"Title":"TrainSmart: Perfect Trainings Every Time","review":"This book works for me simply because it is down to earth, practical and easy to follow, it should be in every trainers collection.The book is based on the Trainsmart model which has evolved out of the latest brain research, it works, people learn efficiently in a friendly and challenging environment.Each topic is carefully explained in plain language and supported by the reasons why it works and how it should be incorporated.

(I suppose, I wouldn't know...)Not to mention that the page layout makes it incredibly hard to read! I was very surprised that this came from a graphic designer. The text is written in a tiny font (I don't wear glasses and I had trouble) in the margins of the pages over a background with some thin blue lines. The lines aren't such a big deal, but they do really distract from reading, and it's hard enough to read the book as it is. The design samples weren't easy to see in every case either. They weren't just laid out as is, the author chose to make the layout &quot;design-ey&quot;. I know, I know, you can't be great at everything (meaning he's a fine designer, but I don't think textbooks are his thing,) so cut the guy some slack.

(In this case, non-standard English dialect as supposedly spoken -- and perhaps, 80-100 years ago, actually spoken -- by Jewish people?) It's embarrassing, to say the least, for most young moderns of the 21st century -- Jews and others sensitive to stereotyping, but especially, in this case, perhaps Jews -- who simply want to be known as INDIVIDUALS, and not as stereotypes! (Don't forget, that once, not too long ago, \\"non-standard English\\" used to be called, \\"sub-standard English\\"!)Well, at least the recipes are not written in dialect, which is a refreshing change from the text of this book. There are still people, I realize, who enjoy reading \\"the way momma and poppa used to talk\\" -- but for those of us who did not have parents who spoke in dialect, and who remember cringing when listening to any dialect, (of any ethnic group -- especially one's own), in a film, theatre, or TV production -- this cook-book, however well-intentioned, can easily make a sensitive reader loose his or her appetite!Thus cautioned, however, (and I was not), one might look into this book further, and try to rise above the not-so-funny dialect, and look for other things which can make a book enjoyable: good illustrations, large, readable-sized type, good quality paper, a quality binding -- and, in the case of a cookbook, easy-to-make, easy-to-follow, delicious-to-eat recipes. I am glad to report that, along with the difficult-to-digest dialect, and dialect \\"humour\\", these other \\"ingredients\\" are also all in this book!It's nice to see, for example, that the drawings of the author -- a blonde, and thin lady -- are accurately drawn. Yes, the \\"fat Jewish hosewife\\" of lore IS also shown....but this is another person -- probably the author's mother from whom she has learnt cooking. Thd drawings are delightfully humourous....and if they do show a stereotyped expression or two, at least their realty is grounded in the NON-stereotyped, true-to-life thinness and blondness of the author, whose picture is on the back cover.One can lear a lot about Jewish cooking from the many authenic recipes in this book. Most are easy and fun to make....and even easier, and more fun, to eat!A full index is given in this book, but sadly, no glossary. So, you must either gather the meaning of words like \\"shmaltz\\" from the surrounding text, (not a difficult thing to do), look them up in a Yiddish/English dictionary, or in a book like Leo Rosten's \\"The Joys of Yiddish\\", etc.(\\"Shmaltz\\", by the way, is chicken fat....)This is the first, (and hopefullly the last), Jewish Cookbook I will come across that is written in \\"pig-Yiden\\" English. (Or perhaps, as pigs are not kosher, one should say \\"chick-Yiden\\" English.) This is one good cookbook, designed and printed....but those \\"funny\\"? dialect-ridden words of \\"explanation\\", betwixt the receipes, are enough to make at least my own stomach, turn and churn, with the greatest of discomfort!"},{"Title":"The Zaddik: The Doctrine of the Zaddik According to the Writings of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoy","review":"Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoy, the subject of this 1973 study by Samuel Dresner, was the closest disciple of the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism. In this book, Dresner presents an academic (but very readable) exploration of Reb Yaakov's model for the Zaddik, or Hasidic Rebbe -- the saintly leader who is capable of achieving the highest degree of connection (devekus) with God, while, at the same time, also being the center of a community. This book would be of interest to anyone -- Jewish or not -- who wants to understand what a saintly Jewish life is like.Reb Yaakov, the subject of this study, didn't start out as a Hasid. In fact, he was quite opposed to the movement. His &quot;conversion&quot; took place when the Baal Shem Tov came to town one day and started telling stories in the marketplace, which, in turn, delayed the people from coming to prayers on time. Reb Yakkov, who was the town rabbi, became furious, and ordered the storyteller brought to him. When they came face-to-face, the Baal Shem Tov told a story that so deeply moved the rabbi's heart, that he immediately called him &quot;master&quot; and remained his closest disciple for life.However, Reb Yaakov was not much of a &quot;people person,&quot; being more of a scholarly ascetic, so, after the death of his master, leadership of the Hasidic movement passed to Rabbi Dov Ber of Mezeritch (the Great Maggid) instead. Reb Yaakov's greatest contribution was to write the first book about Hasidism, called the &quot;Toldot Yaakov,&quot; upon which much of this book is based.Dresner does an excellent job of presenting Yaakov Yosef's teachings, along with a great deal of historical background about the Jewish world of his time. What emerges is a very clear picture of the deep spirituality of the Baal Shem Tov and hiis early disciples, with a model of what a Hasidic Rebbe should be like. This book is an excellent read --- my only complaint is the price which, like so many reprints by Jason Aronson lately, is simply astronomical for a paperback edition. But there are lots of used copies around (it's been through several Schocken editions already), so, if your budget is limited, set your Amazon Auction Alerts for this title, or borrow one from the library. But do read it!"},{"Title":"The Zaddik: The Doctrine of the Zaddik According to the Writings of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoy","review":"Yonasson Gerson's review of this book on the Amazon Site is outstanding, and gives a real sense of what this book is. I would only add one point about the character and nature of 'The Tzaddik'in general.The whole Hasidic movement came into being at a time when the Jewish people were poor and suffering, and in need of spiritual guidance and help. Their leaders deep in study were remote. The Baal Shem Tov came into the world and taught love of the common people. The Tzaddik who became their leader , the new kind of ideal Rabbi and Teacher was one who valued the common people and taught them at their own level. The teaching became a teaching of story and song and parable also. And the great Tzaddikim became the true advocates of the people , the common people in every way.Of course there was a later development in terms of huge courts being built up, and other elements entering.This particular work is a study of one Tzaddik , Yaakov Yosef of Polnoye a disciple of the Baal Shem Tov. Rabbi Dresner writes with learning and sympathy and illuminates not only a life, but also a world, the world of early Hasidism."},{"Title":"The Zaddik: The Doctrine of the Zaddik According to the Writings of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef of Polnoy","review":"While the language is easy-to-read, I had to plow through this book because of its verbosity and redundancy. It doesn't fully describe what a Zaddik is or does, but it does provide some high-level examples. Strangely, R. Yaakov Yosef's definition closely matches the Mahayana Buddhist idea of the Bodhisattva who, while having enlightenment in sight personally, returns to the mundane world in order to help others and assist in raising them up from the muck. The dangers described herein also match. This is reminiscent of Shimon Halevi's comment about contemporary folks leaving Western religions and going East to look for spirituality when it already exists in the West. Here's a case in point. The author, rightly, describes the problem that the early Hasids had regarding the Sabbatean heresy (in which a self-styled messiah converted to Islam under pain of death) and the more (to him) contemporary parallel of Jacob Frank (who brought his followers into Christianity). Both of them used the precept of the leader lowering himself down to a low level in order to raise the people of that level to greater heights. They obviously took this to a great extreme (especially from a Jewish, not to mention Orthodox, perspective). Nonetheless, this is a scholarly work (also read expensive); it has lots of endnotes (mostly in Hebrew--and I like to read the endnotes in books). It also has a 3-page Conclusion at the end of the text. If you can find this book in the library (or borrow it), you can just read the Conclusion. It's a concise, cogent summary of the book. Well worth the read.

Of course, you always have the option of lessening the effects, if you REALLY want your players' characters to survive...Overall, this book is just plain fun, if not dangerous!

The traps still are as lethal as can be, and in my opin were just waaaay too nasty for all of the old school gamers from way back. Thankfully S&S press has added in DC modifiers for deactivating the triggers, and the entire trap which is nice for all the rogues in the group. The art work is still very nice, and nearly all the traps, objects, hallway, and doors are depicted in nice B&W sketches. From whirling blades of death, gravity wells, whipped cream filled pits, and waterfalls made of shaved diamond shards.

It shows--pictorially, using two different styles--how a youngster can put the concepts they represent immediately to work. The book goes well beyond the \\"save your pennies\\" philosophy I was raised on. The book introduces terms that some kids never hear until they take their first economics class. I liked the presentation style that looks vaguely like a Tim Allen movie--artistic washes, subtle tones. Kids will love the brightly colored segments. More importantly--for the parents at least--they are sure to absorb some sound ideas about ensuring their own futures.

The narrative is easy to follow and the illustrations are appropriate to the subject matter. At one point, I felt myself checking my own finances to see if I was on the right track to financial freedom through asset-building versus liability-building!The book makes readers think about their financial future without resorting to scare tactics. The reader's choice is simple: either continue to run from paycheck to paycheck or create financial building blocks to pave your way to financial independence. The authors warn not to place all your eggs in one basket or spend your pennies on useless junk that will end up costing you more in the end.The examples are generic with age-appropriate examples such as comic books, bicycles and newspaper routes. The ending is a little overdone, in my opinion, as a child without financial knowledge might not have the wherewithal to open an ice cream stand after one month. Nonetheless, the tone is upbeat and motivating. I highly recommend this comic book for any parent who is willing to help his or her child gain a healthy understanding and long-term relationship with wealth and the benefits it brings.Christine Louise Hohlbaum, American expat author of Diary of a Mother (2003) and SAHM I Am: Tales of a Stay-at-Home Mom (May 2005), worked at Putnam Investments once upon a time.

A person who reads this book must have a small amount of general science. The book was written to appeal to the general population who is curious about the stars and their makeup. You will find the math is minimum. It will introduce the reader to the Sun's turbulent surface, how solar activity influence the Earth, The Law of Plasma, the concept of the atom and the energy that an atom has, the definition of a Red Giant and White Dwarf and how they evolve, with a historical perspective of how these theories have evolved over the years.

I laughed out loud at least 10 times, especially on the part of the book when Davis's mom put a \\"Spongebob\\" band-aid on his [unmentionable part]. That was hilarious, Toschia's writing style is extremely \\"real\\" yet it's obvious that she is well versed in literature and advanced writing techiniques.

Toschia takes you on a tale-spin from wild sex, to church, to the voodoo lady and the fight scene at Hooter's was off the chain. This book was such an AWESOME read for a first time novelist. I couldn't put it down literally and overslept for my grad school finals. Toschia is \\"WRONG\\" for having Sister Corrine come to church in army fatigues and stand up and testify that she was a soldier in the Lord's army and had made the rank of Captain. This book is truly a story of love, family and friendship. This was a realistic, hilarious drama, drama and baby daddy drama for real. I can't wait for the sequel! I loved the Afro-Caribbean culture themes that were put in the novel and the passages in both French and Spanish were on point, and the vodoo.. Oh GOD! I can't stop raving about this book! and the ending!"},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"Go Girl!!! Toschia excellent job on your debut novel!

Toschia weaved a laugh out loud story about love, family and baby's daddy drama.Reviewed byDawn"},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"First off I would like to say that for those of you who had negative reviews saying that you found this book unrealistic or too far fetched, you must be living in a fantasy world. I just recently read the book and even though the book was written several years ago, it serves to be very true. I know some of these people in similar situations. We often are so busy looking for love that we forget about what is best for us. We are so busy trying to make others happy. No one wants to be lonely. Everyone wants love and companionship and like the song says many times we go looking for love in all the wrong places. I know moms like Davis's mother. They enable their kids, instead of telling them right from wrong they just let them do whatever. They fail to let their children grow up and be the true adults that they should be. When you are sick and tired of being lonely you often through tradition out the window just to try something new even though that something new isn't always good for you. In these days and time this isn't only happening to women but to men also. I have heard that true love is so hard to find these days. Many love and give their all while getting close to known in return. I say it's a must read for realism; sex, lies, deceit, voodoo, poverty, judging, ect. All these things happen in everyday life and she did a wonderful job of bringing it too life."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"When you thought things couldn't get any worse, Toschia took you there. This book is full of drama and comedy. These are things you overhear ladies talk about in the salon. They tell the story as if it were their friends but they're talking about their own life. This story is what needs to stay in books but for some it's a sad reality. Rhea put up with a hell of a lot with Davis. You Wrong For That showed us as women how Love clouds our judgement. We know the situation isn't perfect but we believe that love brings change. Love will make it better if we give it more time. Time comes and goes and things are still a mess. This is a great read. I laughed so hard throughout the book.

Rhea is beyond stupid when it comes to this man. he has kids by another woman that his mother keeps. she has encounters with the baby mama and still take back her man. he's a liar, with no real job or income and it's just plain ridiculous.

Ms. Neaves accused the author of posting her own reviews. That is a lie! This is a good book and people love it, otherwise Ms. Moffett wouldn't have gotten a major publisher to re-release it. And the fact that Ms. Neaves had absolutely nothing to say about the the book itself is sad that it was even allowed to be posted. In addition Ms. Neaves is a not even African-American but a white girl with a vendetta. This book is awesome!

I picked up this book thinking it was going to be great, and it turned out to be a typo ridden pile of crap. If this is the future of AA fiction, God help us all. Every character is poorly drawn and completely unlikeable. Rheonique is stupid and psycho and in the end, no better than the other baby mammas. If you are thinking about &quot;Purchasing this item&quot;, take a few deep breaths until the impulse passes and pick up some Brenda Jackson. At least she writes educated characters with some class instead of this ghetto trash."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"Honestly, I met Toschia at the Harlem Bookfest in New York when she was promoting her self-publish version of this book. Since she was among \\"very few first time self publishers there,\\" I knew she had to be someone special, and I was right. After reading this book, I was speechless. I called my daughter and said, \\"If you thought Sista Souljah's \\"Coldest Winter\\" was headed for the big screen, then you've got to read \\"You Wrong For That.\\" As a somewhat older educated woman, I thought that all so-called \\"educated women,\\" like myself, possessed common sense and would never fall prey to men like Davis. Well, after reading this masterpeice, I must say, \\"I was wrong.\\" My thought is that all of you \\"educated women\\" need to become street wise like the book's character Terri.I was elated to learn from my daughter that Toschia had re-released her book under a major publishing company. I guess the publishing company knew she was talented. Yes, I'm biased towards her first version, and yes the re-released (not self-published but Major Published) version contains typos, but it is still a good book which contains \\"lessons\\" that many of its \\"educated\\" women readers need to know. Take note from the book--\\"Warning does come before destruction.\\" Wake up women; men like Davis do exist... If you don't take heed, you too can become a victim. Finally, it is important to remember that not everyone is going to like everything. And, opinions are like rectums--everyone has one. My suggestion is \\"buy it, read it, and judge for yourself.\\" Continued success in the literary world Toschia, and I await your next masterpiece..."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"I'm sorry, but this book was not good.

Not only did I choke on a few occasions, I almost wanted to email Toschia and ask if she had ever been committed? or sought psychological treatment. This book had drama from page 1 to the end. Toschia put together a wonderful story of family, customs and baby daddy drama. There was so much going on, that you cannot put this book down. The book opens with the main character Rhea going back in time recapturing her wedding,Rhea accuses the priest of molesting litle boys. She meets Davis a coworker and after she becomes pregnant from him the drama continues. This boy has two other baby's mammas. Rhea's family is just as crazy as she is and will do anything to keep her from Davis. Each baby mamma is pathetic in their own way, but Davis is just wrong. He leaves his high-paying job to live with his parent's and takes a job dressed as &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and sings hooks'. His parent's allow each baby mamma to come over back to back weekends. Davis never changes the sheets, Rhea's Caribbean mob family hooks up with Baby Mamma 1 to get rid of him. Baby Mamma 2 is pathetic and lives with her morbidly obese mother and her little brother who rides the &quot;short bus.&quot; And Rhea, although intelligent is stupid as hell for putting up with all of this. Sister Corrine comes to church with a army uniform on and sings &quot;I'mma Soldier in the Army of the Lord.&quot; And that's not even half-way through.

I was in awe from the wedding scene at the beginning of the novel until the accident at the end. This was literally a pageturner that I did not put down, I know I laughed out loud at least 50 times. This novel was a story of baby daddy drama, family loyalty, love, satire and steamy sex all rolled together. Rhea the main character meets Davis Hickman who is obviously beneath her in both morals and money, he gets this high-class sista' pregnant, but he already has two other baby mamma's. Terri, who is really crazy but at least will stand up to Davis and then there is Noel, she is just pityful and is nasty.. I almost choked on the part of the novel when Davis's mother said that Noel could not come back to the family house because she left her &quot;soiled female items&quot; on the bathroom floor, the book was totally wild, but so realistic at the same time. I LOVED IT!! and can't wait for the sequel. I know I'm leaving out a lot but this book is too good to put everything in a review, go buy your copy now. Toschia has done a wonderful, awesome, fabulous job with her debut novel and I know that this will be a best-seller, although the novel is full of drama, the plot is great and there are times that you just want to cry.

It is just too much!This book has everything...humor, love, death, voodoo, religion, the trifling boyfriend, baby mamas (yes it's more than one), ex husband, ex boyfriends, and then the main character, the good, innocent, naive women who pays for it all, physically, mentally, spiritually and monetary. Believe me, you are not going to want this book to end, and it doesn't. Toschia is bringing out the sequel. &quot;You Wrong For That&quot; is a page turner. It took me one day to read it and I was filled with so many different emotions.I sat there and yelled at Rheonique, one of the main characters, for being so stupid, which was easy to say from the outside looking in. However, when I compared it to my own life experiences, we had so much in common. SCARY!! A life full of drama, never knowing who or what to believe, having Mr. Wrong in your life, having to shed out a lot of money to take care of your other half's broke behind and all his drama, and last but not least having the overprotective family that sometimes cares just a little bit too much. And the drama continues.Listen up world! This is just one of those books that you just have to buy, not borrow from your homie or your book club leader.

Toschia takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for love, humor and spirituality.- spiritiuality totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. With her impeccable research, Toschia introduces us to aspects and interpretations of Caribbean history and mysticism I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly,leaving the novel, and time and time again,going online to research Toschia's research - only to find a new world of possibilities opening up for me. This book was a true stroke of genius, you find yourself lost in the character's plot's and everyday drama but at the same time become so mesmerized by the genius of Toschia's writing and real-life situations that transcend from rural Arkansas to Atlanta to Haiti. I have been bragging on this book for weeks.

Davis's first baby mama Terri plots with Rhea's West Indian Family against Davis, meanwhile the second baby mamma Noel is playing both sides. This book had so much drama that I was laughing most of the time and crying, especially when Rhea got into the car accident in Haiti. This book was excellent, especially for a first time novelist. It was a perfect blend of \\"ghetto drama\\" but excellent writing all rolled together."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"This book was given to me by someone who thought I would really enjoy it since I have been on the wrong end of a cheating man. It was a quick read, fairly fast paced, though slow in several spots, and sort of fun if I turned my brain off.The characters clearly lack any development. I feel as if they were gotten off the back of a cereal box they are so one-dimensional. The only vaguely developed character is Rhea and she makes absolutely no sense. Even though the author attempts to explain Rhea's lack of self-confidence because of her relationship with her mother, it still makes no sense how she could go from professional, well educated, wealthy woman to a hot ghetto mess. It makes absolutely no sense especially given her close relationship with her father, a sense of belonging to her community and extended family, and her countless hours with a therapist.As far a sex scenes go, I've gotten more emotional feedback from a Ron Jeremy porno. Can there BE any more cliches in the sex scenes? He has a really big [...] and she is so tight she tears up his [...]? WHAT?The editor should be put in front of a firing squad. Was there even an editor? The ending was bizarre and unsatisfactory. The plot is horribly ridiculous in the worst way. There really aren't enough bad things I can say about this book. The author would have me believe that EVERYBODY is straight ghetto and every possible thing that could happen to a woman happens to this ONE woman. She gets pregnant on birth control. She not only gets pregnant, but gets pregnant with twins. One of the twins will save the world or something. Of course, it would be the boy who saves the world. She delivered of her twins in the middle of a car wreck by a medicine woman of sorts who pronouces the boy as special then disappears into thin air. I feel like I read a soap opera script. What happens in the next book? Maybe everybody will thinks she is dead and she miraculously comes back to life.Girlfriend should write for Bold and the Beautiful."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"This book was really good. The language was a bit harsh at times, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"I'm very pleased with &quot;You Wrong For That,&quot; in fact I'm ecstatic. Often times in America the contributions of person's from the West Indies and the Carribbean are so often ignored. The influences of those of West Indian descent such as Busta Rhymes' Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs, Delory Lindo, Sammy Sosa have bustled their way into mainstream America. Now Toschia has taken the literary world by storm with her own genre that I'd call &quot;multi-cultural&quot; hip-hop fiction.This novel is an exquisite introduction to Afro-Caribe themes, culture, and the plight of family. Toschia has magically interwoven these themes into a book that is filled with laugh-out loud Jerry Springer drama, voodoo and hot bedroom escapades.The main character Rheonique like so many young women today have it all, money, career and beauty. Rheonique becomes &quot;unequally yoked&quot; with a man, although intelligent can't get enough of the ladies. This book is by far the funniest that I've read all year and every last baby mamma and book character will leave you saying at some point. &quot;You Wrong For That&quot;A stunning, captivating debut novel!Anna PierreThe West Indian AssociationChicago, Illinois"},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"This book is drama on top of drama.

In addition to her impressive educational background, beauty and poise, after her reading of a few excerpts from her novel I know I had to purchase &quot;You Wrong For That.&quot; I bought it yesterday and just finished it some 23 hours later. The novel resounds with plot, action and flows from page to page. I am normally not a reader of AA literature, but Toschia has touched on many themes in this book that are universal but at the same time show the beauty of black culture without being degrading. I laughed out loud at least a zillion times, and on the part where the character Davis sings &quot;hooks&quot; for a singing telegram service dressed in a &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; costume, I too like another reviewer almost &quot;peed&quot; in my pants! This book was fabulous and a work of literature that should be exposed.

So I finally went one day and purchased the book and I have to say the first couple of chapters it is a slow read but hang in there Toschia is wrong for writing this book and not e-mailing me to run and get the book, I was laughing so hard all the way thru the book I kept going over and over the words and the chapters cause I couldn't believe some of the stuff she was thinking and saying with these characters. See I am a dedicated reader and not all the times I write reveiws but for me to spend my time writing about a review it's well worth it!!!!

But I had the please in meeting the author years ago, when she first wrote the novel..and I must say it was hilarious!Toschia writes with such a vivid picture being painted and basically allows her characters to just be as real as this world can get!Glad to say that I have 'You Wrong for That' in my library!"},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"The book was good but made you wonder how dumb are we women and how gullible we are when we grave attention and love. Rhea seems like she has it all together but she doesnt and due to the factthat she wants to feel loved and appreiciated she falls into the traps of a man she thought was \\"THE ONE\\" and turns out to be something \\"TOTALLY\\" opposite. You will follow Rhea in this story and discover the trail of deciption and lies this man has spread like a disease. Also the disfunctional family he was sprawn from may be the reason why he is the way he is.

But the author needs to edit the next one better or hire someone to do it."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"This was a good book. Rhea was one stupid and naive woman. The fact that she was Cuban and Haiti made the book interesting. I liked how throughout the book she would make a notion of how her family believe in voodoo, and how she has a family who would kill for her. Davis was a LLOOSSEERR!! He sucked and deserved what he had coming. I recommend this book for all my sistas who have had to put up with a no good man, and for my sistas who haven't."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"Toschia's debut work is very funny in a BET Comic View kind of way.

This book really was not what I expected, in a good way. I expected baby daddy drama from the title but the extra's were the bomb! I had to leave my desk at work at a prestigious plastic surgeon's office a total of 5 times I was laughing so hard. This is a must-read for lover's of fiction, family and relationship reader's and who would have thought that this plot would be so &quot;tight&quot; and crisp for an unknown first time author. I am leaving out specifics about the book on purpose because this is a true must-read, must-have and Toschia will have you on the floor crying! There is a scene where the male-character sings jingles dressed as Dora the Explorer! Bravo Toschia, I can't wait for the sequel and you know you are &quot;Wrong For That&quot;A happy reader,Brenda HallFredericksburg, VA"},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"Toschia would like us to believe that Rhea, our protagonist, is this strong yet sassy sista who's got it going on making a life for herself in Hotlanta. She comes from a wealthy family with a strong and proud Haitian/Cuban heritage. With close friends and family and organizational involvements, one would think that Rhea is complete, but is she?The books' opening pulls you in. Rhea tells of her divorce from Marcus. Amidst doubts and fears, she thought she was destined to live the \\"perfect life\\" of a Doctor's wife. But unbeknownst to Rhea, a \\"friend\\" has wormed her way into Marcus's life and puts a knife in the coffin of an already doomed marriage. She swears off men until Davis enters. Afraid of being hurt again, she tries not to be enticed into starting another relationship but is quickly swept off her feet and lured into more drama than she'd ever imagine. Should she stay or should she go is the question? Why the answer is ostensibly so hard is beyond me.Rhea's reasoning for her actions were too far fetched for words. Like most of us, sometimes Rhea has mood swings, raging hormones and family issues to content with. And yes, sometimes the heart and the mind are not always on the same page. This still wasn't enough to justify being so blinded by such a non-deserving, immature and uncaring man.I won this book and therefore had to write a review. Besides, the author's a Soror so I really wanted to like it. True, the lack of editing was a distraction but can almost be overlooked with hot-tempered dialog and explicit sex scenes. However, the underdeveloped relationships made it hard for you to empathize with Rhea. You Wrong For That fell short of being a well thought-out fun read. I'm confident though that the sequel (there has to be a sequel) will surely be better."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"I think it's terrible that people can now voice their personal hatred about an author instead of rating the work fairly. It's terrible that reader's are allowed to repost negative reviews under different names and accuse the author of faking reviews. I like most readers look at reviews when looking to purchase books. Once I saw a review by best-selling author Sheila Goss (www.sheilagoss.com)of &quot;Roses are Thorns&quot; of the Talented Tenth Reviewers and saw that it was favorable I purchased it. This was a very good book, it had some typo's but most self-published books do. The editing issues were not so that you wanted to not read the book, the drama was so intense that whatever few typos there were was not a big deal. If it was so terrible it wouldn't be re-released from a major publisher. This book was full of drama, suspense and is a very good book. Other's think so too.

I, like all of my friends are tired of these ole' people books that resonate with too much holier than thou themes, but on the other hand what do you have? downright gutta trash. I got shot 10 times so I wrote a book theme, yes.. Toschia, yes... you have found the middle ground the represents the mass majority of us readers today, a lil' sumpin sumpin for the boughetto! and Soror big ups' to you. This book had drama from page 1 to the end! it had religion but didn't preach, it was def comedy jam comedy, it had steamy, raw, sex, it had voodoo, it had other cultures and languages and guess what? it had an excellent plot. Toschia wrote her butt off in this book and it's hard to believe that this is a first time novelist because \\"You Wrong for That\\" is just as good, let me correct myself better than some of your everyday names. Finally a writer that has taken a Creative Writing or English class or two! And can still make you laugh and scream at the characters at the same time. This book was way over the top, I wanted to kill the main charater Rhea on one page then, I felt sorry for her and wanted to kill her baby's daddy. The voodoo lady with the elephant tusk bracelet scared the h*$% out of me! The sex was just the bomb, I'm too through with that bathtub scene and the \\"milk\\" bath! ugh!! All I want to know is why did Davis send Baby Mamma #2 home on a greyhound bus with two faded-Dukes of Hazard pillowcases? why didn't he have a blanket?Why did he want Baby Mamma#1 to cash her student loan check in and buy her own engagement ring from Wal-Mart? Why Lord Why did Davis show his mamma his \\"thang\\" and why did she put green alcohol and a sponge-bob bandaid on it? Was Willie Mae Hicman a tard' or what? and Davis's father was a moocher with a bad attitude! This book was retarted! Why did both baby's mamma's steal the earned income tax credit and he had to borrow money from Baby Mamma #3. What was on Davis's lip???

Man, was I let down. The book had a wonderful plot which I am sure many sistahs have been through, but it was turned into a jumbled mess that was hard to follow. One minute, a baby momma is telling her crazy stuff with her man and in the next page she is sleeping with him and cooking for his family. What is up with that?

I mean all the evidence was laid out before her at every step of the way and yet she still turned a blind eye to it. Why would she even want that broke trifling liar to be around her children. If she had ended up marrying him, she would have gotten everything that she deserved. I mean this shows that with so much education some people still lack commonsense. I also blame her mother who had no sense of values whatsoever. There has got to be a sequel so miss toschia needs to get to it.

At first she doesnt want any dealings with Davis because she is still getting over her recent divorce with Marcus, but Davis gets her interests going with his \\"smooth operator\\" personality.As the drama unfolds, Rhea finds out that not only does Davis have baby mama drama to the second power and crazy parents, but this fool is younger than he claims and also never had a real job.I was so hurt @ how silly Rhea was being when it came to Davis. I found myself yelling @ the book telling her to wake up and smell the coffee and get out of fantasy land.I am so glad she finally came to her senses @ the end of the book.I wish the book wouldnt have ended the way it did, but I guess Toschia figures we (the reader) will know what happened next.Maybe she will do a sequel??If you love drama, then check this book out."},{"Title":"You Wrong For That","review":"Loved this book, I'm from Belize and I must say that it's about time somebody represented from the Islands.

My only complaint, who in the hell was the editor? This is the third urban book that I've read from this line that was awful. They have misspellings, and somebody did not do a basic spell check. I'm in a bookclub so I know that in most cases the author does not edit their work, such a good book to have the only thing wrong with it is the fact that somebody slacked up on three different Urban Books.

WHATEVER! This book was great, the editing could have been a little tightened up, but it was just as good actually better than some of the works published by the major author's. The few editing issues had nothing to do with this plot, nor did it take away from the story line! You're going to find a comma splice in anything! Rhea, the main character is basically duped by her baby daddy Davis who has two other baby's mamas and didn't tell her. This book is a true rollercoaster that never gets dull. I can't wait for the sequel! I loved the characters, they were all just ghetto enough but without being downright gutter and trashy..

I woke up this morning with this book on my mind! I absoloutely loved the whole thing where Rhea was going back in time, this book should not be put into one category because Toschia is a da#% good writer who not only had an excellent plot but had little mini-plots as well. I'm so happy to see that finally a black author put in themes from the millions of us from the islands. I totally loved the passages in Spanish and French!

I don't normally post reviews, but this book was great for a first time self-published author. This is a rollercoaster that leaves you anxious to read the sequel.

If we cannot draw on the example of Jesus to relate to our teenagers, then what good is our faith? As Christians we are uniquely gifted to deal with life, especially teenage sons and daughters. I was impressed with the examples. I recommend this book for parents *and* for teenagers, as both should come to a better understanding of each other after reading it."},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"I always find Peterson's writing hard to follow - and I feel somewhat left out because (a) we are not your typical American Family (we are Australian) and (b)the adults of the family are 'recent converts'. This means that a lot of the examples get bypassed as 'irrelevant' (there are differences in culture) and some of the statements are hard to accept because they refer to families well grounded in Christ - for example, when Peterson asserts that Christian parents have a deep trust in God, I find myself thinking 'well, actually, I still don't quite...'.However, some of the suggestions are very valid, no matter what the family background is - and for any parent struggling through in the adolescent phase of their children's life, his concept of treating it as an opporunity rather than a problem to be solved takes away a lot of angst, guilt and even a couple of arguments."},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"This is a reallt great book for parents and pastors who need to work with youths.

I am reminded of this underlying anxiety when they, now in their primary school years, express disappointment in my decisions. When the emotional storms escalate, I suspect the turmoils I feel may be a faint wind of what is to come. What I remember (and what I forget) of my own teenage years does not give me any more confidence.So Peterson's classic book on parenting teenagers is welcome preparation. What I love is it presents adolescence not as a problem to solve, not a challenge to meet with techniques, but as a gift. Peterson says adolescence is God's gift to the child for their transition into adulthood, and also a gift to middle-aged parents to grow into a deeper relationship with our children and with God.The 12 chapters untangle the dilemmas of comments that parents fear hearing: \\"I'll dress the way I want\\", \\"You never trust me\\", \\"You aren't going to tell me what to do\\", \\"If you'd love me, you'd let me\\", \\"I'm not going to church\\" and \\"You're nothing but a hypocrite.\\" It addresses cars and drugs, discipline and communication, faith and identity, spirituality and emotions. Peterson's sympathetic insights help the reader understand what is a strenuous process. But he also points positively towards how to promote communication and acceptance, trust and love, and how to embrace learning and growth rather than allowing misunderstandings and resentment to escalate. His advice is not so much about how to make teenagers obey and go to church, but how to find their own identity and make their own decisions about God.Each chapter has questions as group conversational starters and the book concludes with principles for parent support groups that Peterson calls \`The Parent Coalition'.Thanks Eugene for helping me look forward to and not fear teenage years my second time around.Darren is BUV's Coordinator of Leadership Training and pastor at Auburn Baptist. This review was previously published in The Witness:The Voice of Victorian Baptists, Vol.90, No.3 (March), p.21."},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"True to Peterson's works, he invites parents to live so their inside person matches the person they are in relationship with their teen kids. Thankfully this is not a formula book; \\"How to be the perfect parent of perfect teenagers.\\" It is a confident book; God's creative grace is active in teens and their middle age parents. Enjoy the ride through adolescence, everybody grows up!"},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"The oldest of Peterson's pastoral works was titled Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up with Your Teenager (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, c. 1976). Written by a pastor who's reared teens, for parents longing for direction, this book offers sound and (typical of Peterson) refreshing advice.First, he helps us relax with the assurance that \\"there are no well-adjusted adolescents. Adolescence is, by definition, maladjustment\\" (p. 1). Just ignore much of the nonsense which assures you these troubled waters can be stilled by some conjuring tricks dispensed by media gurus. Accept the necessary goodness of the generation gap, \\"a design to be preserved\\" (p. 41) for teens' well-being and parental sanity.Second, however much they may try us, parents should \\"embrace the experience offered to them by their adolescent children as a gift from God, a means of grace for themselves to mature into 'wisdom and favor with men and God'\\" (p. 6). Then we work not so much on our kids as on ourselves, which is considerably more do-able. By and large, Christian parents give up \\"meddling\\" with their teens, learning from Eli to \\"refer them to God\\" (p. 19).In this process, if we allow God to work in our lives, our children will benefit. After all, they rarely heed our advice, but they constantly scrutinize our character. To be honest, reliable, openly relying on God's grace, allowing Christ's imprint to seared on our souls, will help our teens more than anything else. This means we most influence our kids in the small activities of life: listening, smiling, mopping up messes.In an important section, Peterson shows how parent-child \\"love\\" changes during adolescence. A new kind of love is needed since \\"the old loves are no longer adequate for the new reality\\" (p. 55). Yet in losing the former kinds of love both parties frequently feel betrayed. The emotional need-loves of childhood, so marvelously satisfying to both parties, must be replaced by a parental love which \\"wills the fulfillment of the other\\" (p. 60). Children move through adolescence to adulthood, and parents must facilitate that transition.That's done by patiently, consistently doing what's best for adolescents, knowing they're liable to rebel and renounce parental pieties, to indulge in rhetorical accusations (\\"hypocrite\\" is a favorite teen-toned label). Teens further need, from adults, an unwavering hopefulness regarding their future (something they frequently question). And they need help moving from the needed prohibitions of childhood into the renunciations of maturity.Designed as a study book for groups, this is one of the wisest books I've read on working with adolescents."},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"We have a review of this book on our church's web page, at www.ilinks.net/~faithpca/teams/youth/parents.html"},{"Title":"Like Dew Your Youth: Growing Up With Your Teenager","review":"What a blessing and comfort this book has been to me, a Grandparent. The wisdom of Eugene Peterson shines brightly in this little book and speaks volumes."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I deeply regret spending money on this vulgar mishmash of terrible writing, characters without any credibility, and a lame plot. I was in a mood for easy, non-demanding fiction, but I trashed this. Don't waste your money on this pandering imitation of far superior fictions. If any good can come of this, it is that someone might be spared my experience! Karen Quinn, I demand a refund."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Can I get a refund this this peice of garbage?"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Sittenfield's Prep is a much better, much funnier book.

Admissions by Nancy Leiberman is essentially the same idea as Ivy Chronicles, and compared to this piece of junk, is a literary masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The Review that said this book would leave you feeling zombie like was right on target. This book is some of the worse writing ever. The first part is all jumbled, the book is shallow and.. I'll stop there but save your time and money and find something else.

Anhyoo, this is a really cool book. Not too heavy all through, though there are some things that I made me think. Especially the whole private versus public education debate. It's a nice book to read to just relax and you want to read more because the short chapters give you a boost and make you feel like you've read loads!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Self indulgent. Groundless. And, worst of all, poorly written. I would have had time better spent watching the Lifetime Channel."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This story has the possibility of being very entertaining but fails rather miserably. There are brief moments that are reasonably funny, but overall I'd say that it was an average read. That said, the story is fairly decent so if youre about to board a plane or take a train and want something light to read, you may enjoy this. I read it having heard great things and I must say I was disappointed. However if you pick it up as a means to pass some time, without high expectations, you may like it. Definitely something to take out of a library, not buy - you will not read it twice."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"If laughter is the best medicine; then I am surely cured of the winter doldrums! Quinn skewers the worst of corporate America's covert antics, the sometimes over-the-top entitlements taken by the privilaged few and the foibles of the nearing-middle-aged woman trying to reinvent her life after being dealt the double whammy of losing job and marriage simultaneouly. Not since Bridget Jones have I laughed out loud this much! Thank you Karen Quinn-keep writing! Hope to see it as a movie and read your next book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I just finished this book... and can't believe how much FUN it was to read!!!! The story is extremely clever and amusing... and gives you a hilarious view into an elite world that most of us will never know. The author does a great job of bringing the characters to life, making them \\"human\\" and making you care about them. The family portrayals were great... I couldn't wait to see which kids got in to which schools!! And I also thought the romantic story lines were very well done... I loved the fact that there were two love interests... and the fact that both were so attractive that I couldn't even decide which one I wanted the heroine to end up with. I was sorry when the story ended... and can't wait to see what the author writes next!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This book is hysterical. It gives an over-the-top, yet realistic view of corporate life, private school admissions, crazy parents and love. It gets better and funnier with every page. I hate putting it down.Thank you, Karen Quinn, for writing such an entertaining book. I hope you write another one really soon."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I didnt understand how someone could give this book 1 star so I had to write my very first review. It is one of my favorite books and since I work in a library I am recommending it to anyone who want to laugh when they read. I listened to this book as I was driving and I laughed all the way to work and back. I recommended it to someone else and she loved it too. She said she drove places she didnt need to go just to listen to it. She is buying it for her daughter to read. We both thought it was a very fun laugh out loud book. So if you want a very funny book with just enough twists to keep you guessing read The Ivy Chronicles. I can hardly wait for Karen Quinn to write another one"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"You know there are days when you just want a light fluffy read? Well, no matter how badly you want a fluffy read, don't read this book. It was awful and a total waste of time.You can basically predict the entire plot as you encounter each character - everyone of them more shallow than the last one. The protagonist is your typical very privileged and well-to-do woman who travels in her successful social group with others like her and one days she loses everything but manages to pick herself up, build her life back together and then some. She gets all the luck in the world, she always meets the right people, always stumbles into the right opportunity, always makes the right decisions, and soon she is more successful AND even happier than she's ever been. Right, because that's what life is like - a fairytale. I know it's part fantasy, but you need to give the readers a break, everything falls into her lap way too easily.Very disappointing book, I usually like stories where the protagonist is down and out and is able to pick herself up and rebuild her life successfully, but c'mon, this is ridiculous! Plus she's so shallow that I have a hard time emphasizing with her, why would I cheer for someone this annoying?I can't believe I paid for this book, thankfully, it was in the bargain bin. And I cannot believe this was a best-seller - there are many, many, many, much better books (even much better fluff out there) out there to read instead of wasting your time on this. The only reason I'm not giving this book only one star is because I was able to finish reading it, so I gave it two stars."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Okay, since I was going to be in the hospital a few days, I desperately needed something to read. I winced at first strains of the whiney narrator of the audio version, which reminded me of when I listened to that baby sitter book, but I digress.Ivy, a young ambitious mother finds herself out of work, a husband and finally a home. With nothing left but to find other employment, She decides to start a business enrolling toddlers and sometimes mere infants in designer pre-schools. I understand this is another one of those stupid common practices among the rich who believe that if they put their child in an exclusive private school it will more than double their chances of getting into the best educational institutions in the country.I say bunk! but then I don't have kids.It's an entertaining tale of a woman who has some of the most shallow friends, and clients known to man. Her romances, range from the detestable cheater, an unethical writer to a simple man with simple states. Thank goodness she found him before it was too late.I was all right with most of the story, UNTIL we arrived at her old nemesis and his group of companions being eaten by alligators. I thought that part of the story line far-fetched and unnecessary. I did like however, that the revenge beast inside was sated when her worst client got his, and big time. I ratedthis book a three mainly because it was just too long, but entertaining nevertheless."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I thought this book was entertaining... but at the end of the day, the author really leaves you feeling like the character who had the most in life was Faith - Ivy's best friend who married a billionaire husband and didn't work. She seemed to lead a charmed life that most of us would love to have (drivers, chefs, nannies, closet organizers, etc). I doubt it was the author's intent to make readers feel like money can buy happiness, but it sure felt like it at times. Which is a hard lesson to swallow for the avg middle class citizen."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This book has a touch more depth than the average beach read. It's quick pace and uniquely named short chapters keep you interested and wanting to see what will happen next. The Ivy Chronicles also contains some pop culture tid-bits that make it more updated and funnier than other similair novels I have read."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"If you're looking for this season's War and Peace, don't buy The Ivy Chronicles. But if you're looking for some fine escapist fun, this is a great choice. Karen Quinn hilariously skewers the absurdities of the lives of the super-rich. My favorite in the \\"superfluous household staff\\" category was the closet director, who's responsible for the computerized system that has all the clothes arranged by designer, color, etc. on motorized racks. Although reading this book will probably not lead to deep thought, it is guaranteed to produce snickers, chuckles & perhaps even gales of laughter. There's even fantasy date with George Clooney! What's not to like?"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"This is the real thing: A laugh-out-loud page-turner about New York City lifestyle. Ivy is as spunky as Bridget Jones and her world is as sophisticated that in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" I laughed until the author seamlessly carried me to a place with important ethical questions to ponder. The story has a base in reality, too: Remember the wily investment executive who got his kids into a prestige nursery school? It's hard to believe that this is Quinn's first novel. I can't wait for her next. City dwellers will particularly appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Ivy Ames finds herself in a world of hurt the same day she loses her high-paying management job at Myoki Bank. Arriving at home early, she discovers her unemployed husband in bed with Sassy Bird, wife of Drayton, who had engineered her firing at the bank. Without a husband and a job, and with two young daughters to support, Ivy assesses her embarrassing financial position. It is dire. She collapses into depression. How is she to continue to afford expensive tuition to the private school her girls attend?Subsequent chapters find Ivy waffling between possibilities but settling on a new career. An entrepreneur, she sets up a new business: that of helping upscale families in New York find acceptance for their children in elite kindergarten programs at private schools. It's a woman-eater of a job, but Ivy proves she's up to it.Author Karen Quinn received the inspiration for THE IVY CHRONICLES from her own experiences as counselor for school admissions. She has changed actual names, schools and personnel, but the scenarios she presents are spin-offs from personal adventures. One hopes that her clients' real personalities are less bizarre than those in the book.Sustained by her true friend Faith, Ivy climbs out of her depression to launch the business she hopes will feed her family. Moving from an affluent apartment to a modest working-class one is her first step --- adjustment to lower-scale living. From there, she advertises her venture and awaits her clientele. Nothing happens. Enormously wealthy, Faith comes to her rescue again. Her high-society contacts boost Ivy's client pool.Ivy's parent-client lists include such personalities as a lesbian couple, a mobster, a maidservant, a snooty chief executive of her own successful Wall Street company, a pretend father, and a neurotic father who threatens to lop off her head at least once a week. In addition, she is bribed by a grandfather who disagrees with his son's school choice. Sassy Bird, now husbandless, manages to reappear as a threat to Ivy's self-confidence. In all, however bizarre the parents' oddities, their beloved urchins upstage them in weird behavior.Ivy is caught in a stranglehold between what is ethical and what will bring in the cash she so desperately needs. At times, the reader seeks to wring her neck. But one holds to the hope that Ivy will succeed for the parents without compromising her own principles.Hopes for romance, riches and reward nip at her heels throughout THE IVY CHRONICLES. A quiet applause for her success is tempered by a wish for her moral rebirth. One would hope that cutthroat admission policies are not the reality in today's big city elitist social world, especially for youngsters at the tender age of four.Quinn's style is raw, humorous and candid. Her characters are exaggerations, but exemplify bits and pieces of real people who Ivy might represent in such a narrow-focus profession. Conversation is delightful, and is one of the highlights of THE IVY CHRONICLES.--- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I listened to this book on CD and found it to be tedious, shallow and nothing like I'd hoped. I found my self hating Ivy Ames and just wanting the book to end. All in all this book was not worth my time."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"Sometimes I wonder how books get published.This story jumped around so much and the resolutions were so random. Ivy was such a shallow character that I just couldn't even enjoy the story...and I was WANTING to! I love the genre and was a fan of Nanny Diaries and even Devil Wears Prada, but this one seemed as if it was written in one sitting. It was also the MOST predictable story ever! I wasn't looking for some literary masterpiece, but this just didn't cut it as an entertaining beach read."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I picked this book up because it was in the clearance rack - and absolutely ADORED it! I read the entire book in a bit more than a day - which is no small feat for a full-time working-out-of-the-home mother. Parts of this book had me laughing out loud, while others had me cheering Ivy on through her struggle with life, money, principles and motherhood. A thoroughly enjoyable book!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I'm not quite sure where to begin with reviewing this novel. I enjoyed it, but so much of it bothered me.The plot of \\"The Ivy Chronicles\\" is certainly more unique than that of most chick lit novels, and kept me turning pages until the end. However, i think it might have been easier to follow for the reader if the main character, Ivy, had taken on fewer clients. It got rather difficult to keep track of all seven sets of parents and children, as well as the myriad of other characters in the book. Several pivotal moments of the book hinge on purely coincidental incidents, which, while they are funny and may add some unexpectedness to the story, they make the novel feel unrealistic, and fantastical.The final few chapters of the novel felt odd, as though the author suddenly remembered that she had a romantic storyline to bring to a close in about 50 pages, which she had greatly neglected throughout the rest of the book. Due to this hurried feeling, the romance factor of the book seemed false, and fell flat.It's a funny novel, but not nearly as funny as i had hoped. The characters are thinly-drawn, with hardly any depth, so the funny parts of the book also lack depth.While it was entertaining enough for me to finish, it was not good enough for me to recommend to others. I will still give the author a chance on her next book though, and hope that perhaps she has learned her craft a little better.Grade: C+"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"As a Kindergarten teacher and new Mom, I found this book great. I don't live in NYC but still enjoyed reading this. It is funny and imaginative."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"The jacket quotes the New York Post as saying this book is, \\"Entertaining... Picks up where The Nanny Diaries left off.\\" Well, I've read The Nanny Diaries. Twice. And let me just say, \\"ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!\\" To include these two books in the same arena is a travesty - The Ivy Chronicles is not clever, well-written, or entertaining - it's simply annoying! The main character, Ivy Ames, is about as shallow as a plastic kiddie swimming pool and while cleverly packaged to look like a smart, witty summer read about the crazy parents of New York's kindergarten wanna-be's - it just doesn't deliver. The chapters are so short and undeveloped that it reads like a spoiled teenager's diary with about the same selfish insight and limited attention span. This story, while I know it is fiction, pushes the boundaries of plausibility to the point that I wanted to finish it so I could stop hear Ivy whine about how helpless, immoral, feckless, and stereotypical she is. Can you think of any cliche about any spoiled, rich NY wives dumped by their philandering husbands who have to pull themselves back up by their bootstraps? It's in there. Save your $4.98 from the Bargain Shelf... go buy an overpriced latte instead - it will be far more satisfying."},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"We get by with a little help from our friends has never been portrayed with such an ingenious mixture of passion, humor and what could only be defined as sheer female empowerment. Author Karen Quinn takes us inside one woman's journey from the top, to the bottom and back to the top again.Ivy Ames...devoted wife and loving mother of two, was living \\"the good life.\\" With a combined annual income of two million plus, the Ames' family had all the luxuries and perks of the social elite. Eight months ago, Ivy's husband, Cadmon, lost his job and instead of cutting back on expenditures, they continued to revel in the lavish lifestyle they had grown so accustomed too. On a typical, all too hectic morning, Ivy had barely managed to get herself to the bank on-time, when she is caught off guard by a note summoning her to the boss' office. You could have knocked her over with a feather when she heard him say \\"human resources has your package, a car will take you home...\\" The words kind-of-faded into a blur. After a day filled with indignities and humiliation, she longed for the warm, sympathetic embrace of Cad's arms. But that was not to be...As the smell of orange bubble-bath was wafting through the air, she opened the door to the bathroom, only to find her husband bathing a naked woman. It was Sassy! The wife of the man that had caused her to lose her job! Enraged, embarrassed and deeply hurt she ordered Sassy out of the house, threatening to drop a hair dryer into the bath water if she did not leave immediately. Refusing to let Cad she her cry, she turned and with all the strength she could muster, she gave him his walking orders as well.It is this one devastating day that lays the foundation for the rest of the novel. With her life in shambles, Ivy embarks on a new career, setting up a business that caters to parents that want their children in the most elite kindergarten programs on earth. A wonderful idea that just needed a boost to get off the ground. Her best friend, Faith, was wealthy and more than willing to help in any way possible. With a few well placed phone calls to her high society acquaintances, Ivy's referral box began filling up. There's a host of outlandish, colorful personalities that make up Ivy's clientele, each adding their own unique flavor to the story. There's a single father with mob ties; a mixed religion couple; a mom who tries to bribe the board at every school; a gay couple with a wheel-chair bound adopted son; etc. Ivy endures an ongoing cycle of nerve-racked parents having mental-melt-downs during the application process and crazed parents bombarding her with verbal assaults. She quickly discovers these parents do not recognize the morally accepted boundaries of right and wrong...when it comes to securing a slot on the kindergarten-roster of their choosing, anything goes!Snooty, snobbish, egocentric and over-the-top, Karen Quinn's novel \\"The Ivy Chronicles\\" is a tongue-in-cheek read that delivers exactly what was promised...a light hearted read, filled with quaint characters and quick wit. While criss-crossing moral and ethical boundaries in hopes of being accepted to an elite kindergarten is wrong on so many levels, it it is the catalyst propelling the humorous insanity. Putting the idea of elite, prep-style kinder-care into perspective for these folks would be impossible. But then again so was the concept of downsizing for Ivy, as she continued to carry her Barney's shopping bag everywhere, hoping to portray that up-town image she missed so desperately.If you're looking for a Saturday afternoon read that doesn't require a lot of thought...that you can just read for the light and fluffy experience...The Ivy Chronicles is a good choice. Fun and seemingly far-fetched, I couldn't help but wonder with Quinn's insider knowledge, how far did she stretch the characters, if at all? I am anxious to see what Warner Brothers does with this zany cast of characters, as the book has been optioned and Catherine Zeta-Jones will be starring in the movie!Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Ivy Chronicles","review":"I thought this would be a cute, fun read, but it wasn't cute or fun. Totally unrealistic (for example, Ivy's former co-workers get eaten by crocodiles...Come ON) and an insult to intelligent readers who were hoping to get an amusing insider's look at the world of admissions into Manhattan's private schools for the youngest kids. Ivy is not a likable character, the story is depressing and really just plods along, the sex scenes are overly graphic, and it was just a waste of time.
