Dr. Campbell advocates a set of four tools that need to be used in order to raise emotionally healthy, secure children. We convey love to children in the following ways (p.37): eye contact (Ch 4), physical contact (Ch5), focused attention (Ch 6), and loving discipline (Ch 9-11)Some interesting notes and quotes from this book:* \\"Most parents have a feeling of love toward their children and assume that they convey this love to a child. This is the greatest error today\\" (p. 19).* \\"Almost every study I know indicates that every child wants to know from his parents, \`Do you love me?' A child asks this emotional question mostly in behavior, seldom verbally. The answer to this question is absolutely the most important thing in any child's life\\" (p. 33).* Unconditional love is the foundation of healthy parent-child relationships. The most important relationships for any parent are (in this order): 1- with God, 2 - with the spouse 3 - with the children. Both the quality of the parent-child bond and the child's security depend on the quality of the marital bond (p. 21)* Inappropriate love (Ch 7) can manifest itself in four ways: possessiveness (p. 70), seductiveness (p. 71), vicariousness (p.75), and role reversal (p. 76).* Every child has an \\"emotional tank\\" that can only be filled by love. Only if the emotional tank is full can a child be expected to be at his best and do his best (p. 34).* \\"Refusing to make eye contact with a child is usually more painful than corporal punishment\\"(p.40)* \\"A boy's need for physical contact never ceases, even though the type of physical contact needed does change\\"(p.50). For girls, it \\"increases in importance as she becomes older and reaches a zenith at around the age of 11\\"* \\"In all my reading and experience, I have never known of one sexually disoriented person who had a warm, loving and affectionate father\\" (p. 74).* \\"Far more children suffer from the lack of appropriate love than from exposure to inappropriate love\\" (p. 78).* \\"Be careful to use punishment as a last resort and refrain from dumping your anger on your child.... If there are two words that sum up Christlike parenting, they are: pleasant and firm\\" (p. 83).* \\"To train children to handle anger maturely, you must, when appropriate, allow them to express it verbally, even if it is unplesant\\" (p. 88).* \\"Discipline is training a child in mind and character to enable the child to become a self-controlled, constructive member of society\\" (p. 90).* Often misbehavior is the direct result of an empty emotional tank. Parents must therefore ask, \\"What does my child really need right now?\\" Punishment may be necessary, but it is not the first step (p. 105). Discipline involves four things: requests, commands, rewards, and punishment (p. 111). Punishment is a last resort.* Helping children spiritually (Ch 13): \\"the first is whether the parents have it themselves! The second is whether they can identify with their parents in such a way as to incorporate and accept parental values. Children who do not feel loved, will find this difficult.\\" (p. 133-134)"},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"This book is very well written, easy to read and the most &quot;on target&quot; parenting book ever!

I have read dozens of books on raising children, secular and Christian, this is the best. Let me explain.It is simple.Dr. Campbell does not get bogged down in the minutia of emotionally charged details. He doesn't preach about spanking, breast feeding, dating v. courting, negative and positive reinforcement, and the like. He tells you what is going on in a child's heart and allows you to determine the details.It is foundational.The principles he shares are so obvious that you are almost embarrassed that you didn't think of it. I found that not only did it help me be a better parent, it helped me deal with many of the issues that I had from my own childhood.It is easy to remember.I have read this book at least four times, but even after the first reading I could remember the major principles easily. They just make sense. The emotional tank; the difference between discipline and punishment; the fact that saying, \\"I love you,\\" to your children does not make it real to them; these principles never leave you.It is flexible.These principles are not tied to one reading of Scripture or a single body of research. Also, they are adaptable to many different parenting styles.It is powerful.Every time I council a teenager, I ask them if they believe that their parents love them. They almost always say, \\"Not really. They only love me because I'm their kid. But they don't really love me.\\" It astounds me because Dr. Campbell quotes teenagers in this book and they are almost verbatim what I consistently hear. The reason is that kids do not feel loved just because you put a roof over their heads and gave them the latest iPod. They need so much more. When the realization of the truths contained in this book hit many parents, they simply sob. They realize that they missed it and their children are paying the price.Most parents are doing their best and simply do not know. No matter what the circumstances, it is not too late. Our God is a God of miracles and he can move powerfully in our lives.

I read this book hoping to find a little information on why some kids are more difficult to handle than others. I found an explanation inside this book that not only satisfied my question, but made me stop and think about the way I was parenting in general. It has been a long time since a book could make me stop in my tracks and think about the choices I have made and how to do something better than I am doing it now. I thank the author for making me think about things and helping to mend something before it became broken. The advice in this book is so clear and concise, that I was able to apply it immediately. I realize than everyone does something a little different when it comes to raising their children, and I am not saying that there is a right way or a wrong way, but what this book did for me, was make me realize that the wide range of emotions we have as adults, the stress we feel and the way we react to negativity a child will mirror. This book reminded me of the value of a kind word and big hug. If you are a parent, get this book...You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"\\"... most behavior in a child is determined by how much he or she feels loved.\\"Many children do not feel genuinely loved. They grow up feeling this way and can become bitter, resentful and antisocial. Their relationship with their parents can also determine how they feel about God later in life. It is therefore so essential that parents realize that they need to love their children unconditionally. Ross Campbell has really written one of the most valuable books I've ever read. As an adult you will wish your parents had read this book while raising you. Or perhaps you are one of the lucky ones who was loved unconditionally. Either way it is never to late to start relating to your children in a meaningful way.Ross Campbell begins his book with the most important aspects of raising a child. We should not be surprised that a good relationship between parents is essential. He then explains the \\"prerequisites of good child rearing.\\" The basics seem natural. Give children attention, hug them, give them eye contact and ask yourself: \\"What does this child need?\\" Too often parents assume the worst about a child's behavior when in fact they may be lonely, hungry, in need of medical assistance or just in need of a nap. Ross Campbell provides guidance in this area and explains how to react in various circumstances.I found the section on teaching a child what to do with their anger very interesting. It has taken me 46 years to learn how to handle anger and I'm still learning. But in this book the author suggests that most will come to terms with their anger by age 17. This sounds very unrealistic to me. As a child gets older and gets married they will deal with all sorts of new situations in which they can get very angry. However the advice on listening to a child and letting them verbally express their anger seems good to me. Suppression can in fact cause worse problems later on.One very important aspect of this book entails the difference between punishment and discipline. The author suggests that it is not a good idea to punish often and in fact believes that punishment is a very small part of discipline. He makes a good case, almost pleading with parents not to make punishment the primary way of communicating with their child. He also makes a case about how punishment that is too severe may cause a child not to feel guilt and therefore won't enable him/her to develop a good conscience which will keep a child in line later in life.Overall I felt this book was essential and I hope more parents will read it again and again. The principles taught in this book will make your life more fulfilling and will create happy and well adjusted children.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"Very good book to deal with how to use the language that children understand to let you know you love them."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"Of course I thought I really loved my child before I got this book but I have to admit that I wasn't getting the message through to her.

I highly recommend this book for any parent."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"While so many parenting books out there are \\"ages and stages\\" and discipline (reacting AFTER behavior), Dr. Campbell take a preventative approach.I think every parent, teacher, grandparent, babysitter, social worker ... basically anyone who interacts with children on a regular basis should read this book!How to Really Love Your Child by Dr. Ross Campbell, M.D.In the preface, Dr. Campbell acknowledges that there is a lot of parenting information out there--enough to overwhelm parents. Though the information is good \\"many books, articles, and lectures have honed in on one, or at most only a few specific aspects of child rearing without clearly defining the specific areas they cover.\\" It's not that the information is wrong or the parents didn't do it right, \\"the problem lies in the parents not having a general, balanced perspective on how to relate to a child.\\" Dr. Campbell believes \\"the problem is how to manifest our love to a child through discipline and when to show it in other more affectionate ways.\\"In chapter one he cites some of the common problems he has seen as a psychiatrist. Chapters two and three talk about the home, parents and child and how important this relationship is for the child to understand love. An entire chapter is devoted to how the husband and wife relate and how that affects the children. Chapter three defines what unconditional love is and is not. The next three chapters discuss how to express, demonstrate, show this unconditional love through eye contact, physical contact and focused attention.While chapter three defined unconditional love, chapter seven touches on appropriate and inappropriate love: possessiveness, seductiveness, vicariousness and role-reversal. If you are a loving, Christian parent and think you can skip over this chapter--wait. Read through it if only to know possible warning signs if you ever see them in your friends' or your child's friends' family.Though chapter eight touches on helping your child learn how to deal with his anger, Dr. Campbell says this topic is thoroughly covered in How to Really Love Your Angry Child. There is some helpful starting information in this chapter, however.Chapter nine is about discipline. Dr. Campbell says \\"that making a child feel loved is the first and most important part of good discipline.\\" Love and discipline should not be viewed as separate entities, and \\"punishment is a very small part of discipline.\\" But the next thing he says is what I found interesting:\\"What you have read thus far in this book is the most important aspect of discipline, and you must apply what you've learned to expect the best results from disciplining your child. There is no point in reading further at this time if you have not applied what you have already read.\\""},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"This book is as timely and relevant today as it was when I was raising my now-late-thirties children. We say we love our children, but do we really know how to show it so they feel it? Dr. Campbell guides parents to this end in encouraging and practical ways. It's a pleasure to recommend this book these many years."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"I am naturally disinclined to read a psychiatrist's opinion on the matter of child rearing. Like other soft sciences, their claims can be difficult to verify with satisfaction and I am not inclined to simply take them at their word when so much is at stake.Having recently read, \\"Shepherding a Child's Heart\\" my own heart was softened to the task so I read Dr. Campbell's book guardedly, while hoping to glean something useful. And, being predisposed to distrust psychiatrists, I was surprised when I did.I did not agree with everything Dr. Campbell wrote (in fact there was much that I disagreed with). But there were some gems that I discovered that I would have most likely missed if my heart had not be softened to the task. As it turns out, there was a baby in the bathwater.I appreciated his thoughts on loving your child with eye contact, physical touch, active listening, and focused attention. I particularly benefited from his thoughts on physical touch, which is an area that I haven't given enough attention in my own parenting. I've already put some of his ideas into practice and I can honestly say that they have been a true help.Now, on to the bathwater...Regarding discipline, the author did have some good points. Namely, that discipline and love should not be separated (though he himself separates them several times) and that punishment is a small part of discipline. However, his poor handling of scripture, and his elevating of his own ideas over clear scriptural prescriptions were troubling.On page 93, he writes, \\"Proponents of corporal punishment seem to have forgotten that the shepherd's rod referred to in scripture was used almost exclusively for guiding the sheep, not beating them. The shepherds would gently steer the sheep, especially the lambs, by simply holding the rod to block them from going in the wrong direction and then gently nudge them toward the right direction. If the rod was (or is) an instrument used principally for beating, I would have a difficult time with Psalm 23 \\"your rod and your staff, they comfort me.\\"Here the author is simply wrong. The Hebrew for \\"rod\\" in Ps. 23 is found 47 times in the bible. More than half of those instances (28) are translated as \\"rod\\". 11 instances are translated as \\"scepter\\", and only for times as \\"staff\\". Moreover, for the instances translated as \\"rod\\", the far majority are in a context of punishment and/or violence.This is not to say that the rod should be the primary means of discipline, but, it should be one of the primary means of punishment - not as a last resort, but as a regular, consistent means to administer loving correction to your children in accordance with the scriptures.The author betrays his actual feelings toward the clear biblical prescription of corporal punishment, in spite of his allowance for its \\"minimal\\" use (96). On page 96, the author calls punishment, \\"the most negative and primitive factor.\\" On page 97, he writes, \\"Corporal punishment degrades, dehumanizes, and humiliates a child.\\" This is pure nonsense. Of course, child abuse does these things. But corporal punishment administered biblically reflects the manner in which our heavenly Father deals with the children he loves. Proverbs 13:24 says, \\"Whoever spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is diligent to discipline him.\\" Proverbs 23:13-14 says, \\"Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him he will not die. If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol.\\" Hebrews 12:6 says, \\"For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises (or \\"scourges\\") every son whom he receives.\\"Does God really prescribe a method of discipline that degrades, dehumanizes, and humiliates his children? I think here it would be best for the author to shut his mouth and let the word of the LORD speak for itself.His lack of scriptural understanding in the realm of children does not end there. On page 102 he claims that \\"the primary cause of misbehavior in a child\\" is the \\"lack of love.\\" Though lack of love is almost certain to result in misbehavior, it is not the root cause. The root cause, according to the bible, is sin. Failing to understand the fallen, human state of our children will make sound biblical parenting difficult. Swapping the biblical cause of misbehavior with a more pleasant psychological substitute is to treat the word of God as secondary in authority to our own ideas.There were still other problems with his view on child rearing. His explanation of \\"two-year-old negativism\\" is not satisfactory. We did not experience the dreaded \\"terrible twos\\" precisely because we did require response to first requests and never tolerated a \\"no\\" answer as a reasonable way for our children to \\"separate themselves psychologically from their parents.\\"In conclusion, there was a baby in the bath, and once removed, there was a tub of dirty water that urgently needed to be thrown out. Read \\"Shepherding a Child's Heart\\" by Tedd Tripp instead."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"Personally I was disappointed that although a chapter was devoted to the discipline of a child, I found no helpful suggestions to the sort and to the extent of discipline that I should mete out, say to a \\"just stepping out\\" teenager. Instead of actual examples of discipline, the author went back to his premise that a parent should ensure that the child's emotional tank is filled before disciplining. But then again what is discipline? What kinds of discipline will not sap away a child's idea that he is loved when punishment is meted out? I, a loving mother to my children, and who having read the early chapters of Campbell's book, concluded that I have filled the emotional tanks of my children, would like to know what other areas I could possibly look at to find out how I could discipline my teenage daughter who is in the phase of exerting her own identity and status. What should I do, or not do, so that I will not damage my child's ego or worse, drag her to withdraw into an ill-balanced adult.I also feel that the chapter on \\"Appropriate and Inappropriate Love\\" could be further explored by the author. For example, the author could provide suggestions as to how a daughter could be \\"weaned off\\" the closeness with her father without hurting her and without making her withdaw from men in the future."},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"I borrowed this book twice from the library and I think I need to buy it to have as a reference.

He shows that if you build a healthy love relationship, you can exercise appropriate discipline in love and children will actually appreciate it and come to view it as what it is--the most loving thing you could do for them.-Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"},{"Title":"How to Really Love Your Child (Pocket Plan)","review":"In an age of all kinds of self-help books, this one is simple and it SHINES.

Soon he is dragged into a foolish plot, directed by the erratic leader, Mackie. Alexander is so preoccupied with the feeling of belonging and the amusement of daily life as a country store clerk that he ignores repeated hints of impending destruction. When he is ultimately called upon to perform a senseless act, the truth about his newfound family is revealed and he is faced with a dangerous choice between love and morality.Mackie's Gift is a personal story of becoming that digs into the quirky and casually violent culture of semi-rural Alabama. It explores how the desire for love and attachment can cause reality to blur, potentially making shocking events appear commonplace. Irreverently funny, honest, and ultimately tragic, Mackie's Gift presents a disturbing interpretation of \\"love conquers all.\\""},{"Title":"Mackie's Gift","review":"Mackie's Gift is well written and explores interesting ideas about the need for love and belonging, especially among the young and naive.

The first thing that stands out is that the book's layout is similar to a novel; this is unlike standard academic texts which have standardized line numbers. Furthering the novel notion, it appears that the book is edited to increase ease of reading, i.e., words and phrases are altered so it has better flow. Now, for many works, modernization is practical, but in philosophical literature alteration of the words of a text can drastically alter the message. Given that people dedicate their careers to translating Plato accurately, one should take translation issues seriously.This book is good for familiarizing yourself with the text for party type situations, however for any serious discussion a better version can be had. I suggestPlato: The Republic (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)as a preferable copy as it includes discussions of passages as well as the standard line numbers."},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"Very nice book! Plato is and will always be up to date! I like this publishers books, they are nice and of good quality!"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":".This translation of Cornford is the best one that I've found for clarity and understanding. The translation itself is not exact or literal, as I find strict adhesure to the literal as corrupting the clarity with exactitude and awkwardness. No doubt if you rather a more exact translation then you must look perhaps to Allan Bloom's, which is totally a good one, and much more so it's the 100+ page interpretive essay of Bloom that makes his book totally worthwhile.Cornford further divides \\"The Republic of Plato\\" into 6 Parts with multiple chapters in each part! And to top if off with an introduction in italics before each new topic that he has divided into separate chapters. This is extremely helpful to piece all the thoughts together and I find it a hell of lot more helpful then the traditional 10 books/divisions found in Bloom's translation, and most others.You can't help but admire Socrates how he reasons so well how truth is always a paradox and not one-sided, as in that of justice verses injustice, how Thrasymachus argues the stronger are the ones who control and benefit, While Socrates argues the weaker are that ones that benefit from requiring the need of the stronger's art of practicing justice in order to receive the injustice he dominates from the weaker. It's incredible paradox and argument. Of course when the stronger becomes less strong and the weaker less weak a balance of justice occurs but not with radical equalitarian methods of communism or totalitarianism, but rather with wise Philosopher Kings and the Guardians that protect the society.Socrates government has some totalitarian attributes, as in the sharing children and censorship, while other aspects, such as the training of the Guardians, the Philosopher kings, and most assuredly, his analysis of comparison of oligarchy, democracy, timocracy and despotism, including the nature of individuals in such systems makes this highly interesting material. And none of Socrates words in Plato's writing and Cornford's translation are obscure and overly abstract. There is no Immanuel Kant language, or Hegel, here.What a great thinker Socrates was. It may be more accurate to say what a great thinker Plato was in his description of Socrates. His continual quest for truth, virtue and in the case of Plato's Republic, justice. At first his idea of justice is very noble and always intriguing, thought provoking and honorable. However, what begins as an intellectual idea of what justice is, ends up being a logically formed government that intellectually, or scientifically, measures, analyzes and controls the creativity of man, a government that epitomizes what centuries later labeled as the Enlightenment, which demystified the artistic man into a pragmatic and positivist being. While democracy based on a rational system of \\"rights\\" developed from the likes of Hobbes, Locke and Mill, what ultimately resulted was a Marxist censorship government of control that emulated itself much in line with this Plato's Republic, the extreme rule built on scientific and rational means of communism and totalitarianism.It becomes utterly frightening to hear Socrates speak so eloquently and intelligibly on what reads as good common sense of a cities justice, training, rule and protection that history has revealed as governmental experiments that were tried, tested, enforced, controlled and in turn, destroyed the chaotic, non-rational elements of creative value producing ability in human society. The results of such totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, all built on the seemingly rational and coherent science of common rule and radical equalitarianism have proved themselves horrendously disastrous.Some examples are: the youth should be trained as soldiers for the city. All scripture, the stories of Homer and the gods, must be censored and altered to shine only a positive or molded light that conforms to the leaders decision. The leaders, while only those of older age would be qualified, would receive a life carefully censored, trained and observed from youth, and would supposedly then become completely wise as philosophers kings, and in this way cannot bring injustice to their rulership. In addition, all music, poetry, art is censored. People who need lifetime medical attention should not receive such and die, (their much better off this way!) as they are nonproductive to the growth and science of what constitutes an ideal and perfect city.Socrates/Plato's descriptions of the two world view and the allegory of the cave are in themselves absolute masterpieces and have literally shaped Western civilization as we know it and are truly behind the majority of ideas and teachings we currently believe and are raised in.Ultimately, I found Socrates argument on Philosophy verses Poetry amazing and understand why Nietzsche completely rebelled and attacked Socrates. I then venture to the East as in the Vigyan Bhairav Tantra and Osho's commentary on such, as in some of Krishnamurti, Buddha, Krishna, Mahriavara and the idea of something beyond the mind/Apollonian/head rationalism of Socrates and the heart/Dionysus/emotion irrationalism of Nietzsche. To Socrates the mind and reason are superior to the emotions and feelings. To Nietzsche it is in the realm of emotions, in the passions of irrationalism and the art of creativity where the superior strength of man exists. To the East it is neither, but the mind and heart act as instruments of something of a Higher realm, the Consciousness or the Self, which exists outside the mind. Here I will agree with all three modes of thought: that fundamentalism and one-sided truths are bogus and for lower and ignorant thinkers. However, it was Socrates who failed to understand the depth of significance in the irrational, while Nietzsche recognized the foolishness and stupidity of biblical literalism and morality codes based on fundamental reasoning.The irrational is what molds the rational, while the rational chisels it's form. It's the passiveness of Yin and the tension of Yang, which when let go and surrender are simply the Tao.The ending of the Republic is worth the read. It is here Socrates supports immortality of the soul and reincarnation and it's amazing how you can see this is the precursor of the bible. The last book or account is symbolic and mythological on the pattern of the universe, the same as the book of Revelation is in the bible with its judgments of the just and unjust and depiction of a heavenly Jerusalem. Socrates also speaks of the winner of a race receiving the crown and the idea of Tartarus, as repeated in the letters of St. Paul. The men who wrote the bible and decided it's cannon are no doubt imitating the Republic of Plato, not to mention Dante and others who were heavily influenced by this book. And what a book it is!"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"Translation is key when buying a book like this.

It is also a good read!"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"According to Whitehead all of Western philosophy is a 'footnote to Plato' As the heart of Plato is in the Republic it might be said that all of Western Philosophy is a footnote to the Republic. And that being the case it seems ridiculous to try and do anything more here than make a minor footnote to a footnote. The point as I understand it though of Whitehead is that if you wish to understand the basic terms and questions upon which the debates of the philosophical tradition are carried out you should know this work.I will make no attempt to summarize or to condense the many questions including the central one of the meaning of Justice and a Just Society which are at the heart of this work.I will just write down a few impressions, a few memories from the reading which took place many years ago .The first is that the work is conducted by a method of dialogue, what is called the 'maieutic ' method in which the philosopher Socrates the main character of the dialogues and Plato's great teacher acts as a 'mid-wife' bringing out the ' inherent truths ' in the mind of man through talking to others. It is all there in us pre- existent according to this view and the Truth simply needs to be brought out.This Truth however has a baffling meaning in the Central Myth of the Republic. This is the Myth of the Cave . The philosopher descends into the Cave and seeks in isolation to know the Ultimate Truth. But what he sees are the shadows of the shadows the fleeting images of sense which can hint at but not really convey ultimately the final truth. And the final truth in Plato's system and world is the Impersonal Abstract Idea which in turn is constructed of all other Ideas. It is as if we arrive finally at One but this one is not the personal G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob but truly a God of the Philosophers somehow beyond and containing us all.At another level this is the great Political guide book of the Western world, and in Karl Popper's accusation the real blueprint for Totalitarianism and dictatorship. The three- part society depicted here is ruled in the end by the Philosopher- King elite, the know-it- alls who keep order by keeping everyone else in order. Liberal democracy is not Plato's final station for the Evolution of the Idea.All in all this is a too rich, too suggestive too meaningful work to write about seriously in a review like this. This work pervades the whole philosophical tradition that follows from Aristotle and through the neo- Platonists and on down to our own day.As for the dialogues and the figure of Socrates and Plato's relation to his own teacher these also are large questions endlessly explored and to be explored.Again who reads this work carefully has a real clue as to the nature of Western Philosophy. But who reads only this work knows Philosophy without the religious and ethical components the Biblical Literature will supply."},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"Excellent...very inexpensive. Great translation. If you need a copy of the Republic, GET THIS."},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"The Cornford translation of Plato is still one of the standards, even though other translations might well be better in this age. To get to the point: Socrates' greatest student was Plato. In \\"The Republic,\\" Plato, through the voice of Socrates, provided the keenest metaphor to describe his understanding of the problem cod defining \\"reality.\\" His allegory of the cave serves as the takeoff point. Socrates describes the situation to Glaucon thus:[Socrates]: Imagine the condition of men living in a sort of cavernous chamber underground, with an entrance open to the light and a long passage all down the cave. Here they have been from childhood, chained by the leg and also by the neck, so that they cannot move and can see only what is in front of them, because the chains will not let them turn their heads. At some distance higher up is the light of a fire burning behind them; and between the prisoners and the fire is a track with a parapet built along it, like a screen at a puppet-show, which hides the performers while they show their puppets over the top. . .Now behind this parapet imagine persons carrying along various artificial objects,including figures of men and animals in wood or stone or other materials, which projectabove the parapet. Naturally, some of the persons will be talking, others silent.[Glaucon]: It is a strange picture. . .and a strange sort of prisoners.[Socrates]: Like ourselves. . .; for in the first place prisoners so confined would have seen nothing of themselves or one another, except the shadows thrown by the firelight on the wall of the cave facing them, would they?. . .And they would have seen as little of the objects carried past. . .Now, if they could talk to one another, would they not suppose that their words referred only to those passing shadows which they saw?[Glaucon]: Necessarily.[Socrates]: And suppose their prison had an echo from the wall facing them? When one of the people crossing behind them spoke, they could only suppose that the sound came from the shadow passing before their eyes. . .In every way, then, such prisoners would recognize as reality nothing but the shadows of those artificial objects.Next, Plato has Socrates examine what happens if someone is taken from the cave out into the light of day. This person then comes to understand that all is illusion and shadows in the cave--whereas earlier that person had defined the images as reality. In this sense, through education, one could come to see reality and escape the confines of the cave. And when that person would re-enter the cave, he would realize the nature if illusions and be able to try to illuminate with his (or her) wisdom the lives of the people in the cave. This, of course, would be difficult since the denizens of that dark region would not themselves have directly experienced the light of knowledge.Who is best able to see what is outside of the cave? The philosophers, of course. Plato believes that there are absolutes, \\"forms,\\" out there in the \\"real world.\\" Circles that we humans craft can never equal the ideal type \\"out there,\\" what we might call \\"circularity.\\" There is an abstract idea of circularity, the perfect circle, the essence of circleness. This is the truth of the object. Only through training can a person begin to understand and appreciate these forms, these ideal types. Only those whose passion and talent is the pursuit of knowledge and who can come to possess wisdom are able to see these \\"forms.\\" Only then can the subject properly \\"see\\" the object, in this case circularity. Note, in contrast, the arguments by the Sophists that the subject is incapable of properly perceiving and understanding reality--even if there is a reality to be apprehended!And, in his metaphor of gold, silver, and bronze, Plato makes this even more explicit. Each person, he claims, is dominated by one of three elements--appetite (bronze), courage (silver), and wisdom (gold). It is in our nature at birth which one of these characterizes each of us. Only those whose central core is gold can ever hope to see the forms and understand the absolute truth that exists. The rest are, in effect, condemned to a life in the cave. Education is needed to take the raw material within a person and shape that individual's capacity to come to see truth, to apprehend the forms or ideal types.In the end, then, only a few can ever come to know reality. And it takes them much of their lives before they are adequately enough trained to accomplish this Olympian goal. It is unsurprising, of course, that Plato argues that these few, these philosopher-kings (or queens, since he accepts that women may be capable of these same feats of intellectual insight), should also become the rulers of the ideal society. That is the nature of his \\"Republic.\\"This is one of the great works of political philosophy. Its assumption that there is a \\"special class\\" suited to rule is open to question. His elitism will not sit well with many readers. The belief that humans can apprehend objective reality is also open to question. His sense that individuals are predestined to serve as \\"producers,\\" \\"auxiliaries,\\" or \\"philosopher kings/queens\\" (yes, he felt that women might become leaders, an unusual conclusion for the time) will not convince many contemporary readers. However, this is one of the standard translations and provides a credible entr&eacute;e to one of Plato's greatest works."},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"Cornford's translation is best, of the three I've read, for several reasons.First, the reviewers of the Penguin version express the shocking misreading and NONreading of Republic as a totalitarian or political manifesto, which indicates the forest being lost for the trees in the heavily over-annotated Penguin version by Desmond Lee.Second, this version omits all needless words. Gone are the politening classic Greek rhetorical flourishes; absent are the constant yes-yes-yes of Glaucon and Adiemantus. Single Greek words instead take single English equivalents. So the wholeness of the arguments shines forth and is immediately grasped, unlike in the classic Jowett version where everyone is so courteous it obscures the message.Third, Cornford is a scholar trained in the English system of the Classics, and as such enjoyed access to men who actually PRACTICED the teaching of Republic, an extraordinary rarity now the book is regarded and mistaught as an ancient political document.My experience is that the aim of Republic is to heal the soul of the reader by revealing the nature of the Good insofar as it can be revealed and demonstrating the order of goods in the healthy human soul. The politics exists to demonstrate this by analogy.Platonism enjoyed 1000 plus years as a system of education of the soul; it is therefore the most successful pedagogy in human history.If you miss the good of the book you have missed the book itself: on this rock is founded Aristotle's biology and ethics, Aquinas' natural law, and Freud's groundbreaking analyses of the nature of instinct:The three-part soul or instinct is the clinical basis of human nature and remains self-evidently useful as a tool for analysis of disorder in the soul and discovery of the Good.

His philosophy has endured throughout thousands of years, and has influenced almost every branch of Western thought - politics, philosophy, art, religion, morality, and so on. For a simple example, this is the man who talked about the immortality of the soul. An idea that is still alive in the everyday believes of Western civilization.Therefore, a reading of Plato is a must to understand, not only political philosophy, but Western thought in general.With that said, The Republic is his most known and important work. It is a Socratic dialogue (a discussion between a fictionalized Socrates (Plato's teacher) and other philosophers), where the main focus is reaching a consensus of what is \\"justice\\", as well as illuminating the ideal society. The Republic can be uninteresting in the beginning, and towards the end, but the work in general is interesting and thought provoking. Plato's style is simply, in my opinion, a joy to read.The Dover edition offers a cheap choice of the Republic, and I would advice it to anyone interested in reading it.

Then, we'll also go on to consider it in indivdiuals, considering the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler.\\" / 369a.) In no way do they mean to suggest totalitarianism on earth, but that the Soul must develop a Ruling Element. It's astonishing how so many take spiritual work in a literal sense. The book only was written as a guide to developing the Soul. The ancients in particular worked from the inside out. Only confused modern minds could take the huge ALLEGORY of this great work as a literal recipe for a society on earth (then knock it as being communist, ant-like, scary or whatever). And it is as funny, lively, clever and compelling as anything written today. Well, more so, of course. Talk about ant-like: this work easily beats or at least informs the best of today's work.

I was able to plow through this book in a fortnight because the language flowed so well.I wish we could get more translators to get the gift of tongues, and to render these classic texts into the tongue of angels!"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"Plato's famed Republic is that idyllic land where philosophical principles have re-formed human nature into something grander than ourselves. The fundament that underlies this golden state is an inquiry into the nature of justice, which Plato embodies in the Guardians of this state. They are the elite, a caste apart within the larger commercial society, in which \\"mean employments and manual arts are a reproach.\\" They lack any of the normal impulses that reward a citizen with love, family, and material comfort. Instead, they are a communalist group, in which even monogamy is too restrictive for the laws under which this elite must live. Eugenic officers put the best to the best to improve the breed, with the eternal goal of elevating this sub-race of gaurdians. Men who distinguish themselves, usually in war, are honored with their pick of the fillies, the only material reward they are allowed. Plato rarely mentions women except at the end of a discussion, with a phrase like, \\"Oh, yeah, and women too.\\" Presumably, the highest reward for a woman's service is her own say in the choice of stud.These Guardians, and this society as a whole, are maintained on a rigidly censored information stream. It is subject to broad blacklists, including whole rhythms of music, forms of worship, and essentially all of visual art. In fact, the latter section of this book includes a diatribe against representative art, abstract being unknown. Ivins, in his history of print and the spread of knowledge, claims that the Greeks' condemnation of visual art held back Western civilization for a millenium. They could have invented block printing, except that slave-copied manuscripts were so convenient, and could have created accurate image reproductions, except that philosophical purity raises one above the need to deal with actual objects in the physical world. Instead, knowledge lay locked in medieval scriptoria until Gutenberg and his motley crew set it free.My two biggest problems with The Republic, however, lie in its first and last sections. The first is a condensed example of more techniques of invalid reason than I have names for. Plato accepts the conclusion as premise, creates false dichotomies, terms the irrelevant as opposite, and generally displays every foul punch and groin kick of disputation that now grace our headlines. The student of debate where viciousness dominates reason must study these first fifty pages.The last section, of course, is the one in which Plato proposes the Noble Philosopher as the grand lord of his republic. These other-wordly beings would live in their cloister of Truth, occasionally to descend from their Empyrean heights to grace us with more of their dicta regarding the proper functioning of the world. One can only assume that Plato would have taken that burden upon himself.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"After reading The Republic in various translations over the years, I decided on this one for a high school course I will be teaching. There are better translations out there for the serious or advanced scholar, but for a teen's introduction to Plato, this book works well. The text is not cluttered with numerical references or notes, which makes the book a bit less intimidating for the mid-teen student. The language is clear and easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"This version is so far the nicest I have seen, if you don't want to spend the extra five dollar on the Management Laboratory Press version. But this one is great aswell!"},{"Title":"The Republic of Plato","review":"WARNING, BUYERS BEWARE: This edition of Plato's Republic by NABU Press is the worst kind of online entrepreneurial opportunism. It is a repackaging in ebook form of Benjamin Jowett's 1871 translation of the Republic, which is in the public domain and freely available all over the internet. So don't waste your money (and they want how much?!). If you want to read the Republic now, google Plato Republic text and find it any number of places (e.g. download the whole book from Google Books). If you want a good hard copy, look at Allan Bloom's or any number of real new translations over the last 30 years. Your public library probably has one or two of them also. But don't buy this edition: unless you just like throwing your money away and supporting people operating shady businesses."},{"Title":"Women Of Old Hawaii","review":"The first sentence in this book sets the tone for the type of drivel found in this book - \\"By today's standards, it is no exaggeration to say that the Hawaiian wahine had it all over her Oriental and Caucasian sisters.\\" Who uses 'Oriental' to describe Asians anymore?For 38 pages, the author pontificates non-hawaiian \\"understanding\\" of concepts on ancient hawaiian life and wraps it up in a melodrama bow. She describes the hackney stereotypical descriptions of Hawaiian life in crib notes, with no substantial proof by way of a bibliography, footnotes, or detailed explanation of WHY women in ancient Hawai'i were allowed to do one thing and not another.The majority of the book focuses on the women of the Hawaiian monarchy and not of the skilled women such as the midwife, the undertaker, or the everyday woman.Overall, the writing style is sophomoric at best and reads like cheeky gossip found in a tabloid magazine. Sometimes, it is downright funny.If you want to learn about Hawaiian history, choose books from reputable scholars such as \\"Dismembering Lahui\\" by Dr. Jon K Osorio or the up and coming book \\"Daughters of Haumea\\" by Lucia and Natalie Jensen. You will learn more of the 'real' Hawaiian woman.I would not recommend any book by this author to a serious scholar of Hawaiian antiquities."},{"Title":"Resistance Welding Manual, Revised 4th Edition","review":"Hi, we are very much influenced by your manual at our company, Mahindra and Mahindra.

The book mainly covers contemporary urban phenomena--everything beyond the second chapter through the sixteenth and last chaper deals with 19th, 20th, and 21st century urban themes and phenomena. Again, it's a book about modern urban sociology, with only one chapter on ancient, medieval, fuedal, and renaissance urban civilizations.

And the text material focuses on the aesthetic and stylistic aspects as well as the historical aspects.This enjoyable book is one of the best of its kind that I have seen, and I recommend it to all readers interested in interior decoration. It is well worth the price.The collaborating authors have done a truly fantastic job."},{"Title":"Furniture Atlas: From Rococo to Art Deco","review":"I really enjoyed Judith Miller's series on furniture and design. But there were limited examples of Rococo wood furniture with inlays and gilding. I was stunned to see 1300 color pictures in this book. I have traveled to many of the locations and seen some of these masterpieces. I could not capture on film the details that this book brings to your eyes with perfect lighting, close ups, and even whole room settings. The commentary is fascinating by detailing who designed/built it, for whom, and where it can be seen today. The variation within the same style due to country and designer/purchaser is shown. The wood grains are very visible so you can see the difference in the woods used. Many of these are rare today.If you have traveled to European palaces and museums and been impressed with the craftsmanship and decor, you will love this book. Labeled as an encyclopedia, I wasn't prepared for how the book was laid out. Yes, it can claim to be an encyclopedia (of knowledge) but you read it like an interconnected story. The progression of styles from Rococo to Art Deco is explained and examples provided. I differ from another reviewer in that I love Rococo. For once I got the sheer volume of pieces that left me satisfied.The Bibliography takes 6 pages and the Index of proper names of people and locations is 13 pages long. This should give you an idea of how detailed this book is."},{"Title":"Furniture Atlas: From Rococo to Art Deco","review":"This is a well written book in light of the fact there are different authors for each section. Beware that this book's focus is on Europe--there is no discussion of America or other places outside of Europe. One thing that struck me was the vastness of the furniture world. For example, Chippendale and Hepplewhite each warrant no more than a few paragraphs.One thing that I found annoying was the focus on the pinnacle of furniture making. I am more interested in furniture owned by average folks, not the crazy over-the-top stuff of royalty. I've never had a client request a bedroom in the the style of Louis the XVI because it would take an army of craftsmen and millions of dollars to recreate the bedroom.The book has several chapters on interiors. These discussions are nice but again, the focus is on the pinnacle of interior design.I was disappointed about the discussion of Art Nouveau. The author, Ornella Selvafolta, spends many pages discussing painting and architecture. This discussion did not contribute to what I wanted to know--i.e. furniture design. The same thing goes for the section on Art Deco which was authored by Selvafolta also."},{"Title":"I'd Kill to Be a Widow : Reflections on Divorce","review":"I discovered this book at my very first appointment with my divorce attorney. I was a little shocked at first, but once I started flipping through it, I so appreciated the humor in it. It's a very quick read with hand written thoughts on each page, some accompanied by illustrations that are also funny. Some of the reflections are laugh out loud hysterical and provide much needed relief given the seriousness of the entire divorce process. Others are words of wisdom that I had honestly never thought of in that way. I have read it many times and keep coming back to get the encouragement you can only get from someone who has been through it herself. It's a mix of humor and wisdom. It makes me laugh and smile, and these days, that's exactly what I need!"},{"Title":"Television: The Critical View","review":"I was assigned this book in a college course on television as popular culture. I seriously struggled with the text at first, but luckily I didn't sell it back. After rereading it again, it has completely smashed the myth that nothing on television is culturally viable. Do not fall into the trap of believing there is no culture left in America. This book will teach how to engage your television in a way that is as mentally stimulating as anything I can imagine. Do yourself a favor and get this book! It might take you a couple reads, but it's well worth it. Enjoy. (I took points off for density, but I have the 5th ed.)"},{"Title":"How Did It Begin?","review":"Picked this book up in the bargain section and this sparked my interest. This book covers a range of topics and offers different possibilities of where different customs, traditions, etc come from. As interesting as this was to read, it offers no source of where the information comes from to help validate the claims being made. I got past this and kept reading because i am still curious about how things possibly could have came to be. So for a bargain price i thought it was a interesting book even despite its lack of evidence."},{"Title":"How Did It Begin?","review":"The other negative review just about sums it up. It is a collection of \\"just so\\" fables seemingly just made up by the author. On a few subjects where I actually knew what the provenance of something was, the book is erroneous. Please, please, please, don't waste your money as I did. Just a typical excerpt:\\"When....the tomb of Tullia, Cicero's daughter was discovered in the Via Appia outside Robe, it was said that a light had been burning inside for nearly 1,500 years. This was not necessarily an incredible, miraculous tale, but could have been accounted for by a supply of natural gas or oil.\\"This is NOT just an isolated case. The book is FULL of stuff like this."},{"Title":"How Did It Begin?","review":"I bought this book on a whim and because I thought it would be fun. I should have been more careful and checked the author, who is not a historian at all. Just a \\"ooh that sounds fun.\\"His \\"history\\" of superstitions is full of just made up facts, complete nonsense, and outright errors. I found this out in the first chapter when he discusses our superstitions about number 13. According to Brasch, ancient man could not count above 12.Um...what?Brasch's ever-convincing proof? That after the number 12, we use \\"compound words\\" for numbers. Forget that in both Latin and Hebrew (as well as many other languages) the \\"compound\\" nature of numbers begins at 10. This really isn't hard to figure out as we have ten fingers.This mistakes continue on from there, and crazy theories are put forth as fact with no citation, no sources, no further information. The only thing I can think is that Brasch was sitting in a room throwing darts at a wall to come up with this stuff.What makes the book even worse is the pathetic editing. Take this classic example:\\"In the sixteenth century, breakfast was a snack, with no fixed menu. It's only purpose was to break the fast. Two thousand years later it had become a sumptuous meal, not just for the family, but for plenty of guests as well.\\"You'll be happy to know that in the 36th century, we can look forward to sumptuous meals.Later today, I'm handing the book over to my child to use for art projects--because goodness knows it's not good for much else."},{"Title":"How Did It Begin?","review":"from back cover:\\"Did you ever wonder why a bride wears a veil, why men and women button their garments on different sides, or why people shake hands?\\"Do you know why we christen ships, dress boys in blue and girls in pink, and consider it unlucky to walk under ladders or open an umbrella indoors?\\"These and manuy more unusual priactices are explained in detail in this fascinating book. 'How Did It Begin?' explores hundreds of traditions from simple superstitions to customs connected with birth, marriage, death, dress, magic, religion; table manners, common courtesies, army and navy customs, and sporting terms. A highly entertaining book, it also provides students, teachers, writers, and general readers with a rich fund of usefull information on an intriguing subject.\\""},{"Title":"The Prophet's Children (Historical Memories)","review":"If you are like me and trying to understand how to rebuild the American Left, then this is a book that you should read.The one lesson that the American Left has failed to learn, and this is apparent from reading Wolforth's book, is that we must abandon democratic-centralism in favor of pluralism. Almost all streams of the radical Left in this country have one source..Leninism. It was Lenin who created the one party state and who began the suppression of all opposition. The American Left has carried forward this model with disastrous results: small fragmented left groups, each claiming a monopoly on the truth. This happened with the old CPUSA, the 4th Internationale Trotskyist movement (of which Wolforth was a leader) and the new Communist movement that emerged in the 70s.We need to shed this model and build a pluralistic, heterodoxic democratic Left. Mr. Wolforth's book sheds light on this and provides other lessons for our movement from his rich experience.Thomas Seay"},{"Title":"The Prophet's Children (Historical Memories)","review":"I met Tim Wohlforth in the early 1970s when he headed up the Workers League, a left split from Socialist Workers Party.

The author refers to his real estate investment experience several times throughout the book, yet he discusses only the single property he has purchased, disqualifying him as a mentor in my mind. He write without technicality, and fills much of the book quoting other \\"real estate gurus\\" and citing summaries of text he has read. I am really surprised that this book was rates so highly on this site, because it really has been a disappointment and waste of time.

I have since purchased books that are more useful as reference material, if not as entertaining to read. If you're wondering if buying and rental properties is for you - this book is interesting.

I just finished this one. Doug is a common guy, just like most of the rest of us. He quit studying and got in the game, and he &quot;hit a stand-up-double&quot; on his first at bat! No home runs, No strike outs, No sugar coating, No tales of how he made millions in real estate, or learned how, but did not do it after CPA school. Doug tells the things he did right that you may want to copy. He tells the mistakes he made and how you can avoid them. Doug writes from a perspective that the guy with 10 rental houses already forgot. If you don't have a rental house yet, but you want one, there is no better place to start. If you already have five rental houses and want fifteen, buy a different book. This author gives practical advice and writes in a manner anybody can understand. Sideline critics are a dime a dozen - and they will scare you into staying on the sideline with them. Buy Dougs book and get in the game."},{"Title":"How to Succeed and Make Money with Your First Rental House","review":"A very informative book on the practical ways to begin a career in real estate investing. Doug documents his methods and techniques with great clarity and shows step by step how he leveraged one property to successfully acquire others through equity lines of credit and refinancings. He also describes in detail the markets to focus on, and what one should look for in properties that will make them the most desirable, both for appreciation and from the tenants perspective. His cost analysis approach for determining cash flow and purchase prices has also been crucial to my success. And even more importantly, I found Doug is one of the most accessible authors to email with questions from anyone as they begin their real estate career. Doug answers all questions in a timely and sincere manner and this alone is worth much more than the low price of his book. His direct advice to my emails has been irreplaceable in my progress as a real estate investor. I have never seen such fast, honest and quick responses with such good information to guide me through my real estate career. Both the information in Doug's book and his email accessibility have been irreplaceable to me and I would highly recommend his book to anyone - both real estate novices and seasoned professionals alike.WKS"},{"Title":"How to Succeed and Make Money with Your First Rental House","review":"This book basically tells the story of buying and renting a single family rental.

And each and every one is a master of the craft.In a sense, this is a puff book - created to facilitate the contact between the artist and the knowledgeable consumer. Each furniture maker gets two beautifully printed pages to present their work and their ideas. Not very much room, when you think of it. Reading the book is like spending a day at the very best custom furniture show in the world.

But it is an inspiration, and, eventually, it helped me make what I wanted to do a bit finer in concept.

Many end up leaving the Church and just heading out on their own with their family. Others try to recreate the Church and end up like the groups they despise.I tried a different route. Find the Church of the first century, locate it on earth today. Join it, and submit myself to it. What I found wasn't necessarily what I was comfortable with, but it is the Church that Jesus established through His Apostles, sinners and all! The Orthodox Church doesn't have the prettiest history, but neither does ancient Judaism, yet Jesus said the people of his day regarding the pharisees, and I paraphrase \\"do what they say, but don't do what they do, for they sit in the seat of Moses.\\" Now if he could say that about the hypocritical pharisees, how much more the successors of the Apostles, the men who sit in their seats? And there are plenty of righteous men in the Orthodox Church, past and present.Schism is a great sin, numbered right up there with adultery and murder. The Anabaptist Church is infamous for it's history of schism. If you are searching for the truth, I encourage you to consider Orthodoxy. A good book to start with is eitherThe Way: What Every Protestant Should Know about the Orthodox ChurchorBecoming Orthodox: A Journey to the Ancient Christian Faith."},{"Title":"On a Roll: A Conversation and Listening Text","review":"Both my highschool and adult students love this book!

For it's faults, this is a first novel of tremendous intensity by a writer whose works I now intend to hunt down. It's certainly energised me to track him and end up dashing this off.Stylistically, Bruen throws so many punches so rapidly in this first novel that it's hard to track down influences. Certainly he's read and studied the classics, from Hammett to Ross Macdonald. For California, tho, substitute working class London. And the story is told by a guy Lew Archer didn't get to when he was a troubled adolescent.Having mentioned faults, I should say that the rythmn of this book seems a bit off to me at times. The sheer impact of the narrative, however, tends to obscure the problem.I've come away feeling Bruin's peers are more along the lines of Lou Reed and Iggy Pop than any literary school, and this is certainly no slur. Rilke on Black is a short slam dance of a book that casts a rather long shadow, a small canvas with details that emerge long after you've finished the book.Certainly this isn't mass market stuff. If you appreciate precise, focused prose in a deceptively tight plot with disturbing undertones left and right, however, give Rilke on Black a shot. I feel this is something of a find."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Raymond CHandler once said to an editor that cut a description, claiming that the reader didn't care about that sort of thing, that he was wrong. Atmosphere, observation and feeling were ALL the reader cared about. They just didn't know it.Which is something to keep in mind about Ken Bruen. Once in a while his plots can feel contrived (and sometimes they are great) but his sense of atmosphere - whether in London or Galway, always among hard men and tough women - never waivers. Rilke on Black is far superior to the similar Her Last Call to Louis McNiece. All Bruen's strengths are on display here. Characters are drawn effortless, with just a few strokes, and feel true to life.It's great to see Inspector Brandt show up late in the novel, too. He's not yet the full blown creation that is Bruen's best achievement, but this book is a great sign of the things to come."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Borrowing from the slick sparse noir styles of James Cain and Jim Thompson this book traces the union of three miscreants-a bouncer, his psychotic friend and his hooker girlfriend- through the kidnapping of a club owner who reads Rilke. What happens when a very unstable multi agenda group work together? Twists, turns, violence, and that unmistakeable Bruen black humor. Give yourself a fast read and a quick trip down Bruen Lane."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Bruen is someone who has such high regard right now I was curious to see what his early work was like and I love this little book.

A really great fast read."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Quirky characters with dialog that'll have you believing you're living in their world. But you'll be glad you're not (or, at least, I certainly hope not). This is a written word version of all those horrific youtube videos where some guy (it's always a guy) races his bike/car/sled straight into a wall... and then does it again! Some people just like to live on the edge of the razor blade. Ken Bruen's characters in this book certainly do. You'll see where they're heading, you'll want to look away, but just like with the youtube videos, you won't be able to. And you'll be glad you didn't."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Ken Bruen's book is very reminiscent of the late great Jim Thompson in the descent into madness that the main character goes through and the characters that fill this novel with one major difference - Jim Thompson had the tendency to write passages of his books in a manner that was quite incomprehensible while Bruen writes quite masterfully.This novel involves a bouncer who meets a black girl and starts a torrid affair with her while dealing with his no good but amiable friend Dex. Together they plan the kidnapping of a businessman for ransom.The book is not long (about 145 pages) and reads quite briskly but it has some disquietening moments throughout and demonstrates quite clearly that Bruen is a writer to read.Recommended."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"This is a rather weak example of noir writing. Bruen uses the short, choppy style, but his sentences seem empty of the toughness that characterizes the best noir (I'm thinking of Ellroy or Thompson). He also has some very annoying (and frequently used) stylistic devices which detract. Throw in some high and low culture references which aren't even necessary, weak characterizations, and an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusions, and you've got &quot;Rilke on Black&quot;."},{"Title":"Regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking (RATCHET)","review":"Very short basic kidnapping story revolving around an aging bouncer type, a sexy young woman and their dodgy partner in crime. Of course since this is noir, they can't trust each other one bit as they run around South London and nasty things happen.

The authors you find in this one are; BarryBerowne(Raffles), Ross Macdonald, Brian Garfield,P. G.

Though Ransome doesn't say so directly, it's implied that they were called away from their beloved lake before the promised Second Battle of the Houseboat; they're thinking enviously of the Amazons and the D's making Captain Flint and his partner Timothy \\"Squashy Hat\\" Stedding walk the plank, and desperately missing the fun of having a small sailcraft of their own. Then they help Jim Brading, owner of the cutter \\"Goblin,\\" moor to his buoy, and before they know it they've made a lifelong friend and been invited to do a little sailing while he waits to be joined by his uncle. Their landlady, who knows him, recommends him to their mother, who consents on condition that they'll be home by teatime Friday, since Cdr. Walker (returning overland by train) is expected on Saturday. But then Jim leaves them anchored near Felixstowe Dock while he makes a run ashore to get gasoline for the engine, and before he returns a sea fog rolls up the river, the tide rises, and \\"Goblin\\" begins to drag her anchor. To their horror the Walkers find themselves drifting out into the North Sea--on a stormy night.Ransome portrays his young characters in a very believable way--worried, scared, yet determined to make the best of their situation, and making good use of the lessons they've learned aboard their little \\"Swallow\\" to keep themselves afloat. The storm prevents them from turning back, and Susan is deathly seasick, but they know that if they keep going they're certain to hit Europe--and they do, in the form of Holland, but not before their unplanned presence gives them the opportunity of rescuing a \\"shipwrecked sailor,\\" a half-drowned kitten they name Sinbad. And just as they're coming into port, they encounter a very unexpected helper (you'll have to read the book to find out who it is!).

A children's book for all ages."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"Arthur Ransome's seventh &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; adventure is set not long after the action of &quot;Pigeon Post&quot;. The action occurs, this time, in the south of England, rather than in the Lake District, and with just the Swallows alone. They are passing the time on the Rivers Orwell and Stour, while waiting to meet up with their father - due, at any time, on leave from his overseas posting with the Royal Navy.What starts out as a few days quiet sailing, though, quickly turns into something rather more frightening, with the children suddenly drawn into a terrifying and completely unexpected adventure, when they find themselves and their (borrowed) boat being swept out to sea by a fierce tide. For once, the Swallows face a very real and serious danger that is to test their combined courage, fortitude and seamanship to the utmost. It is fascinating (for grown-up readers, at least) to see each of the children's highly individual (and completely characteristic) reactions to their predicament. Younger readers, of course, are more likely just to be carried away by the pure nail-biting suspense of it all!While this is a gripping and enthralling tale throughout, the tensions (arising from the danger and the worries of the older children) are lightened for the reader by the pure infectious glee of the younger pair. They, of course, are less aware of the seriousness of their predicament - especially Roger, who, as usual, is perfectly content so long as there is plenty of food around - and rather enjoy themselves!As in all of the &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; books, Ransome's story-telling abilities are second to none, here. The narrative is at all times feasible and this book is a completely absorbing read for young and old alike. This is an inspired and an inspiring tale. Readers who have worked their way through the earlier volumes will also not be disappointed when they finally do get to meet Daddy in this volume!"},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"The &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; books are a variable bunch. They range from &quot;The games we played on our holidays&quot; (Swallows and Amazons, Swallowdale, etc.) to &quot;The stories we made up about ourselves&quot; (Peter Duck, Missee Lee). Even in the straightforward sailing stories the children's imaginations turn Lakeland fells into Darien Peak, casting an air of unreality and whimsy over the narrative that some readers like and others find irritating.We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea is different. The Walker children find themselves in real danger when, through a mixture of bad luck and a crucial mistake, they are swept out into the hostile North Sea in a small cutter, the Goblin, which they have hardly sailed before. There's fog and a storm-force gale building up. Can they save the ship, and themselves, purely on their own experience of dinghy sailing and their own guts and determination?Of course they can. But it isn't easy. The core of this exciting story is the overnight transformation of John Walker from boy to adult. He takes responsibility for the ship and his brothers and sisters, takes difficult decisions and sticks with them through an extremely hairy night at sea.There is little artificiality to most of the narrative. Everything that happens - until they reach Holland, that is - springs naturally from the situation the children find themselves in. The story's only flaw - and it's a serious one - is the deus ex machina springing of Commander Walker, their father, out of practically nowhere to take them home again. From the moment he jumps from the Flushing-Harwich ferry, the gripping realism of the story evaporates.If you love the sea and sailing, if a tale of courage winning through appeals to you, then read this book. It's a classic and, in this reader's opinion, the best of the Swallows and Amazons series; an opinion I formed 34 years ago and see no reason to alter now."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"Of all the &quot;Swallows &amp; Amazons&quot; books, this is the most compelling read -- it doesn't share the laid-back mood of most of the others, and the Walker children are in real danger, which is unusual for the series (the nearest to such would be the &quot;Israelites&quot; sequence {in &quot;Secret Water&quot;} or in &quot;Pigeon Post&quot; {in the &quot;Moles&quot; or the fire sequence} all of which are important but limited parts of the books).Visiting aboard the &quot;Goblin&quot;, the yacht of a young man they had recently met, they find themselves adrift in a fog, swept helplessly out into the North Sea as they drag (and lose) anchor, and then running before a full North Sea gale, with no idea where they are or where they are headed, and no certainty that they will not find themselves sinking on shoals or run down by much larger ships (In a particularly tense and thrilling sequence, just that almost happens, averted at the last instant by ingenuity and level-headedness on the part of Captain John.).Facing the dangers they discover, drawing on their experience in sailing much smaller boats and on their own courage and common sense, they succeed in keeping themselves and the &quot;Goblin&quot; from harm, and even succeed in a mid-sea &quot;rescue&quot;.And, in the course of the adventure, John Walker (somewhere in his late teens, if i calculate aright) makes a major part of the step from boy to young man, learning valuable lessons about himself and what he is capable of, and keeping himself and his sisters and brother safe through the long, stormy night.This is children's adventure at its best, with action, comedy, thrills and danger enough to satisfy almost any taste, but no violence, gratutitous or otherwise."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"I have read all the SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS books several times since I was ten.

The Walker children inadvertantly sail across the North Sea in a snall yacht, after first being swept out to sea and then sailing through a storm. Covers a short time-span but a lot of realistic adventures.Some of the events in this book were based on real-life events that happened to Ransome himself and the yacht in the story, the Goblin, was based on a yacht that Arthur Ransome owned, all of which no doubt contributed to the realism of this book."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"The five Walker children, waiting for their father to return from the Navy, are visiting a seaside town and befriend a young man who owns his own boat. While visiting the boat, their friend goes ashore and never returns. The rising tide causes the boat to drag anchor and the boat drifts out to sea....While the previous novels have flirted with danger (like the brush fire in PIGEON POST), this time the kids are in a serious situation all through. Not only are they completely on their own at sea, they also have to deal with a severe storm and learn to improvise their needs.John really comes into his own in this book, developing into a responsible young man. The kids' reactions to their situation are realistic and gripping. Their sense of responsibility is also impressive; they're desperate to take care of the boat they're in, and also rescue a half-drowned kitten from a piece of flotsam. (The kitten is dubbed Sinbad and returns for an appearance in the next book.)The descriptions of their experiences at sea are extremely well-written. The only thing marring the book is a seemingly convenient coincidence toward the end, when the kids land in the Netherlands only to meet....their father?!?!?! Then again, I've had a few wild coincidences happen to me in the past, so it's not entirely out of the question.Still, all in all, this is the best book in the series, a gripping adventure and coming-of-age tale.Next in the series: A step backwards with SECRET WATER."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"I read this book may times as a child and have been searching for a copy to give to my teenage boys to read.This book probably gave me my early desire to &quot;go to sea&quot;.I spent twelve yars in the U.S. Navy, with a lot of time at sea, and many nights as I watched the reflections of the moonlight on the ocean, my thoughts would drift back to my early years and the evenings spent reading &quot;We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea.Buy it and give it to your kids for an exciting adventure without the violence we see so often."},{"Title":"We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea","review":"For my money, this is one of the great sailing stories of our times.

That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender. A must-read, for everyone."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Oh, what a romp this is! When Virginia Woolf isn't feeling sorry for herself, she can be a delight. Don't read this book as a treatise on sexual identity or societal roles. Woolf describes the book as a biography, and that's what it is. Orlando makes his (then her) way through the world, trying to make sense of it and, from time to time, trying to fit in. It wreaks havoc with your love life when you don't age over the centuries (just ask Anne Rice's vampires). But it does give you perspective, and that is why we read."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Virginia Woolf is often a difficult author for students to become familiar with. Her _Orlando_, which strikingly defies placement in a single genre, introduces the reader to Miss Woolf's language, her symbols, and the themes common to her many equisite works. However, _Orlando_ is bereft of the beautiful and detailed stories and ideas which enrich her other works, making the novel on the whole a simple enough read for the beginner.Compared with the span of her works, _Orlando_ stands out as an original among originals. Nowhere else does Miss Woolf so successfully tell a fabulous tale, and nowhere else does she render concrete locations, times, and events so beautifully."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"The most brilliant portrayal of a transsexual experience in modern history. Even when Magnus Hirshfield was publishing his treatise on the transsexual phenomenah, Woolfe relates an account of the intracies of gender identity undiscovered by social scientists and biologists. Published in 1928, Orlando has been billed as one of Woolfe's best imaginative works however, such criticism was never seen in the light of reality but a surreal depiction of the writer's portrayal of a young man who wakes up one day as a woman, as if in the ordinary course of his life. As Woolfe suggests of her character's reaction to the change \\"Orlando herself showed no surprise at it.(Woolfe, 139. Modern transsexuals have explained only recently in their writings, their internal thinking stays the same, only the external body appears different to others. Woolfe describes: the reaction to his change of sex, as it may appear in a scientific journal today;\\"[b]ut in every other respect, Orlando remained preceisely as he had been. The change of sex, though it altered their future, did nothing whatever to alter their identity. (Woolfe, 138). Woolfe captures the failure of the general public to grasp the concept of gender reassignment when she has the narrator express dismay in the lack of Orlando's reaction where \\"Orlando was a man till the age of thirty (Similar to our understanding of modern transsexuals who start their transition at middle age) when he became a woman and has remained ever since.\\" (Woolfe, 139)'. Woolfe's use of metaphor and foreshadowing is uncanny. The pyrotechnic displays prior to the deep sleep of Orlando depicts change. She puts Orlando on a ship called the 'Enamoured Lady,' and she is suddenly the object of the Captain's and other males' attention and realizes that the sexual fantacies of men creates a dillemma for her as a woman, where she must sheild her own desires as a woman. Woolfe precisely proclaims that '(Orlando) remembered how, as a young man, she had insisted that women must be obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled... (and) \\"Now I shall have to pay in my own person for those desires ... for women are not (judging by my own short experience of the sex) obedient, chaste, scented, and exquisitely apparelled by nature.\\" Woolfe does not stop at her proclivity to undress Orlando's gender identity but lays bare the confusion of sexual preference. Although a woman herself, Orlando proclaims that \\"it was still a woman she loved; and if the consciousness of being of the same sex had any effect at all, it was to quicken and deepen those feeling which she had had as a man.\\" (Woolfe, 161). Where she gives in to sensual thoughts of a man, the Captain on whose arm she trembles and remembers that she had once been a Duke and Ambassador, \\"that she, who had been lapped like a lily in folds of paduasoy, had hacked heads off, and lain with loose women amoung treasure sacks in holds of pirate ships...\\" Woolfe reveals a metaphoric character, the Archduchess Harriet Griselda of Finster-Aarhorn and Scan-op-Boom in the Roumanian territory, seen in chapter three as a woman, and in a later chapter is shown to be a man, the Archduke, who suddently professes his love for her. Woolfe's ability to produce a character like the Arduke Harry who today would fall somewhere on the transgendered scale, is amazing, for a woman in her time. Yet through all its carefully crafted language and delightful parody, the gender message she professes is much the same today as it may have been then, that \\"Clothes ... change our view of the world and the world's view of us....\\" Orlando challenges the Eurocentric binary gender construct of the world she lived in. Here, the writer's own indictment of the unrealistic bounds placed on women is evident and transposed by her narrator and Orlando's own expository reflections, \\"In every human bing a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only that clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\" (Woolfe, 189). Here, Woolfe appears to challenge more than the unfairness and imperfections of gender traditions on women. She uses comparaisons of the formalities of being a nieteenth century man and woman to make her point. Additionally, the most introspective journey in Orlando, is of a person who is not questioning her own gender identity, but defining it. Woolfe appears to depict, not confusion, but knowledge by the transsexual main character of her own identity, and chosing to adapt to it by changing the way the world looks at her, by changing sex. It is the world that suffers the confusion. Woolfe makes generalities about other persons hiding their sex in the clothing of the other gender, suggesting there are numerous persons in her era that suffer from some sort of gender dysphoria. After reading Orlando, and comparing it with the writings of transsexual, transgendered and social scientists,Woolfe describes so clearly the struggle a transgendered person experiences, that critics should look more closely at this writing. Woolfe's narrator states: \\"Of complications and confusions which thus result every one has had experience;\\" and as though afraid to delve deeper, she leaves this general question to \\"note only the odd effect it had in the particualr case of Orlando herself.\\" As Woolfe so eloquently portrays the posttranssexual eptiome, \\"having now worn skirts for a considerable time, a certain change was visible in Orlando, which is to be found even in her face...\\" and where the narrator wonders, had both the man and woman of Orlando's time.worn the same clothes (in other words, different sexes but same gender) it is possible their outlook may have been the same too.\\" (Woolfe, 188). Yet the most profound statement made in the text reveals Woolfe's secret exposition: \\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of soemthing hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dicated her choise of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only exprssing rather than mor openly than usual---openness indeed was the soul of her nature---(Woolfe, 189). Thus, Woolfe explains that Orlando chose to change his sex because he was in fact a woman, a woman's soul in a man's body. This book is highly recommended to all who are ever wonder what it is like for a transsexual to alter his sex, and begin living as the gender opposite of his or her sex. And for those who never wondered, it is a great read, full of insightful commentary on the possibility of a gender continuum and expanding the boundaries of a binary gender system of a phallocentric society."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? This Guy. I'm probably going to have to turn in my English Lit Major membership card over this, but man. I slogged through this, and didn't enjoy it at all. I'm not sure when I was last so bored by a book whose core concept intrigued me so much. Orlando is virtually immortal, changes gender mid-book, has a group of core household personnel who also seem to be immortal. The story starts in Elizabethan times and moves to the early 1900's. So much of that is fodder for great storytelling, not to mention the ability to comment on societal norms, gender reversals, etc. I won't deny that Woolf manages to pack a lot of social commentary into the book. I won't deny that she experiments with form in a way that makes most students and professors of English literature salivate. But in a book that is over 300 pages long ... nothing happens! Sure, there's the sudden deep freeze and equally sudden thaw of England that provides a momentary rush, but other than that, the protagonist spends pretty much the entire book sitting around depressed over the slights he receives from a woman, a fellow poet, and other varied personalities. I'll say it again: I was bored. And based on my reaction to this, which is supposed to be the most accessible of Woolf's works ... I can honestly say I don't think I'll be trying to read anything else by her.Also, It is interesting to me that when I looked on Amazon, BN and Goodreads, none of the product descriptions I read attempt to describe the plot of ORLANDO. These are product descriptions now, not reader reviews. They all talk about how original and influential the book is and what a great movie Tilda Swinton was in a few years back. But none of them even attempt to describe the plot beyond what's quoted in the premise above.

Much has been written about the startlingly experimental nature of the book's treatment of its hero/heroine. Especially for its time, Woolf's daring literary gambit puts this novel head and shoulders above most others.But her writing, more than any experimenting, is what endeared this book to me in the first place, and continues to do so. From the opening passages in which young Orlando engages in fencing practice with the decapitated head of a Moor, to the incredible descriptions of the ice-bound Thames finally thawing and carrying away with it the multitudes who have encamped on its frozen surface, Orlando weaves a hypnotic spell that lingers long after the reader has closed its covers."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Orlando is perhaps the most entertaining of Woolf's works that I have seen. Clearly, she wanted to explore gender components but chose a wonderfully satirical framework and let go of ordinary boundaries of time and space to create the utter freedom she needed to do so. I'm sure there are many more well thought out discussions of the gender-identity issues in these reviews, but I wanted to let readers know what wonderful satire and what beautiful writing this is and its all wrapped around a literary romp that provides sheer pleasure for fans of English literature."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"We had to read \\"To the Lighthouse\\" in high school, and based on that book, I thought Virginia Woolf was a chore.

First there is the fact that it is a Woolf book that is purely fun and romantic, and void of the trenchant tone of her other books. It is gorgeous, challenging farce, nothing more. Then there is the typical Woolf language, a stunning eye for detail, and rare and particular introspection about gender and identity. Then there is the novelty of the story itself, and how it embraces its matter-of-fact peculiarity. Woolf only rarely goes off the deep end here, and the story overall is mostly beautiful and keenly interesting. Fans of the wonderful Tilda Swinton movie will be reassured at its fidelity to the book. Fans of Woolf's canon will find this one of the more simply enjoyable books out there, but also a worthy addition to world literature in spite of its breezier attributes. Full recommendation."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This novel has aged in many ways and remains the testimony of an author and a period. To imagine a character who could survive Elizabeth I up to modern times is at least bizarre. We wonder what the objective is. When the originally male character turns female somewhere in Turkey, we start understanding the aim: to study the male personality and the female personality respectively as confronted to a person of the other sex. What's more when later that female Orlando finds her supreme pleasure in dressing and behaving like a man in her transvestite personality we understand she is trying to recapture the pleasures of being a man, though it is artificial. This can only be dealt with if we consider sex the way it used to be considered, as a private secret you have to keep hidden and unseen. Today, all that is trite and without much interest in the post AIDS generation. Literature is entertainment and if a book is only interesting for its historical value in literature it is no longer entertaining, an entertainment. And that's just the problem. Then the vanity of those who try to psychoanalyze Virginia Woolf through her works is just what it is a vanity, and what's more a useless and fake vanity that seems to ignore that an author is able to go beyond that kind of psychoanalytical determinism if not vulgate. Too bad because that book could have been a historical depiction of these three centuries it covers, but it is not.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID"},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Orlando is adventure, comedy, gender study and literary commentary all rolled into one. The titular character lived through four centuries. During that time he served the Queen, fell in love with a Russian princess and lost her, entertained annoying guests, spent a century roaming in his estate, sailed out to exotic places where he became a she, and came back to find that her old love had grown fat.A host of memorable characters populated the story, gifting it with eccentric moments: the pizza was toasted in the fireplace and the rug nearby was burned, the countess sneaked in the garden and \\"cackled and gaffled\\", and the sea captain was lured to chivalry by Orlando the lady's legs. The narrative is not as experimental as Woolf's earlier novels, but the prose is still intelligent and evocative.

Very novel and engaging if a bit loose-ended at times."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"I read Orlando because someone told me that a central theme was Knole, the massive great house of the Sackvilles in Sevenoaks, in Kent south west of London. (I also liked Mrs Dalloway--See my Amazon review.) When we lived in London my family and I spent a day at Knole. It is supposedly the largest private house in England. Much of it now belongs to the National Trust. Knole beggars description--it is a vast mansion, brooding, and dark, but also eminent; it is a castle, a factory, mills, breweries, a village, and menagerie. I remember the deer as being especially numerous and friendly. Orlando the novel is dedicated to Vita Sackville-West who sadly was unable to inherit Knole although she grew up there. Only males could inherit.The novel Orlando is a tour through English history from the mid-15 hundreds to 1928 always from odd perspectives. It is also a subtle and searching exploration of gender roles, social roles, and artistic and creative efforts. Themes interweave with lightning speed. It's crazy, funny, satirical, wild, and moody. I found parts to be incoherent, post-modern stream-of-consciousness, but most is entertaining and illuminating.But this novel always comes back to Knole just as Orlando does. He/she (there is a sex change mid-novel) tours her house, thinks about it, ponders it, worries about it, and is always focused on it. Orlando lives for hundreds of years, but somehow I think he/she is a metaphor for the great house. Knole is not mentioned by name in the novel, but that's it. Knole is also the setting for The Edwardians by Vita Sackville-West. Knole is very worth a visit if you get to London or Kent. On the web at the National Trust website.A visit in person however would help bring the novel Orlando to life. The novel is titled Orlando: A Biography. I think it is the biography of Knole.One other odd feature: My edition (Signet Classics) has in index. This is the first novel I've read with an index. This suggests to me that Orlando is more than a novel, it is also a history of sorts."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This is a review among many reviews and will leave out the tale of the story assuming it has already been read here. This tremendous novel is one of my two favorites. \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez also luxuriously takes the reader through a lifetime that lasts many lifetimes in length. The reader becomes a traveler through a society, culture and location while watching time fly by at a rate 2-5 times that of the lives we actually live. Both stories give the reader a sense that judgement about experience can extend to generations of experience and not just to one's single, private, say, 80 year period. The benefit of reading these books, to young readers who are trying to stretch their own personal horizons, is beyond belief.Each story is a gift from it's author on a level seen almost no where else. With all modesty I'll say that they are imaginative, funny and compelling.Another text that transcends the perspective of one lifetime in one person's viewfinder is \\"Foundation and it's Trilogy\\" although that work of science fiction is simply not in the class of literature of the other two."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Once you get into the flow of Woolf's tangled web of a world, this book is at the same time poetic, philosophical, and a beautiful social commentary.

However, it may mean more to the person it is written about than to us. Personally, I found the plot to be a constraint. Virginia Woolf's earlier books are also constrained by plot and she is at her best when she discards it or uses it only loosely enough to allow her sprawling style to make sense. Orlando, for me, is too caught up in the gender and time changes. Perhaps the book can be read while subtly ignoring these aspects and experiencing the book sentence by sentence (like in The Waves say). However, that might not be doing this book justice either. Perhaps I simply did not understand or buy into the premise of the book or some of the plot details.

It was a strange tale of adventure and romance, with Orlando seeking the beauties of life and poetry throughout the centuries."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Throughout history, women have always been the subject of oppression and stereotyping. Today the world is finally beginning to accept women as intellectuals, workers, writers, and other occupations other than housewife. However, women have not always been so fortunate, and history clearly shows their oppression from the lack of information left behind by women. Some of the greatest writers who ever lived may not of gotten anyone to read their writing, because they were women and it was not \\"politically-correct\\" for them to do anything but raise the children. Gradually, near the beginning of the century, women were able to start pushing away these stereotypes, and they started to receive more rights and were allowed to publish their writings. Virginia Woolf is able to wonderfully express the struggle of women, in a way in which men could easily relate. By Orlando starting as a man and then seeing all his rights and respect taken away when he becomes a woman, the men reading could understand what they have and take for granted. One example of the unfair way in which the women were treated can be seen when Orlando goes back to England for the first time after the change. She went to get her house but encountered a few problems, \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead , and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same...\\" (pg.168) The women of the day were given rights no better than those of a dead man were. Also as soon as she got back, she was expected to settle down and start looking for a husband, instead of writing or working, \\"In short, they acted the parts of man and woman for ten minutes with great vigor ...\\" (pg. 179) This is how her life was, secretly hiding herself from society, and also dealing with the courting of men. It is ridiculous how little respect or rights that she received. The best angle of the book, however, is reading through and noticing the growth of independence in woman and how their world expanded. Gender should never be a consideration in decisions or cloud the minds of those who decide, it should be an equal chance for both men and women. Everyone is stuck on this planet, and we might as well try to get along together with as much peace and equality as we can."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This is a comic \\"biography\\" about Orlando, who starts off the book as a 16 year old boy in the Elizabethan era, and ends the books as a 36 year old woman in 1928.

This is an interesting book that allows Virginia Woolf to make witty observations about English society and the differences between men and women."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"\\"Orlando\\" is a fictional biography whose subject in the beginning is a sixteen-year-old boy in the Elizabethan era and in the end -- three hundred years later -- is a thirty-six-year-old woman. This is not a novel about transsexuality, as such a premise would indicate, but it is a statement about sexual identity and gender roles in English society as only an author like Virginia Woolf could make, territory not even the brazen D.H. Lawrence could traverse with much confidence. It is a lyrical tour de force in which Woolf displays her considerable talent for subtly describing moods and scenery, but most surprisingly, it demonstrates her sly sense of humor and satire.Orlando's gender alteration is naturally the central event of his preternaturally long life, but his aging only twenty years over a course of three centuries is certainly no less bizarre. To describe the circumstances under which he becomes a woman or explain the logic by which he ages so slowly would be giving away too much in this review, nor would it really help to recommend the novel to one who is not yet persuaded to read it, so I will be silent on that account, saying only that these outrageous devices fully succeed as vehicles to explore Woolf's theme of femininity with respect to English cultural and historical frames of reference.The novel examines the effect of gender alteration on Orlando's amorous and professional capacities. As a young nobleman in the Elizabethan court whose interests are swordsmanship and poetry, he is engaged to an aristocratic Irish girl, has a torrid affair with a Russian princess, and meets a silly woman who, resembling nothing so much as a hare, calls herself the Archduchess Harriet. After serving as an ambassador in Turkey, Orlando becomes a woman, joins a band of gypsies, and returns to England where he (she) must handle the legalities regarding his dukeship because of his new gender. As a woman, he manages to gain the romantic attentions of famous writers like Pope, Dryden, and Swift before eventually marrying and having a son. Some surprises ensue, but let it suffice to say that Orlando is not the only androgynous character in the novel.An underlying, and highly controversial, implication is that every human being harbors aspects of both genders, mainly psychological, but Woolf goes so far as to make them physical in order to press the point. Although the idea may seem tame now, \\"Orlando\\" may have set a precedent for cross-gender role-playing when it was first published in 1928. The novel is very much ahead of its time; it has a sort of nonchalant sophistication that characterizes the type of magical realism that was to become a large part of European-influenced literature throughout the rest of the twentieth century. My admiration for Virginia Woolf only increases with each novel of hers that I read, and \\"Orlando\\" is in my opinion the best yet."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"John Irving (&quot;World According to Garp&quot;) wrote an essay onCharles Dickens book &quot;Great Expectations&quot; in which he saidthat that book was the first book he had ever read that hewished he had written.

In the novel, Woolf uses the character of Orlando, a person who lives through four centuries as man sometimes and woman sometimes.

She depicts Elizabethan times through the early twentieth century with wit and sarcasm.

It follows the title character through English history from the Elizabethan Age to the 1920s, when the novel was written. The writing is different sections of the book mimics the styles of different periods of English literature. Most of the book is firmly tongue-in-cheek (Woolf can be very funny), but it does brush lightly upon issues of art, gender, and history.I think _Orlando_ is the most purely entertaining of Woolf's novels. Orlando's various adventures are highly laughable, and Woolf's dry commentary rarely fails to elicit a smile. It is also one of Woolf's less experimental and ambitious novels. She wrote this novel as a lark, for amusement--it is a very different project from, for example, _The Waves_. This is not to say this is in any way a conventional novel--but it is rather different from Woolf's other works of the 1920s.I would definitely recommend this to most readers--it is more accessible to the general reader than Woolf's other novels. Readers familiar with the history of English literature will find it particularly amusing. If you are a first-time Woolf reader looking to really experience her more important works, however, I would suggest _Mrs. Dalloway_ or _To the Lighthouse_ first."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\" is unique in form, being a mock biography of a fictional character. We are introduced to Orlando, a protagonist based partly on Woolf's close friend Vita Sackville-West, as a 16-year-old boy, the son of noble parents, in the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. By the end of the book, more than three hundred years later, he has become a 36-year-old woman living in \\"modern\\" times (meaning 1928, the year of publication).Woolf uses Orlando's sexual transformation and long life as a vehicle for investigating influences on and consequences of gender and sexuality through history. Her commentary is pointed and often right on the mark. But at the same time, the book is infused with Woolf's dry wit, giving everything a humorous overtone. For example, when Orlando returns to England after his transformation, everyone at home assuming him to be dead, she finds herself embroiled in a legal battle to get her property back: \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead, and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same thing\\" (168). One can tell that, while these issues were obviously important to her, Woolf was having fun when she wrote this.Now, as far as my personal reaction, I am going to be among the minority of reviewers here in saying that overall I really didn't much care for the book. In talking to others who have read it, I've noticed that \\"Orlando\\" seems to be one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" works. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong expectaions, this being my first Woolf novel, but it just kind of fell flat for me. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be the kind of book it was. Thinking it was going to be a historical fiction piece with a serious tone, I found it to be much more like a more emotional version of \\"Candide.\\" Much of it is farcical, and certainly far from being believable.Though Woolf makes some very insightful and worthwhile social commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact. The fantasy-world feel that permeates much of it makes it seem unreal, and therefore less applicable to our own world. In addition, the narrative tone changes from time period to time period, which makes the book feel disjointed. Just as you get used to one style - BAM! - it changes to a different tone and you're left feeling disoriented all over again. And furthermore, Orlando her/himself doesn't feel like a real person. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't empathize with her/him. All of this, I found, got in the way of the actual story and its intended impact.In summary, I do commend Woolf's experimentation in style, and as I noted the underlying messages are important, but overall the book just wasn't as strong as it could have been. If you're a fan of Woolf, go ahead and give it a try. You may well find that you like it after all. But if you like more reality-rooted and tonally serious stories, this probably won't leave you very satisfied. Try it, but calibrate your expectations first."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This fake biography (complete with counterfeit photographs and an index) is not Virginia Woolf's greatest novel by any means--but even the least of her works must rank among the finest of early twentieth-century fiction.The \\"plot\\" seems more appropriate to a Heinlein novel: a boy raised during the Elizabethan period becomes a woman, lives until the 1920s, and ages only 36 years. During the past century, the novel's reception has evolved much like its lead character: while early critics and readers praised the book as a literary parody bordering on farce, later generations have regarded the novel more as a commentary both on sexual roles and on the oppression of women. Some readers will see Orlando as representing, in human form, the evolution of literature (it\`s telling that the only other character who lives as long as Orlando is a critic); some will focus on the novel's presentation of gender and sex. Both interpretations (and others) seem to be equally valid--which is why this book is so powerful even today.One of the most charming (and surprising) qualities of the novel is Woolf's refusal to take herself or her book seriously. At times, the novel is laugh-out-loud funny. She mocks her own style (she interrupts one of her infamous run-on paragraphs with \\"nature ... has so much to answer for besides the perhaps unwieldy length of this sentence\\"), and she even makes fun of the book's very concept (when Orlando is not doing much of anything, Woolf exclaims: \\"If only subjects ... had more consideration for their biographers!\\"). \\"Orlando\\" infuses everyday life with both wit and elegance; or, as Woolf puts it, \\"when the shrivelled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly.\\""},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Woolf's skill of imagery in writing is amazing.

That detail in itself promises an intriguing plot.Woolf's prose often resembles poetry, and in \\"Orlando\\" this is no exception. She cleverly renders Orlando's (and the first-person narrator/biographer) feelings and experiences with a myriad of seemingly useless details. It may take some time to get used to and make sense of how these details fit; yet, that is the beauty and brilliance of Woolf's language that makes this novel (and her other works) such a pleasure to read.\\"Orlando\\" is referred to as Woolf's \\"holiday\\" novel and one that Woolf herself said she wrote in preparation for the next (and often considered best) book, The Waves. While \\"Orlando\\" does seem more light-hearted and comical than her other work, and this is partly due to the fantasy and her use of satire and parody, it can also be quite political in the issues it addresses, particularly those related to gender, literature, and modernity. Orlando as a character conveys her emotions but does not reflect much on their implications. However, we as readers who witness her transformation and her lifestyle, who are made to read to about Orlando's existence and position in the world, would soon find ourselves thinking about Woolf's recurrent themes and how they relate to humanity.As a whole, \\"Orlando\\" is very thought-provoking. Every time I pick it up, I find something new to marvel at."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"No lover in the world ever wrote a valentine more exquisite than Virginia Woolf's tribute to her lover Vita Sackville-West. That tribute was \\"Orlando: A Biography,\\" a magical-realism tale about a perpetually youthful, charming hero/ine who traverses three centuries and both genders -- and Woolf's writing reaches a new peak as she explores the hauntingly sensuous world of Orlando.Orlando was born a young aristocratic man in the time of Queen Elizabeth I, and when the dying monarch visited his home she became his new court favorite (and briefly lover). His passionate, curious personality attracted many other women over the years -- until he fell in love with Sasha, a mercurial but faithless Russian princess (supposedly based on Sackville-West's ex-girlfriend). Bereft of true love, he devoted himself to poetry and entertainment.But then he's assigned to be an ambassador to Constantinople, and something strange happens -- while a bloody revolution rages, he sleeps for a full week... and wakes newly metamorphosed into a woman. With the same mind and soul but a female body, Orlando sets out on a new life -- and discovers that women aren't quite as different from men as she once thought.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a very weird book, and was even more so when it was written since \\"magical realism\\" didn't exist as a literary style in 1928. Virginia Woolf makes no explanations about Orlando's immortality or unexpected gender switch. It's simply accepted that once he was a man, and then she became a woman, and that s/he has lived from the Elizabethan era until at least the 1920s (and who knows, maybe Orlando still wanders among us?).And Woolf's writing is at its peak here. Her prose is soaked in luxurious descriptions that constantly tease the senses -- silver and gold, frozen flowers, crystalline ice, starlight and the exquisite expanses of nature's beauty. At times the sensual writing seems almost feverish, and Woolf adds an almost mythic quality by inserting spirits of feminine virtues (Modesty, Purity and Chastity appear to try to hide Orlando's feminine body), and by having her hero/ine encounter great poets, queens and men of the sea.And Orlando him/herself is a truly fascinating character -- s/he can be sweet, passionate, romantic, wild and melancholy, and s/he has an almost magnetic charisma. He starts off the story as an elusive romantic teenager, suffers a heartbreak that matures him as an artist, and post-metamorphosis she becomes a woman of the modern world. Both in mind and body, Orlando is a very different woman at the end than the boy s/he began as.\\"Orlando: A Biography\\" is a truly spellbinding book -- Virginia Woolf's prose enthralls the senses while her main character explores the boundaries of gender.

Nonplussed, Orlando decides that it is \\"better to be quit of martial ambition, the love of power, and all other manly desires if so one can more fully enjoy the most exalted raptures known to the human spirit, which are . . . contemplation, solitude, love.\\"There follows much discussion of gender and gender confusion. Woolf tells us that:\\"The difference between the sexes is, happily, one of great profundity. Clothes are but a symbol of something hid deep beneath. It was a change in Orlando herself that dictated her choice of a woman's dress and of a woman's sex. And perhaps in this she was only expressing rather more openly than usual - openness indeed was the soul of her nature - something that happens to most people without being thus plainly expressed. For here again, we come to a dilemma. Different though the sexes are, they intermix. In every human being a vacillation from one sex to the other takes place, and often it is only the clothes that keep the male or female likeness, while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.\\"There are many other themes in this imaginary biography which spans centuries. One is comical examination of English society and culture:\\"Thus, stealthily, and imperceptibly, none marking the exact day or hour of the change, the constitution of England was altered and nobody knew it. ... The muffin was invented and the crumpet. Coffee supplanted the after-dinner port, and., as coffee led to a drawing-room in which to drink it, and a drawing-room to glass cases, and glass cases to artificial flowers, and artificial flowers to mantelpieces to pianofortes, and pianofortes to drawing-room ballads, and drawing-room ballads (skipping a stage or two) to innumerable little dogs, mats, and antimacassars, the home - which had become extremely important - was completely altered.\\"This \\"biography\\" is also metafiction, and there are several humorous references to the act of writing. In fact, Orlando herself writes prolifically throughout the novel (carrying with her a poem, \\"The Oak Tree,\\" that must constantly be revised as she changes).and encounters many literary figures, among them the revered Alexander Pope who makes a big impression: \\" ... \`How noble his brow is,' she thought (mistaking a hump on a cushion for Mr. Pope's forehead in the darkness).\\"Sometimes I don't get Virginia Woolf, but I was very entertained by this novel."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This experimental and unusual novel by Virgina Woolf spotlights the rhythm of her prose as no other work of hers can do. The flights of fancy, the descriptions, the tongue-in-cheek humor flow like poetry from the pages--and it's possible that this book is absolutely at its best when read aloud. My favorite Woolf novel is not this one; it's \\"To the Lighthouse\\" which has an incredible sadness and beauty that is difficult to imagine being put down in words. But for sheer fanciful imagery, this novel is quite amazing--let alone the amusing twist of the main character turning from male to female in the first third of the book. Other than that unusual event, the book rather reminds me of Voltaire in the way it fails to take anything seriously, except, perhaps, poetry.The narrator conveys the subtle, arch sense of humor well, and makes the most of the rhythm within the paragraphs. Other than the film that was adapted from the novel (with wonderful Cate Blanchett, who was about the best person imaginable to play Orlando) this audio book really displays Woolf's talent to the max. For lovers of literature, it's like enjoying a box of Turkish Delight and it melts away on the mind with the same soft and liquid sweetness."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"I was attracted to Virgina Woolf's modernist ORLANDO through its bizarre premise of a protagonist starting out as a young man in Elizabethan England and then, changing sex halfway through, living as a female novelist in 20th-century London. ORLANDO is Woolf's love letter to Vita Sackville-West, with whom she carried out a relationship in the 1920s, and the novel is a roman a clef with Orlando living out West's bisexuality. If gender queering is your thing, then this is the literary classic for you.It's not mine, so were the novel only focused on Sackville-West's sexuality, then I probably would have gotten bored with it quite soon. Happily, Woolf focuses very much on how one appreciates literature, with the protagonist making some insightful observations on how readers go about choosing their favourite books, how critics can be so woefully wrong, and how the artist struggles with the creative urge. There's a great deal of laugh-out-loud moments in the book. Also, the plot anticipates magical realism, with so many fantastical developments that nonetheless remain part of a believable narrative.For the most part, ORLANDO is a tame work from Virgina Woolf, not displaying the stream-of-consciousness style of her other major works. Things do get a great deal more avant-garde in the last 50 pages, but for the most part the narration is quite traditional. Although brilliant at first, Woolf's twee and effusive style can become exhausting two thirds of the way through, the main reason I cannot award this book a full five stars. Still, I enjoyed ORLANDO and the novel has many memorable elements."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"By far Virginia Woolf's most lighthearted and appealing book. But it is also by far her most profound meditation on reading and writing, identity and art, history and time.Strictly speaking \\"Orlando\\" is a pseudo literary biography that mocks literary biography (and representation in general). In place of a person Woolf creates a fantastic hybrid and the metamorphoses that occurs simply underlines the unreality, the utterly fabricated nature, of her creation and of all writerly creations. But its also much more than that for Orlando allows Woolf the opportunity to comment on one of her own creations as she is creating it. The writer transforms the world with her words but she is also transformed by the words that she uses. In this way one can view reading and writing as ongoing metamorphoses.No other book in existence so proudly announces what it is not: real. No other book calls attention to the fact that it is merely literature--a figment of a writers fancy-- in such a graceful way. And yet few books have the imaginative power to so transform the readers who encounter it as this one."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Written in 1928, this book clearly sought to shock the reading public. For every repression delivered by Victorian authorities which surely hampered Woolf's freedoms, this book delivers a defiant rebuke to the same.Orlando - it states in the beginning - is a man for whom \\"there can be no doubt of his sex.\\" He is rich, handsome and lives a life even Hugh Hefner may be jealous of. But, scandals lead him to isolation, to public ridicule or upbraiding, which led him to sequester himself to his 200-bedroom hermitage-castle. In his hermit's existence, he does not pass time philandering, but instead pulls books off the library's shelves and romanticizes with fiction.Eventually tedium compels Orlando to ask his friendly king to deliver him overseas where he can perform the duties of ambassador. He ends up in then Constantinople, now Istanbul, Turkey. While living there, he ends one exhaustingly long night of debauchery and partying with a seven day sleep - and awakes a woman.This was a \\"good thing.\\" As a man, he could not appreciate Tennyson, Shakespeare, Byron and the like. As a woman, their written word touched her greatly. She could be red eyed, she could be lachrymose. As a man, he never loved. Wollf says, \\". . . love - as the male novelists define it . . . has nothing whatever to do with kindness, fidelity, generosity or poetry. . .\\" Orlando the man had no love? Maybe, with Sasha (a Russian seductress) - but maybe Sasha ruined him so that he could never love again.As a woman, Orlando knows love. Wolff explains, \\"Love is slipping off one's petticoat and - \\"Can you imagine the Victorians reading that?!Orlando's life continues not for decades, but centuries. And, some other characters do as well. \\"The true length of a person's life . . . is always a matter of dispute. Indeed, it is a difficult business - this time-keeping thing. . . \\" Indeed, it was for Wolff who quite intentionally delivers this novel as a time-challenged writer.More obscurities arise - androgynous lovers, angels' visits, children born from or for Orlando - and splendor with these very biologically-defying events.This is not written in the weaving masterful language which Woolf delivers in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" or \\"Mrs.Dalloway.\\" Instead, here the schizophrenia lies with the main character, not the writing style. Probably, a better story than \\"Lighthouse\\" or \\"Dalloway\\", but I am partial to the writing style of those masterpieces.In any event, anyone wondering just how throttled Woolf felt in the stifling moral norms of her country, read this book.

Okay, so it takes a certain sense of humor to really enjoy it, but if a satire on writing throughout the ages sounds like fun to you, you'll probably enjoy it.

I learned about all that stuff while researching for a 15 page paper on the book. Getting a little to much Orlando due to that paper made me lower my rating from five to four stars. It is fun and liberating. Oh, warning: it has a very odd ending. I'm not sure I'll ever understand it. I read it before I finished the book and thought, oh, It will probably make sense after I've read everything in between. Nope. But it was definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"After that light title for the review, allow me to stress that *Orlando* is one of my favorite, favorite books. I've probably read it 20 times. I'm always astonished again by how much character and life and plot and gorgeous prose that Woolf packed into so few pages.SUMMARY: Orlando, the title character, begins life as a lad in Elizabethan England in 1588 and ends the book as a woman thirty-six years older in 1928.Much has been made of the fact that Orlando changes gender and ages magically slowly during the 340 years that the book covers. The effects of the gender switch play beautifully against society and society's changes. Orlando the character is probably based on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lesbian lover who cross-dressed, and the gender switch is seen to embody both the masculine and feminine aspects of her. Modernism, the art movement that best characterizes Woolf, is concerned with society and the person's role in it. Woolf managed to play both sides by introducing a character who was both male and female.All this is true, but I believe that there is another layer to the book beyond mere gender role exploration and modernist games. Orlando is a book about being a reader, about a life spent as a reader. When one reads great literature, one experiences what it is like to be both a man and a woman, to live the span of many lifetimes, to have experiences as varied as traveling to Istanbul by ship and giving birth to a child and hacking at the head of a Moor swinging from the ceiling and being the lover of a queen and being in love with a man. Of course, a writer is a reader moved to emulation, and Orlando is a writer. After centuries of composition (and that's what it feels like sometimes!), *The Oak Tree,* Orlando's epic poem, is finally accepted for publication.Most of the time, when I read a great book, I understand the mind and the soul of the writer better when I'm done. Reading a book about being a reader may seem a tautology, but in this case, I feel like Virginia Woolf understood *me,* and my life as a reader, almost eighty years after the publication of *Orlando.*TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This novel stabs at society's defining roles of the sexes in a way that is humorous, yet thought provoking as Woolf entertains her readers in this biography of herself. The author begins with her birth in the sixteenth century, and ends in the twentieth century. She starts as a young man and ends up a woman at the end of the novel, she most definitely makes appoint of showing how women have been oppressed throughout the centuries which is not something no one knows, but a good reminder. Throughout the novel, Orlando rarely changes in appearance with an eerie androgynous look as she/he sees monarch's come and go, and changes along with every forthcoming style.

Nothing is any longer one thing! I take up a handbag and I think of an old bumboat woman frozen in the ice&quot; (305).Orlando examines how experience creates meaning. It is a discussion of intertextuality where metaphors are created diachronically. Meaning is created, however imperfectly, by the piling up of associations with a particular image. The book illustrates both the creation of imperfect meaning, but also the undeniably human desire to communicate those ideas.By repeating images, Orlando supposes, we give them meaning. The oak tree, for example, evolves meaning through time. At the beginning it's just an image: a boy alone on a hilltop contemplating the way that the roots feel. Then Orlando removes it from reality by making it into a poem. He adds things in the margin, reworking, elevating the image until it is not a boy under a tree at all. He takes the real and compounds it until it becomes abstract. When Orlando finally lays down under the tree at the end, having &quot;given birth&quot; to the manuscript, the action has a completely new meaning. It is attached forever to Turkey and gypsies and the whole life that preceded it. It transcends image and object to become allegorical. When Woolf describes it she is not merely describing an image, she is attempting to communicate a life.By layering the image in the text, adding meaning on top of meaning, the number of interpretations grows exponentially. The novel would submit that this is the way of language and life. Like metaphors, people are not just as they are at the moment but are also everything and everyone that has preceded. They are the past: the trees that they have sat under and the words that they have spoken. The whole of a person can never be communicated, only approximated in images and metaphors. And yet it's &quot;a curious fact that though human's... have such imperfect means of communication, that they can only say \`good to eat' when they mean \`beautiful'... they endure ridicule and misunderstanding [rather] than keep any experience to themselves&quot; (144).ORLANDO is, definitively, Good to Eat"},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This book proves that Virginia Woolf could write what she damned well pleased - she had a family publishing house that published all her work (is that the same as self-published these days?) and a literary salon that the who's-who of literature at the time frequented. An enviable position to be in and not have to risk the inevitable rejection letter from a publisher who wanted more of the same that sold. At one point she even celebrates the unpublished or self-published writer by saying \\"while fame impedes and constricts, obscurity lets the mind take its way unimpeded.\\"That said, Orlando is, in my mind, Woolf herself, taking a bold romp through history, spanning the centuries from Elizabethan to Edwardian times, free of the limitations of thinking in a particular sex, yet being bound by the conventions of his/her times depending on when Orlando was either a man or a woman - all the while letting us experience life in those particular times through the lenses of Orlando's thougths and through his/her biographer's descriptions and ruminations. Woolf's descriptioons of changing landscapes (London going from a clump of derelict buildings and muddy streets in Elizabethan England to a modern metropolis during the Restoration), political systems, customs (wearing a ring and being married became prominent during Victorian times), food ( crumpets and muffins were invented in the 19th century), women's sizes (\\"slim was in\\" in Edwardian London),speech (evasive conversation was espoused in Victorian England) are told in rich flowing prose that does not stint in its use of dashes and semicolons.Time transitions take place during sleep, while thinking or while on a long voyage at sea, where our hero(ine)remains unaged (albeit, at times sex changed) as the world changes around her.The pompous biographer that Woolf chooses as her device for rendering the story is also a free spirit, free to comment, jump from place to place, ruminate and sidebar - all needed in order to deliver a story of this vast time sweep.I wouldn't read this novel for entertainment, but rather as a study of what experimental fiction must have been in Woolf's day.My one regret is that with all this going for her ( no rejection slips, write whatever she wanted) our dear Virginia had to load herself up with stones and drown herself in a river. Oh, if she would only know the travails of the writer, let alone the experimental one, of today!

Based on Orlando's identity, the society she lives in expects specific behaviors from her in the areas of business, society, and love, \\"that each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life.\\" Her search for meaning amidst those expectations is what ends up being Orlando's pursuit for meaning in life.Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"This \`roman &agrave; cl&eacute;s' is very original.

A wild ride through four centuries, the novel shows Orlando aging, magically, only thirty-six years between 1588 and 1928. Even more magically, he also changes from a man to a woman. As she explores Orlando's life, Woolf also explores the differing roles of men and women in society during various periods, ultimately concluding that one's role as a man or woman is determined by society, rather than by birth.From the Elizabethan period, during which Orlando works as a steward for the queen and also serves as her lover, he progresses to the reign of James I, experiencing a profound love for a Russian princess, Sasha, who is herself exploring the role of a man. When the relationship ends, he retreats, devastated, to his estate, with its 365 rooms and 52 staircases, which he redecorates over the next few years. An interlude in which he is wooed by the Archduchess Harriet/Archduke Harry leads to his ambassadorship to Constantinople, a period spent with the gypsies, and his eventual return to England--as a woman. New experiences and observations await her there.Throughout the novel, Woolf matches her prose style to the literary style of the period in which Orlando lives, creating always-changing moods and sheer delight for the reader. Some constants continue throughout the four centuries of Orlando's life. Orlando is always a writer, always recording his thoughts, and always adding to a poem he has begun as a child entitled \\"The Oak Tree.\\" He is always returning to his 365-room house whenever he needs to recuperate from his experiences, and some characters repeat through time. (Orlando is betrayed by Nick Greene during the reign of James I, but he is encouraged by Nicholas Greene in the Victorian period.)Literary historians make much of the fact that Woolf modeled Orlando on Vita Sackville-West, Woolf's lover, and that this study of gender roles was an early exploration of lesbianism, bisexuality, cross-dressing, and transgender identities. The novel is pure fun to read, however, and though it raises serious and thoughtful questions about sexuality and the ways that it controls our lives, there is no sense that Woolf wrote the novel specifically to make a public statement or prove a point. Her themes of gender and its relation to social expectations, of imagination and its relation to reality, of the importance of history in our lives, and of the unlimited potential of all humans, regardless of their sex, transcend the specific circumstances under which Woolf may have written the book.

Orlando is a love story, a wonderful mess-up of gender and all the questions about love that gender provokes, and an ode to creativity.The story begins with Orlando as a romantic youth, lacking in wisdom, but not in appreciation of beauty and lust for life. His vibrancy catches the eye of the elderly Queen Elizabeth, who then, falls in love with his beauty and graces him with a court appointment and takes it upon herself to protect him from the usual pains that would befall someone of his status. [It is at this point, in the movie (with Tilda Swinton), that Queen Elizabeth (Quentin Crisp) cryptically tells him, \\"Do not fade. Do not wither. Do not grow old.\\" I did not find this quote in the book, but the sentiment is the same. There is a special immortal something about Orlando that others recognize and he is doomed and blessed to tumble through the ages in one guise or another.]Orlando falls from the queen's grace when she spies him with one of the many girls he courts. Three years after the queen's disapproval, Orlando finds himself madly in love with a Russian princess, who will not marry him. He falls asleep heartbroken, only to awake 50 years later in a different role, as an aristocratic poet. And so go Orlando's series of romances and heartbreaks. After several failed romances and the seeming death of his beloved poetry, Orlando reawakens as a woman, without skipping a beat. We then follow him/her through subsequent decades and see Orlando grow in wisdom and knowledge of love. One could say that perhaps his womanly incarnation is what Fate has thrown at him in order for him to understand what it is to be on the other side of the mirror. Yet in either form he is admired.It's an odd story and plotwise, difficult to track, which is perhaps besides the point. Certainly full of humor. The only contemporary author to whom I can compare it is Jeannette Winterson and her novel The Passion--she has a similar interest in characters and love, and an equal disregard for rules of space, time, and gender roles. Winterson may be our modern day Woolf.If you haven't read Orlando, and you are unsure, try the movie first. It is what prompted me to read the book. The production is gorgeous and Tilda Swinton is perfect as Orlando. And when you decide to read the book, there's plenty to be discovered that the movie can't touch on--for instance the writing nuances and styles.

The background to the rich and handsome Orlando seemed promising, his adventures interesting, but then weirdness grew and became overpowering.

What I really didn't like about ORLANDO is that there is a sub-text, closed to those of us of this day and age, who are not privy to the intimate doings of the Bloomsbury set, who did not sit together with V. Woolf and listen to her read her latest chapters, chuckling knowingly as they recognized the models for the various characters. I felt excluded. And why would I read a novel from which I was excluded ? Well, the answer, dear reader, is that I wouldn't. And I don't recommend that you do either.People tell me that Woolf's other novels are much better and of a different type. So, I am not condemning the writer, only the book. And, OK, maybe you will like it. But don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Virginia Woolf caught a break in the publishing world, which is comparable to a 365-bedroom estate. But like Orlando, Woolf needed more than that. As a member of the working class, I found myself thinking 'nice that you have so much time to pontificate on life'. Is Orlando one of the rich and bored? One who dishes out but can't take it?Take Sasha for instance. He calls her faithless when he's bedded every wench in town and is engaged to marry someone else when he meets her. Hard to sympathize with the guy. It's only a tragedy when he's the one hurting. Throughout Orlando's lives, he/she strikes me as a spoiled rich kid who wants to be useful and good but can't help being a punk sometimes. Very true to real life.Woolf takes the reader through history fantastically; every scent and sense is unique to the years. Her observation on clothes being related to the person within is great. And even though people put a homosexual spin on the subject, I felt it was more about what a person is capable of and why a 'man' or 'woman' label is slapped on certain traits and abilities. If a woman is mechanically inclined, does she have to give up being feminine? If a man has a fashion sense, must he forfeit his masculinity?In the end, I found myself wondering how Orlando would have turned out if he/she weren't so rich. Maybe it's my working-class distaste for pampered complainers that made we want to smack Orlando. But as a non-traditional woman, I also heard my thoughts echoed in Orlando's, especially when she 'yielded to the spirit of the age' and got married. That entire description of the pressure to marry was brilliant because it comes from without and within.All in all, there are perks and drawbacks to being male or female. But Orlando shows we're not the only one who finds our talents stretch beyond what is considered a man's job or a woman's. Did Orlando have to become a woman to know love? Did his maleness make him a better ambassador? Nowadays we say 'of course not'. But Orlando personifies those questions, makes the reader aware of the chains of tradition. And just like Orlando's ancestry, are they anchors or dead weight? Or both?"},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"\\"He -- for there could be no doubt of his sex, though the fashion of the time did something to disguise it...\\"Late-Elizabeth fashions were so flamboyant that you couldn't sometimes tell who was male and who was female. And that time frame sets the perfect tone for this witty and strange gender-bender. Orlando was sixteen at the time, and his boyish good looks made him quite popular at Queen Elizabeth's court. But his poetic sensibilities cannot handle heartbreak very well. A deceitful Russian princess has left quite an impression on him, and he broods over the fickleness and faithlessness in women. So time goes by, Elizabeth is followed by King James, and as generations pass Orlando becomes not only a nobleman of high rank, but he's also courtier, then an ambassador -- until he leaves it all behind when he becomes a woman. The new gender brings confusion. All of the things Orlando once took for granted -- his freedom, his power, his lands and rank -- are all jeopardized. But at the same time, she -- for now it is she -- discovers other pleasures and joys, and sometimes boredom, in the eighteenth century parties with celebrated noblemen and writers, and in Victorian times, when she experiences her first night with a man. After many centuries, it is in 1928, when this immortal being realizes that she is essentially the same person she has always been.It is impossible to summarize this novel. Written in the form of a biography, Orlando covers quite a number of themes and discussions, and you'd have to read the book in order to appreciate it. You'll have to read it not only once, but several times. I think I will have to reread this in the near future in order to completely get it. This is a unique gender-bender, with feminist undertones, and a voice full of satire and magic realism for great measure. There are some wonderful passages here, full of humor. Take this one, for example:\\"All of her estates are put in Chancery and her titles pronounced in abeyance while the suits were under litigation. Thus it was in a highly ambiguous condition, uncertain whether she was alive or dead, man or woman, Duke or nonentity, that she posted down to her country seat, where, pending the legal judgment, she had the Law's condition to reside in a state of incognito or incognita as the case might turn out to be.\\"The \\"incognito or incognita\\" is what made me laugh. Virginia Woolf was a great writer. I had once read To the Lighthouse and was indifferent about it. However, Orlando has compelled me to read other books by Woolf. Her wit, combined with the passage of time and historical references, made this an absolute delight to read. The one thing I do find confusing is the passage of time. For example, Orlando opens her window and stares out into the courtyard and beyond in the year 1712. After a series of descriptions and whatnot, the chapter ends with, \\"The Eighteenth century was over; the Nineteenth century had begun.\\" And that is more or less how it occurs every time. In one sentence, it is still Victorian times, then it's Edwardian the next. Also, the whole gender change is too complicated to describe. As said earlier, you will have to read and reread the book in order to understand it. Some people don't get this book at all and hate it; others might enjoy Woolf's take on society norms and love it. I'm the latter. Orlando is a must-read if you're into some rather thought provoking and somewhat complicated literature."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"Orlando is a gender-bending-twisting-conflating biography in which the eponymous hero begins as an Elizabethan nobleman and ends, over 300 years later, as a liberated woman.There are many reasons to read a classic work of fiction, but to be totally honest, doing so is not always a purely enjoyable experience. Sometimes it is more like work, worth the effort, but not easy or even totally pleasurable.This book is simply a gas: a high speed, surrealistic excursion through four centuries of the role of women and men in English society, and Woolf's writing is in turn caustic, brilliant, lyrical, funny, transcendent and astonishing.If you are going to read one great work of 20th century literature, this should be on your short list."},{"Title":"Orlando: A biography (A Signet classic)","review":"I thought Orlando's trip through the ages was wonderful and exciting.

Alexandra Ortolja-Baird has created a wonderful compilation of cat photos and simple sayings. The photos are of those definitely cat-like moves or posses that anyone who has ever owned a cat has seen his/her own bundle of fur do. The quotes, some from famous authors such as Mark Twain or James Herriot, that go with each picture provide a laugh or reminds one of when they saw a cat do what the words were talking about.This is a great book for a coffee table or even better as a gift for the cat-lover on your list. It is small enough in size so that it makes the perfect shelf decoration and anyone looking through your bookcase will notice it right away. The cover photo - a cat snuggled in a blue boa - makes me think of the warm and cuddly times I have had with my own cats.This is a book I will look at again and again and one I will buy to give to the cat-lovers I know the next time I need a gift for them.

This book was definitely one of the worst ones, if not the worst. The examples in the book were OK, but there is nothing new or above and beyond the Princeton Review or Kaplan books (both of which were much better than this book). Also, the CD did NOT work at all. When I called the helpline, I was always given some bogus excuse as to why nobody could help me. The CD would get to question 2 and cause a computer error. It was extremely irritating. My irritation was compounded by the fact that the person answering the phone at the supposed support line was totally unable to help me whenever I called. I was able to get a high score, but through using the Kaplan book and taking practive exams on paper.

Frederick Talbott has captured the essence of one of history's greatest speakers simply by letting him speak for himself. Winston Churchill's words, spoken in the most trying of times, can give a person a great deal of courage and motivation to cope with today's daily battles.Talbott gives a brief background with each quotation to put the words into context. And that is enough. The beauty and power of Churchill's words and character come through without any additional analysis or insight. And that is the beauty of this book.A must for any Churchill fan or anyone whose daily battles sometimes seem too harsh to bear."},{"Title":"Churchill on Courage: Timeless Wisdom for Preserving","review":"Great book for great quotes.

The book was published in 1902, so the style is similar to most books from that time period - kind of like the Anne of Green Gables books. The story pulls you in at first because there's there's some sort of mystery brought in right at the beginning. The main character, Ruth (a career girl who works at a newspaper office), is house-sitting for her aunt in a small village by the sea somewhere on the East Coast in America. The mystery is that her aunt insists she must light an oil lamp every night and leave it in the attic of the window facing the sea. During the story Ruth is trying to figure out why she must do this, and find if it is connected to an old beautiful woman who lives nearby and a story behind some newspaper clippings in the attic and some notes she's found. During all this she meets a young man who happens to work in the same place she does who is on sick leave, and they become friends. (You can guess where that goes.) The story is all right, but not so spectacular. I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't a huge mystery behind the oil lamp - you figure it out soon enough. The most interesting part of the story is Ruth and her friend Carl and their hard time admitting they like each other. It's kind of a dramatic and sappy ending, but that's the type of stories that were popular back then, so it isn't too hard to swallow. Over all, I rate the book average."},{"Title":"Lavender and Old Lace","review":"I bought this book a while back, and never got around to reading it.

With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Pickle Things was one of her picks.Our daughter likes anything funny, and this book certainly fit the bill. It is designed as a short, simple poem that looks at various imaginary ways that pickles can be used (decorations on a Christmas tree, as an ear, as a nose, as hair, as toes, as objects to juggle, to come out of a water spout, as desserts, breakfast food, sweet snacks, as kites, etc.).Each potential application moves off in a new direction to stretch your child's imagination.Since the poem is short and triggered by the illustrations (of big green pickles), it is easy for the child to memorize it, and begin to &quot;read&quot; to you.The illustrations are clear, colorful and capture wonderful expressions on children's faces.A great thing to do with this book is to take another fruit or vegetable and create your own book (poem, illustrations, and all). I remember having the most fun with eggplants!We all start with lots of imagination, and generally lose that imagination to complacency.

Grey is a disatrous exception. His writing style is that of a detached yet mock-interested outsider displying equal touches of naivet&eacute; and arrogance. Naivet&eacute; and arrogance works remarkably well in the wirtings of, say, Carl Hiassen, but Grey's ramblings read more like that of a pretentious high-school student.The similarities with high school do not end there. Like most high schhol term papers, Grey strives for too much and ends up with too little. The chapters show little, if any, cohesion and one must wonder who had bribed the proof-readers prior to their assignment on this book. When Grey does explore some interesting themes he is either a)uninformed (i.e. too lazy to do the research needed), b)too anxious to get on with the next boundary-breaking &quot;insight&quot; or c)both, as is most often the case.The real horror-story (or comic relief depending on your frame of mind) of Grey's work is his &quot;field-work&quot;, i.e. 7 hastily conducted interviews with less-interesting people where one in every four questions concern the &quot;fascinating&quot; breast-implant phenomenon of Hollywood. In between these 7 interviews, presented for some daft reason in original transcript form as if to say 'Look, I Really did do these interviews', Grey tacks on various stories of encounters with friends of stars or has-beens in and around Hollywood that one does best in avoiding.Like a high-school student, Grey will mature in time, get a better perspective of things, develop his writing skills, find more interesting stories to write about and get some psychotherapy for all that 'anger'. Unless, of course, having this rubbish published gives him a big ego, in which case we'll have to brace ourselves for more incoherent ramblings from this 16-year old stuck in a grown man's body."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"While few filmgoers today would dispute the idea that Hollywood cranks out dozens of pieces of garbage for every one truly good film that is produced, Ian Grey's SEX, STUPIDITY, AND GREED: INSIDE THE AMERICAN MOVIE INDUSTRY is not, as its title and cover promises, a daring examination of Hollywood that \\"splits the carcass of the American movie industry from gizzard to groin.\\" Employing a sometimes vulgar invective--one that he would surely cite as socially or culturally subpar were it to show up as part of the dialogue in some recent film--Grey frequently pits recently produced films against those from the pre-MPAA era as a way of illustrating how the Hollywood movie has \\"devolved\\" over the past four decades. Reading between these lines, the astute reader can't help but conclude that it is not the American movie industry per se that Grey hates so much, but what angers him instead is the fact that recent movies--with all their newfangled technical FX and new methods for storytelling--have usurped the beloved films of his youth in the projectors at the local cinema, an attitude that makes this read more like a reactionary rant than an expos&eacute;.If one can forgive Grey for using the book as a soapbox for his personal rant, it is still difficult to surmount the other obstacles within these pages. One of the most glaring problems with Grey's arguments is his constant use of AD VERECUNDIAM logical fallacies. At least two major chapters in SEX, STUPIDITY, AND GREED: INSIDE THE AMERICAN MOVIE INDUSTRY are built around interviews with \\"authorities\\" that have little expertise in the American film industry, one centering on a publisher of soft-core porn magazines and the other a psychiatrist who apparently treats patients with self-image issues. Another irritating aspect of the book is its overall style. Rather than reading like a formal book-length expos&eacute; from an industry insider--which is what the jacket declares the book to be--the writing style is more akin to that of an amateur internet blog, with the same sort of abrupt shifts in thought and subtopic that one often sees when reading online diaries and such. And there is an apparent lack of professional editing, too, as one comes across numerous grammatical and punctuation errors throughout the text (again, the same sort of errors one commonly finds when reading entries on an amateur web site).Also, the frequent comparisons of certain recently produced films against specific films from the pre-MPAA as a means of \\"exposing\\" the deterioration of quality and morality in Hollywood make it seem as if Grey is unaware of--or perhaps purposely ignoring--the history of filmmaking in America. With everything from the racism and blatant historical inaccuracies of D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) to Roman Polanski's dalliance with an underage girl in the 1970s, the pre-MPAA movie industry in the United States certainly had its share of controversy regarding the morality and aesthetic quality of the films it produced and the people who produced them. Grey's arguments that such problems are something new to the industry simply fall flat in the face of history.SEX, STUPIDITY, AND GREED: INSIDE THE AMERICAN MOVIE INDUSTRY is not without its merits. The chapter discussing the establishment of the MPAA in the late 1960s and the frequently inconsistent application of its rating system is very eye-opening, and Grey's interview with the sometimes reviled actress Sean Young is also an interesting read. Yet despite these way-too-infrequent good points, Grey's purported expos&eacute; of the deterioration of aesthetics and quality in the Hollywood movie-making juggernaut is actually little more than the reactionary ranting of a man who is miffed because \\"they\\" don't make movies like \\"they\\" used to, and being such, it will be of little interest to anyone hoping to get a genuine look at the inner workings of the current American movie industry."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"Ian Grey has all the right ingredients for a first rate litary drive-by. He has perfected the self-righteous swagger of a master polemicist and he's got the staccato sarcasm down pat. He's glib and witty, and has just enough of the been-there-in-the-trenches (and see who I've rubbed shoulders with) authenticity (he's a failed rock star AND a failed screenwriter) to play the oucast insider the genre demands.Unfortunately, he forgot to have a point worth making or anything resembling a solution to the problems he cites.So what we get are series of thematically linked essays concerned centrally with the artistic death of the American movie brought on by corporatization, the MPAA, the \\"200 vice presidents,\\" Ronald Reagan and a host of other carboard boogeymen, held together with a handful of interviews with the fairly famous (Wes Craven), the nearly famous (Ulli Lommel) and the famous-only-to-the-self-appointed-cognoscenti demograpic (Julia Strain).The essays are, in general, interesting, if ultimately devoid of any real insight (what, the blockbuster syndrome hasn't been great for the prospects of art films? who'd have thunk it?). They're most entertaining when Grey sticks to innuendo and insult or to matter-of-fact portrayals of some of the more absurd effects of blocbuster bloat (Waterworld's budget, for instance). When he wanders into more 'serious' theoretical speculation, he reads like a high school student turned loose with publishing deal and no ability to critically analyze his own sources (he approvingly cites [at considerable length] a Peter Biskind essay from \\"Seeing Through Movies,\\" without acknowledging that the piece in question is not only an antiquated exercise in academic Freudian maundering, but also includes the almost inconceivably retarded implication that George Lucas is in some sense responsible for the Reagan Presidency). Other times, Grey is undone by his own naked prejudice: he snidely attacks \\"Last Action Hero\\" on several occasions, but reserves voluminous praise for \\"Scream\\" - essentially the same film but with different subjects.The interviews, on the other hand, are simply terrible. In addition to mostly being made with peripheral figures of neither artistic nor commercial importance, they're filled with leading questions and Grey's own self-important ejaculations (not to mention his irritating habit of inserting his subjective reading of body language, voice tone etc. into the text of the interviews). Worse, many of his interview subjects share Grey's abominably self-congratulatory posture - at one point, Wes Craven compares \\"Scream\\" to Shakespeare without the slightest trace of irony (or any objection from fanboy Grey). Ulli Lomman is almost as bad. He seems to believe he is bringing the spirit of Fassbinder to the unwashed Americans (because, as we all know, \\"Bogeyman\\" is just a work of sheer, avant-garde brilliance).But what is most off-putting is the smarmy, masturbatory self-promoting glee with which Grey imbues the whole book. In the end, \\"Sex, Stupidity and Greed\\" isn't about exposing the failings of Hollywood or proposing a solution (which Grey implies lies with hipsterish, z-grade, ironically so-bad-it's-good horror schlock), it's about showing the world what an insightful, in touch, all-around awsome guy Ian Grey thinks himself to be."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"This is the kind of book that needed to be written. But sadly, it did not need to be written by Ian Grey. He's illogical and apparently blinded by self-righteousness.This book is really a collection of essays and interviews on similar subjects, and it's not just because of the lack of cohesion that they contradict each other. In one chapter he writes about the scandalously huge budgets movies get today, but the very next section is an interview with a Hollywood insider who reveals that movies' budgets are actually exaggerated by studios, and they aren't really too much. So what was the point of the first chapter? Grey could at least have written &quot;Oh, I was mistaken,&quot; but he just moves on. Later there's a chapter on how actors and especially actresses must get surgery to look young and attractive so they can remain employed. That chapter is truthfully grim, but it's followed up by an interview with actress Julie Strain, and Grey almost seems to praise her for &quot;remodelling&quot; her body. (&quot;Remodeled&quot; sure sounds better than &quot;They slit her open and shoved in implants,&quot; the kind of language he uses in the other chapter.)Grey seems to think that Strain can do no wrong since she makes low-budget movies, which most would probably call B-Movies. Well, there really isn't an impartial &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; when it comes to movies, but Grey assumes that anything without a big budget is better than any blockbuster hit and really, anything from a big studio. The truth is that low-budget does not equal objectively good. Grey cannot grasp this concept, and he sticks with it throughout the book.As I wrote before, this book needed to be written. The evils of Hollywood should be revealed to the public, but it is impossible to read this book without loathing it. Grey wanted to get the message across, but he was defeated by his own contradictions, predjudice, and, ironically, stupidity."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"...is one sentence in an early chapter, talking about ballooning budgets. While he could make a good case about how we are spending our money as a society, he instead contradicts his own points, shows a lack of insight into the reality of the industry(ie things cost money), and a line about James Camerons upcoming disaster film costing almost 250 illion to make. In response to this he exclaimes, \\"this would have to be almost the highest grossing film of all time to earn its money back.\\" Perhaps before taking bold potshots at one of the most successful and consistant directors of all time, he should have waited to see how the movie would pan out first. This is typical of the book, which is angry, foolish, rambling, and now painfully out of date."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"I'm flabbergasted to learn that some readers actually enjoyed this pointless bit of piffle. Truly, there's no accounting for tastes. Here's the deal: this Ian Grey guy was briefly, peripherally involved in screenwriting. He's been in the same room with a few third-tier celebrities. He doesn't like think very highly of the movie business. Oddly, Grey seems to believe that this all adds up to some sort of sensational now-it-can-be-told muckraking extravaganza. It's a bit like a meter maid writing a tell-all account of the inner workings of the justice system. How these aimless drivelings ever found a publisher is a complete mystery. If you feel like rolling around in some real insider sleaze, read Charles Fleming's &quot;High Concept&quot;."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"This book really makes you sigh, in the end. It has been said for years that cinema is where art and commerce meet...and in the eighties art went home. Ian Grey basically explains how the little piggy that went home that is art--people with something to say--in American cinema, was told to go, and why it still is staying there.The anecdotes can be funny; the social commentary is often fascinating. The double standards and schizophrenic ideals concerning the standard for portraying violence in film is such a powerful social statement on our society that it is worth the price of admission by itself (irony thy name is horror movie ratings system: the message behind the standards do more harm to society than the films that fall beneath it). The only problem is what is easily detectable in Ian Grey's outlook or personality. Ian sounds a lot like the famous preachers obsessively pointificating on the wages of sin in front of the bordellos: you know, the ones who are on a first name basis with the madams and the most expensive of the employees! In other words, there are few times in the book that you don't get the impression that he is one gig or sold superficial action movie screenplay away from refuting virtually all of what he wrote here and living it up with the very people he is trashing. There is a thin line between simple insiders and true heretics; Ian seemingly wrote a book that, instead of having him hung in effigy by the elite and run out of town, will seemingly merely have him be heretofore excluded from only all of the very Hollywood parties he no longer wants to go to. Which means, well, the obvious: the real elite of elites in Hollywood are having as much fun with his book as he is.Just the same, whether the leit motif of sour grapes is or is not running through this symphonic critique of the devolution of the art form of American movies over the past two decades, you learn a lot about how the business is run--or how this Frankenstein runs itself. When I think of how difficult it must be to get a screenplay or acting career established in Hollywood, his book simultaneously deflates a lot of secret hopes, and reinspires a belief in the redemptive power of artistic integrity over fame. And then it makes you laugh with a new sense of hope; after all, if some of these characters in the business could actually become famous and successful, anyone could!"},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"How this book managed to slip past the publishing industry amazes me. This book reinforces the sanities that I find being pressed, everyday."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"Should be mandatory for film students and anyone else who wants an inside look at the Hollywood meat grinder."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"Ian Grey answers the question everybody asks themselves as they exit the multiplex: why do movies suck ? He also has ideas about what to do about it. And if you don't feel like doing anything... he'll make you laugh instead of grinding your teeth. Some of these interviews and essays are fabulous (Wes Craven, the life-affirming qualities of gore, yes... the Oscar night, Sean Young, Ulli Lommel...). Others are &quot;merely&quot; great, and the whole book is enlightening and immensely entertaining. It should be a must read for moviemakers, for moviegoers, and for all those who have stopped going because, well, indeed, movies suck."},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":".

It exposed the dark underbelly of the entertainment industry. My only problem with it was the author seemed to focus on Horror flicks more than other genres.

It also reveals things about 'the biz' that you could never know otherwise. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"In this book, Ian Grey explains how tripe blockbusters like &quot;Waterworld&quot; get made, and why there hasn't been a breath of fresh air in the entertainment industry in years.Ian knows many insiders and people whose ideas have been rebuffed by some 25-year-old suit who has no idea what originality is. He also advances theories on vanity projects and stars-turned-director/producer and why this is a bad thing. He pulls no punches in giving us the insider's view on today's rash of bad movies and movies with the same tired plots.Especially intriguing and interesting is Ian's interviews with the Hollywood B-movie set and several well-known horror movie wunderkinds.Ian writes very sharply, sarcastically, and with huge amounts of sardonic wit. He's not angry - he's aghast!Incidentally, Ian is also a terrific fiction writer. He has a horror story in &quot;Embraces: Dark Erotica&quot;, an anthology edited by Paula Guran. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Sex, Stupidity and Greed: Inside the American Movie Industry","review":"Ian Grey starts off &quot;Sex, Stupidity and Greed&quot; with a bang and quickly fades to a whimper. Instead of giving us the inside scoop on Hollywood, how it works, how it thinks, who's who in the zoo, he takes every opportunity to take a potshot at the Reagan-Bush years, parroting the liberal screed we've all heard ad nauseam,(and believed to be true until the advent of the nineties when suddenly the &quot;greed&quot; of the eighties became the &quot;wonderful economy&quot; of Bill Clinton).Pa-leeze. When we buy books about Hollywood, we want to read about Hollywood. If we want to hear what a rotten job Ronald Reagan did twenty years ago, we'll buy political books."},{"Title":"Home Sweet Home By Guidepost","review":"\\"Home Sweet Home\\"(Guideposts) is a wholesome book that would be nice on any coffee table or guest room night stand. It's filled with old-fashioned short stories and essays of home and hearth. Memories of childhood and holidays, poems begging to be read aloud. Recipes like grandma used to make(\\"Lemon Pudding Cake\\", among them), songs like \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" and \\"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet\\" with music and words, give a wonderfully nostalgic feeling. You may find yourself remembering something that brings back your own childhood memories.Short but sweet stories from Laura Ingalls Wilder, Louisa May Alcott, and Charles Dickens; selected poetry of William Blake, Robert Louis Stevenson,and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, are all among the many treats to be found as you turn the pages.There are also beautiful paintings pictured on almost every page. Serene settings that look like they go back to turn of the century times. Some have the artists signature, but some don't. I think the only thing that could have made this book even better, would have been to include information for the reader about these works of art and the artist.Fabulous gift for your holiday hosts or housewarming.

Yes, it is a kids' book; however, it can be enjoyed by teens and adults as well. The cover captures the excitement of Mars, but the real satisfaction is within the those covers. Images! Images Images! Bright, clear, crisp, thought-provoking! They describe the science, and they fire the imagination. The inside page offers a large, captivating illustration of one of the MARS Rovers. As one moves through the book, the reader can see a model of a Martian snowflake; Martian atmosphere; topography map of Mars; The Face on Mars; Mars Global Surveyor; Pathfinder; Mars history including ancient coins, maps, sketches, telescopes, pop conceptions like War of the Worlds and Flash Gordon;Mariners 6, 7, 9 missions; Viking mission, Mars' place in the Solar system and planetary facts; the ages of Mars; Phobos & Deimos, the Martian Moon; Sojourner Rover Mission; Martian Canyons; craters & volcanoes; Speculations on Martian Water--past and present; Martian Meteorites; Mars Rovers mission; Unsuccessful missions to Mars; Europe's Mars Express; Martian Mysteries; Future exploration; Colonization & terra-forming; Did You Know Facts section; Martian Timeline; How to Observe Mars; and an excellent glossary.I was most impressed with the Olympus Mons pictures in this book. They really do the Solar System's largest volcano photographic justice.I usually like DK products / books because they are always thorough, researched, and well made. Pictures are well-placed and well captioned; fonts are clear and easy to read. This book, to me, even exceeds their normal quality. A whole heap of information is stacked in such a small space. This is a must addition to any Red Planet fan's library. Truly, this is a primer for introducing Mars to others...young or otherwise."},{"Title":"DK Eyewitness Books: Mars","review":"Mars has fascinated the imagination and curiosity of Man Kind through history. It has acquired a special place in the hearts and minds and appeared in the literature, arts and religious manuscripts of many civilizations. The fascination with this planet is not over by far, from Science Fiction to Edge on Space Science this planet is at the top of the list. Being the next target for human landing and probably colonization (after the moon) I think this book is the seed for those young minds that need their scientific curiosity nurtured to be the future Astronomers and Astronauts and the leaders of the Space Exploration Saga.As with the previous review Titled \\"Fantastic Voyage to Mars!\\" I find this book quiet impressive to be able to capture the history and science of this planet within 70 pages with very impressive Pictures and Facts.A couple of notes, the book I have was published in 2004 so Pluto is still referred to as a planet, but the one fact that was confusing was on page 16 referring to the size of the Sun compared to Earth and Mars; to quote \\"The fiery Sun is the greatest body in the solar system, 110 times larger than Earth, 200 times larger than Mars\\". If we go by diameter, the sun is 109 times that of earth, but when it comes to size, Sun occupies about 10^3, or over 1,295,000 times the volume of the Earth. Finally there is mass, the Sun is about 332,776 times more massive than Earth. I believe this should be reedited in future revisions of the book."},{"Title":"DK Eyewitness Books: Mars","review":"The illustration and level of detail in the writing make this great for kids and adults!

Now that I've read it, wow, was he right! Lots of anthologies I've read will have one or two strong stories plus a lot of filler. This one was all winners. The anthology gets off to a great start with &quot;They Go Bump&quot; by David Barr Kirtley. In this story a squad of soldiers are sent on a mission to test alien equipment that renders them invisible. It's a marvelous study in paranoia as one soldier grows increasingly convinced that his invisible friends are one by one being replaced by aliens. Other highlights: &quot;Great Theme Prisons of the World,&quot; one of the freshest ideas I've seen in science fiction in years. In it, people can choose to alter their sentences by choosing their prisons. Choose to serve your time beachfront in the Bahamas and you triple your sentence. Serve your time in a dank medieval dungeun and cut your time in half. &quot;Who Lived in a Shoe&quot; is the funniest story in the book, a tale of a couple househunting on an alien planet. The alien real estate agent is increasingly bewildered by the human's reactions as he shows them houses made of goo, houses underwater, etc. The title story also deserves special mention. It's set in a future Atlantis where people are immortal and to pass the time they hunt each other for sport. It's the most atmospheric and sensual of the stories, but sometimes a little jokey. Many of the stories do remind me of my favorite stories from years ago, but not because they are based on the same ideas. These stories are just told well, with strong beginnings, middles, and satisfying conclusions. The craft of storytelling is alive and well in these pages."},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","review":"I must say that each one of these twelve science fiction stories is truly a winner. I can hardly pick which one I liked best, which is unusual for an anthology; most of the time, for me, only one or two short stories will stand out from the rest. Here, Card and the judges who picked these have collected the best of the best. In particular, I liked &quot;They Go Bump&quot;, a story about invisible soldiers (being invisible is not as much of an advantage as one would suppose) and &quot;22 Buttons&quot;--a futuristic tale about social mores and isolation. I read every one work in this book with total amazement at the writing skill. If you want to try your hand at writing science fiction, these wonderful examples can inspire (or discourage) you.My only complaint is that the book was not what I would consider a good value, even with the excellence of each of the works in this anthology. I expected more than twelve stories--twenty would be more like it. I hope future volumes of this series will be bigger books."},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","review":"Like many other people I bought this book just because of Orson Scott Card. Even though he didn't write much more than the forward and intro's to every story, I am really glad I got this. I think that anthologies exist to introduce readers to new writers, new ideas, and new ways of telling a story. I had gotten so sick of reading the same sci-fi stories over and over again that &quot;Empire&quot; was a welcome change. Of course I liked some stories more than others, but I thought that they were all well executed and all trying to bring out new ideas. I think that even non-sci-fi readers will like a lot of these, especially &quot;22 Buttons&quot; and &quot;Great Theme Prisions&quot;.I hope that this is just the first of many new anthologies and I look forward to hearing from many of these new authors again."},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","review":"This book is filled with ideas that have been blossoming in my head since I read it a month ago. Science fiction, at its best, exposes the vulnerability of human ego while at the same time offering possibilities beyond our present way of being or thinking. Most of the stories did this, each through a unique setting or emotional perspective. The title story is so dark and sexy it deserves a soundtrack, and proposes a form of human gaming that seems allegorical to the relentless pursuit of image that actually goes on in popular culture. Even if you don't usually read short stories (which I don't), do not miss this anthology. It flows, and the subtle layers of the worlds it describes will inspire curiosity, and maybe optimism, about the one in which we live."},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","review":"some of these stories were truly excellent. looking forward to their next book. maybe i will even submit to the fiction contest, and get in one of these myself."},{"Title":"Empire of Dreams and Miracles: The Phobos Science Fiction Anthology (v. 1)","review":"I ordered this online because of Card was involved ...

Instead, it is Luke Fitzwilliam, a retired colonial policeman who has returned to England and chances to converse on a train with a woman who reminds him of a favorite aunt. She informs him that she is reporting three murders to Scotland Yard and is hoping to prevent a fourth, that of a village doctor. Before she can do so, she is killed by a car, and a short time later the doctor she mentioned is killed. Fitzwilliam decides to investigate these five deaths.There is a large array of plausible suspects, but readers with their eyes open ought to be able to solve the mystery before Luke Fitzwilliam does. (This novel has 24 chapters, and my own correct solution was arrived at in the middle of Chapter 19.)I have rated this mystery four-stars (for a letter grade of \\"B+\\") and would have rated it higher if its concluding scenes had not depended so very heavily on a series of implausible and lucky coincidences.

Although Rosalind gives a decent high-level overview of how the business works, she provides less than adequate details on how to actually get started in this business. It appears that she's more concerned with selling other affiliate programs within her eBook, including her own telephone consulting services. I am technical. If you are non-technical, there is no way you will be able to get started by using this book. I picked 1 or 2 interesting reference points, but overall the book gets a thumbs-down. My advice - save your money."},{"Title":"The Super Affiliate Handbook: How I Made $436,797 in One Year Selling Other People's Stuff Online","review":"I got hooked into the \\"hype\\" of this \\"sales product\\" and feel that I got burned.

Perhaps that is a reflection of how the information has deteriorated in value as well.For the most part, the information provided by Ms Gardner is general in nature and does not provide specific strategies which would help anyone begin an Affiliate business. She uses the book to generate even more business for herself, sprinkling a generous number of her own affiliate links.In this sense her book is nothing more than an example of how to use an ebook to generate more income in the guise of a \\"guide\\". She also spends a lot of time talking herself up as a guru, which does nothing for the reader.Save yourself the money and just cruise the net. You will find all the info free."},{"Title":"The Super Affiliate Handbook: How I Made $436,797 in One Year Selling Other People's Stuff Online","review":"A got a hold of a copy of Rosalind Gardner's Super Affiliate Handbook. Notice, I said \\"got a hold of\\" because I definitely wouldn't buy this book. I wasn't really impressed with it at all. Because it's so long, 288 pages, I thought it would contain a ton of information.I was definitely wrong. In reality it's bloated with page after page of keyword Search results. From the looks of it she self published the book herself. No reputable publisher would put out that kind of garbage. I didn't really find what I was looking for at all with this book..When I buy a book to learn online marketing, I want something that's loaded with good, solid, and useful information. Especially for sixty nine dollars. Think about it, when was the last time you bought a hard back book for sixty nine dollars or more? What kind of information was in it? For me it was a graphic design book on Print and Production Finishes. Did it have all the information I was looking for? You're damn straight it did. Honestly, I wouldn't pay more than two dollars for the Super Affiliate Handbook.From the official website:\\"Start NOW and Say \\"GoodBye\\" to Your Boss and \\"HELLO!\\" to a Better Way of Life\\"Yeah Right! I Googled Super Affiliate Handbook and found an ad that says \\"You can start your own business with no experience\\". I won't dispute the fact that you can start your own business with no experience. Any body can open a business with no experience. The question is can you make any money with that business? If your counting on the Super Affiliate Handbook to show you the ropes. The answer is no.Rosalind adds affiliate links throughout her e-book with the class and style of a used car salesman. For me it's a big turn off. I'm like anybody else, I hate to be sold, but I love to shop. If I want something I'm going to go out and get it. But you won't see me buy a book to get to a link so can buy something from it. Nobody does that. She's depending on people to think \\"Hey Rosalind says I need this to make money. Oh look here's the link right here in the book. I'll go there now so I can make money.\\" I feel bad for the person that buys into this because the only person making money is Rosalind. When she sells the book she gets paid and when you use her links she gets paid again. That's a big turn off.There are little sections that waste your time like the \\"Can you handle the lifestyle\\". It goes into detail comparing the average persons workday to Rosalind's workday. I mean honestly, I think it's pretty safe to say that I'm pretty confident I can handle the \\"lifestyle\\" otherwise I wouldn't be looking for specific information about where to learn online marketing.The information is also little dated since you can't go to overture anymore to check out keywords. So that part of the text is a worthless. But oh look, she put in a link for a site I can buy keyword information from. No thanks Rosalind I think I'll just go to my Adwords account and use the free tools they offer.So would I suggest the Super Affiliate Handbook? Hell no, you should take that money and go to dinner and a movie. You'll get more from it.[...]"},{"Title":"The Super Affiliate Handbook: How I Made $436,797 in One Year Selling Other People's Stuff Online","review":"You're going to collapse!When you start reading this book, you won't be able to stop. And it's over 270 pages long! So unless you are a much faster reader than I am, you are going to fall over with exaustion before you can stop reading.Rosalind sells this book with the subtitle \\"How I made $436,797 in one year selling other people's stuff online\\" and I don't doubt it for a minute. The information she has included in this book is very detailed and there are so many ideas for how to get more traffic, better conversions, faster responses and so on that I just couldn't take it all in. I will be reading this book again after I've had some more time to try out the things I was able to take in.Peel back the cover and what do you see?There's a big focus on how to generate traffic to the products you are selling. After all, that's absolutely essential to selling anything. As a result, there is some duplicate content that you will find in other resources. For example, a lot of the content in Rosalind's book is also in John Reese's Traffic Secrets series which sells for about $1000 and I'll be reviewing soon, but the Super Affiliate Handbook is a whole lot cheaper and highly specific to affiliate programs. There is also some crossover into the AdWords world that Perry Marshall just plain Owns. But the focus is very strong on Affiliate Marketing and she does a good job of leaving the related topics like traffic generation and Pay Per Click advertising to the respective experts.Included in the guide are sections on \\"How to Research a Profitable Topic\\", \\"How to Find Merchants\\" , \\"How to Choose Products and Affiliate Programs\\" , \\"How to Plan and Build Websites That Sell\\" and some advice on writing good copy, providing quality content, maintaining credibility and staying organized in your business as it grows.In writing any review of a product or service, it's important to cover the up and down sides. But I'm honestly having a hard time coming up with anything negative to say about this handbook. She takes an honest approach to all of her marketing. Her business model revolves around adding value to the Internet in the form of real quality content, and not just cluttering it with junk. Overall she's a straight shooter with a very thorough guide on how to make a killing in affiliate marketing.Ok, I've scanned the book some more and come up with a few things to complain about -just for you.I'm really not that clueless.Initially, like most books, I skimmed over some big areas of this book. One of those areas was the \\"Setting Up Shop\\" chapter. She starts with \\"Basic Knowledge\\" and tells the us that we don't need HTML knowledge at the start and that it's good to learn Windows Macros like CTRL-C to make work faster. Then she says you need a computer and a Fast Internet Connection. Next we learn that we need a web browser. (This is getting too complicated for me. I should just get a refund for this book.)Ok, so she does give some nice links like where to get Firefox for those still stuck on IE and suggestions to use a router and where to get some good software like eudora and UltraEdit. But this chapter gives me the impression this book was written to be printed and sold to soccer moms at the school book sale. If you feel you already know how to use your computer and your Internet connection pretty well, I give you permission to skip this chapter too.Another thing I can say that's bad about this book is that most everything she recommends actually requires some significant work. Sure, there are some thing in there like using datafeeds from merchants to create your own website in less than an hour. But most of those things have lost a lot of effectiveness due exactly to how easy they are to do. Now everyone has a datafeed site. And it just sits there doing nothing because people would rather buy from the real store instead of your feed to it. The suggestions that she makes which actually return results will take some work.Stand back and watch the explosion. (Or hold the match with a big smile)This handbook was an important one for me to review early on. Affiliate Programs are the core of my marketing business, and a major force in Internet Marketing. And if you've been following the trends, one of the fastest growing segments of sales on the Internet have been in Information Products. In other words, people are buying more and more instantly deliverable information products online. They are beginning to trust eBooks and online courses. They are beginning to PREFER them over print because it's instant gratification. Even Amazon is running fast toward electronic delivery. And what's so great about this field is that the profits are very good. Electronic delivery has basically zero cost. And zero cost means low overhead.So, I'm not just going to leave this as a simple ho hum review. I'm going to TELL you that if you want to get into this area of marketing (and I think it's a darn good idea), you will save yourself a lot of wasted time, money and effort by getting this book as soon as you can. There might be some other books out there that will try to compete with this one, but they are going to have a tough time. Rosalind did an excellent job on this. I can't think of much that would improve on it. This is an example of something that will pay for itself many times over when you do what it says.People complain about the price. I agree, it's high. All \\"Get Rich Quick\\" guides worth anything are high priced. And yeah, you can find everything here for free on the net. But if your willing to spend some money buying an \\"expensive\\" book that will help you make a lot more money and feel that your time is more valuable than searching the net for the same information for free and having to sift and sort what actually works, then this book won't dissapoint.I don't get anything if you buy the book. The author doesn't even have a clue who I am. I just read it and loved it. Good LuckBuy it!

I can't help but wonder if I got a different edition than some of the other reviewers. Mine is not the eBook. It is the published book - October 2007 edition.It is so poorly written, I had difficultly staying focused on the content because I found myself constantly trying to make sense out of typos or sentences that just did not make sense i.e., words mixed up and/or left out of the sentence. It was very distracting and irritating considering the price I paid for the book.The lack of proofreading was so disturbing to me, that I actually sent an email with my concern that she/they/whoever should know how bad it was. I did receive a reply back and I was told that they \\"already knew\\" and hoped to make changes in the new edition. Well, I HAD the \\"newest edition\\" (just two months old when I purchased it) and that was the edition I was referring to!Many of the links do not work either. The author will direct you to reference a site, but the link won't work. Sometimes, if you do a search with the web site name, you can find it and it will indicate she left out a word or position in the URL. This got very frustrating to me. I realize sometimes links change, but this happened much too often. It was due to lack of quality of proofreading and testing prior to publishing.The margins are inconsistent and all over the place. It just makes for too many distractions. Bottom line is, time was not taken to produce a quality product and it shows.I'm sure one can still learn information from this book but you can also learn elsewhere for a lot less. And there is NO WAY you will be able to become an affiliate marketer from reading this book as there are too many details left out. So don't plan on this teaching you how to begin to become an affiliate marketer.

If you are new to affiliate marketing or new to the idea of making money online, this book is definitely for you. The author explains everything, from the concept of affiliate marketing to the hardware that you will need to set up your online business. The book is also great because it contains a lot of resources to help you get started, it contains a lot of links (Most of them are affiliate links, so the author earns money every time you click on them and buy something from her referral) to websites that you will need for your affiliate marketing business.

If you are not a bird lover, you will be after you read this book. And as an added bonus, this book not only helps you be a \\"bad\\" birdwatcher, but it can even teach you how to be better person- seriously. Read it and you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"Haven't read but a couple of pages of the book, but looks good. Book came in a very few days--great service."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"If you have a little trouble getting my title;you'll surely know what it means if you read this gem of a book.I have been an avid birder for close to 20 years.In that time I have compiled a list of nearly 600 species in North America,met and birded with hundreds of other birders,made numerous friends,travelled far and wide, as well as locally,joined several bird clubs,served on executives,read hundreds of 'bird books';and own around 1000 books dealing with every aspect of birdwatching.With all that;I am pleased to call myself a 'Bad Birdwatcher';even though I had never heard the term before.What makes this book so good is that it does an excellent job of telling what birding is all about,the many ways one can partake in it,and what attracts so many to it.In other words,if you want to see what birding really is or want to give a friend a book to find out for themselves,what this birding you do is all about;then you won't find a better book .The author is an experienced birder from Britain,and quite a bit of what he talks about is birding in Britain.Don't let that disuade you as he covers a lot of other countries and everything he says is applicable to any country as well as very good for a rank amateur to the most seasoned 'expert'.He also talks about something I don't believe I've ever seen covered.He explains the reason for this interest in birds and not other animals,insects,and other species.That's not to say that some people get interested in butterflies,mammals,etc.;but birdwatching outstrips them all.\\"Anyone who has ever gazed up at the sky or stared out of the window,knows something about birds.In this funny,inspiring eye-opening book Simon Barnes paints a riviting picture of how birdwatching has framed his life and can help all of us to a better understanding of our place on this planet.\\"A great addition to the numerous bird books,but one that is different and has something to offer for everyone;be they already a birder or just interested."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. Lovely, lovely lovely; charming and thoughtfully written. And I've been inspired to be a bad birdwatcher myself, purchasing a pair of \\"bins\\" and a local bird guidebook and going out to see what I could see. And I saw much, including my first-ever tiny indigo bunting! I may be hooked. I've already bought several copies of this book for friends. Wonderful."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"Having once worked as a professonal naturalist and now working as an editor in the outdoor publications field, I loved this book. It brought me back to the excitement of being outside and just enjoying nature. Obviously the book is about birds on the surface, but it is much more than that, a delightful, fun book about the joy of nature that I enjoyed reading. I love Barnes writing style -- it kept me going throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"A terrific, funny romp through the process of learning to effortlessly enjoy what is right in front of us anyway, by an author who is great company--you won't want the trip to end. A book to share and re-read when you are in a bad mood someday.One of my favorite reads recently."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"I am also a seasoned birder and have traveled extensively and seen many species of birds worldwide. Upon reading this I realized I have been a \\"Bad Birdwatcher\\" all of my life - I just did not know it!I did relate on many levels to what the author was trying to convey. But, while this book did have several inspiring moments, my biggest gripe is not in the content, but in the way the author sometimes relates that content.The first half (and some parts of the second half) of the book seem to be filled with many obvious (to me, anyways) observations about humans and wildlife, and also one analogy after another - which came off as if the author felt like he had to condescend to another level to explain his thoughts to the reader. Example: When explaining about first learning how to identify birds, he likens familiar birds vs. new birds to watching your hometown soccer team vs. another team. Getting up in the middle of the night to use the loo vs. doing the same thing at a friend's house. Picking up your mother from the train station vs. having someone else pick up your mother with only a picture in hand. Speaking English vs. learning a foreign language. OK, enough!!! We get it!!! The author does this type of comparison in several chapters, and it gets quite monotonous and annoying rather quickly.Still, you do get the idea that the author is very excited about sharing all of these birding bits with others (although part of me thinks the reason he drags on so with the analogies so much is to fatten up this otherwise short book), and there were some excellent laugh-out-loud moments. He also touches on migration, breeding, foraging techniques, habitats, evolution, and what we can do to prevent birds and other types of wildlife from becoming threatened or extinct (without becoming all \\"gloom and doom\\" - which I appreciated); these are all very important aspects of understanding birds and birders, not to mention the world in which we live.Overall, this person cared enough to want to share his stories of how he became interested in birds and wildlife, and that's it's not such a foreign and inaccessible thing to the rest of us. Once you get used to his poor over-use of analogy and the occasional condescending tone, you see that he does mean well and has a lot to say."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"This is a very charming book. The author uses simple idea to pull you up short. takes some very simple ideas and pulls you up short - the reason people wathc birds is that they are available (try looking for a wild mammal to watch ... now look for a bird. You get the point). As the book progresses it begins to reveal, almost as if by accident, the real reason for bird watching. The fascination of habits and diversity, certainly, but this also includes the joy of simply looking and the even greater joy of sharing it. A quietly inspiring book with a lot of laughs as well."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"Bird watching is one of the simplest, cheapest and entertaining pastimes an amateur natural history buff could enjoy; and nobody should be overwhelmed by the fact that there are 10,000 species of different birds to watch. Writers from Woody Allen to poet John Keats are liberally quoted in avid birdwatcher Simon Barnes' How to Be A (Bad) Birdwatcher, a guide which follows the author's bird-watching adventures around the world. Bird enthusiasts and armchair viewers alike will find much to appreciate in his lively observations."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"So I finally got around to reading How to be a (Bad) Birdwatcher, and I found this book to be an absolute treasure. Simon Barnes does an excellent job of capturing the joy and wonder associated with the simple act of just looking, being aware, of the birds that are just outside our windows.But as much as I appreciated this book, it wasn't written for me - I own a pair of binoculars, a field guide, and I can name just about any bird that I'm likely to see within the part of the country in which I live. No; this book would have been more appropriate for me a few years ago, when I set up my first bird feeder and began to watch, and before I could tell the difference between a nuthatch and a grosbeak.And in writing this book, Barnes is trying to attract people to a \\"revolutionary\\" way of thinking about nature: an intimate concern for the welfare of the environment. It's what E.O. Wilson refers to as \\"Biophilia.\\" Afterall, if there were more birdwatchers out there, environmentalism might have a higher political priority. Maybe. Or maybe just more people would enjoy something simple and wonderful."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"Anyone who has ever lifted their eyes to watch a hawk circle or a seagull soar will appreciate this book. It is a refreshing approach to bird watching: Just watch them and enjoy them. Too many birdwatchers suck the life out of what should be a serene and zen experience by chasing birds to add to their lists. Barnes makes the point that the birds are there for everyone, regardless of their level of expertise or knowledge of birds. Just get outside and start noticing. As Barnes points out it could change your life and your relationship with nature."},{"Title":"How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher","review":"I secretly suspect that people who like to watch birds are basically just nice people. Thats how the author comes across as a person. But what makes this a wonderful books is the really personal, up-close, warm writing. A must read, even if you have not considered watching birds."},{"Title":"CULINARY ARTS INSTITUTE ENCYCLOPEDIC COOKBOOK COOKING FOR AMERICAN HOMEMAKERS","review":"I have had this fascinating cookbook since I was 20 years old and I am now 65. The story about how I got it is practically unrepeatable so I won't publish it here. I was a young bride with some experience in cooking a few Polish dishes and a few American dishes. That was it. This book taught me what it is to cook with variety, texture, practical shortcuts, and expertise. I love to cook. I still refer to this book frequently for my old-time favorites, and often try recipes I've never made. I can say this honestly even though I now own dozens of cookbooks. (I'm now gluten-intolerant and have new recipes to learn.) I've been married three times and all my husbands were mad for my cooking.

I really devoured the book, practically frantic to see what would happen next. The characterization is well done, as is the plot line. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the ending. I felt the author failed to wrap it up in a satisfying way. I can't say more without giving away the ending. I'm not at all saying that the ending was disappointing; just that it could have all been tied up a little better with all the characters."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Yes, you may be surprised at the type of writing, and check to see if you have a Gilbert Morris book, but it's true. Even though it's different than his normal style of writing, I enjoyed it very much. The suspense kept me reading to find out how it would turn out. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Gilbert Morris leaves his usual writing style and genre in this book, and gives his readers a refreshing change. The plot idea was very clever, but was not unfolded as much as it might have been. The main character is a sufferer of amnesia, and though many of his reactions to re-discovering life are realistic, some are forced and stale. Details and discriptions are extremely true to life."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"Hey, this is my mom's account but this book is an excellent read! I got it for my book report book and it was so cool. Very discriptive! I was never the fighting type but this book makes so interesting.

Adam Smith becomes a real person when you read this book. You feel for him and want him to find the answers to all his questions. It is a book with twist and turns that keeps you guessing all the way. I read it, my mom read it, my brother read it and we all loved it."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"This is my first (and last) Gilbert Morris read. I never would have guessed that this author had so many previous publications, and I find the other reviews here totally incongruous with my perception.On the up side... The book had an okay story, and it was a fast read, primarily because of an unusually large type face. I almost rated this two stars because I could imagine worse, but I've given two stars to an item here and there that I thought were somewhat better.On the down side... No suspense; No medical information to justify the portrayal and basis of the amnesia of the story protagonist; Hugely stilted colloquial jargon. Most disappointing were the extremely heavy-handed Christian story elements and metaphors. Apparently the author is a former pastor and drawing from his expertise, but he did it with no grace and at the expense of every other requirement in a well-constructed and well-written story."},{"Title":"Through a Glass Darkly","review":"I could handle (barely) the first two-thirds of the book with him being a Don Juan but seriously, who does this character think he is? John Wayne or Clint Eastwood? What with all the fights he gets into - a barroom brawl and a street fight, to name a few. And wouldn't you know it, he even wins them all!By the time this narrative is almost through, he undergoes 3 identities. Does he really know who he is when the story is through? I couldn't wait to get to the end of this book - to finish it!"},{"Title":"A history of Russia (Evergreen encyclopedia)","review":"John Lawrence's book provides a solid basis of information concerning the origin of Russia and the formation of her various governments. Information pertaining to more recent political events is not included, as the last publication date is 1993. Lawrence's book is handy and concise. It gives an overall picture of Russian cultural and political maturation, starting with the Viking explorers. Lawrence's book does not get bogged down in detail. The biographical bits regarding Russian leaders are just enough to inspire interest without detracting too much from the flow of the book as a whole. He chronicles the difficult relationship between the church and various governments throughout the country's existence. He simplifies Russian policitics, while providing a picture of the Russian mindset. This is a great jumping-off point for someone who wants to gain a general timeline of Russian leaders and events. Build your knowledge of Russian history by beginning here."},{"Title":"A history of Russia (Evergreen encyclopedia)","review":"If this is the 7th Edition, the Author must be doing something right, or there simply aren't a whole lot of other books that present a broad historical chronicle of Russia. I suspect both are true.I recommend this book to history buffs and people like myself, Russian literature enthusiasts who want to put their favorite novels in an historical context. For this, the Author has done a wonderful job of tackling a huge timeline and doing so in language that is accessible and at turns even humorous.I'd recommend this book as a start, a primer....a jumping off point for more indepth study!"},{"Title":"A history of Russia (Evergreen encyclopedia)","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this is at best a starting point for further reading. Often the book reads like an interesting lecture by an old prof to whom one is giving the benefit of the doubt about knowing his subject, full of opinions that are staunchly held but often not defended with the facts that an author of lesser stature would feel the need to resort to for buttressing. One example of the big ellipses needed to cram 1000-plus years of history into 350 pages is that Catherine the Great is given approximately 2 paragraphs. Lawrence is more detailed on the later history of Russia, but throughout, his perspective is more religious than might necessarily be warranted in explaining events. He was president of the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism, so while you might expect from this author, for example, reference to changes that the Kerensky government made that affected the Orthodox church, it still seems a minor detail wedged in because of the author's personal field of interest. In short, for details and more balanced perspective, expect to need further study."},{"Title":"A history of Russia (Evergreen encyclopedia)","review":"I used this for a course in Russia history up to the 1800's.

Much better, much more informed."},{"Title":"A history of Russia (Evergreen encyclopedia)","review":"I won't take a long time here, but I didn't find the book to be very interesting or well written.

To my great surprise and delight, it turns out that this book is as much about the international politics of race and ideology as it was about pugilism. Thus this is not just a report on a one-round boxing match heard around the world, whose outcome in any case is well known by most even before reading the book: Louis beat Max Schmeling with such a vicious attack that it broke several ribs and had many observers thinking that Joe Louis Barrow must have been a man possessed by demons. No, it is not a story just about that one-man, two-minute demolition squad, but about the state of the world as seen through the eyes of a skilled biographer of sports history. And about his views of what the fight meant to two competing societies.The stage for this, the second of the two fights between two \\"intellectually challenged\\" protagonists, could not have been more pregnant with meaning or more heavily imbued with dramatic significance. At the time the world community was deep in the throes of an international depression, in which images of male impotence abounded. Boxing loomed large as a surrogate to fill the gap of male lost self-esteem and as a \\"stand-in\\" for national virility among men with bruised, diminished and weakened egos. Thus the gladiators in the ring of Madison Square Garden on the night of June 22, 1938, were part of the global pre-fight between German Nazism and American democracy. For the multitudes on both sides of the Atlantic with lost jobs, and lost self-esteem, boxing: male power, mano-y-mano, framed an essential aspect of the national identity.Nazi Germany and \\"democratic\\" America became engulfed in, and swept up by the emotional hysteria of the Max Schmeling-Joe Louis fight. To both nations it was not just a defining moment in history, but also a showcase of the defining qualities of their respective political systems: their ideologies, their ways of life, and the meaning of boxing to their respective societies. In short, the fight took on a distinctive life of it's own. It was a \\"hyper reality\\" in which both fighters had a lot to prove. Even as a winner, who was \\"on the down side of\\" a career that included having won the world Champion in 1930 while still being \\"counted out\\" on his back, Schmeling, as a winner of the first fight, still had as much to prove as Louis did as a loser: Schmeling had to prove that his win over Louis and his earlier Championship belt were not flukes. Louis had to prove that they were.As far as German domestic politics were concerned the stakes also could not have been higher. At the 1936 Munich Olympics, Jessie Owens, another Black American, had severed the proverbial racist limb Hitler had so boastfully but precariously \\"walked out on.\\" Owens had single-handedly embarrassed Hitler's claims of Aryan racial superiority by winning four gold medals. Lucky for Hitler, Schmeling, had that very same year, won the first fight against Louis, and had in part restored if not completely redeemed this Munich lost of face. By unexpectedly beating Louis in a 12-round knockout, the Owens insult and Aryan lost of face, had not only been redressed, but had made Schmeling the temporary reigning hero of Nazism.For the U.S domestic situation, the fight was a great deal more complex than it was for Germany. And my hat goes off to the author for making a heroic effort to finesse the many glaring challenges and contradictions the fight presented to an American nation only slightly less racist than Nazi Germany. Just like as was true for Jews in Germany, racism was the defining quality of a vicious caste system based on race for Blacks in America. It seems more than just a little ironic that Louis, a black male, was thrust onto the international stage to carry the mantle of male virility for a Nation that hated blacks with a passion. It was not unlike asking Frederick Douglass, a runaway slave to speak on behalf of the Fourth of July celebration at Rochester New York's Constitution Hall in 1852. Although Louis was probably the perfect vehicle for doing so, white Americans still remained ambivalence and very nervous about \\"having to root\\" for a Black male symbol of American virility and as the hero of their nation at a time that the male ego was so diminished. The specter of Jack Johnson and his wife wives and consorts running around the country like he was King of the world, kept agitating and haunting the collective American mind. Most white Americans, including Jews (who were a fixture in the boxing world as its managers, owners, agents, and trainers), were thus caught like a vise grip between their own white supremacist views, their visceral hatred of Negroes, and the anti-Semitism of Hitler.The author nevertheless proved his mettle and that he was up to the task of this rather profound challenge and the mental and literary jujitsu needed to carry such a narrative forward without injuring American sensitivities and sensibilities, or indeed doing further harm to the U.S. image of those (and these still) embarrassing times. With timely changes in voice, and in the names given Louis (depending on the context Louis was referred to in no less than 16 different ways, as: \\"our Joe,\\" the Black people's champion, the Black Champion, a credit to his race, the chocolate champion, an American hero, the Brown Bomber, a champion of democracy, the first African American Superman, African American folk hero, an anti-fascist hero, American Champion, an American icon, a symbol of African American political awakening, or the first African American hero seen as an American standard bearer, to he's no Jack Dempsey or Gene Tunney), Erenberg was largely able to avoid a head-on collision between American racism against Blacks and Hitler's racism against Jews.Altogether, the politics of race on both sides of the Atlantic made the fight such a complicated affair for the American mind to process, that the fight itself almost became anti-climatic. President Jimmy Carter in recalling this fight, recounts what happened in his hometown of Plains Georgia, where, while two Negroes were invited, as many as fifty showed up on his family's front porch to listen to the fight on radio. Once Louis had Ko'ed Schmeling in one round, the Negroes all quietly and respectfully returned to their homes on the other side of the tracks, whereupon all hell broke loose in a paroxysm of jubilation that did not stop until daylight.But as the author skillfully notes, as heavy and as palpable as the racial message was, and given that race in America trumped nationhood, the larger backdrop for this fight was international rather than domestic politics. On the global scene, these fighters were nothing if not proxies for their respective political systems, which at that very moment were making preparations for the Second World War. Thus in this larger sense, for one day, the boxing arena became a mere prelude to a multigenerational struggle between America's racist Democracy and Germany's racist Nazism. The question the fight begged for the American racial caste system was: How could \\"Hitler's racist Nazism\\" against Jews be wrong and \\"America's racist democracy against blacks be right?\\"Even though Hitler and Nazism have been gone for more than half a century, and America is on the verge of electing its first black President, that question still remains an open and an unanswered one for American society. This author nevertheless did his job well. What a worthy effort. Fifty stars"},{"Title":"The Greatest Fight of Our Generation: Louis vs. Schmeling","review":"Well researched and an interesting read, though it is a badly edited book -- typos abound. One question, though: Why was the fight in which Louis beat Schmeling \\"the greatest...of our generation,\\" despite having gone to form and pretty predictably, while their fight two years earlier, in which Schmeling produced one of the biggest upsets in sports history with an intelligence rare for boxing, was apparently less great?A key moment for American society, yes. Maybe also the most eagerly anticipated fight. But the GREATEST?"},{"Title":"The Greatest Fight of Our Generation: Louis vs. Schmeling","review":"Having been a fight fan since a small boy, I was looking forward to this book for the insight into the 2 most admired heavyweights of their age. But I got so much more.Erenberg succeeds in bringing to life the problems created by the segregation and dehumanisation of the African American in the 1930's, as well as the already well trodden theme of Aryan supremacy in Nazi Germany. Both these men, from humble beginnings, rose to fame quickly. They both became fierce rivals, and both quickly realised how they were being used as symbols of national pride. They met each other twice, and honours were even, but the most striking part of this book is how the author is able to bring to life how events on the world stage propelled them in such opposite directions, and also how life after the war sent them careering to the opposite end of the scale - Louis victorious yet penniless and dying in poverty, Schmeling the defeated yet living a life of privilege and great wealth. Although they were fierce rivals, they later became good friends, realising that they were in fact fighting for the same ideals, not what their respective governments were telling them.I recommend this book to anyone who is studying the noble art of pugilism, modern history or indeed civil rights. The research is meticulous, and the material is presented without overdue bias to either side, a considerable feat."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"This terse, fast-moving cold-war spy yarn has to do with a pair of counterspies careening around the world (the Sahara, Washington, Paris, Florida) trying to coopt a Russian engineer in order to get at a Russian installation capable of intercepting satellite intelligence transmissions. The main characters are a CIA operative, Major Mann, and the story's narrator, a nameless British agent. The plot twists are entertaining enough, but as in all of this author's better books, the real fun is in overhearing the conversations and the wry observations that reveal the characters and situations in which the coolly competent protagonists operate. Much of the pleasure in a Deighton novel lies in coming upon the author's clever turns of phrase -- as in a scene where our two agents are in the posh Florida home of a communist agent grilling the wife regarding her knowledge of his activities. She tries to maintain a facade of innocent southern gentility, but as her story is being picked apart item by item, she fiddles with her purse, which our narrator observes is \\"made from a couple of yards of the Bayeaux tapestry.\\""},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"A very nice book, probably not as good as his nine Bernard Samson novels, but still a nice read. It has the usual globetrotting spy aspects and is done in a way that only Len Deighton could pull off. If you are a fan of deightons this is sure to please."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"Although the novel doesn't come right and say it, this has all the markings of a \\"Harry Palmer\\" novel. A nameless British agent criss crosses the globe in an effort to aid a defecting Russian scientist. Nothing is as it seems and our protagonist must sort it all out."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"All spy stories entail - maybe require is a better word - betrayal to drive the narrative. While all of author Len Deighton's books are prime examples of that, it was this triad of books (Spy Story, Yesterday's Spy and this one) where the betrayals not only increased numerically but also moved to a more personalzied level. One might even say the reader is also subject to a form of betrayal - perhaps that is an extreme statement - becasue the ultimate solution to the narrative has nothing to do with what is presented at the start other than locale.The story begins with our unnamed agent - who, while close, but not exactly the same, to the ones in the preceding two books and is different from the one many call Harry Palmer (a name that was the invention of screenwriters not Deighton)- working to extract a Soviet defector from the desolate wastes of the western Saharan desert. The rescue is successive but comes with literal and figurative baggage in the form of the defector's wife and a curious reluctance on the part of said defector to \\"pay his bill\\" with the sought after information.In trying to solve this dilemma, our (anti)hero and his CIA superior travel a hazardous route along which wives and husbands and fathers and sons come to realize how little of what they see is actaully the way it appears. Politicians are moles and agents are double agents and by the end of the story several characters are compelled to face the reality about who their loved ones really are and for whom they have emotional and physical attachments.In an ironic twist, the novel finishes about where it started physically, but emotionally, the ending is miles and miles away. And, for the reader this was the last spy book from Deighton for about seven years. During the interim, he wrote of other things - some of it non-fiction and other books dealing with a form of alternate history - before returning to the spy genre in 1983 with the triple triad plus one saga of Bernard Samson."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"Thought this was the best of Deighton's spy novels. The plots of some of his novels, such as Billion Dollar Brain, was thin and, thus, the book was dull. In other novels, his prose was more like a dense thicket the reader had to plow through.But in this one, the plot is excellent and his prose - while not sparkling - is better than average. It's an excellent suspense novel with twists and turns, and none of them cheat the reader. The unnamed British agent remains interesting and full of quips and the other characters are very well drawn too. The plot is exceptional.As I said, the best of the Deighton's novels."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"Catch a Falling Spy (also published under the title Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Spy) is a well crafted spy thriller that incorporates elements of dark comedy with gritty action, suspense, and a noir atmosphere. The characters lack the depth of Bernard Sampson, the star of many of Deighton's later novels, but they are nonetheless convincing.British agent Harry Palmer teams with CIA agent Mickey Mann to help Bekuv, a Russian scientist, defect. Their mission leads them to a dangerous encounter in the Sahara Desert. Once they finally have him in a place of safety, Bekuv refuses to cooperate unless his beautiful young wife, Katerina, joins him. An assassination attempt and the emergence of a secret society of Ruyssian scientists contribute to the intrigue. Added to the ever growing list of characters who may or may not be traitors are a U.S. senator, the senator's aide, and Harry Dean, a washed up CIA operative who is found with an embarrassing amount of cash in his private stash. Is anyone to be trusted? Only by reading to the conclusion of this exciting story can the reader answer that question.Deighton mixes credible, fast-moving action scenes with psychological drama in a novel that takes the reader on a wild journey. While not as complex as Deighton's later work, Catch a Falling Spy offers an early example of this fine spy novelist's talent."},{"Title":"Catch a Falling Spy","review":"Nowhere near the quality of Game Set Match.

Dr.Brunell's sensitive presentation of O'Neill's own words beautifully reveal the vibrant personality who enchanted the world with her unique personality as well as her artistic gifts."},{"Title":"The Story of Rose O'Neill: An Autobiography","review":"While this book is not a great literary work, it is a wonderful resource for the Rose O'Neill enthusiast. I found it to be the most comprehensive record of Rose O'Neill's life I have read to date. In her own words, Rose describes her upbringing in an extremely unconventional household by a mother and father, both well-read and educated, with a mutual interest in the arts. Her father wanted to make an &quot;experiment&quot; of her regarding her education and along with reading classic literature, listening to Irish stories of fairies and little people, he always provided her with sharp pencils and plenty of paper on which to draw.Extensive information is provided on Rose's life including her first trip from New York to the family's new home at Bonniebrook, in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri, her marriages and her struggles to make the first Kewpie dolls.After reading this book it is easy to understand why Rose became the woman and artist that she was.

I feel stillbirth is a completely different situation."},{"Title":"Hope is Like the Sun: Finding Hope and Healing After Miscarriage, Stillbirth, or Infant Death","review":"There is no more poignant or painful loss to a parent than the loss of a child, whether it be by miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death. There are almost a million pregnancy miscarriages a year in the United States alone, and all too high record numbers of infant deaths. Hope Is Like The Sun: Finding Hope And Healing After Miscarriage, Stillbirth, Or Infant Death follows author Lisa Church and four of her close friends as they personally navigate the difficult passage through the grief of having a child die. The result is a unique volume offering similar couples a compendium of practical tips and emotional/spiritual encouragements that can only come from personal experience and an intimate expertise.

I wish I had this book 8 years ago."},{"Title":"Hope is Like the Sun: Finding Hope and Healing After Miscarriage, Stillbirth, or Infant Death","review":"In \\"Hope is Like the Sun\\", author Lisa Church reaches out to her readers as if she has known each and every one all of her life. Reading this book is like getting advice from a dear friend during a most trying and difficult time. And, not only does she relate with personal experiences but also details accounts of four of her closest friends who also have experienced losses themselves. The text is a support group in itself. The nicest thing about the book is it is written from a first hand perspective as opposed to a medical or scientific approach. Ms. Church does not try to explain things that often times can't be explained. She also goes to great lengths to validate the readers' feelings. And, as someone who has experienced the most devastating loss imaginable, it is a great comfort to know that someone else acknowledges my child as a person even though the rest of the world continues as if she never existed. Also, the feelings I have felt since the lost are foreign to most people I know. By reading \\"Hope is Like the Sun\\" and getting to see that the five women in the book all had similar feelings to my own, I felt that I wasn't isolated any longer and needed not make apologies for my sometimes erratic behavior that has resulted from the constant emotional rollercoaster I have faced since my loss. My appreciation to Lisa for her willingness to share her own personal grief voyage and reach out to others who have just begun their journeys with grief after the loss of a child is immeasurable."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I love this book completely. I found it in a used bookstore when I was thirteen (1993) and completely fell under its spell. It's an incredibly EPIC and rich tale, following Pedro de Vargas from the Spanish Inquisition at home to the New World, with lots of drama and swashbuckling in between. I must have read this yearly through early high school. However, it has probably sat on my shelf for the last 6 or 7 years, which is a tragedy. (Confession time: I am a NUT for historical epics, in both literature and film, I love the grandure, the sweeping scale, the broad vistas). Recently, I was gripped by a need to partake in something EPIC so I pulled this off the shelf and it's been such a delightful ride, again. I've been long enough removed from the story that, while it is familiar, I am still in suspense for all but the largest of plot twists. I'm so glad that this is being published again. This was written in the 40s and deserves a chance at a new audience.After re-reading this recently, I found that it is even BETTER than I remembered. The story is so rich and complex...warm fuzzies! I stayed up WAY TOO LATE last night trying to get past all the \\"tense\\" moments so I could get some sleep. UG! But then, there were only twenty pages left so I stopped because I didn't want it to be over just yet. It was very interesting seeing the 16th Century Spaniards' sentiments toward the Native Americans, and then Shellabarger (the author) as an \\"enlightened\\" 1930's male trying to justify/explain them. Yet, the author had NO ISSUE with his characters' treatment of women. While several of the female characters are much more than dish rags (yay!) the concept of beating a woman into obedience is treated as an acceptable solution. I had forgotten that part and how it had rankled me during my readings of this a dozen years ago. Still, it's a tiny 2 page blight on a 500 page great adventure."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"...you'll love this book! I have to agree with &quot;No from Seattle.&quot; This is one of my five all-time favorites as well. I first read it about 35 years ago when I was a kid, and have re-read it probably 5-6 times since (it's pretty intense and not a once-a-year read). Its compelling characters, graphic and historically accurate account of the Inquisition and the Conquest, heroes and villains, tough hombres and scoundrels, are no less real to me now than they were 35 years ago. Pedro de Vargas has been my archetypical hero since my first read, and few others have matched or exceeded him in my mind. Cortez was every bit as complex in reality as he is portrayed in the book, and the Conquistadores' audacity and greed in believing that a few hundred men could conquer a martial civilazation was realistically and breathtakingly portrayed. The period in Tenochtitlan is portrayed in a detail rarely seen anywhere else, including in histories I've been inspired to read as a result of this book. The account of the Sad Night was grim, desperate, and exciting. The author's descriptions of the Aztecs, a tough warrior race with a strange mixture of brutality and beauty, gave me a much better sense of the high culture present in North America when the Europeans arrived. And of course we can't forget the romantic storyline - enough to satisfy any romance addict. Be warned - the movie doesn't really do the book justice: it only covers about the first half of the story, with a contrived ending, and Tyrone Power was a little too old and a little too wooden to play Pedro de Vargas with conviction. But don't let that stop you from reading this book! It has to be one of the all-time great adventure stories."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"\\"On the evening of June 28th, 1518, young Pedro de Vargas, aged nineteen, confessed his sins of the month to Father Juan Mendez.\\"So begins Captain from Castile, a great adventure set in Renaissance era Spain. Pedro de Vargas is an eminently likable young man who gets by through quick thinking and a deft hand. The story is quick paced, taking the reader on a journey that leaps from imprisonment in the dungeons of the Inquisition, to the invasion and conquest of Mexico to intrigues in the court of Emperor Charles V. The treatment of the native populations may come across as dated but definitely true to the views of the 1500s. This is pure swashbuckling action written at a time when Tyrone Power and Errol Flynn ruled the box office. Swashbuckler fans won't be disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"This intriguing novel immediately propels the reader into the life of a young and courageous Spaniard who sacrifices everything he owns for a chance to find honor and treasure in the New World. Each adventure, from the escape from the Spanish Inquisition to the conquest of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City), seems so real that you feel as if you were there alongside the characters, fighting for a common cause. This novel offers a vivid and accurate depiction of the Conquest of Mexico, the atrocities of the Spanish Inquisition, and a comparison between the \\"pagan savages\\" of the New World and the supposedly superior and religious conquistadors. The excitement of battle is also intertwined with an enthralling, romantic story line.Although this book would be fantastic with only its compelling story line and breathtaking adventure, it is enriched by a profound and universal philosophy that questions and defines such concepts as love, friendship, racism, and religion. Captain from Castile is an inspiring and enthralling novel that I would equally recommend as an adventure, a romance, a historical and cultural depiction, or a deeper, almost philosophical piece. I found it a book that was hard to put down, yet so absorbing that when I reached the final page, I wished that the book was longer so that I might remain in the story a few moments longer."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I came to the novel \\"Captain\\" by something of a back door. Years ago I saw the screen version and loved it. As a matter of fact, I first read Prescott's history as a teenager and have been entranced with the Conquest ever since. In the last number of years I decided to write and, being a true aficionado of Mexican history, I explored the possibility of writing about the Conquest. Surely, I thought, there has been abundant English-language fiction written on this, one of the most phenomenal conquests in history. I was wrong. Except for Schellabarger, there seem to have been few novels written on the Conquest...from the Spanish point of view.Having decided to write on the Conquest and, recognizing that Schellabarger and I would necessarily be walking on the same ground and contending with the same people--and recognizing that my novel[s] must be entirely unique--I purchased his book and read it thoroughly and critically. I believe I succeeded and my novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\", are the result. Are my insights and is my writing as good as Schellabargers'? I obviously can't answer that question myself. It's up to the reader.My lead character, Rodrigo de la Pena, is a far darker character than Schellabarger's Pedro. Rodrigo is no \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" and his relationships with women and Hernan Cortes are more tortured and complex. This doesn't mean that I don't enjoy Schellabarger's tale. Quite the contrary, I love it and think it is one of the truly great novels.Ron Braithwaite author of Mexican Conquest novels, \\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\""},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"\\"The dream, not the realization; effort, not fruition; battle, not victory - these were life.\\" -Fray Bartolome Olmedo (CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE)The words of Father Olmedo fire the spirit of young Spanish nobleman Pedro de Vargas for glory, riches, fame, and honor in the New World in 1518.

From this exciting beginning of CAPTAIN FROM CASTILE we follow Pedro and his two closest friends Juan \\"Bull\\" Garcia (recently returned to Spain from the Indies with gold in his purse and adventure in his blood) and Catana Perez (a poor but beautiful dancer and servant girl at the Rosario Inn) as they leave the decadence and corruption of the Old World behind to explore the promise of the New World with Captain General Hernan Cortes and his small Company of Conquistadors. Along the way, from Cuba to the Yucatan Peninsula and then to the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, they discover a strange world that is both enchanting and frightening, beautiful and savage, and forge the bond of friendship that will be severely tested in the coming years and will carry them through many harrowing adventures and confrontations with Aztec warriors and Spanish evildoers alike. This is an extremely well-written novel rich in history and full of excitement. I highly recommend it.A few readers may be put off by the author's portrayal of the indigenous people of Mexico during the 1500s as being brutal and bloodthirsty. The Aztecs did practice human sacrifice by tearing the beating hearts out of their captors and then cannibalizing their corpses. One reviewer expressed a concern that Samuel Shellabarger condoned the thrashing of a wife by her husband. In the 16th century, women were considered to be chattel and fathers and husbands had the power of life and death over them. Mr. Shellabarger's novel brings to light the realities of the time."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"It's surprising this novel has gone out of print. It's an adventure book with love, war, and honor, everything that makes the genre great. It's also a very well-researched book set in the era of early Spanish exploration of the New World in the 16th century. Our hero is a young Spanish aristocrat, Pedro de Vargas. His family is falsely accused and imprisoned by the Inquisition. He is forced to flee the country, so he sails to Cuba, joins the ranks of General Cortez, and earns a reputation for valor and skill. Full of romance as well, the book is not necessarily of interest only to those who enjoy history or action stories. De Vargas navigates through interesting straits as he is forced to decide between marrying the young noblewoman he courted as a youth and a likable but disreputable girl who keeps cropping up in his adventurous life. I've read this book over and over. If it ever becomes available again, you're sure to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"This book is so good I rate it one of the 5 best I have ever read. It is pure adventure and will transport you to a time when a young Spaniard went to a new world, battled evil men from the Spanish inquisition, and fell in love with a beautiful senorita. Possibly the best adventure novel ever written. My other favorite books? All the Kings Men, The Hobbit, War and Peace (I haven't found #5 yet)."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I picked this book up for twelve cents (yes, twelve cents) at a used book sale, and it was by far the best twelve cents I have ever spent. I had previously read Shellabarger's Prince of Foxes while on a swashbuckler kick last summer, and so had reasonably high expectations for Captain from Castille. This book went well above and beyond my expectations. I find it hard to express just how good this book was. The reason I like the genre of swashbuckler books is that in them one finds the truest expression of the unbridled youthful imagination. From sword fights and pirates to code of honor and witty dialogue, this genre is the embodiment of the imagination of every young man. I have rarely, if ever, encountered a book which so stirs this sort of imagination as this book does. I think Shellabarger rises above even Dumas in this category. I am still amazed at the greatness of this book. How it is so unknown is beyond my means of explanation.Captain from Castille is the account of the adventures of Pedro de Vargas, a young Spanish nobleman from Castille. He encounters the corrpution of the Spanish Inquisition, flees to the newly discovered New World, and joins Cortez in his war against the Aztecs. I have never read such an accurate depiction the journey of an innocent boy into a worldly-wise man as Shellabarger has created in this book. The transition is so smooth and seamless that it is not until the end of the book that you suddenly realize how far he has developed. It is only then that you can look back and see how incidents slowly shaped Pedro's thinking. In respect to innocence, Shellabarger seems to me to be exactly half-way between the childlike innocence of Robert Louis Stevenson and the crafty/worldy Dumas. Stevenson's books were born of the imagination of a young man confined to his mind by illness. Dumas' were the product of real-world experience. Shellabarger has sucessfully combined the two, managing to retain the innocent imagination of Stevenson along with the real-world practicality of Dumas. Pedro himself makes the journey from the one to the other in this book, and in the end rejects the latter for a newly-understood version of the former.I really have little else to add that has not been said by previous reviewers. A few reviewers have been bothered by some of the chauvinistic remarks in the book, or by the justification of the conquest of the Aztecs. I think they have entirely misunderstood Shellabarger himself to be promoting these things. He was simply writing the book from the perspective of someone living in the 16th century. He actually spent a significant amount of time researching the people, places, and events he wrote about in this book (which is remarkably historically accurate), and what he wrote of those subjects in the book could easily have flowed from the quill of a 16th century writer. The fact that Pedro struggles with the morality of killing the natives, and in some cases tries to prevent it, shows that Shellabarger understood the problem, but purposely wrote it from the perspective of a Spanish man fighting the Aztecs. To those who decry the savage portrayal of the Aztecs as lying human-sacrificers: well, it's actually quite accurate. It is hardly fair to call Shellabarger culturally insensitive for accurately depicting the Aztecs.In short, if you like swashbucklers in the style of Dumas, Stevenson, Sabatini, etc., you need to find a copy of this book. For a long time The Three Musketeers has reigned (in my opinion) as the best swashbuckling book, and the Captain from Castille is its first significant challenger. If Shellabarger's other books are nearly as good as the Prince of Foxes and this book, he well deserves to be enshrined alongside Dumas in the lists of great authors.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I have loved this book since I was a teeny weeny little girl. I totally agree with everything that has been previously said about how good it is. It's accurate, it's a headlong read - you can hardly put it down once you get rolling. I had one of the original hardcovers (it was my aunt's), plus a falling-apart paperback which I just gotta replace. True, the movie does not do it justice although it is real, real good - I think this was Tyrone Power's role of a lifetime. The music is now considered a classic and the cinematography is utterly gorgeous (filmed in Mexico with all the mountains and flora and fauna, etc.). I told my daughter to bury me with a copy of this book... This is truly a movie they should absolutely re-make (and get it right) - anyway, more later!"},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I first read this book when in my teens, but missed the motion picture that was withdrawn almost as soon as it was issued. It strirred my interest in Spanish North American History which became my major in college. Recently, I re-read the book with its awful accuracy which, while its main characers are fictional, involves others who are not. It is a riviting account of the time if read purely for historic content. The scenes conjured by the writer are in no way more graphic than the truth which a history of the Inquisition can substantiate. Except for the ending I felt too conrtrived, as if seeking a way to bring his novel to an end, the book is well worth the reading. A fine introduction to the history it portrays that may lead to more investigation."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"Captain From Castile is my all time favorite book. I have read Samuel Shellabarger's other novels and enjoyed them also, but \\"Captain\\" remains my favorite. When my husband (without my knowledge)stored the box with my hardbond issue in a storage unit when we moved, where it ended up getting ruined I was very upset. I have had to be content with the paperback version. I recently thought I was going to be able to purchase a new issue version, but could not get it afterall. Hopefully, it will be re-published and perhaps the full book be made into a movie as the one previously did not deal completely or well with the true contents of the story. Its a marvelous read of a period of history full of details that are wonderful and sad and delightful to read and re-read. I have been doing so since 1964.V.

Since the very beginning we get to apprecaiate the effort that took the author to inmerse the reader into the character's profiles.

A classic story of intrigue, adventure, forbidden love, and historic events that shaped all of our destinies. The history is all there, and becomes riveting and real as you get into the story. More than once I racked my brain to remember if some element of the story had actually happened or not, and I even spent hours going back through my history books checking to make sure. The story is so fantastic, and so intriguing, that the historical elements could easily be dismissed as fiction! There is a reason that this book is universally acclaimed as a classic, is still in print after 50 years, and is considered a \\"go to\\" resource for teaching children about Spain, the Inquisition, the Conquistadors, etc. I highly recommend the book, and I feel certain that you will never regret having read it."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I was on a mission that lead me North in RC East Afghanistan.

Great Romance, super exciting story, and tons of interesting history.And I LOVE the ending."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"What a tremendous historical novel! This swashbuckler has everything, including romance, adventure, true history, a great protagonist/hero and some very slimy villains. I read this book after seeing the Tyrone Power film; although the movie was good, it was a pale shadow compared to the book. The movie stayed true to the spirit of the book, and was a fairly faithful adaptation of the first half of the novel, but probably because of time constraints very little of the last half of the book made it into the film.And what a last half it was! The historical background--Cortes's conquest of Mexico--is itself one of the most remarkable stories in human history. Cortes was a military genius on the order of Caesar and Napoleon, and it is surprising that he isn't typically mentioned in the same breath as those men. Shellabarger's task was to make his fictional story as interesting as the true history of the conquest, and he succeeds. The novel got me so interested in the history that I simultaneously read an abridged version of Prescott's \\"History of the Conquest of Mexico.\\" A few of Shellabarger's phrases and descriptions seem to be almost direct quotes from Prescott. Born in 1888 and raised by his grandparents, Shellabarger was not that far removed, in spirit, language or manners, from Prescott, who published \\"conquest\\" in 1843.Shellabarger had a real gift for writing both about romance and about political intrique and scheming, and there is a good deal of both in this novel. Sure, Shellabarger intended this primarily as entertainment, not as great literature. But as critic Jonathan Yardley points out in the introduction to the Bridge Works reprint, Shellabarger had style, and his writing was of a quality not typically encountered in today's popular fiction. If you have any appreciation for swashbuckling historical fiction, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"I'll be brief. If you're a fan of adventure, of swashbuckling, of novels like Dumas' \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" - this book is for you. It's a thrilling novel full of vivid descriptions and interesting characteres."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"First published in the mid-twentieth century, Samuel Shellabarger's Captain From Castile is an enduring adventure novel about Pedro de Vargas, a young Spanish nobleman who escapes to the New World when the Inquisition denounces his family. Pedro's exciting adventures (complete with swordfights, political intrigue, and romance), make Captain From Castile a merry and panoramic narrative worthy to take its place among the literary classics."},{"Title":"Captain From Castile","review":"This one had a lot of promise. Written by a fairly reputable author, still in print after fifty years, a best-seller in its time, and with the Cortez conquest of Mexico as its backdrop, it seemed like can't-miss historical fiction. Well, it isn't awful or anything, but there is much, much better out there.The story is about Pedro de Vargas, the scion of a Spanish nobleman. His family becomes ensnared by the Inquisition through machinations of the one-dimensionally evil Diego de Silva, and they must flee Spain. The father and mother make it to Italy, and Pedro goes to Cuba, where he meets up with and joins the Cortez expedition.This, of course, makes up the bulk of the novel and as far as it goes, it's pretty good. You really can't go wrong with subject matter such as this; my goodness, this has to be one of the most thrilling stories in history. And Shellabarger gets the details right: there's Cortez burning his ships, there's Montezuma as a Spanish captive, there's Alvarado massacring the natives, and there's the Spanish retreat on the night of tears.The problem is that there's nothing especially illuminating about any of this. The Cortez character is about what you'd imagine him to be, no more, no less. The same for Montezuma, the vacillating emperor. History shows that he was weak-minded. He's weak-minded in the novel. The Spanish soldiers lusted for gold and were devoutly Catholic; the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice and lived in the stone age. Just like we've all been taught.In the meantime our hero has a book-long love affair with a cabaret dancer and a book-long faithful friend who suffers his triumphs and tribulations along with him. The tension comes from de Silva who follows him all over the place to give Pedro and us something to worry about, and also the pretty but empty-headed noble girl he left behind in Spain and whom he feels guilty about not marrying.Again, this isn't a terrible read. But for adventure, Sabatini and G. M. Fraser are more entertaining; for fiction with this subject matter, Aztec, by Gary Jennings, is more imaginative; and for a strictly historical aspect, The History of the Conquest of Mexico, by Prescott, though a history, is frankly more exciting."},{"Title":"Travel Smart: Western Canada (Western Canada Travel-Smart, 1st ed)","review":"I like the various sample itineraries included in the books.

Languages usually come easily to me but Irish is another story; it is MUCH harder than any language I've ever encountered.This book has been a real help to me. I find that learning songs helps me with pronunciation and grammar - and it's always nice to learn about culture and tradition while studying a language! I didn't really like the way the author used \\"phonetic\\" spelling; for me, this was just confusing. (I actually find that transliterating the words into Russian letters is far more helpful!)

Before the author sings each song on the CD, she pronounces each Irish word clearly without singing it and then proceeds to sing it. I can actually sing Irish better than I can speak it!

They are, for the most part, common, ordinary people who live common, ordinary lives. They face trials and tribulations as well as joys and triumphs, however it is never so much what they face, but the manner in which they face it.MacDonald weaves an interesting tale of a young man, Richard, who is an heir to the aristocracy, yet throughout the majority of the narrative, as a result of extraordinary, yet quite believable, circumstances is aware neither of his heritage nor his future prospects. By the time he has gained this knowledge, the impact has been considerably lessened and redirected, for, he has, beforehand, gained the Kingdom of God. There is not much that the world can do, either good or bad, that can shake the faith, hence the peace, of a true child of God. The highs are never too high, nor are the lows ever too low; for in either case, to God belongs the glory.I invite you to join Richard and Barbara, as well as Richard's very interesting grandfather and a rather eccentric ensemble cast of supporting characters, as they begin their odyssey into the light.

They said that it was a partial review. Their statements made 2 things very obvious. The first is that they did not really know or understand or know what they were talking about with regard to the holding therapy. The second is that they have never dealt with a child that has significant attachment problems.This is an excellent book, and should be required reading for all divorce attorneys, all parents going through a divorce, and all judges who deal with divorce cases involving children.The book discusses what attachment is, and what can happen when attachment (bonding) to people does not occur. It helped my wife and I to understand what was happening with a foster daughter we had that we later adopted. We received her at 10 months old, and she had never been with a person long enough to bond. Picking her up was like picking up and cuddling a large board. The little girl did not want to be with anybody that she knew. She would reach out and ask any stranger to take her.This little girl's problems were severe enough that if she had been older, she would have been very likely to kill. It has taken years of work and patience to help her to develop a deep attachment with people.One of the problems that this book addresses and helps people to understand is the typical length of time that a child can be apart from their primary caretaker without significant attachment difficulties being likely to occur. This is very important for parents and judges to understand."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"After years of trying to deal with and straighten out my stepdaughter's ADHD, I discovered this book while searching for more written material on discipline techniques, and more books on ADHD.

After I was done with this book, I realized that although my stepdaughter did not have fascination with blood and gore, she fitted into all of the other catagories. She didn't physically hurt people, she mentally and emotionally hurt those who she had a beef with.

I have one suggestion: try borrowing an unattached child for a couple of weeks and see what you think then. Actually, try it for a few years. Then you'll REALLY know what it's like.

Our child had many of them and we felt better because we became empowered by this knowledge and were able to move ahead and try to help him and our situation. I recomend this book to anyone who can read. It should be a must for anyone contemplating becoming a parent. Please help these children by not creating them first.

No one knows where it started, but certainly it spread across the steppes of Russia, through India and Africa, and to Old Europe from whence it sailed to the New World bringing far worse than smallpox to the native peoples of America. It is here, with us, now, in the schoolyard bully and the child who murders, in the con man and the avaricious politician. It glimmers dully in the pale light of CAT scans and in the chemistry and structure of the brain. It is a failure to thrive, a loss of opportunity, a malnutrition of being. In their book, Dr. Magid and Carol McKelvey compile the data of destruction, the epidemic of our failure to our children. They note: &quot;Infants deprived of...important sensory stimulation during the first months of life suffer dramatically. Severe mental retardation is often the result: with lesser degrees of abuse leading to children (and then adults) who can neither give nor receive affection, who are cruel, who engage in self-destructive behaviors, who lie, steal, and who themselves may continue the cycle of depravation on their own children. The aut! hors state that, &quot;...prior to birth the fetus possesses a full complement of neurons and if these neurons are damaged there is virtually no regeneration...the goal during the later months of pregnancy and during infancy and early childhood is to get the neurons organized into patterns of responsiveness.&quot; Minimal brain damage may be caused by organic problems, or it &quot;...may occur in a child who has not experienced the (parenting) necessary to get a reasonably organized nervous system&quot;, leading to 'unattached children'. &quot;It is impossible to tell which unattached children will become serial killers, but we do know that some will become murderers. Others will become manipulators, thieves, con artists, wife-beaters and child abusers.&quot; This book includes life histories of both adult and child murderers, the causes and symptoms of failed development as well as the consequences of interrupted brain development and states: &quot;The killers are just the tip of a massive iceberg. The message this book has for you is that the chances for increasing numbers of psychopaths are escalating. We must search for answers to the pressing social problems that are helping to create unattached children.&quot; If you only have time and energy in your life to become knowledgable and involved in one public issue, there can be no more urgent one than this. &quot;High Risk&quot; not only explains the biological basis for the rise in violence among children in our country, but also sets out reasonable and viable methods for turning the trend around. This is an excellent read and one of the important books of our time."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"An excellent read for any parent, or anyone who works with children in any capacity. It is very clear and concise in the way it outlines what to look for in children who are at high rish for serious problemes down the road, whether they are mental problems, or behavioral problems leading to incarceration. I read parts of this book over repeatedly, as I work with children mental with problems and have also experienced these problems in my own family.

There is no medical proof that children with attachment issues will turn out to be the next Ted Bundy. In fact, Ted Bundy never had the diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy. The signs and symptoms listed in this book as indications of reactive attachment disorder more closely match the diagnostic criteria for conduct disorder.The authors create a false sense of urgency, to encourage parents to hurry off for controversial therapy, rather than take children to medical professionals who will take the time to make an appropriate diagnosis.Fear of unattached children is used to scare parents into seeking immediate attention.A better book to read would be It's Nobody's Fault: New Hope and Help for Difficult Children and Their Parents by Harold S.

It was too late for my daughter, but it started the long process for me of letting go of the guilt, the feeling of failure, lessening the sadness and grief, and finally in letting go of my daughter. That is not something I wanted, but she chose not to have a relationship once I cut the purse-strings, so letting go for me was letting go of the dreams of having a relationship with my daughter. Really, I learned through this book that I never really knew my daughter, but only the image I had of her.When my daughter was born; within moments she was \`looking' all over the delivery room, and I commented on \\"oh, look she's so smart she's already looking everywhere\\". But, they told me, \\"that's not normal, and you are going to have serious problems with this child\\". I thought they were wrong. A couple of nights later she developed severe colic and vomiting, and the colic stayed with her for about 8 months; she nor I never slept more than about 15 minutes at a stretch for months on end. I'm sure the pain really effected her ability to bond. But, there was something more than that, cause she just never ever wanted cuddled or held, or even read night-time stories to. Anything that meant connection she didn't want. She was this way her whole life. Whenever she would start making tentative steps to bond, she landed briefly in the hospital 3 times in her first year and a half; that would break what bonding had started, and then again she refused all human connection. She never did make a bond, and I didn't know about this stuff, so I finally just accepted that this was the way my child was. And, later blamed myself for all that was wrong with my child. She never was afraid of anything even as a toddler. And, even as young as 12 months old she had the wit and determination about her to fake sleep (without herself falling asleep) till I fell asleep; then she'd get up and destroy the room. At 2 she became a very hyperactive child. Then at 9 she started becoming violent to classmates and to me. Later she turned to alcohol, and after she left home she turned to drugs and a life of serious crime. Then prison for a year. I now understand she is an anti-social personality. She is long out of prison, and finally she created some stability in her life in her late thirties, but still has the same mindset.My daughter was almost ready to leave the nest when this book was written. I wish I had known more and maybe could have changed the course her life took. And, changed the pain that came out of it. But, all I can say is that this book helped start me on the journey of resolving the pain I was in. Perhaps it can help other mothers be spared that life of pain."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"I first read this book 18 years ago when I was expecting my child. Since then, I have recommmended this book to all my friends. Well written, insightful and hard to put down. Definitely a must read for anyone who wants to understand the importance of early childhood development and especially those persons who want to have children."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"This book is the largest compilation of studies ever done on the study of unattached children. Although it was published in 1980, still today it is the most in depth study to attachment disorders across the board. It may have outdated methods but critical readers know better than to not look beyond that. The theories about unattached children may not be answered but anyone working with children, or have any close relationships with children need to read this to understand why the attachment bond is so critical to a child's development, not only for the rest of the worlds sake but for the child's sake as well. All of my childhood development classes have had this book on the must read list for the last ten years."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"We adopted 3 children and one has an emotional detachment. The book has many interesting topics. My wife and I are both reading the book and are finding it helpful."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"Thanks to an endorsement by none other than Rep. Patricia \\"Pro-Family\\" Schroeder, this book is still in print and this ghastly \\"therapy\\" continues. Foster Cline popularized this practice in Colorado where it has gone by various names: Rage Reduction, Holding Therapy, Attachment Therapy, Holding-Nurturing Process, Compression Therapy, Prolonged Parent-Child Embrace, Nancy Thomas parenting, etc.There is one photo and one cartoon in this book that sum up the entire approach:The cartoon shows the range of attachment, from Mother Teresa as extremely attached, to a demon holding a bloody knife. Demonizing children who don't love their adopted parents is sick, especially when it is used to justify extreme measures.The book contains a photo of Foster Cline, MD, knuckling the sternum of a restrained boy. A child would endure this for hours on end.Therapists admitted once to a Colorado legislator that a bruised chest was normal for a child undergoing Rage Reduction. This was years after a boy escaped Cline's center in Evergreen with a bruised chest, and Cline was ordered to stop the practice after an investigation.This is a book that hopes to hook in parents who want to see children severely punished, i.e. tortured. It also gives parents a rationale for abandoning their adopted children."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"I TOTALLY agree with the statement regarding Holding Therapy. This type of therapy was widely used in the 1980-1990 era to *treat* RAD children. We now know that this therapy is extremely harmful, and even outlawed in some parts of the USA. If we can IGNORE this portion of practice that the book refers to, then we might be able to extract the importance of dealing with at-risk children in unconventional ways, for these children are anything BUT conventional children. At-risk children have NOT been socialized according to the standards of society. While they LOOK normal, somewhat FUNCTION normal, and many times ACT normal, many have deep psychosocial issues. Society LOVES to cast social labels onto children that have not bonded properly, as *troubled kids* or *deviant kids*. This book UNDERSCORES the reasons at-risk kids cannot function as society expects by presenting FACTS that have led to their dysfunctional existence, as proven through research. At-risk children often times have been neglected and abused by primary caregivers who have not received help themselves for their own issues, but go on to have children. Please, READ BETWEEN THE LINES. Other helpful sources for understanding the peril of at-risk children are: Harry Harlow (monkey studies on neglect) and John Bowlby (attachment studies). Both men are pioneers in the field of attachment and neglect.Sign me: Unlicensed Psychotherapist in Colorado working on licensure."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"This is a very partial review: I couldn't face reading all of this book, because I felt physically sick.I got to the descriptions of &quot;rage reduction therapy&quot;, and gave up in disgust and fury. This &quot;therapy&quot;, also known as &quot;holding therapy&quot; entails one or more adults pinning a child to the ground and provoking them (verbally or using physical prodding or poking) until they are screaming with rage or fear. Supposedly, this allows the child to release all their past traumas and magically and instantaneously bond to their parents (bonding evidently being a form of psychological super-glue which can be poured on in a matter of days or weeks without the necessity of building a relationship).If this didn't have a pseudo-therapeutic rationale behind it (the authors even mention proudly that it was devised for treating autistic children, having failed to notice that autism has been conclusively shown to be neurological in origin), we'd call it child abuse.In fact, it has been heavily criticized by many experts, including authorities on working with traumatized and attachment-disordered children such as Beverly James (editor of the &quot;Handbook for Treatment of Attachment-Trauma Problems in Children&quot;), who argue that it only traumatizes and abuses the child further.Parents shouldn't be pressured into inflicting controversial and harmful treatments on their children by claims such as those in this book that unless they do their children will become sociopathic criminals. The behavioral and emotional problems of abused and traumatized children are very real, and very dificult for both adoptive parents and society in general to cope with. But this isn't the answer."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"I had this book as a college text book. I took lots of sociology, criminal justice and psych classes, and this is a standout.it might seen sensationalistic to laymen and the general public, but it is one of the more memorable textbooks from all the above mentioned subjects I studied... I also reccoment Hunting Humans by Elliot Leyton."},{"Title":"High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.","review":"This book took over 250+ pages before it admitted that \\"not all \\"un-attached\\" children are without conscience.\\" And, I'm glad it finally did. Up until it reached the \\"prevention\\" section (the last one), it sounded like it was trying to usher you and your child into a psychiatrists office. This book was published 1989, before emotions became a popular subject in American psychology... though I did enjoy all the \\"worse case scenario\\" stories, it is not a good book for someone who has the wellfare of children at heart (unless you are willing to delve deeper in the subject)- I say this because, as the book also quoted \\"Put a kid on the wrong train and your likely to arrive at the wrong station.\\" (im ad libing here). I read this book simply because of the negative reviews it had. It is my belief that when you research a subject, you do so from all thought systems, not just the ones you agree with. Now, there were a few understandings I gained, and plenty of things I agreed with on the subject of bonding, and establishing trust... But that information could be sought from a different source, one that does not have such a horrifying underlying tone that makes you question a child's mental health (with such a bias in your mind, it is likely to taint your perception and as a result, distort your interactions with children)... It's a shame that the only group of people I see benefiting from reading this (unqualified caregivers/ abusive parents) would (most likely) never pick it up... There were a few passing statements that vaguely mentioned \\"temperment difference\\", though the book did nothing to elaborate on what those differences are, I would have found that to be particularly appropriate for the theme of this book... I'm giving it a a 2 star because, at times it was gnereally captivating and kept me interested, it did not maintain pace. And being a nonfiction book, it was not nearly as informative or thorough as I would have hoped. It did not provide any new information about what causes a \\"psychopath\\"- and throughout the entire book maintined the broadest, and most ridiculous symptoms to encompass as many children into it's diagnosis as possible. Of course, the purpose of this book was to focus on the enviornmental/nuturing factor of causing psychopathy... I'm not saying \\"don't read it, it's a complete waste of time\\" but... ... ... I gave it two stars :PEDIT: Here's food for thought, \\"The trick of the psychopath trade: Make us believe that evil comes from others\\"...

Nick LeBeck is the brother of Zack Muldoon from Falling for Rachel. They met back in Falling for Rachel, when Freddie was 13 and Nick was 19.Back then, Nick was trouble, but becoming part of the Stanislaski family straightened him out, and he's now a respected composer. In fact, he's been asked to write the songs for a new musical for Maddie O'Hurley (Dance to the Piper). Unfortunately, his usual lyricist can't work with him.Which is fortunate for Freddie, who offers her services, and after quite a bit of arguing, she convinces him to work with her.What Nick doesn't know is that writing lyrics is just the tip of the iceberg of Freddie's plans. She's been in love with him for years, and has decided that it's time to do something about it.Nick has trouble initially thinking of Freddie as someone other than a young girl, a sort-of-cousin. He's also troubled by his past, feeling that a former gang member is definitely not good enough for Freddie. And then there's the whole family looking over their shoulders. But Freddie's nothing if not determined.There were the expected appearances of other family members from the series, as well as the O'Hurleys from another of Nora's series, but in this case, it didn't seem remotely forced. Freddie and Nick were members of the same extended family, so it would have seemed odd if the family hadn't shown up. And the O'Hurleys were a nice bonus, but also logical.I always like the books where the hero and heroine have known each other a long time. Something about them knowing each other so well and falling in love with the whole person. Odd, because I was married within 6 months of meeting my husband, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Maybe it's the contrast with real life that appeals to me.Surprise, surprise, I don't have any complaints with this one. It's just a sweet, feel-good book that leaves me smiling:* I smiled when Freddie came to New York with her 3-fold plan.* I smiled through all their bickering about the songs.* I smiled at Nick's reaction to meeting Chantal O'Hurley (Skin Deep).* I smiled when Nick wanted to get her some brandy or a glass of water \\"for the shock\\" after the first time they made love (well, okay, I laughed).* I smiled when the family discussed Freddie & Nick's budding romance after the anniversary party.* I smiled when Spence gave Nick a hard time & said it was his duty as a father.etc., etc."},{"Title":"Waiting For Nick (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1088)","review":"Personally, I feel I am being tricked when I accidentally buy a &quot;new&quot; book and discover when I get home that it is a reprint.This is another reprint, yes?

New York is the natural place to go for more than one reason -- she has aspirations of writing lyrics for musicals, her extended family lives there, etc. But all the reasons just come down to one: Nick LeBeck lives there, and it's HIS music Freddie wants to write for. Nick, the stepbrother of Zack, who is married to Rachel, who is Natasha's sister (see the convoluted relationship?) was a troubled teen who has pulled his life out of its collision course with destruction and made a name for himself in the world of music composition. But he also has a chip on his shoulder about his background and his misspent youth, and when Freddie declares that she's loved him for years it throws him for a loop and makes him want to push her away.

What more can I say?The characters are believable and well rounded out. They are far from perfect and yet they are good people. They are the type of people you would like to meet on the street. I enjoyed this book. I particularly enjoyed it because I was able to revisit with some of my favorite characters from other novels (the Stanislaski Series). In earlier novels you read about young Freddie with her crush on Nick. Only now it's years later and Freddie is grown up and ready to show this to Nick as well. With much hesitation and worry Nick soon learns she's a grown up girl who is able to take care of herself.Excellent.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Waiting For Nick (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1088)","review":"This book was one of the most amazing trillagies I've ever incountered. In order to fully appreciate the book it self you have to start from the begining by reading The Stanlaski Sisters first (almost by birth order which means your reading four books at once), then you have to read The Stanlaski Brothers then Waiting for Nick and then Considering Kate . That way you can fully appreciate each character that is introduced to the reader and you are (in some sense ) already feel as though you are apart of this family because of the stories behind each character.I myself have waited for this book for almost a year and practically spent all day reading this book because I could not put it down (I couldn't have imagine a better way to spend on my day off).I actually would give it ten stars Absolutly a great read for the romantic at heart."},{"Title":"Waiting For Nick (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1088)","review":"Finally! The story of Freddie and Nick. For those of you who have read the previous stories of the Stanislaki family would be very familiar with Freddie's love interest in Nick since the first time she saw him in a family gathering. Now little Freedie had grown up and was in her twenties. She decided to move out (alone!) of her family home in West Virginia to somewhere nearer to Nick (actually, just a few blocks from Nick's place) so that she could begin her plan to make him fall for her. Yes! Little Freddie had a plan to make Nick fall for her!I don't want to let on so much on the plan or it will spoil the read for interested readers out there. Generally, this story revolves around familiar characters from the previous books but the family has made fewer appearances. It seems that Nick and Freddie has more things to argue about, causing their relationship to be more stormy than I prefer. That's why I give it only three stars.Anyway, it's still a good read for the Stanislaki fans!"},{"Title":"Waiting For Nick (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1088)","review":"In great Nora style, this book tyed up the stalanislaski's stories, with the tale of Zack, Rachel's husband's step brother, Nick, and Freddie, Tash's step daughter."},{"Title":"Waiting For Nick (Silhouette Special Edition, No 1088)","review":"&quot;Waiting For Nick&quot; was a good book.

Her aunt, Rachel Stanislaski, becomes involved with a rugged bar owner and his nephew, Nicholas LeBeck, who was trying to be a juvenile delinquent, until Rachel was assigned his case.Years later Freddie decides that Nick has had enough time to realize that she's not a child anymore. Nick has always thought of Freddie as a kid sister, but she's about to make that stop! They're extended family, and extended family isn't supposed to have these types of feelings for each other!WAITING FOR NICK is a fun filled romantic story that is still enjoyable even though it's predictable.

The author's genuine affection for Ireland and its fascinating culture permeates the book, and he includes snippets of history and myth that make the towns and islands he passes come to life.

In his characters, in his settings and plots, he captured the moods, the interests, the conflicts and concerns of small-town life in mid-America. Ogden Nash once compared him to Mark Twain. What the latter did for Hannibal, Missouri, Nash said, Rhymer did for Bloomington, Illinois and the entire Middle West.When the first collection of Rhymer's Vic and Sade radio plays was published a few years ago, it touched something in the memories of readers everywhere. Time found the plays \\"gentle, funny, low-key, and as timeless as the telephone poles on U.S. 20\\"; The New Yorker welcomed \\"a most rare thing\\"; and the Chicago Daily News, close to Vic and Sade Country, called it \\"a very lovely and lovable book.\\" This is the second volume of verbatim scripts for Vic and Sade the radio series for which Rhymer and the cast won national recognition.Paul Mills Rhymer (1905-1964) who grew up in Bloomington, Illinois and attended Illinois Wesleyan University, spent his adult years in Chicago as a freelance writer. In the 1930s Chicago was the proving ground for radio dramas, and Paul Rhymer was in the right place at the right time to assist at the birth of script radio, as it was called. He quickly developed and became the foremost practitioner of what can be termed \\"pure radio,\\" using one set (the small house), three voices (Vic, Sade, Rush - and later, Uncle Fletcher), and the imagination of his listeners to create a family, a neighborhood, a town, a world, and a time. Never was a community so magnificently peopled by verbal reference alone.The vitality, accuracy, and vibrancy of Rhymer's portraits make Vic and Sade, their life and times, universally appealing to fans old and new. To dip into Vic and Sade, is not merely to take a nostalgic trip to a bygone era - it is to recognize that the people and pastimes of small-town America are flourishing today. They may be transplanted to new places and adapted to new circumstances, but still they flourish. Paul Rhymer's Vic and Sade scripts rescue them from the glass case of nostalgia and put them right smack where they belong - in that small house half-way up in the next block. If you listen, you can hear them now...."},{"Title":"Beyond the Mountains of the Moon: The Lives of Four Africans","review":"I was interested in this book (obtained via interlibrary loan from UMBC) because we are planning soon to live among the people that are studied in it. These people -- the Babwisi -- live in what is now the Bundibugyo District of western Uganda near the border with what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the far side of the Rwenzori Mountains with respect to the reminder of Uganda. The title of the book refers to the legendary mountains which had been identified since Roman times with the source of the Nile; European explorers in the mid-19th century placed the Nile's source at least in part in this region of Uganda and the connection between the \\"Mountains of the Moon\\" and the Rwenzori Range was born.The book begins with a brief overview of the local culture, including marriage, family life, government, language, religion, economics, and history. This overview is a condensed -- and probably to many people more suitable -- version of the material in Winter's book \\"A Structural-Functional Analysis of a Patrilineal Society\\".The remainder of the book consists of life histories, told in the first person, of two men and two women who lived in the region in the mid-20th century. The histories consist of a series of anecdotes rather than a flowing narrative. The content of the histories is a fascinating look into the day-to-day life of people of that time, particularly as regards effects due to the arrival of significant Western influence. I visited the area recently, and it's clear that things have changed quite a bit since the book was written, but it's also clear that many traditional aspects -- polygamy, exchange of bridewealth, concern regarding \\"curses\\" to name a few -- remain largely unchanged. I hope reading this book will enable me to understand and contribute to their culture to a greater degree than would otherwise be possible."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"While Bronowski's book, Science and Human Values is often lauded as a critique of logical positivism, I found it to be much more than just that. Bronowski launches a critique on a more pervasive foundation of western philosophy, that of dualism. Bronowski seeks to reduce the dualistic view that somehow science and technology are antithetical to the human spirit. The book is constructed as an extended essay consisting of three distinct, though closely related arguments:a) The Creative Mind - an argument that the human mind operates creatively whether engaged in logical constructivist activities or in more subjective expressions of thought. In short, Bronowski argues here that the Poet and the Physicist have much more in common than we allow ourselves to believe.b) The Habit of Truth - an argument that both the right (creative) and left (analytic) sides of the brain are doing the same thing, seeking truth, in the generative process.c) The Sense of Human Dignity - an argument that the objective exploration of science and technology are just as \\"human\\" as the quest for introspective or subjective understanding of the human condition.Epilogue) The volume also contains an interesting fictional dialogue titled The Abacus and the Rose, held between a public servant, a scientist and a literary figure regarding the nature of their thought processes.Bronowski emphasizes the notion that the outcomes of science and technology are mere tools and artifacts, it is the spirit and creative energy behind them form the basis for human values and ideals. For Bronowski human values are what drive scientific discovery just as they drive public policy or artistic creativity. We get into trouble when we try and separate these ventures from human values, and thus confuse means and ends. In this way Bronowski offers a compelling argument that is less a critique of positivism than a call for a more holistic vision of human development and the creative spirit.The essay is well written and easy to follow and provides some solid insight on the ever more difficult task of linking scientific and technological progress with human value systems.\\"Whether our work is art or science or the daily work of society, it is only the form in which we explore our experience which is different; the need to explore remains the same.\\" (Bronowski, 1965, p. 72)"},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"This is a small but profound work. The three chapters\\" 'The Creative Mind''The Habit of Truth' ' The Sense of Human Dignity' taken together constitute an argument against modern positivistic philosophy and logical analysis regarding the absolute separation of 'is' from 'ought'. As Bronowski understands it the sense of values pervades and in a sense brings together the major realms of creative life. The special values of Science itself are for Bronowski 'independence and originality, dissent and freedom and tolerance; such are the first needs of science; and these are the values, which , of itself, it demands and forms.\\"Yet Bronowski also strongly emphasizes the evidence- based nature of Science in its search for Truth. And he speaks of the process of its development ,\\" the view that our concepts are built up from experience, and have constantly to be tested and corrected in experience.\\" Here is the great distinguishing feature of Science not only its quest for truth but in its power to transform the world.What Bronowski does in another sense is cut across the 'Two Cultures' divide posited by C.P. Snow. A person of both literary and scientific background himself he finds that ' the exploration of likenesses' through symbolic concepts define creativity both in literary and in scientific realms.Bronowski is in a very deep sense a humanist who defines and dignity of mankind in its search to understand and transform the world.There is much to be thought and said about this very important book."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"I became interested in this title by attending a talk that included the likes of Harvard's Steven Pinker, who mentioned it in his address to the audience. Now that I have read it, I am amazed I had never heard of this book. This should be required reading in science classrooms at the high school level (if not even earlier) the world over. Bronowski makes a stirring case for science, as he wrote this in the 1950s when human society was faced with the crossroads, whether to continue down the path of progress aided by science, or to maintain the old society as driven by the mechanics of religion. He comes down firmly on the side of science, and in few cases (perhaps only from Christopher Hitchens of late) has such an impassioned plea for that discipline been put to paper or oratory. Pages of this book are quotable, and given the very anti-science rhetoric being tossed around political circles in the United States lately, are poignant admonishments to defend science against the forces of ignorance that seek to unseat it and place subjectivity and superstition in its stead. The book is a good and short read, and is separated into three parts, the third of which closes Bronowski's advocacy with an impassioned crescendo. The entire text is worthwhile though, and the author references history and philosophy often as he gives his perspective in relation to science.This book should be on the shelf of every scientist and ardent skeptic. It's the kind of statement that needs to be heard much more often today, particularly when evolution is being attacked as conspiracy in the classroom, and children are falling treacherously behind in math and the sciences nationwide, stricken with disinterest in the type of hard work science requires."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"It is easy today to get depressed about mankind. Bronowski demonstrates that there is hope for us yet. He also demonstrates that we, perhaps know more and are capable of more than we thought."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"I can't say too much about this book. I purchased this as a gift. The receiver was pleased with the book, so I guess it was of value to them."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"This was required reading for me in a required Social Sciences survey course required for my B.Sc. in chemistry over forty years ago (I hold an earned Ph.D. in chemistry in additon to a later acquired law degree). I still regard it as one of the most influential books in my life. I understand the essays in this small book to be a critical examination of various scientific philosophies. However what I found to be most illuminating was Bronowski's study of values in a scientist's search for truth; how the values necessary to enable the search for scientific truth in the cooperative enterprise of science are human values ratified by the great religions of the world. What this meant to me as a callow (at that time) intellectual who was more of an agnostic than an atheist at that point in my life was that many of the value systems espoused and shared by the great religions were independently derivable by the values necessary to succeed in the quest for \\"truth.\\" This resonanted with me personally more than any thundering proselytizer in a church pulpit and my faith began to grow. This is a small book to have such a large effect and it is worth reading for many reasons - some well elaborated by other reviewers. I think Dr. Bronowski would be pleased with its effect on me."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"Bronowski's &quot;Science &amp; Human Values&quot; should be purchased with A.J. Ayer's &quot;Language, Truth &amp; Logic&quot; --the quintessential explanation of the &quot;verifibility criterion of meaning&quot;. Just as the Russell/Whitehead &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; sought to ground mathematics upon a foundation of pure logic, the &quot;verifibility criterion of meaning&quot; sought to provide an empirical basis for all scientific enquiry. However, the inescapable conclusion is that ethical imperatives (sentences containing the word &quot;ought&quot; or its equivalent) are non-sensical. However logical, this position may be untenable from a practical standpoint. Jacob Bronowski's crtique of the &quot;logical positivist&quot; position in his &quot;Science and Human Values&quot; pointed out an underlying social injunction implied in the positivist and analyst methods. That implied imperative is: &quot;we OUGHT to act in such a way that what IS true can be verified to be so&quot;. Ironically, Bronowski's critique may have saved logical positivism from its own inflexible consistency, placing its edifice not upon an unassailable axiom but rather upon an &quot;ought statement&quot; which will not admit of proof by the very method which is its logical offspring."},{"Title":"Science and human values","review":"Before reading, I assumed J. Bronowski's Science and Human Values would be a work dealing with the opposition or harmony of scientific-technological progress and our social values. Instead, it examines science as a specific case of human activity and the definition of human values in general and specifically with regard to science.Bronokowski begins by dispelling the \\"schoolboy\\" notion that science is a collection of \\"facts\\". It is instead a creative activity like art and philosophy in which concepts rule. Concepts are open to interpretation and development, and this is what happens in science.The second essay in the book puts forward the position that all human values are like scientific values and subject to change and development. This is not only a theoretical possibility but an historical reality, as evidenced by the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and other political developments.In the third essay, a theory of social values based on science is developed. \\"Value\\" is defined as a concept that both joins men in a society and lets them retain some individuality. In the scientific community values such as truthfulness and scholarship are what allow the scientific community to exist. Bronowski seems to say, then, that if we want a society that integrates science it must be a society that upholds scientific values, and science must support certain values in society in order to thrive.That science should be the basis of society is not so much stated outright as assumed or implied. This is a work of pragmatism. Too bad Bronowski didn't realize that he assumes science is a collegial society. In fact, the scientific community today is predominated by concerns such as tenure, profit and grant security. It is extremely hierarchical, with the drawing together aspects of values much more prevalent than the individuating ones.The last part of the book is a dialogue (a la Plato) on the same theme."},{"Title":"Pillow Talk (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"by J.P.

Unfortunately, the hunky consultant, Adam Taylor, is the problem. His job is to polish the company she works for as an acquisition target--and if that happens, Jessica is going to be out the door rather than through the glass ceiling.Adam Taylor is good at what he does and what he does is help companies maximize their profits by doing more with fewer workers. Sure he finds Jessica attractive, but that doesn't mean he can escape the brutal logic of the numbers. Fortunately, Adam has a better plan. He'll persuade Jessica to give it all up and help him pursue his dream--the house he already owns in Alabama needs a wife and kids. And Adam's homey fantasies have suddenly gotten a lot more concrete with Jessica in every picture. Unfortunately for his fantasy life, Jessica is a Chicago girl and wouldn't recognize a stove or vacuum cleaner if they bit her.

She currently suffers from sneezing fits as her nose goes wild when she is stressed and by the number of sneezes she must be stressed off the scale.Consultant Adam Taylor is retained to insure a smooth friendly transition though downsizing is expected. Though Jessica and Adam are attracted to one another she treats him with disdain expecting him to ax her job. Soon they challenge each other with a contest of statistical trivia and who can win a foot race that lead to the pair dating though both agree this is the wrong time.

An irate Jessica bets Adam that he can't seduce her in ten days; he accepts but plans to lose as he wants more from the woman he loves as he dreams of Green Acres with her.Though some of the squabbles and contests seem odd for two rational professionals to participate against one another, then again love makes for irrational behavior.

Like the bible, use it only when you have serious problem to deal with."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"This seventh edition of the famous classic standard book on optics is really neat! The notations, symbols became a little more modern than the previous editions. Also the shapes of the characters in the equations looks much more pretty so it helps reading, understanding. As most of you know, this has everything you need to study about, refer to classical wave optics. The only weak point of this book is the material covering geometrical optics. It's too abstract, mathematical and lacks modern treatment of optical designs, aberrations. But, regarding the wave optics, it's hard to find any flaws, downsides. Even though I am working on micro-photonic elements, I often need to refer to this book for some wave optics principles, knowledges. But this book alone does not cover the whole optics including optical design, photonics. If you want to have the best minimum combination of books covering the basics of the entire optics. I would recommend &quot;Fundamentals of Photonics(Saleh)&quot;, &quot;Modern Optical Engineering(Smith)&quot; and this book."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"It is just a rare book on physical optics based on Maxwell equations. Rarely a book states the assumptions,the validity of the equations, the principles and how the equations arrived. Certainly, it is a great book for postgraduates and researchers in physical optics not so for undergraduate students who don't want to go through all the mathematics."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"It should be on the shelf of every serious optical engineer or scientist. I find myself referring to it at least monthly. What more needs to be said?"},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"It is of course the reference for optics, and is very completeand rigorous. I didn't learn optics from it, I only use itas a reference and I suppose that is its function.It feels a bit oldfashioned (for example, I haven't foundspeckel applications in the chapter on coherence) but Isuppose that that is due to the fact that it is a classic.My other, personal, objection is that I hate Gaussianunits, I prefer by far SI units. Even Jackson finallyconceded to switch to SI units, but Wolf clings on thisGaussian system."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"This is a great book that I have used often. This is a graduate text. You should have had an undergraduate course in optics first. A typical undergraduate text that I recommend is Optics by Eugene Hecht who also wrote the Schaum's Outline for Optics. This being a graduate text you should have taken math for each of the four years of your undergraduate studies. My graduate work is in Microelectronics & Photonics and I use the book now as reference book. This book covers the theory very well; I have not found any other book that even comes close."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"Born and Wolf is simply the best and is always needed. Detailed derivation and references to original papers make it the indispensable book. Some reviewers complain that exclusive use of cgs units makes this book hard to read and even outdated. This is not true. There is no way SI can match cgs in elegance and physical clarity; it's the language of the experts and is for the real researchers. To excel in understanding electromagnetic theory of light, one had better become familiar with the cgs system rather than thinking in terms of SI. Understanding other books doesn't make me confident about the subject, understanding Born and Wolf does."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"Without any doubt, Born and Wolf are still the deepest theory book. Consider this book as the main source for most of other optical books."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"This book is the most comprehensive and readable book in all my books collected in optics. I specifically like the chapters devoted to geometrical optics and the rigorous treatment of diffraction. I have do doubt at all in my assignment of five stars to this book. It is no wonder that many of the scientists and engineers in NASA have the book in their possession."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"This classical reference in optics has been fittingly updated and enriched. A new edition of this must that should, however, be kept along the classic one. Apart from its historical connotation, the latter will be in fact highly appreciated for its clearer typography."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"Amazing book. It's the bible of geometric optics. Have everything you might need.Needs a little previous knowledge, but which book doesn't?"},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"Yes - all classical (linear) optical concepts are in here, and yes, it's the 'bible', but it's very dated in its content, style and references, generally, and not very practical to use.I wish Hecht - or someone like him - would re-write this classic as a more advanced version of his book."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"I read this book in the late sixties, when some of my fellow engineers built and tested an acoustic lens for a developmental company. Born & Wolf were well-acquainted with antenna aperture theory, and were among the first to write that the human eye could resolve 5X better than aperture theory would predict. This they credited to involuntary eye movements called flicks and saccades, which when combined with the brain's ability to do signal processing, was able to produce much better resolution than would have been predicted by the diameter of the retinal rods. In many ways the book gives testimony to God's wonderful gift of vision with color, depth, clarity, and order."},{"Title":"Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light","review":"The Born and Wolf Principles of Optics text is, without a doubt, a classic. At first, it was hard for me to get into the text because I could not see a physics test without problems or exercises at the end of every chapter, but I realized, through this book, that there was a better way to study. Now I'm getting more out of all the texts and journals I study by internalizing the information through memorization and so on instead of learning just enough to work the problems. What I learn from Born and Wolf will take me a long way."},{"Title":"The White Earth Tragedy: Ethnicity and Dispossession at a Minnesota Anishinaabe Reservation, 1889-1920","review":"Meyer does an excellent job detailing the complex history of dispossession on the White Earth Reservation during the early 20th century. American Indian history is often portrayed as simplistic; Meyer avoids this entirely and, instead, her meticulous research brings a story of diversity, deceit, and contradiction to life. This is a compelling tale of economics, politics, and social change. Meyer does not sugar coat the reality of the involvement of federal, state, and local officials in what is one of the most outrageous scandals in U.S. history. This is also a story of identity and how the U.S. employed race and racialization of Anishinaabeg as the ultimate means of dispossession."},{"Title":"The White Earth Tragedy: Ethnicity and Dispossession at a Minnesota Anishinaabe Reservation, 1889-1920","review":"I set about reading this book for class. Halfway through, I was still confused about what was all happening, because it felt as though the author was writing the pages as they entered her head, with little orginization. A paragraph will cover several years of statistics, and the next will be about an entirely different decade, either later or earlier, or it will suddenly change locales without notice (white earth one paragraph, mil lacs the next, back to white earth, etc). It was also very heavily dependent on names, which also seemed to switch between christian names and anishinaabe names without notice. Finally, it felt as though a thesaurus had been dug out for most of the book, as the wording was often higher than would be used in normal conversation, which made you have to sit and think about certain words because you were unaccostomed to seeing/hearing them."},{"Title":"OLD TESTAMENT MINIATURES: A Medieval Picture Book with 283 Paintings from The Creation to The Story of David.","review":"Amazing!Old Testament Miniatures, or, The Maciejowski Bible, as it is known, is a phenomenal resource for armour and garb reference in the 13th century. But it has so much more too! Period illustrations of foot wear, siege weaponry, feasts and even underwear!Well worth the price you pay. The plates are a large size (this is an Oversized Book) which allows a decent level of observable detail. The only downside is the book's gold inking from the plates seemed to be slightly damaged by the facing page.

Originally the book contained no text. Subsequently over time it acquired text in Latin, Persian, and Judeo-Persian. This book is an unique artifact of historically and culturally situated sense of Hebrew scripture.

You can't fix the damage done to the cochlea where the damage has occurred -- instead, people need to come to terms and learn to do the best with what hearing they have left.

Hearing Aids -- sold from a good competent audiologist -- is the key to understanding and making adjustments to maximize use of what hearing is left."},{"Title":"Coping With Hearing Loss: A Guide for Adults and Their Families","review":"One of the prior reviewers of this book was very negative. I disagree! As a hearing aid user for more than 40 years, I think this book is a good summary of the information that I need and have bought copies of it to educate my family and friends. I suspect the unhappy user was never correctly fitted with an adequate hearing aid and feels used and abused. I would have also been in that frame of mind if I had purchased my aids from the wrong audiologist. This book will help educate potential hearing aid users (and their families) to realistic expectations and hopefully lead them to good audiologists."},{"Title":"Coping With Hearing Loss: A Guide for Adults and Their Families","review":"An excellent book. Rezen has a way of getting straight to the point, while remaining very sympathetic to both the person with the hearing loss, and those who communicate/live with that person. It is a very helpful, clear, well-written book that I cannot recommend highly enough to you."},{"Title":"Coping With Hearing Loss: A Guide for Adults and Their Families","review":"It is very difficult to obtain clear, unbiased information about hearing loss, and many of the books I read just confused things. But this book really puts everything you need to know together in one place, and the author is clearly knowing and compassionate. If you want to do something about your hearing loss, I would say that this is the place to start."},{"Title":"Coping With Hearing Loss: A Guide for Adults and Their Families","review":"Nobody should have to cope with deafness. Nobody should have to adjust. One reads of all the advances made in science and technology, particularly in fields of medicine and what advances have they made in deaf research in the last forty years? Nothing. So, instead of doing anything about it, so-called doctors just spend their time ripping off deaf people of their hard earned money while hearing aid manufacturers and retailers make a fortune selling junk that, while of some benefit to people who are hard-of-hearing, provide absolutely no help to the severely or profoundly deaf and closed caption companies charge [per] hour to caption programs on TV that are garbled half the time. And the author says \\"cope with it.\\" A bad book that offers no hope for a better future. Save what little money you have left after blowing it on useless hearing gadgets, visits to the quacks, and garbled captions paid for by the federal government from your taxes."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"This is one of the coolest books I have ever read. If you like Christian books you should definitely read it! It's pretty much a story of what it will be like when all the people that believe in Jesus get raptured and everyone else gets left behind."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"Being a teen myself, I would have to say that this has a very good story line, even if you only see it as fiction. The best part of reading this book is that you are able to pick out the fiction and compare it to the book of Revelation. I would recommend these Left Behind Series to anyone, if they are a non-Christian or Christian. Either way Tim LaHaye gets the message out in a very entertaining, easy to read environment. The credit also has to go Jerry B Jinkins. I hope this helped!Deus Laus!"},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I read the first book in this series because I was bored during a plane ride. I'm glad I read the book only so I can warn others away from them. It was very poorly written, with huge plot holes, unbelievable characters and impossible situations.

Still if never read other books,was a good eye opener to what to expect in future.."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"These books, along with the adult aimed \\"Left Behind\\" series, rely on poor theology and play on people's fears in order to make a lot of money for its authors. They provide a seriously flawed view of the end times by combining scriptures from different books of the Bible that are not meant to be together. In doing so, the transform the gospel message from one of love to one of fear. As previously stated, I fear that they are more concerned with Profits rather than Prophets."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I really liked this book because I couldn't get into the adult Left Behind series.

Since the book intersected with the adult novels that made it even more interesting.Jenkins and LeHaye make a great writing team. This book was geared for YA readers, but with these excellent writers it makes for acceptable adult reading.You will be wondering at the end of the book what kind of person you would be if you were in this situation."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I have read all of the original left behind series. I love the way that the authors can combine fiction with endtime biblical prophecy. The Young Trib Force is a great way to see what it will be like when the rapture takes place. I also like the fact that it gives each teen's perspective. I would recommend this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"Im am reading this series for the second time and I love them! The first time through though I compared the bible verses to what said in the book to make sure the authors weren't just making stuff up.

Great for younger readers , but maybe a bit shallow for older kids. The overt religious tone maybe offensive to those who are offended by any mention of it."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"At no doubt, this will definitely give kids a great point of view towards the rapture through the eyes of four teenagers who are experiencing it themselves. If your kid has questions, and confusions about the Rapture, the Left Behind Kids version is sure to have them understanding it, and also giving them a good story to think about for the near future, and of course, entertainment.Judd, Vicki, Lionel and Ryan think they know it all. None of them believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, and none believe in God. With Judd a running away from his parents, Vicki rebelling against her parents conversion, Lionel lying about being a Christian, and Ryan skeptisysing about his friends faith, the four will come together to realize there was more to life, and God that was there all the time, they just wouldn't take the time to believe it.I recieved the first book (which is the first four books in all) for my birthday, and was a little skeptical about them at first. A few months before I had started to read the adult Left Behind books, but to no avail for the fact that they were too old for me (I was twelve at the time). After re-discovering them a month later, I was hooked on them. Not only were they entertaining, but they gave an easy understanding towards the Rapture for kids.Even if adults have trouble understanding the Rapture and the end times, it'll provide an easy understanding, and have them (as I did) rexamine their faith through these books.An instant five stars. And remember, if you refuse to believe the Rapture, just make sure you have plenty of places to go afterwards, because there will be no place to hide."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I didn't read this book to learn more about Jesus. I read it because it was hard to put down and the story intertwined the adult series books and stayed true to the original story line but from a teen's perspective. Just as reading about Narnia didn't teach me to talk to lions or watching sci-fi made me learn about quantum physics. If the book says it's &#34; fiction &#34; then sit back and enjoy the story.If you are searching for God, read the right book. It should be a reference or non-fiction genre."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I've read the adult series and enjoyed it. As a Christian who enjoys fiction writing I know it's sometimes not easy to separate fact from fiction. This book follows the \\"what if\\" principles of the Book of Revelation. It doesn't say that this is HOW it's going to happen, it gives a fictional perspective on how it plays out in the authors mind based on what the Book of Revelation says. Anyone who tries to tie the theology to it and make it into a \\"fact\\" is not reading the book for the story. That said, this series is really good for teens and does make a teen think about the \\"what if's\\" related to the Bible. Excellent Reading and a great page turner for the younger sect."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"Last year, I just started reading The Left Behing Kids Series. Well, at the moment, I knew it was a christian book series, and that was about it. I never knew it was so addictive that I had to read every one of the forty books in the series. It can give you all sorts of different feelings, it will make you cry, it will make you laugh, yada, yada. Well, four teenagers got left behind when all of the believers in Christ went up to heaven.The four teenagers are: Judd, the Runaway: a boy who was raised in church, had a nice family, nice house, nice life. Never caught the grasp of the teachings in church. Judd's family dissapeared and went to heaven, leaving him behind.Lionel, The Liar: Same story as Judd's, but Lionel is immature and is younger that Judd.Vicki, The Rebel: Vicki is the opposite of Judd and Lionel. Known as the creepy girl in school, she was raised in a trailer park, with a somewhat dysfunctional family, dirt poor. She was the only one in her family to be left behind.Ryan, The Skeptic: Ryan is the youngest one in the foursome, but unlike the others, his family did not disapear. His parents were killed in two different tragic accidents, leaving him alone. His family was not believers, but his best friend was. His best friend had tried to teach him about Christ, but Ryan was skeptical.Well, the four end up living together, forming the Young Tribulation Force, with the help of Bruce Barnes, a pastor. The try to spread christianity around, in a world that is separated by believers and non-believers.I highly suggest reading this series, even if you are a believer or not. Give it a chance, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I have read the entire Left Behind series. All 13 books were totally captivating. This is the story of 4 teenagers left behind. Ryan, from a family that never attended church & died during the disappearances, Vicki whose parents and siblings accepted Christ 2 years earlier, Judd whose entire family disappeared and Lionel who was also left behind with one uncle when his their family disappeared.They went to the same high school but did not know each other. Judd was from the upper class, Vicki lived in a trailer park, and Ryan & Lionel who were both middle income. Lionel was the only African American. They learn to depend on each other and God during the turbulent times. The story and characters blend in with the left behind series. This story is told from the prospective of the teenagers. It is the first in a series.It is important to remember that this is a book of fiction. Many people take religious fiction far too seriously. This is not a story of how things will happen only a story about how they could happen."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"The Book of Revelation has been the central issue in innumerable debates. As a scholar of Second Coming Prophecies, I must say that LeHaye & Jenkins did an admirable job in sticking to as it was written, not only in revelation, but also in the other Second Coming prophecies that are scattered throughout the Bible. It also places it in an exciting format that will and has attracted many un-believers. There will always be critics of these books, mostly non-Christians who did not even bother picking up the books or the Bible, who will brazenly say, \\"If you want to know what happens, read John's book of Revelation.\\" In doing so, they show their own lack of reading that very book in the Bible. These stories are wonderful and I highly recommend them to all ages! They are also great witnessing tools because even if the reader doesn't accept Christ now, they will after the church is raptured! May the grace of our Father find you."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"A very thinly veiled retread of the \\"Left Behind\\" series for the younger set, this book defies even the lowest standards of disbelief.Four young people are left behind during the Rapture. Three of them come from Christian families and are the only ones left behind. One of them has been exposed to Christianity, but never believed and is orphaned when his mother and father die in post-Rapture accidents.The four young people find each other, realize they have been left behind and accept Jesus, and form the \\"Kids Tribulation Force\\" or the \\"Junior Tribulation Force\\" (both names are used in the book). You might think their pastor, Bruce Barnes, would connect them with the adults in the regular Tribulation Force, but Jenkins and LaHaye actually couldn't let that happen since it didn't happen in the main series (logic would require sacrificing continuity which would mess up their attempt to make money off of these books). Buck Williams makes a cameo appearance to tell them about the Antichrist, but nobody really seems to care that these four young people are living alone instead of with adults. It makes even less sense when you consider that the regular Tribulation Force had so much time on their hands in the main series (what did Chloe really DO anyway?). These are the first four books of the series, but I can't even imagine the excuses Jenkins and LaHaye will use to keep the kids away from the adults in the last four books of the series.For the first four books, their adventures are pretty much limited to deciding to dress more conservatively, having prayer meetings, getting really excited about going to church, and watching the news for clues on the Antichrist.This book has the same weird lapses as the regular series. Society is in chaos, but people care about all the wrong things. We endure pages of Judd rescuing his SUV the day after the Rapture from a parking garage. A criminal is in hiding because the police think he killed himself (as if the cops would notice, in the midst of total chaos, that a low level gangbanger popped up in a Chicago suburb). Police from Chicago can't arrest somebody they suspect of murder in a suburb because they don't have permission . . . but after they set up a time consuming and expensive sting, they can go right into the suburb without permission and arrest an accomplice. None of it hangs together.This truly represents the bottom tier of Christian fiction. Don't let Jenkins and LaHaye separate you from your money. Anything you could read would be a better use of your time than this."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"I have been reading Left Behind series for several years. I received a kindle about 3 years ago and have been reading other books about Revelation and have enjoyed every one of them.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Taken (Left Behind: The Young Trib Force)","review":"This is a good account of what the world would be like if Jesus Raptured his church.

While other translations / editions may be better for use in study, Oxford's The New Testament and Psalms - An Inclusive Version is invaluable to provide text for lectors in worship services where inclusivity is at issue. This Bible avoids exclusion of women and minorities, and clarifies concepts in terms which do not have the usual cultural impediments of western-centered language. Through all these efforts, the translators have done a competent job of holding fast to the original message.Every church which tries to do readings in a contemporary, inclusive spirit should have a copy of this Bible."},{"Title":"Do Everything in the Dark: A Novel","review":"Laid out in the form of \\"a game of triple solitaire,\\" Gary Indiana's sixth novel is beautifully written, and it skillfully evokes a certain near-great, over-40, Bohemian crowd in New York, allowing the reader to peer into their bedrooms at home and their vacation accommodations in Ibiza, Santa Fe, Provincetown, and Istanbul. Yet they suffer, stricken by dope and booze and fear of failure, and if this makes it possible for certain readers to return gratefully to rather unglamorous lives, it is also perfectly realistic; only the narrator remains something of an enigma. The story ends at about the same moment as Paul Auster's \\"Brooklyn Follies,\\" but to his credit Gary Indiana builds up to the brink of the cataclysm with more credibility, realizing that a return to self-obsession is only a matter of time. Highly recommended for mature, literate readers."},{"Title":"Do Everything in the Dark: A Novel","review":"Amazing book! I just finished grad school at CalArts and I felt like this book was a snapshot of me and my colleagues in 20 years time...(of course, we can't afford new york anymore, but you get the idea). I am in awe of Indiana."},{"Title":"Do Everything in the Dark: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading this book for the fifth time (!) since its release in 2003. That's how much I love it. Gary Indiana is one of my favorite contemporary writers. I've read most of his published fiction, and love it. But this is my favorite. In addition to the black humor, art-world gossip, dirty sex, and overall camp tone that characterizes GI's fiction, this book also has real heart, but without sentimentality.Do Everything in the Dark tracks a dozen related characters through the summer preceding 9-11. A presentiment and preoccupation with untimely death via plane crashes, physical disease, mental illness, bodily violence, creative burnout, and drug addiction permeates the narrative. Nevertheless, 9-11 is never mentioned. (The last scene takes place three days before the attacks). In this sense I think this is the best novel \\"about\\" 9-11, because it's all about the mindset that preceded it. The last chapter (I won't give it away) is devastating. This is such a clich&eacute;, but I have to say it, because in this case it's true for me: I have laughed and cried whilst reading this book. The characters are so real I wonder and worry about them. And for anyone who has experienced (or witnessed someone experiencing) a major depressive episode, the Denise-Caroline storyline is just gut-wrenching and real and true. It's one of those moments in literature where you think, \\"How could he [the writer] know that?\\"Because it reads like a roman-a-clef (GI is both the narrator and an eponymous though deliberately underdeveloped character) one recognizes fairly obvious references to Cookie Mueller, Nan Goldin, Ron Vawter, among others, so it's fun to try to guess who the other characters represent, even if you realize that as most writers do, GI has most likely created composites. That being said, I am DYING to know who \\"Tova Finkelstein\\" is based on. She can't really be Susan Sontag, can she? Not even GI would dare! Now that is some gooooood gossip."},{"Title":"Do Everything in the Dark: A Novel","review":"You want to turn away from the downward spiral of these characters but can't. Well written,funny, but also tragically sad, Gary Indiana follows a group of people living in New York, Santa Fe and one through Istanbul.At the start of this, I really didn't know if I was going to finish. More than anything else I found myself getting depressed.It's very funny at times, but there were moments I just wanted to take a shower afterwards to shake it off. Aging, depression, empty one nighters,drug addiction, and psychotic episodes. Guess this is why they call it a black comedy."},{"Title":"Until Tomorrow","review":"From the back cover:Woman of the prairie...Alone on her Kansas homestead, Cara James passed the time making rag dolls--and dreamed of a better life in California.Man of the battlefields...Traveling home from the Civil War, Dake Reed came across an ambushed wagon--and a newborn baby in need of care.Bringing the child to the first house he found across the lonely prairie, Dake turned to Cara--a backwoods young woman who lived by her grandma's saying and her pioneer instincts. Together they embarked on a journey to fulfill the heart's greatest promises: a place to call home--and a love that lasts forever and a day...And my review:The first half of this story was really good. The author created loveable and well-rounded characters. They had their flaws, but they were basically good people. After all, who couldn't admire the Southern man who was willing to face the hatred and scorn of his neighbours and friends to fight for an end to slavery, because he knew it was the right thing to do? Or the man who was willing to take on the responsibility of caring for someone else's baby? Or the woman who was willing to help him in these endeavors? Finding two likeable lead characters can be really rare in romance writing these days. I liked watching the \\"everything in its place\\" military man fall for the offbeat woman who had no sense of time and didn't like to wear shoes.However, by the second half of the story, things started to drag. The characters were in love and wanted to get married. It would have been a find place to wrap up the story, in my opinion. But instead, the author decided to drag it out. One bad thing after another happened without any relief in between painful incidents. It just got to be really annoying after a while. It felt like the story came to a climax was too many times. By the last encounter with the villian (who was totally obvious to me two pages after meeting that character) I just wanted the book to be over already. It felt like the author had to reach a certain page count, or something. I ended up skimming the last 100 pages to see how the story ended (and of course, there were no real surprises).I find that this is often the case with Landis' novels--they start off strong, then the magic and momentum starts to die by the middle of the book, and pretty much completely fizzles out by the end. I've yet to read one of her books that had really moved me by the time I finished it. I don't recommend UNTIL TOMORROW. There are better romances out there.***One last caveat--though it is a historically accurate term, and was considered politically correct at the time that this book was published (1994), some readers might be offended by the frequent use of the words \\"negro\\" and \\"black\\" to refer to African-Americans, as well as a few other blatant ethnic slurs spoken by racist characters throughout the story."},{"Title":"Until Tomorrow","review":"Having never given a book a one-star rating, I paused before doing so - but not for very long. I thought that if I could find any redeeming value in the book, I could at least give it two stars. My aunt had recommended this author, so I was eager to try one of her books. Must have picked up the wrong one. The story is about Dake, a native of Alabama, who fights for the Union during the war and then begins back home for the south after the war is over. On the way, he finds the bodies of three people who were ambushed on a Kansas trail. One of the victims is a white southern lady who is relieved because someone is there to save her newborn baby boy. She tells him who she is and where she is from - Alabama. After the woman dies, Dake gathers up a quilt and the woman's bracelet so he'll have proof of the baby's identity. He now is left with the arduous task of caring for a newborn and vows to return him to his family in Alabama. Dake travels to the nearest cabin and ends up hiring its occupant, Cara, to travel with him to Alabama and take care of the baby. With this premise, the story had a lot of promise. But as soon as they arrive back in the south it becomes predictible and often insulting - the southerners are mean, evil and immoral and in need of Yanks to save them. I struggled through the book hoping that I would find some of the excitement I had felt when I first began the book. The characters never had a &quot;spark&quot; and a lot of the plot seemed contrived."},{"Title":"Until Tomorrow","review":"The story is outlined in depth by another reader and it's a good plot/story line actually. My problem is that I really liked the second half of the book when the plot thickened and characters became real but I hated the first half. The &quot;heroine&quot; starts off as a real turn off with her backwoodsy, live in a cave, dirty feet, etc...unreality. By the middle of the book she gets cleaned up some and becomes more appealing. I liked the hero from the beginning so I stayed with it until it got better but I wouldn't read it a second time."},{"Title":"Until Tomorrow","review":"Dake Reed and Cara James become well rounded characters and develope well with their efforts to save the baby, Clay.Now, be realistic and admit that there were good and bad on both sides, not north and south, just humans and their failings.Minna certainly gets what she deserves.

The fact that Chahin chose to start from here (circa 1300 BC) is significant enough, considering that many scholars choose to ignore Armenian history until the late medieval era (circa 900 AD), when the Bagratuni Kingdom was established. And yet, he devotes roughly 2/3 of the book to Urartian history, richly describing the cultural and political legacy it left behind and showing that, far from being a weak state subject to the whims of the Assyrians, it always provided to be a thorn in the soft northern belly of Assyria, and, at certain points in its history, as well as its regional equal.There were only a few faults I found in this book: I was a little distressed of how Chahin broached the topic of the transition from Urartian to Armenian rule. Chahin takes the word of ancient historians, most notably Herodotus, at face value, and concludes that the Armenian people must have been colonists from Europe. This may be easier to forgive since new studies proving that Armenians were original inhabitants of the region only came to light in the 1980s, and that this book was published only in 1987. Chahin could have also devoted more space to the other kingdoms of Armenia; i.e., the Yervanduni, the Artashesyan, the Arshakuni, the Bagratuni, and the Cilician kingdoms. In the grand scheme of things, 230 pages on the Urartian kingdom seems significant, but it falls somewhat short when 1500 years of history is summarized in a space of only 90 pages. Nevertheless, it's an engaging read and a great introductory tome on the little known kingdoms that were founded in the Armenian highlands."},{"Title":"Mustang Restoration Handbook","review":"This is a great book for the beginner.

If you are purchasing it as a primer on what to expect during a rebuild/restoration then it is both entertaining and informative. If you are buying it as a shop reference, then it isn't really going to be worth your while. Probably the most informative parts are right in the beginning where the author describes common problems found on unrestored cars and what to look for when shopping.Also, being written 24 years ago, the techniques presented are somewhat outdated (there are easier ways to do some of the things described in this book). There are also no more piles of Mustangs to be picked over in local scrap yards, they were either snatched up, destroyed, or rusted away long ago.

He partakes of everything to extremes in his marvelous palace - food, wine, women, and most importantly, knowledge. His mother Catharis encourages and fosters his love of the dark arts, by which he comes to summon a Giaour, a foul demon.The Giaour promises the voracious Vathek to grant him access to the realm of Eblis and Soliman, where he will command all demonic forces and be privy to enough knowledge to satisfy his curiosity. To this end, Vathek engages in wanton and reckless murders, seductions, and blasphemies against the patient divinity 'Mahomet' and his benificent spirits.One sees in &quot;Vathek&quot; a comparable theme with Montesquieu's &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. In both, we have a tyrant, (Montesquieu's Usbek is a domestic tyrant) who abandons, and ultimately relinquishes all capacity to control their dominions or themselves - All for the pursuit of knowledge.Vathek can thus be seen as a critique of the Enlightenment and of enlightened despotism, so much the rage in Europe in the late 18th century. Beckford seems to rail at knowledge being held above respect for a common humanity. Overall a very interesting novel in many respects and aside from Beckford's unnecessary authorial interruptions, a solid read."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"The tale of Vathek is undeniably a wonderful oriental fable, where enlightenment ethics are presented and critiqued. If read in conjunction with Samuel Johnson \\"Rasselas\\", Montesquieu's Persian Letters and \\"Arabian Nights\\" one may be able to better understand the landscape upon which orientalism (a term used by Beckford himself to illuminate the period's infatuation with the orient, not to be confused with Said's) and enlightenment values where divulged. Beckford's tale however speaks of a more prescient sphere where the author's inner struggles and thwarted tragic desultoriness devolves. As with all literature this compact gem stands on her own; however many have tried to extract a moral import and some have even described a mystique of knowledge and a system of ethics with undue fastidiousness. In a more likely scenario we have a wonton fable whimsical and indulgent, crafted as a parody of \\"orientalism\\". Knowledge of Beckford's life may serve the reader well but should not hinder her enjoyment. The author's disquietude trumps an increasing distance from the absurd drive and hedonistic tendencies of the protagonist, while we feel a sympathetic kinship laxed the more into the novella we proceed. The author wrote this fable in French and supervised the translation as best he could. The grotesque and the sublime are here married insolubly but tend to find a balance suspended over a void that derides and insinuates the emptiness of a spiritual fantasy in turmoil.The ending paragraphs are singed with a sad glow that seems to recriminate as much as it moralizes: much like a father that punishes a child only to feel remorse over the fact that his own blood cannot enjoy what is most enjoyable. He is not convinced and Beckford created a wonderful fable where much is exposed, but the simplicity, the arrogance and the conviction are to be regaled with the same comic grotesque sprightliness with which he infuses his narrative.A quick fun read that demands little of us, but in degrees can disclose a sensibility we may be dismissive of if we are to package it as a tale where orientalism meets enlightenment values."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"Leaving aside the question of whether this book is a 'gothic' novel or not, it is a dark fantasy. It shares with its more conventionally gothic brethren a tale of dark deeds in an exotic setting, where an alien and exciting religion is practised.In the standard Gothic tale, allusions to Roman Catholicism, thought of by respectable Englishmen as a dark, oppressive, and half-pagan faith, were part of the conventional apparatus. Beckford chose instead to imagine the world of Islam, an even more exotic milieu that added some flashes of bright colours to the dark and sorcerous background of his book. His choice of an even more exotic setting allowed him greater freedom in portraying characters who defied social convention and fell into exotic habits of mind.My understanding is that it is a matter of some debate to what extent the English text of -Vathek- is a translation from the French, or an original English composition. I do not have the French text in front of me, but it has been represented to me that Beckford's &quot;original&quot; French is rather like the French of Oscar Wilde's -Salome-, and needed extensive editing to be acceptable to a French readership.At any rate, -Vathek- is a prime example of early dark fantasy. The description, of course, will be richer than you are used to, but Beckford's prose actually seems to move quite quickly. Fans of H. P. Lovecraft or Clark Ashton Smith will find that it is quite easy to slip into. And the tale is indeed a vivid one, right up to the exceptional ending when Vathek and Carathis are damned to the halls of Eblis, their hearts seared with unquenchable fire.This is a good edition of the story, and the notes and maps are helpful."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"Vathek is another work in an endless series with the Faust myth as its backbone. Except here, instead of being set in Germany, the setting is the ancient middle east in which genies and devils inhabit the land.Vathek is a caliph who is loved but also feared by his people. In fact, if he really loses his temper, just the sight of his gaze can cause death. His court makes The Satyricon look like a sunday school with its voluptuousness and excess. There are even five wings of his palace, with each one dedicated to a sense with names such as \\"The Delight of the Eyes\\" and \\"The Palace of Perfumes\\". Oh, the decadence! Of course someone as attached to physical gratification as Vathek is sure to stomp on the moral and religious boundaries of Allah and get in trouble.Much like God and Yahweh in the Book of Job, Allah allows Vathek to be tempted and tried by demons as a bizarre test of his faith. Actually, maybe in both cases it was a test of God's faith in man. The faith that man will do the right thing in the end. That he will turn away from evil. That he will have an epiphany which will redeem him. Vathek isn't so lucky.An evil being in the disguise of a man, called the Gaiour, comes to Vathek's court with all sorts of magical artifacts which seem to give their bearer otherworldy powers. Vathek becomes entranced by the thought of having powers over spirits and other men and begins to follow a direct line to eternal hell. In order to court evil spirits, Vathek becomes a mass murderer, a blasphemer, a betrayer, a killer of his own people. He is helped in this by his mother, Carathis, who hasn't even heard the word goodness. She constructs a tower much like the Tower of Babel, in order to reach to the gods and to serve as storage for her arcane items.The book, much like Dante's Inferno, becomes a little much at times. I mean, how many deeds of evil can we experience before we go, \\"ok, he's going to Hell now!\\" Sometimes you sense that some of this is intentional and tongue in cheek. At other times, you're horrified at the evil that most of the characters do. Any characters that are good are trampled upon by the evil. The last couple of pages are truly disturbing. I liked this book and would recommend it to anyone that keeps an open mind about fantasy or who is interested in the question of how much knowledge is too much knowledge."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"Vathek was Caliph in the area of approximately present-day Iraq, at some unknown time in the past. He was generally a fair person, but woe unto him who got Vathek angry. He lived in an immense castle, with the absolute finest of everything. One day, a very strange, and very ugly, man stood before his throne. He had a hideous laugh, but didn't speak. He showed Vathek all manner of rare and exotic items, including sabers inscribed in an unknown language, inscriptions which kept changing from day to day. The stranger was thrown in prison for his unwillingness to speak. The next morning, finding the stranger gone, Vathek totally blows his top.Finding himself outside the castle, at the foot of the nearby mountains, Vathek hears a voice coming out of a huge crevasse. It is the stranger, called a giaour, who promises Vathek all the powers of heaven in exchange for the blood of fifty young boys. Vathek provides the boys, through the guise of a sporting competition, then the giaour reneges on its part of the deal. When the people, especially the parents, understand what's happened, Vathek has to get back to the castle and lock the doors, until the anger subsides.Later, Vathek commands the creation of a great caravan to a place called Rocnabad, home of famous springs. For various reasons, he needs to get away from the castle for a while. This is going to be the biggest, and grandest, caravan ever. On the journey, the caravan is attacked by wild animals, with a number of casualties. Vathek, his wives and senior advisers, can no longer be carried the rest of the way, because of lack of personnel, but actually have to walk to Rocnabad.At Rocnabad, there is a castle as big or bigger than the one that Vathek left behind. He meets a young woman named Nouronihar, who he wants as one of his wives (as Caliph, what Vathek wants, Vathek gets). She is promised to a man named Gulchenrouz. The lovers drink a potion that will make them look dead for several days, then, the idea is that they go and live somewhere else, away from Vathek.This is one of the very few novels set in the world of the Arabian Nights, a world of eunuchs, slaves and harem girls. It was first published over 200 years ago (in the 1780s), so the style of writing is very different than what is normal for a modern reader. Therefore, it will take some patience on the part of the reader. If you can find a copy, it is time, and money, very well spent."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"The tale of the caliph Vathek is certainly the strangest thing I've read lately, and that is an accomplishment since it had to beat outThe Blind Owl: no mean feat, that.I think I would be doing anyone a disservice to spoil the plot, especially since it doesn't make much sense anyway. I will give away that it is basically a variation of the Faust legend, with huge helpings of oriental exoticism. The story's mood is sometimes dark and moralistic, sometimes light and fantastic, sometimes ironic. Sometimes the narrator seems to sympathize, or to want us to sympathize, with the anti-hero; other times we are clearly to be repulsed or, at the least, startled.Who should read this book?First of all, any fan of early gothic. Its mood is less consistently dark than the genuinely gothic novels, but I'm sure the relations are obvious. The deepest sympathy, I think, between Vathek and more famous gothic stories, is in the mingling of attraction and disgust at the superstition and cosmic moral drama found outside the orthodox Protestant or rationalistic Enlightenment worldviews. The reader should indulge in a Catholic or orientalist fantasy for awhile, come to appreciate its danger, and return gratefully to the supposedly well-ordered English society. Escapist literature at its best! Beyond that, however, the similarities pretty much end.If you are a fan of early gothic novels, of course you should read whatever you feel like, but I would gently recommend readingThe Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story,The Monk (Penguin Classics),The Romance of the Forest, and of courseFrankenstein (Norton Critical Editions), maybe even (for some lighter fun)Northanger Abbey (Penguin Classics)before turning to Vathek. They are each more famous, more coherent and arguably more entertaining.Fans of H. P. Lovecraft might enjoy Vathek as well.Secondly, anyone interested in the later stages of the Enlightenment, or early romanticism. Here again I would suggestFaust: A Tragedy (Norton Critical Editions), and I agree with the reviewer who suggestedThe History of Rasselas: Prince of Abissinia (Oxford World's Classics)as works that you might like to read along with, and probably before, Vathek.Thirdly, anyone interested in orientalism. Here of course the key thing to read first isThe Arabian Nights, Volume I: The Marvels and Wonders of The Thousand and One Nights (Signet Classics)is the place to start, and Johnson's Rasselas would be a good follow-up, and then Vathek's place will be well appreciated.The connections to gothic, romanticism and orientalism are obvious, but I'll go out on a limb that may surprise: Kafka fans will probably enjoy this. Now Kafka's stories have brilliant subtleties that Vathek lacks, but I believe there is a definite affinity here in spirit, if not in technical execution. Kafka couldn't have written the way he did in the 18th century, but if he'd been there to try, perhaps he would have come up with something like Vathek.So, in sum, there are a number of works with a greater claim to most people's time and attention than Vathek; however, there are a large number of readers out there who are unfortunately missing a work that they would certainly relish. By all means, give this fascinating little book a shot."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"Those are the three categories that I've seen this story put in. Vathek tells the tale about a man with an exceedingly high tower. This man named Vathek is very greedy. The reading can be a little rough at times, which is why I took off one star, but there are some very memorable scenes. Two that really stick out in my mind are: When the stranger in the dungeon escapes. And when Vathek ascends his tall tower, thinking how tall he stands over his minions--then he looks up at the stars and grimaces, because the stars are still the same distance away. Both of these scenes are towards the beginning, which I think is the best part of the book. The middle details Vathek's journey to some far off place. But then it picks up again towards the end. I don't normally read Gothics--if this IS a Gothic, opinions vary--but it is a very good book and definitely one I plan on adding to my permanent collection. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges gave enthusiastic mention to this book in one of his works."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"Beckford's story is what is known as an Oriental tale; it falls into the sub-division known as 'Satanic.' The reader will easily see why. Vathek kills casually, his mother Carathis positively gleefully; they hold traffic with evil spirits, Carathis raising them up when necessary. What they do, they do to gain access to the Palace of Subterranean Fire. This story moves along well, with plenty of darkly humourous comments. The translation process does not seem to have impaired the book's readability; if so, it was probably due to the fact that Beckford and a colleague only worked on it sporadically--Beckford kept on having to remove himself from England to prevent unpleasantness. His tastes are reflected in his fiction."},{"Title":"Vathek: An Arabian Tale","review":"The book itself is absolutely wonderful, and I'd reccomend it to anyone. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the readability (if that's actually a word) is somewhat damaged by the fact that it's a translation from French. I also would warn anybody who is attracted to 'gothic' novels (i.e. The Monk, The Castle of Otranto). It's set in the Middle East and, although there are certain moments of gothic quality horror, over all, the setting somewhat ruined the classification under which it was reccomended to me, and, as any true gothic fan will know, setting is crucial to such novels."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read further, as my comments & criticism include some plot revelations. I would have given this book 4 or even 5 stars had it not been for their glaring ripoff of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility's 'Marianne and Willoughby.' Hell...they didn't even have the decency to change Will's name! While the book is quite a fun read, and much better stylistically compared to some other chick-lit, didn't anyone else notice the same storyline? In \\"S&S\\", the dashing yet penniless Willoughby charms sweet, romantic Marianne...then drops her for a woman with a fortune. He coldly rebuffs her at a party, then sends a note saying Marianne has 'misinterpreted' his affection. The same thing happens here...Willoughby, married to a cold, unaffectionate woman with a large sum of money, charms the main character Julia. When the affair is discovered, he is thretened to be left penniless and out of their social circle. He gives Julia the same lines (almost verbatum) from \\"S&S.\\" In the end, both \\"Willoughbys\\" watch their true loves get married to other men from afar...Austen's on a white steed...and Karasyov's in a white porsche. Perhaps it is just my personal taste, but I do not like to see such blatant recycling, especially with such a classic novel."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Julia Pearce works as a salesclerk at Pelham's, an exclusive jewelry store.

Julia is quickly taken in by Lell and her super-wealthy friends as someone to mentor, a \\"winter project\\". Lell hires Julia as her Deputy Publicity Director at Pelham's.

At the same time, Julia tries hard to avoid the obvious chemistry but cannot help falling in love with Will Banks, Lell's estranged husband. However his ironclad financial agreements with the Pelhams prevail over his romantic preferences.

Her sentences are jumbled and all over the place which makes for a terrible uneven flow. She describes 5 or more characters in 3 pages which has me so confused as who is who..I even tried 'The Right Address' and felt the same inexperienced nonsense and hoopla. And describing things just goes on and on, I found myself skipping pages just just to get it overwith. Her books are boring and pointless."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Where to begin? The mind boggles. Well, its target audience cannot be older than 15, for starters.Then we can move on to eye-rollers such as: the horribly cliched phraseology (\\"Gag!\\" says the heroine after her employer's husband makes a pass,); the one dimensional stereotypes that populate its pages (catty male makeup artist, rich philandering dad, star-struck gay pal, jealously malicious best friend - now I have the urge to say \\"gag\\" myself...); the gratuitous obscenities that punctuate the characters' sentences to an excessive degree; and the tiresome name-dropping of \\"hip\\" restaurants, drinks, hotels, shoes, baby carriages, yadda-yadda - apparently calculated to make the book seem like a coveted window on the world of privilege for all us yobs out here with our noses pressed again the glass.The only thing that made the book even worse was to hear its audio version, narrated by Susan Denaker. Her vocal characterizations were not only grating and stereotypical, but they kept sliding into Paul Lynde Land ... where so many of Denaker's myriad characters tend to dwell. Those that didn't flucuated between Ms. Denaker's misplaced and anachronistic impressions of Valley Girls and swishing queens. In the first fifteen minutes, I flinched and protested aloud so often that I switched off my iPod and never returned."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Very enjoyable read and a sad commentary on society!

The women in this book just weren't smart. They were actually quite clueless and not anything like anyone I'd ever want to know or spend time with. I suppose if you're a big reader of \\"glamour lit\\" this might appeal to you, but it was as if the authors pulled out every stop they could think of and every cliched character (the gay best friend, rich girls, poor girl, a make-over, lies to fool people, etc.). I like my chick lit but this was just too much fluff with too little substance. Not my type of book, but maybe for others."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Don't get me wrong this book is an amusing and fashionable walk through New York society, but has anyone else come to the realization that this is a modern day remake of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", by Jane Austen?!?!?! The authors try to make a tie to My Fair Lady (in the notes about the book) as distraction from the fact that they actually ripped off Jane Austen's story line. There is a Jane Austen reference in this book, so I'm sure that the blatant similarities are no surprise to the authors. How is it that a book written by two people, has to pull from another source to fill the pages.I'll point out a few examples: the rogue man that plays on the affections of the books protagonist(Julia)is Willouhby; they didn't even bother to change the name!! Will is a dark haired, chamrming man, that has good breeding but not enough money to back up his family crest. Will then marries an attractive woman with a hefty bank account. He then finds a Julia, a woman of lesser standing, upon whom he preys and betrays in front of everyone. And the novel ends with Will looking on wistfully as the woman that he caste aside, marries a moral and wealthy man that has secretly loved her all along. If you've read \\"S & S\\", you'll know what I'm referring to... It's a shame that they can't come up with a plot of their own.I really enjoyed the \\"Right Address\\" and could not wait to read this book.

Julia, their endearing heroine, finds only disaster when she falls under the dangerous spell of glitz and glamour. When she meets the ringleader of a group of manipulative Manhattan elitist girls, they take her on as their \\"winter project,\\" intending to make her over into one of their own. It's a fun story that includes many yummy jabs at the sometimes moral corruptness of New York high society. I liked it! I totally look forward to their next book."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Carrie and Jill display their finest dialogues on this unmatched novel.I finished it in 2 days and decided to read it a 2nd time to digest, and take in all the snappy, savvy, and catty dirt-dishing verbal skewering.This book takes you to the heart of New York's rich and richer young crowd.Wickedly funny, this book is a winner."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Catty & Clever are the two words I'd use to describe the second novel from authors Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman. The story is a grown-up version of the film Mean Girls, set on the streets of upper-crust New York.The description of the book that you'll most often read is only partially accurate. Yes the story is essentially about a young woman with dreams of being a jewellery designer named Julia. By \`chance', Julia gets the opportunity to meet the young and hip heiress to the store, Lell, on the day of Lell's wedding. Something about Julia strikes Lell and those around her, and most of them devise plots in their minds to use Julia for one purpose or another.What the book doesn't dispel is how the story is not just about Julia. The other characters, including the other leads such as Lell and her friends, as well as much more minor characters, all get time to narrate the story from their point of view, albeit in third-person. The other main characters aside from Lell include Lell's husband Will, who develops the hots for Julia upon laying eyes on her - at the alter! Lell's best friend Polly also becomes intrigued by Julia at the wedding, and plans to use her as a pawn to stir up trouble between her friends. Finally Hope is probably the least affected directly by Julia, but is one of the best characters since she isn't quite as catty but is just as interesting as the other girls.This book is a bit on the slow side to begin, but after the first couple of chapters you probably won't be able to put it down as you get into the heads of New York's top society ladies and gentlemen - although they are anything but well-mannered. Scandals aplenty abound as Julia arrives on the scene - including financial woes, affairs galore, family conflicts, threats and promises, and a criminal charge here or there.All in all a great read, especially to curl up with on the beach!"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"After spending two hours reading a paperthin plot with plastic characters I could not believe I wasted my time or money.

Garbage."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Even though, I could point out a few flaws in the story line (you cannot afford a 2 bedroom apartment in Manhattan on a sales clerk's salary!), I did enjoy the book.

I liked the first novel better. This one reminded me too much of Eliza Doolittle and Professor Higgins. If I didn't know better, I'd swear that is where their inspiration came from. It's worth the read but I'd borrow it from the library instead of buying it."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"I truly enjoy low watt books - you know, books that require minimal effort to read and I think Wolves in Chic Clothing is exactly that.In saying that, I admired Wolves's main character, Julia for being passionate about jewlery, but frustrated with her inability to sniff out Lell and Polly's motives. It seemed slightly unbelievable that someone as grounded as Julia could be sucked into Lell and Polly's mind games.I think other reviewers have done a good job with summarizing, but want to express my frustration with the predicitability of the plot. The twists and turns the authors attempt to make shocking weren't and although the confrontation between Julia and Lell was great, I wish the authors would've captured Julia's edge and no-nonsense attitude in various parts of the story.All being said, its a quick read and if you are looking for something light without the need for too much concentration, this would be a book to consider. However, I highly recommend any book by Sophie Kinsella or Emilly Giffin before reading this book."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"After being entertained but a tad disappointed with The Right Address, the first novel from these authors, I was much more pleased with their second novel. Wolves in Chic Clothing follows Julia, a beautiful California transplant who dreams of being a jewelry designer while working as a salesgirl at Pelham's, a large, famous NYC jewelry store.Julia's life changes one day when she delivers a necklace to Lell Pelham for her wedding, and gets adopted by Lell and her friends- Polly, a catty, wealthy woman who ignores her baby son, and Hope, a genuinely nice and happy person, who has to hide her and her husband's money troubles from friends, despite being pretty happy. The book follows the adventures of all of the characters, but mostly focuses on Julia, who accidentally catches the eye of Lell's new husband, Willoughby.This novel was fun and gossipy, but had a lot more heart than the Right Address, and more likeable characters. It was funny to see a few characters from the first book come through to the second! I great, fun read."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Jill Kargman and Carrie Karyasov, authors of The Right Address, are back with their second novel about the elites population of New York. One character says, \\"'I hate gossips...there are two girls that I'm sort of friends with, and the have a book deal to write about twenty- something Park Avenue debutantes. I think its really shameful and tacky.'\\" Or maybe not so.Lell Pellham is the heiress to one of New York's most famous jewelry stores (think Tiffany's and its ilk). Julia is an assistant at the main store in the engagement ring section when this story begins. However, for some mysterious reason, she is given the all-important task of delivering a set of highly expensive jewels to the famous heiress just moments before she is set to walk down the aisle. Lell and her friends Hope and Polly are impressed with Julia, who has a passion for jewelry design; and Lell immediately hires Julia as her \\"deputy artistic director.\\"Thus begins a contest between the three friends: Lell, who from the beginning is unhappy in her marriage; Hope, who is unhappy because she doesn't have as much money as the others do (though probably the most down-to-earth of the group); and Polly, who enjoys preying upon \\"lesser, more unfortunate\\" people. The three friends set themselves a task: to makeover Julia into a bridge-playing debutante, just like themselves. Eliza Doolittle, as the dust cover of the book pronounces.At first, Julia is flattered- who wouldn't be? Borrowed couture clothing, advice from people who style themselves her \\"friends,\\" and invites to some of the hottest parties and benefits in the city. Of course, all that glitters isn't gold, as the old adage goes, and Julia quickly becomes disenchanted with the lifestyle pretty quickly. Added on top of this is Lell's new husband- Willoughby, or \\"Will,\\" for short. He's a playboy who immediately sets Julia at the top of list of women to woo.In short, this is a witty, novel, perhaps even better than The Right Address, the first endeavor of these two novelists. Karyasov and Kargman give us an intimate picture of the materialistic, superficial lives of the jet-setting women who live on Park Avenue through the eyes of an outsider. And, contrary to what Lell says, that endeavor is not \\"shameful and tacky.\\""},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"If you've ever longed to peek into the world of New York society princesses, then WOLVES IN CHIC CLOTHING is definitely a book you'll want to pick up.Julia Pearce is a beautiful, hip, but middle class salesgirl at Pelham's Jewelry, one of the top jewelry stores in the world.

This chic lit topic of \\"Mean Girls\\" hasn't been overused in other books so I guess that's why I liked it. I was getting sick of breakup stories and \\"trying to find myself\\" fiction. I highly recommend this!"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Sometimes I feel the world moves too fast for me. Honestly, it seems like just yesterday I was one of the last voracious-reading, Vogue-subscribing women to discover Chick Lit. It was Sophie Kinsella's Shopaholic series that changed me from a critic of the genre to a fan, although I guess we could really trace it the whole way back to Helen Fielding and her every woman's hero, Bridget Jones. But I digress. From Kinsella I zoomed on to Weiner and Wolf, Keyes and Zigman, spending an entire summer month flitting from one book to the next. I even came out of the closet and reviewed several Chick Lit books for a local newspaper, declaring my love for this previously forbidden (in my eyes) fruit.Suddenly, Chick Lit has taken a back burner to the latest media darling --- Gossip Lit. In a way, it started with Shopaholic Becky Bloomwood's penchant for fashion; the pages dripped with names from both magazine and runway. And who can forget Weiner's Maggie and her addiction to Manolos? THE NANNY DIARIES came next and started naming not just designers, but the doyennes of the Upper East Side who couldn't be bothered with mothering the heirs they were forced to bear. (Some City residents at the time swore they knew who the real Mrs. X was.) THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA and its loosely veiled Anna Wintour trash-fest upped the ante, and now the people we read about in the pages of Vogue were actually showing up in fiction --- never directly outed, mind you, but I'm sure that armed with the vivid descriptions the books provided, it was all too easy for those in the know to know who was being, you know, trashed.Enter Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman. They are the co-authors of last year's fun read, THE RIGHT ADDRESS. This spring they are back with WOLVES IN CHIC CLOTHING, Gossip Lit at its best. The plot is fairly straightforward. Meet Julia, a transplant from California with aspirations of becoming a jewelry designer. Upon her arrival in the Big Apple a year earlier, she landed a plummy job at Pelham Jewelers (umm, can you say Tiffany's), scores a cool apartment in a trendy neighborhood with Douglas, her totally fabulous gay co-worker, and there you have it --- life is just GRAND for Julia.Meet Lell Pelham, heiress of Pelham's, New York Socialite, leader of a small pack of \\"twenty-something Park Avenue debutantes\\" just like her (well, not as rich, but in terms of hair and clothes, almost carbon copies) who is about to marry, according to her mother and the rest of New York, the perfect man --- Willoughby Banks, a man with a roving eye, not just for other women but also for Lell's checkbook. He has the Mayflower breeding, but unfortunately for Will, he's never had the money...until now.Fate throws Julia into the wolf den when she is summoned to Lell's wedding to assist with last-minute jewelry adjustments. In a nanosecond she transforms the traditional Pelham's necklaces she has delivered into something completely new and trendy that catches the attention of her boss, Lell. Upon her return from a three-week honeymoon (during which the happy couple becomes very unhappily bored), she makes Julia her assistant as well as her new winter project. Because Julia's last name is also that of a well-to-do glass blowing family in Vermont, these ladies who lunch think they have another heiress in their midst. Unbeknownst to Lell, her incredibly shallow, always caustic friend, Polly, has made the same Pygmalion decision that sets Julia up like \\"an accidental pawn in...a sidewalk sized game of chess.\\"Julia goes from shop girl to chi-chi overnight, but discovers that the golden life of the city's young cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me isn't as wonderful as it looks. Lell's quartet immediately starts telling her what to eat (Salades Folles) and what not (cheeseburgers --- \\"There's nothing worse than being fat\\" declares Polly), which nail polish to use (Ballet Slippers, NOT Wicked) and why she needs to lose her anklet. They also begin to ensure that she receives invitations to all the must-be-seen-at charity events around town. In this arena, Karasyov and Kargman have come up with some pretty funny acronyms such as the benefit dinner for FADD (Fight Attention Deficit Disorder) and the GROG ball (Get Rid of Gangrene).Julia's life is not the only metamorphosis. Lell reconnects with a man she has been in and out of love with for years, but who she rejected for marriage --- or did she? Her husband's eye already has wandered and where it has come to rest, I can't divulge without ruining the surprise. Hope questions the cost and benefits of the New York lifestyle she and her husband are going broke trying to lead (most of these charity dinners have tickets that start at $300 a person and lunch with the girls usually runs $95). Polly, despite having a talent and taste for stirring up trouble, begins to wonder how much she really needs her deadweight of a husband and starts to see that she is repeating a parenting pattern begun by her own mother who, living in France with her latest husband and two children, has no time for her as a daughter and gives her very little regard even as a social contact.Don't worry, though. These storylines are still set against a dazzling backdrop of beautiful people, gorgeous city settings, exquisite clothes, and a society world that, while fun to watch, most of us will never step foot in --- which isn't necessarily a bad thing!The co-authors take a little jab at themselves on page 51, when Lell Pelham denounces Gossip Lit as \\"really shameful and tacky.\\" There are also some brief appearances by the villains of THE RIGHT ADDRESS --- Joan Coddington and Wendy Marshal --- that are fun to spot. This being Gossip Lit, one doesn't have to worry about a neatly tied, somewhat happy ending. That's guaranteed for the sympathetic characters who come off as strong individuals, and definitely not for the ones we love to hate. There is, however, an interesting taking-stock syndrome that we see traveling amongst the key players like the very diseases they throw benefits to combat. One wonders if this also is happening to the real-life society faces we see every month on the party page. One can hope.--- Reviewed by Jamie Layton"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Julia Pearce, a hip, downtown salesgirl at Pelham's jewelry store, finds her social life turned on its head when she is asked to deliver a necklace to the store's young heiress, Lell Pelham, on Lell's wedding day.

With \\"Wolves in Chic Clothing\\" by Carrie Karasyov and Jill Kargman, it's a jewelry heiress named Lell Pelham of Pelham Jewelers who decides to take the hip, beautiful but offbeat Julia under her wings.It begins innocently enough. First Julia gets to deliver Lell's engagement ring to her, then Lell decides to promote Julia to be her assistant in a new department of the store. Soon Julia is thrust into parties, makeovers, and society events. Lell's rich and mostly stuck-up friends, who are not without problems of their own, also take Julia under her wing, but not without some cattiness. But when Lell's husband and Julia realize they are extremely attracted to each other, things begin spinning out of control. What will happen if Lell catches them?This book had all the makings of a good novel, but unfortunately it just didn't come together as an intriguing and solid read. Although it was fun to read about heiresses and the super-rich doing all the things they do, the story lacked any type of substance and crucial plot elements. The authors also refer to themselves at one point in the book (although they hide their names) which I thought was ridiculous. The characters were wooden and very unrealistic. I know this was supposed to be a light, gossipy read, but this just went way overboard and frankly, insulted the reader's intelligence. If I had to sum up this book in one word, unfortunately it would be \\"boring\\".The things I did enjoy in the book was reading about the situations and problems that Lell's circle of friends were going through. They were interesting and made an otherwise awful book a little more readable.Overall I don't recommend wasting your money on this book until it's published in soft cover. So much more could have done with the plot and characters, and wasn't.Please note: this is a reposting of an earlier review. I have read this book for a second time and felt a need to revise the original review."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"If you are looking for a book that will take your mind off work or something stressful going on in your life, then read this book. I thought it was fun and light. Chic lit is very popular right now and this book hits the nail on that head! It's good to see that Julia Pearce was going to walk away from the wolves but the ending is somewhat predictable. Otherwise, good summer reading."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"Yikes! I usually like chic-lit now and then, especially when it takes place in NYC....but this was just a waste. It was very immature, and badly written. The plot was all over the place, the characters were foolish and it was hardly humorous. I much prefer chic-lit writing that is witty, and perhaps makes a little sense!"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"I found the main character, Julia, hard to sympathize with. She had no backbone and was chasing her boss' husband. When she got fired for it, why all the shock? Not a very likeable character. Ending up with Oscar was too convenient to be believable. Disapointing."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"I've read other books that fall into this chick lit sub-category (Bergdorf Blondes, etc) and found that there is a thin line between love and hate of the uber-rich who star in these stories. The protagonist usually is someone who is not \\"born\\" into the lifestyle, so we can usually side with her. However, if the protagonist is just completely clueless, well, do we have to? In this story, a group of heiresses decide to take Julia Pearce, a salesgirl, under their wing...until something better comes along to distract them at least. Julia, who was supposed to be so \\"down to earth\\" doesn't bat an eyelash when her new \\"friends\\" get her a promotion, a makeover, and a fake pedigree. Add in some more stock characters (like the token gay best friend) and you've got the bulk of the story. Can anyone else see how this will end? Sure, chick-lit can be formulaic sometimes, but come on here ladies!"},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"The best of funny New York Chick Lit.

Julia Pierce, a beautiful saleswoman has been asked to deliver the infamous \\"Pelham necklaces\\" for Lell's wedding. Julia is shocked to learn that Lell has even noticed her, and never would she guess that \\"Lell would notice her\\". Lell is intrigued by Julia, who although beautiful would be the perfect person to morph into the social butterfly of the century....she would be responsible for taking someone from another class, but all the classic looks and changing her to fit what her idea of \\"perfect\\" is. Lell is joined in her attempts by Polly who is equally as manipulative as her friend. Julia, caught up in the excitement of a new job, new friends, new clothes, and fantastic opportunities finds herself slowly changing into someone that she never thought that she would (she feels attracted to Lell's new husband Will, who is pursuing her because Lell has started cheating on him, right after the honeymoon). There are extremely entertaining and interesting characters in this novel.Lell Pelham, heiress to a jewelry company, works hard to please her father while hating her mother. She knows that her father is unfaithful whenever possible, but relishes in the fact that he trusts her to run the family business. However, she too is fighting demons of (1) not letting anyone to close, even her husband. (2) Using money to keep people under her control. And (3) wants what she can not have.Polly, who we hate, but soon understands, is in a marriage (for convenience only); has a child (to beat Lell to the punch); has a husband who drinks and ignores her (and seems to have a secret); gossips non-stop, as well as starts trouble within the group and struggles with her relationship with her mother (who doesn't seem to want to acknowledge her existence)- seems to find out what is really important in life, after it is too late.Will, married to a woman who can give him everything that he wants materially, but she won't give him what he wants the most her heart. And I think that Will realizes that sometimes selling your soul won't bring you happiness.Oscar, the sweet misfit of the group, just doesn't understand the long conversations about fashion or what \\"dumb\\" benefit that everyone wants to attend, just for the sake of attendingHolly, the friend of Lell and Polly who seems the most down to earth. She is married to a wonderful man, and has two wonderful boys, and for a minute questions \\"what if\\"? But in the end,knows what things are important and clings to that.I really enjoyed this novel and would like to read another. I thought that it was whitty, and although I initially thought that I would never like a book that discussed this kind of topic, it was refreshing."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend after she gave it a great review. I was hopeful at the beginning, but the book dragged on and I had to force myself to finish it. It was very immature, poorly written, and the plot was all over the place. By the middle of the book you knew what was going to happen, and I couldn't wait to finish it. Not worth the time or money.. skip this one and read an original not set in NYC Chick Lit Book."},{"Title":"Wolves in Chic Clothing","review":"The book portrays a glimpse of the pretentious life ofNY socilites: attending luxurious gala for benefits, backstabbing, gossip, looking for drama since bored with life.

I recentley saw it in my local library and I decided to check it out before buying it. I usually enjoy the author's work-but I did not enjoy this book at all.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Funny Bone: An Orthopaedist's Tale","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Dr. Newman was a wonderful storyteller and had quite a sense of humor. Sometimes I chuckled out loud, and some parts were sad, even bringing me to tears. Through all the experiences that he wrote about, Dr. Newman came through as the moral, caring doctor that he must have been. All in all a very entertaining book and a tribute to a doctor that had the old fashioned view that the patient came first."},{"Title":"Funny Bone: An Orthopaedist's Tale","review":"Dr. Philip Newman has written a fascinating, funny, sometimesshockingly revealing memoir of his experiences with medicalschool, internship, residency, medical practice, patients,insurance companies, and much more. The presence of humor is oneof the many outstanding differences between this book and themany others I have read on these subjects. In fact, Dr. Newman'swriting shows him to be a master of dialog and humor."},{"Title":"Funny Bone: An Orthopaedist's Tale","review":"This book was enlightening, touching, and funny all at the same time. I could not put it down, as I read the story of Philip Newman's path from the small immigrant apartment in Brooklyn to a lifetime as a beloved and talented physician. Though he desn't talk much about his family life, I could tell that he was an exemplary husband, son, and father from his caring, warmth, straight-talking,and good humor. His apologies about not being there for his children don't ring true. The epilogue by his children brought me to tears, and I could tell that Philip Newman was a one-in-a million wonderful person."},{"Title":"Funny Bone: An Orthopaedist's Tale","review":"So, I thought the entire book would be as funny as the beginning stories. I could read how this Doctor cared about his patients and his family. It gave me a wonderful insight about becoming a doctor a few decades ago.

As such, he writes from a logical, investigative stand-point. He does not glorify, conspiricize or add to the bizarre aura surrounding these crimes.Mr. Rumbelow begins and ends with the facts of the case. He gives a terrific background to conditions in Whitechapel in the 1880s, very important to understanding the crimes. He has gone through police files to pull out the actual records and facts recorded at the time of the records, and he goes through the main suspects and gives the pros and cons of each suspect.Donald Rumbelow also tries to put to rest some of the conspiracies that surround the case (eg. it was not unusual for the police to destroy records as they were not routinely saved until well into the 20th century). Mr. Rumbelow also puts into perspective forensic science at the time of these murders, for example finger print evidence was only admitted into legal proceedings and became common place 20 years later. All of this helps us understand some of the reasons that Jack the Ripper was never caught (at least as the Ripper) and why he has not been definitely identified over 100 years later.The book is a bit out of date, however it still has a lot of good information - especially concerning the realities of police work and conditions in the East End in the 1880s. I would strongly recommend this book as a good starting place for anyone interested in reading about the Ripper killings. However be forewarned, these are brutal murders described fairly graphically with some photos of the victims. If you are very squeemish, this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"Mr Rumbelow's book is probably the most entertaining and well-written book available on the Whitechapel crimes yet produced. Although first published in 1975 it still seems fresher than most works on the subject today. Mr Rumbelow recounts many unknown about the Whitechapel/East End area at the time of the murders. Strange and interesting facts such as the local confectioner's of the time selling 'Leather Apron' toffee abound in this volume and makes for a very entertaining read. Mr Rumbelow himself is a police officer of 27 years experience and brings this knowledge to the fore in his examination of the slayings. A natural writer, he keeps the book pacy and fresh, having written previous works on police history/true crime. This book is most recommended, it was revised and reprinted in 1988 by Penguin Publishing and is invaluable to anyone studying the crimes of 'Jack the Ripper'. His examination of the suspects is exemplary and brings human feeling and warmth to the victims of the murderer, something which mo"},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"In all the silliness that has been published about the Ripper killings, this is one of the half-dozen or so books that top the pile. It was the first thorough and truly unbiased attempt to deal with the case in a clear-headed investigative manner. It also inspired much of the research that has led to new and enlightening discoveries in the 25 years since it was first published. Other reader reviews that criticize Rumbelow forget that some of what is now publicly known was not available in 1975. The Sugden book is more up to date, but for many years this was the be-all and end-all book for Ripperologists. It is still worth reading, especially for dedicated students of the subject. The opening section on the horrors of life in Victorian Whiechapel is still a remarkable bit of writing, and the approach to the evidence is clear and extremely well-organized."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"Donald Rumbelow has an excellent writing style and this is an easy to read and understand book. In particular, he does a great job of helping the reader understand the conditions in London's east end during this time of the old city's history. He also gives the reader a complete understanding of the limitations faced by police in the late 1800's. If no one saw the killer commit the crime, it was almost impossible to make an arrest.This is a fairly short book as compared to other ripper books but there is a wealth of information. This would be an excellent book for someone just getting interested in the ripper for it is more of an introduction to the case than anything else. Rumbelow never really makes any attempt to solve the case. Instead he spends a lot of time showing the faults in other ripper writer's theroies. I think it was Sherlock Holmes who said that if you get rid of all the things that were impossible, what was left was the answer, no matter how improbable. I think that may be what Rumbelow is up to.Truth be known, the section I enjoyed most was the chapter called \\"Beyond the Grave\\", which deals with ripper like killers who followed Jack. The Yorkshire and Dusseldorf rippers and Jack the Stripper for example. Their cases are not only highly interesting but also prove that the shadow of Jack the Ripper will be hanging over us for a long time."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"Thsi book is definitely a dark ride, and may also keep you up nights (esp. if you're licky enough to be reading in a creepy hotel in London, as I did). I have a copy signed by the author, who gives Jack the Ripper walking tours in London. He is an articulate and intelligent man, and so is his book, dismissing far-fetched conspiracies in favor of where the facts actually lead. An inthralling and chilling read."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"I just returned from London and attended Donald Rumbelow's &quot;Ripper Walk&quot; (on 20 May 04) and Donald has just revised his book.

I loaned it out and it never came back. This is the definitive Jack the Ripper book."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"Donald Rumbelow, as a Scotland Yard Detective, provides a grim, realistic study of the Ripper Case, even down to studying such vague connections as Ellery Queen fictional work concerning it.He was permitted access to records that are still sealed, and was shocked to find how little of the records survived. He was also able to put back the death bed picture of Mary Kelly.The only fault I find is in his analysis of the suspects. He seemed to rigid and not willing to look into this with any real depth.Overall, a must for any ripperologist!!"},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"This book is a great start for someone interested in Ripperology! Although there have been theories born since the first edition of this book, Rumbelow's theories and information are complete for its time. Rumbelow's clearly presents the facts and information. He also clearly discounts other theories with facts as well. It is a cleanly written book and a suprisingly fast read. Black and White photos are included. Rumbelow never clearly states who he believes the Ripper was, but it is evident &quot;between the lines&quot;. Read it and see for yourself. I think you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"This book contains the most thorough coverage of all possible aspects of the Ripper crimes. I couldn't put it down. Fascinating!"},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"I actually got to meet and discuss the murders with Mr. Rumbelow on a trip to London last summer, and it's not hard to see why he is considered by many well-thought-of historians and many of Hollywood's elite as the Official Jack The Ripper Historical Expert. For instance, he not only has an amazing amount of knowledge regarding details of the Ripper Case, but he was also a historical consultant for the 2002 film &quot;From Hell&quot;, the most accurate Ripper film, to date. In this book, he paints a bleak yet comprehensive portrait of the case that has baffled historians and case-solvers, alike, for the past century. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"This book is the best I have read on this subject. On my last trip to London I actually went on a tour with the author Donald Rumbelow. I bought the book from Donald at the end of the tour and he autographed it for me. Donald leads a London &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; walk that far surpasses any other guided tour of any sort that I have ever been on. He knows his stuff, as you can see by reading the book. Donald is the Curator of the Police Crime Museum and a former Scotland Yard Detective. Anytime I go to London, which is about every couple of years, I have to go on a &quot;Ripper&quot; tour with Donald. Travel guides like Fodor's, Frommers, Eyewitness etc recommend the expert walking tour and his crime book. Donald's walking company site is &quot;london.walks.com&quot;."},{"Title":"The complete Jack the Ripper","review":"Rumbelow did not do his homework completely. If he had done so, he would have discussed the American, Tumbletry, who was the subect of intense investigation by Scotland Yard before he fled back to the U.S. The American papers of 1888 were full of speculation about him, and the Yard followed him here.

You may be suffering from this disorder. I am reading The Psychology of Missionary Adjustment. It's a sobering book, in which almost all of the case studies that are presented are of real missionaries who were abject failures in their endeavors. This book was overall a disappointment as most of the case studies ended in failure. It was all full of jargon and high-sounding terms that confuse the average reader. Find something else positive about missions before picking up this depressing volume."},{"Title":"The art of Peter Max","review":"First off I want to correct the often repeated false statement in a previous review: Heinz Edelman was the artist behind The Beatles Yellow Submarine, Peter Max had absolutely nothing to do with it, and was in no way the inspiration behind it. Edelman was already doing Yellow Sub style art before Max's style became famous. For the complete background read \\"Inside the Yellow Submarine\\".That said, this is a wonderful, long over due collection of the art of Peter Max. I don't think this book could have been printed any better, it is stunning. For me, the only thing that could make it better would be to add even more pages of art. The classic 60s-70s period gets the short end of the stick being overshadowed by the newer works. It is all beautiful work either way, but my preference would have been for more of the older pieces.People will be magnetically drawn to this sitting on your coffee table. This is also a great companion to \\"The Art of Rock\\" the 2-ton book of classic old Fillmore concert posters that was out about 15 years ago. They don't make art like this anymore...unfortunately."},{"Title":"The art of Peter Max","review":"This edition I had was printed in Japan, notwithstanding the quality of the prints, pages and the cover were stunning!Unfortunately I was hoping for more of Peter Max's psychedelic artwork & merchandise which he was most remembered for, as the book featured most his more recent paintings and his penchant for the Statue of Liberty & American icons. In fact I bought the book as a reference for 60s color scheme & rock posters but retro artwork added up to abt 30 odd pages out of the 240...I'm thinking contemporary fine-art artists/lovers might take to this book with more enthusiasm than illustrators or graphic designers, despite this, the book still manages to inspire me with Max's whimsical use of paint colors and his contribution to society."},{"Title":"The art of Peter Max","review":"Everyone knows the genius of Peter Max and the fun of his art. I won't presume to review either. Instead, let's talk about the book! Beautiful printing on quality paper.

She'll cherish this book for years to come. If you are a Max fan, so will you. As all coffee table books are, a bit pricey but an excellent work to enjoy again and again!"},{"Title":"The art of Peter Max","review":"Peter Max's influence was strongest in the 1960's when his style influenced everything from the Pop generation look to the Beatles film, \\"The Yellow Submarine.\\" I became most of aware of Max's work as a resident of New York City after 9/11, when streetpost banners with his art tout the city's great landmarks, such as Lincoln Center and the Empire State Building.This book is the first published collection I've seen, save for a couple of European books and one he did in 1976, that shows the breadth of his work. The son of immigrant parents, Max's later work seems to be most strongly associated with his renditions of American icons, such as the Statue of Liberty and the American flag. Some of his work, such as his Amazon-influenced \\"Better World\\" series, is stunning. Other work, such as Umbrella Man and Zero don't appeal to me quite as much. Back in the 60's, I think he was known mostly for his bold colors and psychadelic images. But environmentalism plays a bigger role in his late 80s and 90s work. His posters for the Rainforest Foundation and 1992 Earth Summit are stunning examples of this.There's never been anyone quite like Peter Max, for better or for worse. I'd highly recommend this book to even casual fans as the reproductions are beautifully done and the vibrant colors leap off the page.

I was in Williamsburg, and looked at the other costume books available there. This is the least expensive, and therefore does not go into the depths of the much more expensive, larger books. But in itself it is sufficient to give a very good overview of the period. The pictures of original clothes in this book also appear in the other books, along with some others, but the additional pictures do not really add that much to what is in this book, and would cost an additional $55 in cost."},{"Title":"EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY CLOTHING AT WILLIAMSBURG.","review":"This small booklet has some interesting prints of colorful clothing of men, women, and children dress(and underwear)from the colonial period of America.

I read it when I was 11, and now at 14 I still love reading it over and over.

I learned some history from it, and was impressed by Annie's heroism and selfless service, as well as those she worked with. I think I may have kept going back to it, though, because I found the ending unsatisfactory. I still felt lost and restless, like Annie could never have real peace and a place of her own again.The characters are well portrayed, the battles and storyline are clear and easy to follow, and Annie's emotions and decisions are relateable. I appreciated the humanness of it all. The story inspired me to do more research on the Civil War and the people involved in it."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"It's a really good book and I found it to be interesting.It's a very dramatic book and gave me alot of details to better help me understand what it must of been like to be of that time in history."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"This book was a good book because it had details about the character my favirote part was when Annie and Sarah whent into a fancy house with all diffrent kinds of rich things.

My favorite character was Will because he is a funny character and he does different things in the book . A history reader should read this book because it might be interesting for that reader like me I like to read about history."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"I gave the book Gentle Annie four stars. I gave it a four because it was a wonderful and delightful book to read. It was a great book to read if you a person that likes books that make you feel happy, sad, and depressed all in a 184 page book. I defintly think that if your that sort of person then you will love the book Gentle Annie. I believe that it was a good way for me to learn about the Civil War.In this book you are led through the time line of the Civil War by a genle and loving nurse named Annie Etheridge. Annie makes friend and loses friends. She has happy moments and sad moments.I am in fifth grade and I loved this book. But I think that this would be good for all ages. Besides, what is wrong with being 100 and having some good historical fiction to read. I gave the book Gentle Annie a pretty good rating. It is even in my top 20 favorite books.

It tells of her whole life, starting from a happy 10 year old. She had to grow up heartbreakingly fast when her father became ill. She baked and sold bread and worked as a nurse. When her father died, and her marriage failed, she got a job as a nurse. Then she joined the army, to do what she loved- be a nurse. Of the 20 girls she was recruited with, Annie as the only one left when they went to war. She braved death in the face, caring for soldiers of both armies. She worked among the blood and gunpowder and death, but never once lost her goodness. At the end of the war, she received a medal for bravery."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"&quot;Gentle Annie&quot; is the best biography that I've ever read!

I loved this book."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"I liked the book because of the intensity of the setting with the bloody and brutal battles. They explain how bad the wounds were on the soldiers so well that I could almost see them in my mind when I read. When she was just seventeen she was as a nurse. She was ready to serve her country. Annie is very interested in history and what is happening around the world. She was a strong, independent girl that wanted to be treated like a soldier and be in the front lines of the war. I would rate this book from a scale 1 - 10 an 8 because it leaves us hanging at the end a little. I suggest this book to 4th - 6th graders that like the Civil War."},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"I think that the book Gentle Annie is a very good book! I like how the author explains Annie's character. I also thought that the news about Frank was very shocking! I did think the author left us hanging at the end. I like how the book is historical fiction, but it is based on a girl named Anna B. Etheridge. I think this book on a 1 to 10 scale would be an 8. There are more settings in this book, but the main setting is in Alexandria, Virginia. Annie reminds me of Clara Barton because she was a civil war nurse for the union, and so is Annie. I think this book is good for people who love reading about the Civil War. I also think that this book is good for teachers. If teachers want an interesting book to share with their class this is the right book. This book might be a little hard for some students. I like this book for 2 reasons. First, I love reading! Second, I am very interested in civil war books. When Annie was with the troops she was happy. She always marched in the front line with the soldiers. When a soldier was wounded or died she always cried. I wonder if there are anymore biographies about Anna B. Etheridge. I would really like to read more about her!THIS BOOK IS COOL!"},{"Title":"Gentle Annie: The True Story of a Civil War Nurse","review":"Someone should read this book because it is exciting and a fun adventure. Someone should not read this book if they don't like adventures and excitement in a story.This book was a pretty good book that is why I rated it a 4.It was not an awesome book because it got boring and I wanted to put it down at times, but I did not because I was determined to get done and finish the book so I kept on reading.

Despite these often depressing topics, West's characters have a sense of personal dignity that brings them through the oddest and most difficult situations.Readable, interesting and compelling.

Twin sisters with long unpronouncable names, but \\"Cannie\\" and \\"Cantie\\" for short, are left to make a journey by themselves. Their Mother has planned everything out for them and made all the preparations, but is not home when the girls get dressed and take everything with them that their Mom had chosen for them. Cannie, who has the same dissappointments and doubts that Cantie does, follows her Mother's choices beleiving that she must know best; Cantie is more concerned with how she looks than how well prepared she is, and so makes her own choices. The journey gets underway and the reasons for each choice become clear as the day unfolds.A wonderful moral story that is truly a classic, as fresh today as when it was written. The perfect thing to read to children who \\"have their moods\\" and a treasure to pass down from mother to daughter to great granddaughter.

Even if you have felt confused before in reading through card game rules, this book is an excellent introduction to playing card games. It goes over everything that happens in the game, from the rules, to strategy and tips, to history of the game-a fascinating book.Because it goes in-depth into each of the games, you will not find one place in the chapter that has a concise list of the rules.

Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led (the suit of the first card played) picks up all the cards played. The person who wins the trick leads anything he likes from his remaining cards to the next trick, and the process repeats itself until all the cards have been played.&quot;I simply could not understand this paragraph no matter how many times I read it, until I consulted a friend good at Hearts. This is typical of the arcane writing throughout this book. It's simply not easy for a dummies. In fact my friend was totally lost when he read this paragraph.

Making a movie, even a short or a mediocre one is VERY hard work. Your movie may suck. If you don't spend time and effort on the story, it most likely will. How will you sell/market it? There are movies with stars that can't find distribution so your independant movie with no stars better be damn good. I work in computer animation, and digital is not the solution to all problems like some of these books profess (although it can be a big help in many aspects). Film still looks better and is easier to light. Becker approaches filmmaking with a straightforward no-bs atitude. He has a chip on his shoulder when it comes to Hollywood and the state of recent movies, which according to him have been in a slump since the late '70s. Even if you disagree with him his rants are entertaining and well informed. He just wants to see better movies like all of us. If you want a touchy feely book that says you are special, all your ideas are wonderful and you will inevitably succeed, look elsewhere. If you want a realistic perspective and useful info on the entire film production process, buy his book. It doesn't have the whole puzzle but it has a lot of the pieces."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Low-Budget Feature Filmmaking","review":"Josh Beck has a down to earth realistic style to his writing. He doesn't fill you with crap, about how easy it is to make a movie. This is the Third book I've read on film making. His writing style is of the true artist. He's honest and tells you straight up, what it actually takes to make a movie. I've read A Rebel with out a crew first. Which was a fun read, but it didn't say how to make a movie. Josh, gives real advise and his bit on how to deal with actors is great. He has a direct approach to making movies and follows some very strict guidelines about budgeting. Which makes sense if you're paying for your own movie. He covers vast amounts of information in his book. He covers editing, cost of film, production, post production and much more. He even was nice enough to explain what the job titles are and who does what and why. But he get angry if you even mention the kelvin scale. Telling us to go look it up. A paragraph could have covered that. But he's right look it up. It's complicated. Or take my approach purchase a reader and plug the numbers in. Saves you time and hassle. Or check it out on wikipedia.\\"The kelvin is often used in the measure of the color temperature of light sources. Color temperature is based upon the principle that a black body radiator emits light whose color depends on the temperature of the radiator. Black bodies with temperatures below about 4000 K appear reddish whereas those above about 7500 K appear bluish. Color temperature is important in the fields of image projection and photography where a color temperature of approximately 5600 K is required to match \\"daylight\\" film emulsions. In astronomy, the stellar classification of stars and their place on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram are based, in part, upon their surface temperature, known as effective temperature. The photosphere of the Sun, for instance, has an effective temperature of 5778 K.\\"- wikipediaHe uses his own movies as examples and a few others. Make sure to rent his movies so you understand what he is talking about. But even if you don't watch his movies it's still easy to understand what he is talking about when it comes to transitions and editing techniques. Though, this book may discourage a few people from going into the movie business; since the cost of film is outrageous. About 100 grand for a 90 min movie. The book felt a little dated since he didn't cover anything about new technology such as how most studios use final cut pro and convert their film to digital. But I do believe he is correct in stating that shooting on film is higher quality than any digital camera you might posses. He explains the types of film for camera and the cost and the trouble of not using the best film available. Overall, its a good book to purchase if you want a real taste of what it takes to make a movie. I have never made a movie but would like to someday. So reading and thinking like Josh is the first step.The quality of the paper and the book overall is poor. The paper is a gray and the ink was light. So if you have bad eyes it could be troublesome. The design on the book is clutter. The sketches in the book are fine, they get the message across, but could have been improved. At times the book can be a touch reminiscent on areas of people he didn't like or fired. But no names were mentioned and since this was his personal experience its only normals to have a few examples of people you hired don't perform. Though, I felt that how to fire someone wasn't necessary.If you don't know anything about film or movies this is a must read. It will make you appreciate the art of film making and the hard work it takes to produce a quality movie. Thanks Josh for the book. I'll look forward to seeing your next movie.Please forgive the writing errors.

The book's like having an ideal big brother take you aside and give you the low down. Out of the several books I've read, this offered the most practical and solid advice - not surprising, since Becker's actually directed four independent films, along with some TV shows.

The unity of the Trinity is the focus of many books and studies, as are the roles of the Son and Holy Spirt, but seeing the three persons of the Trinity in relationship to each other is unusual. Very helpful."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Bruce Ware's 'Father Son and Holy Spirit' is no more about the Trinity that 'Animal Farm' is a book about agriculture, despite the ostensible topic. And so I was sad to see that another reviewer commented that this was the best book he had ever read on that topic. What a sorrow in the Evangelical church if this is the best we have to offer on the Triune God.I too was really excited to read this book (which I special ordered), but Ware's book is in fact not a book about the Trinity; it is a book about authority and submission: in the home, in the church, and in every relationship. If you are hesitant (he uses the word 'resist') about male-only eldership he calls it 'sinful'. He talks about how the submission of wives and church members is to be 'absolute', 'always longing to do just what is asked or commanded of them'. Ware believes that everyone who works in the church is to give honor to the senior pastor who has 'granted them the privilege and the training for their particular ministry'. And he allows no space for alternate views because, for Ware, these relationships are direct reflections of what the way that he (wrongly) conceives of the Son as eternally subordinate to the Father, both before and after his incarnation.I agree with Ware that role inequality does not logically entail value inequality, but Ware abandons all mediating positions and pushes right through to the extreme. I have not counted, but I would guess that the word 'authority' or 'submission' is on 90% of the pages of this book. It is not a book about the Trinity, it is a book that uses the Trinity as an outline to write a book reinforcing traditional authority roles in home, church, workplace, and world.Ware's own sentence on p 97 sums up his own book best: 'By this, the Son is shown to be under the Father, but over the Spirit.' And therefore the wife or church member or worker is under the absolute authority of their male only leader in a way that cannot be questioned or challenged without sin. That is what this book is about. I would recommend as a contrast Kevin Giles' book 'Jesus and the Father'.Jesus and the Father: Modern Evangelicals Reinvent the Doctrine of the TrinityAnother book on the same topic (that is, family relations and the Trinity) that I enjoyed a lot more (except the chapter on Mary and the HS that he presents with at least a caveat that he might be mistaken on the point, which I think he is) is Scott Hahn's 'First Comes Love'.First Comes Love: Finding Your Family in the Church and the TrinityWare's 'Father Son and Holy Spirit' broke my heart because I had hoped for such good.As an alternative to Ware, one of the best books I have ever read on the Trinity is 'Mutuality' by Mary Prokes.Mutuality: The Human Image of Trinitarian Love"},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"What can be more foundational to the Christian Faith than the essence of our God? The author begins with chapters on the importance of the topic and a historical overview before spending one chapter on each person of the Godhead, and then sums up everything in a sixth chapter. The chapters on the Father, Son, and Spirit discuss how the person focused on in that chapter relates/interacts with the other two members of the Godhead.There are at least two commendable things about the book. One is its \\"readability\\". The author takes such a complex topic and writes very simply. The information is also arranged so systematically that it is easy to follow and outline.

Are we AWARE of just how crucial this doctrine is to all else we believe as Christians?\\" (p. 16).If God were a single person (as the Jews and Muslims believe)--if God were not \\"Triune,\\" a perfect triplicate--then we would stand to lose the doctrines of Adam and Eve and the Talking Snake; Noah's Ark and the Curse on Negroes; Balaam and the Talking donkey; the Star of Bethlehem; the Essential Inferiority of Women; the Rapture of Christians Up to the Sky; and the all-important doctrine that Everyone Except Us will Suffer Unspeakable Torments Forever in Hell, After Death.Here, then, is the essence of the Trinity, as B.A.Ware explains it: Yahweh the Father is holy. He cannot forgive your sins (e.g., your Sabbath-breaking and cursing and masturbation) unless someone first gets crucified for what you said and did. And it might as well be His Son, Jesus, who gets nailed instead of you! (I mean, just watch Mel Gibson's movie, _The Passion of the Christ_, or at least read my Amazon review of the film. Then look into the mirror and ask yourself: \\"Would I rather have God the Father do that to Jesus on a Friday two thousand years ago, or would I rather have Him do it to me for all eternity after I'm dead?\\" --Come on, be honest!)To be saved from Hell, you don't have to \\"like\\" the holy Trinity; you just need to FEAR Them, as the Bible reminds us in Deut. 6:2; Deut. 6:13; Deut. 6:24, and in roughly every tenth verse, right through to the Apocalypse: \\"Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of His judgment is come\\" (Rev. 14:7).But as B. A. Ware argues, it's also good thing if you actually do LIKE the Trinity. If you like at least one of Him, that can be a definite plus toward escaping the judgment of eternal damnation.Today, if we were to take a vote among born-again Christians which member of the Trinity they like best - Father, Son, or holy Ghost - and even if we allowed the Virgin Mary as a write-in candidate, Jesus would win by a landslide. This is especially true in America, where the Son enjoys a huge and growing base of popular support. There is even a powerful new movement afoot in America to rename the nation \\"the United States of Jesusland,\\" in recognition that the world's greatest democracy was founded by evangelical Christians such as Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, and George Washington - unlike, say, Australia, which was founded by banished criminals; or Britain, which was founded by naked tree-worshiping Celts who painted themselves blue and threw rocks at the troops of Julius Caesar.Jesus, hands down, is also my own personal favourite. Long ago--before the Creation, before he came down to Earth to be punished for your sins--Jesus was one of the kindest, quietest, most courteous deities you'd ever choose to worship (Ware, chap. 4). To this day, I can still imagine myself having lunch, or a drink, with the Son of God. There are days when I would rather have a beer with Jesus Christ than with Beelzebub and Belial, my two best friends. But when the Son comes again, at the so-called \\"Rapture,\\" there will be no more Mr. Nice Guy. When \\"Jesus returneth in power and glory,\\" there will be scores to settle, and Hell to pay (Mark 13:26).The Ghost is less chatty than the other two, and harder to describe. He is more like a Force than like an actual person (Ware, chap. 5). We angels in Heaven used to have a saying, May the Ghost be with you! But I never really figured him out. If you want something from God, you should say, \\"Dear Father,\\" or \\"Dear Jesus.\\" Don't bother with, \\"Dear holy Ghost.\\" The Ghost is the Trinity's most aloof personality. He is not really someone you can to talk to, or ask for favours. In North America they don't even call him by his real name any more. At an 1895 conference of American Bible translators, it was voted, 127 to 96, that \\"holy Ghost,\\" though literal, sounds \\"a little too Gothic\\" for modern readers. English translations from the American Standard Version (1901) through the New International Version (1973) have therefore switched over to calling the holy Ghost, the \\"Holy Spirit.\\"(That's my only complaint about B. A. Ware's fine exegesis: he goes with the flow and calls Person no. 3 the \\"holy Spirit.\\" I personally dislike the innovation. But these big Bible companies are forever changing the text in order to sell new Bibles. Next thing you know, in order to attract more readers to its New International Version, Zondervan Corp, will start calling the holy Trinity: \\"the Father, the Son, and the Very Good Feeling.\\")The holy Ghost still has the charismatics squarely in his corner. A \\"charismatic\\" Christian is one who has been \\"filled,\\" not with charisma, exactly, but \\"with the holy Ghost,\\" and who therefore has a special ability to \\"speak in tongues\\" and to \\"believe in the miracles on TBN television.\\" If the divine election were held today, I might even vote for the Ghost myself. I don't know him as well as I know Jesus, but of the divine threesome, it is the Ghost who is usually pounding lumps on the fewest people at any given moment.Third, but not least, of course, is YAHWEH (Ware, chap. 3). The Jews after all these years still feel a special loyalty to God the Father, which actually amazes me, a little, because their Yahveh-worship has never done them a darn bit of good. (Not to put too fine a point of it, Judaism exhibits the same painful quirk of human psychology as Battered Woman Syndrome.)The corker, for Ware, is that the holy Trinity gets along with Himself so perfectly, without any signs of a dysfunctional relationship: \\"The Father is supreme in authority, the Son is under the Father, the Spirit is under the Father and the Son,\\" and the Virgin Mary is under all three, figuratively speaking, which is how Jesus came to be born, and acquired a perfect human body that he can no longer get rid of. (The other two--the Father and the Ghost--have no body per se, which is one good way to tell them apart from Jesus.) \\"Yet there is also full harmony in their work, with no jealousy, bitterness, strife, or discord\\" (p. 131); which is pretty remarkable, when you think about how long those three have been hanging out together, especially during those pre-Creation days, when the Trinity had absolutely nothing to do for billions of years, except to exist.\\"In order for us sinners to be saved,\\" writes Ware, \\"One must see God at One and the same time as the One judging our sin (the Father), the One making the payment of infinite value for our sin (the divine Son), and the One empowering and directing the incarnate--human--Son so that He lives and obeys the Father, going to the Cross as the Substitute for us (the Holy Spirit). The Christian God, to be Savior, MUST then be Father, Son, and holy Spirit\\" (17). And that is just so true--especially in these Last Days before Armageddon, when the Roman Catholics are still trying to slip a female One in there! But GOD IS NOT A QUARTET! and there is NO WOMAN INVOLVED. Do the math, people! 1+1+1=3/3=1.- L."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"If you're looking for a book to open up the mysteries of the Trinity, that is easily understandable, and doesn't require a lot of thought, good luck. That book doesn't exist. If you want a better understanding of the Trinity that is reverent, worshipful, devotional, and applicable, then this is the book for you.Bruce Ware begins by stating the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity. The doctrine of the Trinity is important because God has revealed Himself as Trinity. If it were not important it would not have been revealed in Scripture. The first chapter also contains ten reasons for focusing on the Trinity.In the second chapter Dr. Ware gives a brief statement concerning the historical and biblical doctrine of the Trinity. As he does this he very aptly defends the historic position of One God, yet Three distinct Persons.Chapters 3, 4, and 5 then focus on each member of the Trinity in their distinctive relationships with each other, distinctive roles within the Godhead, and the relevance of each for mankind. Each of these chapters end with an application of the above stated doctrines.Chapter six now applies the doctrine of the Trinity to our own relationships as we live together in communities (Families, friendships, workplaces, Churches, etc...).I wholeheartedly recommend this book as an introduction into the meaning of the Trinitarian faith. While it is not meant to be a philosophical treatment of the Trinity, there is much here to be learned, and what we learn is given hands and feet, so that we can be doers, and not hearers only."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"This book is about the\\"Relational Trinity\\" an old blatantly polytheistic version of the Trinity. It is getting more popular recently due to God and the Gospel becoming for some more humanistic."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Excellent and in depth commentary on just who God really is. The roles of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit in our lives is thrilling to understand!"},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"If you are a student of the Trinity or simply want to understand the concept, I highly recommend this book. I have read others, which frankly made no sense. This book does! I highly recommend it to anyone Christian or who wants to understand the concept of the Trinity."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"The author of this book succeeds at what he attempts to do--having the reader behold the wonder of our God in the persons of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This book is solidly biblically informed, telling us what God has Himself revealed about Himself. And the wonder of this God is well worth beholding.In this time, when progressives and emergents want to put a rift between the Father and the Son, when charismatics emphasize the Spirit to such an extent that the Father and Son become little more than background ornamentation, and NAR and megachurch leaders are holding out the hand of fellowship to modalists past and present, this book cannot be more timely.The book is a keeper, and one to be kept close at hand. I couldn't recommend it more highly."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"This book is easy to read and easy to understand for such a difficult concept. This book is simply an argument for upholding particular views of the Trinity that have been a part of recent discussion. The role of relationships and the patriarchal order of the universe. He doesn't describe well why our relationships must reflect the immanent trinity. He does not give opponents best arguments clearly and then defend his own view. He gives a basic argument and states how it must be so terrible to be such people. Even though I agree with him in his basic beliefs, it isn't helpful rhetoric and it doesn't allow me to weigh the arguments well enough. I had to find the other arguments in other books. If your looking for something simple that agrees with what you already believe, this is for you.If you are looking for a more breadth of opinion, look elsewhere. I give it three stars because it does what it is intended to do: define a particular theologian's point of view and insult those who disagree. The Standard."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Most books about the Trinity, in their quest for thoroughness, are written outside of the grasp of lay members of the church. In other words, they are often long, boring, and verbose to the point only a seminarian would reach the last page of a chapter. Bruce's book on the Trinity, however, is very much with the range of a lay member's interest and understanding. He does a great job of taking on a massively important doctrine with crystal clear clarity. Congregations should use this book to learn about the wonderful revelation and truth of God in Three Persons. I applauded the entire book, until the last chapter, when the wheels fell off this Mercedes of a book. His views on egalitarianism, along with other implications of what he just wrote about leaves much to be desired. I recommend two things: (1) skip the last chapter; and (2) read or use this book alongside THE FORGOTTEN TRINITY by James R. Wright."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"This book will open your eyes to the unity of the Trinity and to the unity we as those made in His image should seek in the Church. Benefits of reading: A deeper knowledge of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, and increased intimacy of relationship with our Lord.Once again I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Very, very good! Ware provides a concise and insightful look into the Trinity. He breaks down the history of the belief's development, describes each member, uses biblical exegesis to anchor each of his points, and provides several helpful applications of this doctrine. I found his commentary on prayer (praying TO the Father, THROUGH the Son, and BY the Holy Spirit) and relationships between individuals, within marriages, and for the church as a whole invaluable. His discussion of authority and submission within the Trinity, and how this is a model for human relationships within families, marriages, and churches was fascinating. It was presented as a counter argument to the egalitarian movement, including some aspects of feminism. My only criticism is that some of the rhetoric Ware uses as he summarizes a section or chapter is better spoken than written because the passion is more easily expressed, but this is forgivable since the book was developed from a series of oral presentations. I highly recommend Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to all ministers, Christians, and anyone who wants to better understand the Biblical doctrine of the Trinity."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"This book was given to me as a gift, but having read Dr. Ware's book, \\"God's Lesser Glory,\\" I anticipated that it would feed my soul and engage my mind. I have not been disappointed. This book is a wonderful treatment of the subject of the Trinity. As the title suggests, the books addresses the roles of Father, Son, and Spirit and the relationship that exists between them.Dr. Ware's main purpose in the book is to demonstrate that the distinction between the persons in the Trinity is not a distinction of essence. That cannot be because they each share the same essence (i.e, they are all three equally God). The distinctions between the three persons of the Trinity are to be found in their roles and relationships.Buy this book and enjoy."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"A few weeks ago, while I was in one of my favorite bookstores, a guy made a comment about how the Holy Spirit has been forgotten in contemporary Christianity. I replied by suggesting that we haven't forgotten Him, so much as we have misunderstood Him. Whether we misunderstand or forget Him altogether, it's clear that we don't have a robust understanding of the Holy Spirit, or the Trinity in general.Bruce Ware's Father, Son, & Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, & Relevance, seeks to provide us with the robust understanding we lack. The brief 158 page book is an adaptation from a series of lectures Dr. Ware gave at a conference in 2004 and is broken down into six chapters.Chapter One addresses the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity. \\"Would God have chosen to reveal himself to us as the one God who is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, unless he knew that this would be important to our understanding of him and our faith?\\" (13) Chapter Two claims to be an historical overview of the doctrine, though it's really more of an analysis of the Biblical evidence for the Trinity.Chapters Three through Five are each on a different person of the Godhead. Each chapter describes the unique roles of each person, how they relate to one another, and what relevance each person's roles has for our lives.The final chapter, six, concludes with ten \\"lessons for our lives and ministries from the relationships and roles of the triune God.\\" (132) Since we are made in God's image, we must start with understanding of God in order to understand ourselves. The applications include living in community, the harmony of unity, the importance of authority and submission within our families and churches, how to pray, and how to worship.The book is a very easy read, though it is far from simple. I still think James R. White's The Forgotten Trinity is the best book available in regards to the Biblical basis of the doctrine. However, Dr. Ware's is the best I've seen that explains the roles of each person and how the doctrine should apply to how we live. For instance, \\"Here in the Trinity... we see hierarchy without hubris, authority with no oppression, submission that is not servile, and love that pervades every aspect of the divine life.\\" (157)If you're questioning the Biblical basis of the doctrine, go read James White. If you are seeking a deeper understanding of the Trinity and the relevance the nature of God has in your life, Dr. Ware's book is a must read. I know of no other book that explains these profound truths with such clarity and warmth while maintaining their depth and weight."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"A couple of months ago I asked Crossway if there was a book in their catalog that they felt was an overlooked treasure - a book that deserved far more recognition than it had received. They suggested Father, Son & Holy Spirit by Bruce Ware. I know of Bruce Ware from his excellent critique of Open Theism in Their God is Too Small (which was a condensed version of a larger work on the same subject, God's Lesser Glory). A quick look at Amazon showed only one reader review which seems to prove that this book was, indeed, overlooked.Having read the book I agree with Crossway's assessment. This book is a treasure and one that deserves to be read, absorbed and appreciated. It is a thorough but readable study of the Trinity, their Relationships, Roles and Relevance. The final word of that, the book's subtitle, is what sets this book apart. Ware does more than merely provide a defense of the doctrine of the Trinity. Each aspect of the doctrine is accompanied by an explanation of why this doctrine is relevant and how the reader can apply this to his life. This is a perfect example of practical theology - taking theology out of the realm of knowledge and making it a part of our lives.Like many books on theological subject matters, this one began as a series of sessions delivered at a conference. The five one-hour speeches have been adapted into a 167-page, six-chapter book. The first chapter deals with the importance of the doctrine of the Trinity. Ware correctly asserts that few things can be more important than studying and understanding, in so far as we are able, the character and persons of God. \\"It is my hope and prayer that, through this study, we will be able to hear the voice of the Lord helping us to understand the beauty and glory of the God whom we already know as God. But do we know him as we should? Do we know him as he truly is?\\" (page 14). The second chapter provides an overview of the historical development of the doctrine as Christians came to a deeper understanding of biblical truths through the history of the church.The heart of the book is in chapters three, four and five. There is one chapter dedicated to each of the three persons of God. In particular, Ware examines the relationships of the members to each other. While each member of the Trinity is fully God, what defines one from the other is their particular roles and relationships. For example, the way in which the Son relates to the Father is presented in clear contrast to the Son's relationship with the Holy Spirit. In each chapter the reader is led to marvel at the wonder that is our God. Each chapter concludes with a section where the author provides application of all that he has taught about the relationships within the Trinity.The final chapter encourages the believer to behold the wonder of the triune persons in relational community. The chapter is composed of ten \\"lessons for our lives and ministries from the relationships and roles of the triune God.\\" Each lesson is practical, understandable and biblical.What can I say? Taking theology to the masses does not get much better than this. Bruce Ware has taken his extensive knowledge of this doctrine and provided it to the church in a format that anyone can enjoy and understand. There is enough content to challenge any believer, but it is simple enough that none need be intimidated by it. This is the best book I've read on the Trinity and I simply can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Something I appreciate about a good teacher or a good writer, is the ability to make complex ideas understandable and abstract ideas practical. Bruce A. Ware has accomplished this as he writes on perhaps the most complex and misunderstood doctrine of the Christian faith: the Trinity. In Father, Son & Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, & Relevance, Ware explains the doctrine and its history, and then focuses on each person of the Godhead, explaining their distinctive roles in the accomplishment of God's will, and yet maintaining their unity of essence as One God.Bruce A. Ware is Senior Associate Dean and Professor of Christian Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. The book stems from five talks Ware gave at a pastor's conference in 2004. Though first directed toward pastors, it is not just for pastors. Anyone with basic Bible literacy will benefit from it. It would make an excellent gift for new believers or anyone struggling to understand the doctrine of the Trinity. If I were to make a list of books that every Christian ought to read, I would include this one.The subtitle of the book: Relationships, Roles and Relevance, reveals its basic structure. Each person of the Godhead is studied in regards to His relationship to the others, to His role in accomplishing the will of God, including the salvation of His people, and also in terms of how these truths are relevant to our understanding of and relationship with God. Ware's thoughts on relevance and application are very profound and thought-provoking. I found myself reflexively setting the book down to ponder the wonder and majesty of our most glorious God and how the relationships within the Godhead are imaged in His relationship with us, and our relationships to one another.With its approximately 150 pages of text, the book can be quickly read; but it deserves to be pondered and slowly digested. The application section of the chapters on each person of the Trinity would make excellent material for personal devotional time. The book could also be used profitably by study groups. Perhaps Dr. Ware will bless us soon with a study guide.This book is a gem."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"The triune nature of God is one that Christians have tried to get a grasp on for the last two thousand years. The scriptures affirm that God is one and that He exists eternally as three persons. Each of the persons are fully God and there is but one God. This is a difficult doctrine to understand to say the least, but it is one that God has presented in His word repeatedly, so we have a responsibility to understand it correctly, if not completely. I believe it impossible to understand the triune nature of God completely in this lifetime, and perhaps in the next as well. The infinite cannot be contained within the finite.As I said earlier, we do have a responsibility to understand this revelation as best as we can, but most of us, myself included, have put off this theological doctrine in favor of things that are easier to grasp. This does not constitute apathy per se, but we honor God by seeking His face as clearly as possible. For us to deny any aspect of the trinity or to try to amend the trinity to meet our expectations is to diminish God in our own hearts and try to reform His being into one of our own likeness.In Father, Son and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, & Relevance, by Bruce Ware, we are given a good overview of the trinity, beginning with a list of ten great reasons every Christian should study this doctrine. It continues with a historical look at how the early church met heretical understandings of the trinity with biblical proof, always leaning toward the scriptures and not on logical statements of others speaking of a God no greater than their knowledge could comprehendThe meat of the book comes after this, as each person of the trinity is given a chapter to discuss the differences of role and not of essence that they have. I found this to be extremely helpful in my Christian walk, as virtually every aspect of a Christian's life is impacted by our triune God. Take prayer, for example. I was taught as a child that praying was just talking to Jesus about whatever was on your mind. According to the Lord's Prayer though, Jesus tells us to pray to the Father. We are also told that our prayer to the Father is offered through our mediator, Jesus Christ. And this prayer to the Father, through the Son is to be offered up by the power of the Holy Spirit. Proper prayer acknowledges the trinity.The roles of the trinity are quite complex, with the Holy Spirit pointing us toward the Son who seeks to glorify the Father. Thus the eternal roles of each of the persons should be rightly understood by all Christians if we are to discern error. For example, if someone claims that the Holy Spirit has come upon them for any reason other than to point us toward Christ, our ears should listen attentively to what is said that we may be able to lovingly correct the statement which is bound to contain errors, based on the errant foundation of the source of this information.I have yet to see a book that is more informative on this doctrine than Father, Son and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, & Relevance. It fills in many common misperceptions that we may make regarding what the trinity is and what it is not. One thought I have had for some time has been confirmed while reading this book. Christ came to save sinners, yes. But why is it that the Father does anything? Did He send the Son to die for the sole purpose that we may find our salvation in Him or is there an underlying motive? When you get down to the core values within the trinity, God the Father sent God the Son to earth as a man to be enabled for his task by God the Holy Spirit to the ultimate glory of God the Father. This was accomplished in part by God the Son atoning for those He was sent to redeem. And from His submission to both the Father and the Spirit (for a time) He is King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and yet maintains the second level of primacy to the Father.This book is 158 pages, not including the notes and indexes, but don't let the relatively short page number dissuade you. The length of this book is such that every Christian should read this book for personal edification, not to mention a more learned response to one of the more frequently brought up objections to Christianity. The content of the book is such that anybody could follow it, but those with a stronger theological background will be able to gain more insight than a casual reader to the degree of thiner knowledge. I recommend this book heartily to all for these reasons and more. This is a book that I plan to read annually, as I am certain there are truths represented within these pages that I have not been able to fully appreciate."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"You may believe in the Trinity, but how much do you know about it? Are you like me, and you know that you believe in it, you can quote the traditional formulations of it, but you still don't know much about the relationships between the persons of the Trinity; the roles those three persons have; or especially, how knowledge of the relationships and roles within the Trinity ought to affect the lives of believers within their own relationships? If the previous statement describes you, too, then this is a book you'll want to read.&quot;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&quot; is theology at its best--the study of God with a view toward the practical implications of that study in the lives of the Christian. This is one of those rare books that is short, easy to understand, but so dense with important truth that it oughtn't be read quickly. If I had a vote in the matter, I'd vote this one straight onto the list of Christian classic books for the lay person, valuable to be read and then reread through the years. In all the reading of Christian books that I've done, I'd have to go back a few years before I'd find a book that I think is as important for every believer to read as this one."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"The fact that the Triune nature is one of, if not the greatest mystery of the Christian God, it does not follow that there is no further revelation that one should know or learn from. Neither should it preclude one from attempting to gain a deeper understanding in this matter. Dr. Ware begins by teaching from Scriptural evidences, the basis of the simultaneous, equal and eternal divine nature of all three distinct Persons, thereby refuting Sabelianism or Modalism that claims the divinity of each Person occurred sequentially; only one Person being divine at a time, and Arianism that rejects the divinity of the Son and the Spirit. Therefore, since all three Persons are simultaneously, equally or fully, and eternally God, it is futile to attempt to understand their difference in terms of nature or characteristics because each possesses all attributes of God; among which are omniscience, omnipresence and omnipotence.Many tremendously important lessons to learn can be derived by understanding the difference in their roles and relationship, which not only serves as a divine revelation, but also a pattern and divine design for humanity to follow, having been created in His image. The beauty of the Trinity lies in the respect and affection in their treatment to one another, harmony in operation, and unity in purpose, as well as the complete absence of envy, friction, disagreement, power struggle and abuse of authority amongst Them. Here is a model of a perfect, most sublime authority-submission relationship displayed in the supremacy of the Father, subordination of the Son to the Father wherein the Son glories in the Father, the Father glories in the Son, the Spirit submitting to the Father and the Son. Moreover, the Spirit glories in the Son, yet when the Son was on earth, He was subject to the Spirit, and the Spirit is always eternally joyfully content to take up the background behind-the-scene roles assisting the Father and glorifying and pointing all attentions to the Son.Dr. Ware also covers what each Person does, and its implications whereby one learns the true fatherhood and obedience, the gracious work of inspiration, illumination, sanctification and evangelism. In regard to Christian life, they teach the divine inspiration and thus, the infallibility and inerrancy of the Bible; expose the importance of illumination in understanding of the Scriptures, show the right way to pray; by the Spirit, through the Son, and to the Father, direct how to worship properly, the Son being the center of all. In the mission field, they affirm the absolute necessity of the work of regeneration brought forth by the Spirit in a true conversion that results in faith and repentance. At home, these lessons are applicable to the relationship between men and women in marriage as husbands and wives, and between parents and children. It is also a divine design for the church and society in general; between congregation, ministers and elders, citizens and government; students and teachers; subordinates and superiors wherein God ordained authority-submission structure or taxis to reflect who He is and how He operates. In each of these relationship structures that Dr. Ware went through in details, he not only teaches that the doctrine of the Trinity is highly practical, but also refutes egalitarianism and a general distrust of authority. Yes, human authority is imperfect, whether it be husband, parent, minister, governor, and superior in a workplace, but Dr. Ware pointed out the preciousness of the lesson of submission from the Trinitarian taxis,\\"It appears then, that we need to learn something about the nature of true freedom. Freedom is not what our culture tells us it is. Freedom is not my deciding, from the urges and longings of my sinful nature, to do what I want to do, when I want to do it, how I want to do it, with whom I want to do it. According to the Bible, that is bondage, not freedom. Rather, true freedom is living as Jesus lived, for He is the freest human being who ever lived. In fact, He is the only fully free human being who has ever lived, and one day we will be set free fully when we always and only do the will of God.So what is freedom? Amazingly, Jesus' answer is this: Freedom is submitting, - submitting fully to the will of God, to the words of God, and to the work that God calls us to do\\" (p.75).The reason why this book is a must-read is because we live in the days where human autonomy is God and the seemingly prevailing rule is that I am my own authority; you have your own rules and I have my own, so don't ever tell me what to do. Understanding, embracing and applying the doctrine of the Trinity is a great antidote to this toxic post-modern spirit."},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Recent years of scholarship have surfaced some terrific books on the doctrine of the Trinity. Father, Son, & Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles & Relevance by Bruce A. Ware is among the best. Dr. Bruce Ware defines and defends the doctrine of the Trinity with biblical precision, Christ-exalting passion, and theological muscle.Chapter one unfolds the importance of the doctrine. Ware draws the reader in by illustrating ten reasons to focus on the \\"wonder of the Trinity.\\" Readers are given a treasure-trove of ammunition that not only demonstrates the rationale of this doctrine; it shows the practical ramifications for marriage, career, and relationships in the local church.Chapter two surveys the long history of the doctrine. The author shows why the early Christians accepted the Trinitarian formulation. His explanation is rooted in both Scripture and the writings of the church fathers.Chapters 3-5 takes an in-depth look at the respective roles of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Dr. Ware makes it clear throughout his treatment that \\"every essential attribute of God's nature is possessed by the Father, Son, and Spirit equally and fully.\\" Each chapter concludes with practical and powerful points of application. There is no abstraction here. Dr. Ware is concerned with linking truth with the affections and God-centered response.Chapter six develops a theme that was originally explored by Christian thinkers like Augustine and Jonathan Edwards, namely - the Trinity as society or as Dr. Ware puts it, \\"in relational community.\\" Ten key principles are presented that need to be fully digested and applied in the real world.Dr. Ware has done in invaluable service for the church in this book. He has unpacked the doctrine of the Trinity in a way that is clear and biblical. He has skillfully applied this essential doctrine in a way that can strengthen a Reformed spirituality among believers. And he has rightfully challenged the egalitarian movement with the biblical antidote that should define a new generation of Evangelicals.Highly recommended!5 stars"},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"Solid book that provides an in-depth look at the glory of the Trinity. This is a smaller book and just begins to scratch the surface of what we can observe, love, and learn from studying the Trinity. I would definitely recommend this book for all. If you are trying to understand how the relationship of the Trinity works, while they being One then this will help unpack that. The main purpose of the book is to set the foundation that their is a hierarchy within the Trinity (Father highest, the Jesus, lastly the Holy Spirit) but they are equal. So one in their essence and nature, but different roles and relationships. This book will not give you every answer and exhaust the doctrine of the Trinity but it should and will help you think through what it means and why it is vital to our faith.\\"The Trinity not only distinguishes the Christian faith from all others, it also establishes the basis for all that we hold dear as Christian believers.\\"\\"Freedom is not my deciding, from the urges and longings of my sinful nature, to do what I want to do, when I want to do it, how I want to do it, with whom I want to do it...the Bible calls that is bondage, not freedom.\\""},{"Title":"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: Relationships, Roles, and Relevance","review":"For me, this book made the Trinity distinctions come alive!

He presents a plethora of biblical argumentation for a thorough going Trinitarian understanding of God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ and I appreciated VERY much how he doesn't just reference texts but rather spends a few statements explaining his references.He opens the book giving 10 reasons on why the study of the Trinity is so important. That chapter alone is amazingly edifying and is a staunch rebuke to those who would ignore this doctrine because it's purely academic theology with no practical application. Ware argues clearly and convincingly that the Trinity is, when properly understood, one of the most practical and important understandings of the Christian faith.He then explores the historical foundations and formulations of the doctrine of the Trinity, laying forth the proper Old and New Testament teaching on strict monotheism and then explaining what exactly happened at the council of Nicea (where absolutely nobody voted on what books should be in the Bible, contra pretty much every ding-dong on the internet) regarding the formulation of the Nicene Creed.The later chapters give biblical argumentation for the deity of the Father, Son and Spirit and the sixth chapter talks about the importance of Trinitarianism for understanding relational community. All the chapters were wonderful and gave insightful applications and practical outworking of Trinitarianism, as well as substantial biblical support. I absolutely loved this book and will consistently recommend it to any and all people who are curious as to the Trinity. I'm going to make it mandatory reading for baptismal classes at my church as well!So then why 4 stars?I DID thoroughly love this book, and I find Dr. Ware to be one of the most \\"pastorally minded\\" scholars I've ever read or met (albeit briefly). That being said, if I could offer a suggestion to Dr. Ware it would be to include at least one appendix on how various cults and world religious systems misunderstand the Trinity. This book is clearly meant as a lay introduction to the subject, and most lay people who get involved in discussions about the Trinity will find themselves, almost immediately, in debates. I've had Trinitarian discussions at workplaces before that almost immediately reveal I'm talking to a oneness Pentecostal, or a Mormon, or a Jehovah's Witness, or some other non-Trinitarian. They always have articulate rebuttals, seeing that most cults and world religions make a point of explicitly attacking the Trinity, that can be unsettling to Christians trying to explain their faith. Seeing that Trinitarianism is such a specific compartment of theology, solid biblical responses to anti-Trinitarian rebuttals can be difficult to find. Seeing that Dr. Ware's book is a concise treatment, a 20-40 page appendix dealing with what most lay people will encounter \\"on the street\\" as rebuttals to biblical Trinitarianism would have changed this book from 4 to 6 stars. Nothing comprehensive and nothing technical, but if Dr. Ware possibly would have included maybe 5-10 common arguments (i.e. saying 1 is 3 is a logical fallacy) against Trinitarianism with biblical responses, that would have made this book the single resource on the Trinity any lay person would have ever needed."},{"Title":"Segues","review":"William Stafford and Marvin Bell, Segues (Godine, 1983)Marvin Bell and the late William Stafford, two of America's old guard of prizewinning poets, came up with an idea during a (boring, we infer) writer's conference to correspond in poems, using the last-received poem as the genesis of ideas for the present poem. It's something poets do quite often, but without the kind of structure and formality they were setting out. The result, after two years of correspondence, was the book Segues.It's a neat little package, and you can pick it up assuming that what's inside is going to be good writing; both poets have a solid track record of excellent work. But what's most interesting here is a chance to look at the way poems come to form, to look at an image Bell puts in as an aside that becomes the basis of a Stafford poem, and the tangents that poem sends Bell off on, etc. The fact that the poetry is quite good seems to be something of a sidelight, given that. ***"},{"Title":"A History Of World Society, Volume 1 Sixth Edition","review":"As a high school history teacher, I have found this book to be an excellent resource for lecture notes.

It places the work in its correct historical context by describing the chain of discoveries, beginning with those in the early part of this century, that eventually led to Dolly.However, the book is needlessly sensationalistic in the way it describes science and scientists, seeming to draw parallels with the worlds of power politics and showbiz. Science is really a more subdued and low-key affair - as exemplified by the very lab that created Dolly.My major objection is that the book appears to take as its underlying assumption that the public (or a large segment) is opposed to science and treats its acheivements with profound suspicion. I agree that there exists a vocal minority that thinks this way and may have its roots in various fundamentalist movements. However, the majority of people that I have met, while frequently poorly informed, are not antagonistic to science, but rather are interested in enjoying the fruits of its labor. This may be why, as the book says, while various self-styled experts debate the ethics of cloning, infertile couples are lining up for possible medical applications. It is only when the public is either denied the benefits of science, or is not educated about what these benefits may be, that it grows resentful. This issue seems to have been overlooked. On the other hand, comparisons with the atomic bomb are abundant, though meaningless. The bomb has killed thousands and was created for that express purpose. Cloning has created very little and destroyed nothing, except a few egos.Fortuneately, although the book begins grimly, it seems to end on a fairly optimistic note, moving away from its opening notions that cloning is an evil, dirty business.The bottom line is that whatever else it may do, cloning does not undermine human dignity. A person's dignity arises from his or her actions, not whether they were born as a twin, testtube baby or clone. We would do well to remember that. To my mind, the most profound line in this book full of lines that compete for that honor is one attributed to a Scottish farmer who says, in some perplexity, 'I don't understand the big deal. A sheep is still a sheep.'"},{"Title":"Clone: The Road to Dolly and the Path Ahead","review":"This is a very fine book, even if you don't have a burning desire to make copies of yourself. As Gina K helps us understand, cloning is just a huge metaphor for the complexity and wonder of modern biology. To the media, its a way to sell papers and ads. To the scientists, its sometimes a way to get grant money, and sometimes the path to the most important medical advances imaginable. And, to the public, its an opportunity to get excited and hopeful about the future of man, or resentful and apoplectic about the schemes of these bad, mad, godless scientists. And to the moral arbiters of science (mostly illustrious residents of Cambridge, MA) its a chance play premature Cassandras to a poorly-informed and suggestible public.This must have been a difficult book to write, because a very complicated stage must be set; Kolata starts by reviewing the history of cloning, beginning roughly in the 50s with frog cloning (Briggs and King), then passing thru whackiness-posing-as-journalism (Rorvik), fraud posing as science (Illmensee) before arriving at genius in the person of a Faust-like Danish vetrinarian (Willadsen) and finally the methodical Scottish cloner himself (Wilmut).Its obvious that Kolata's journalist/scientist heart belongs to Willadsen, who is the scientist we all wanted to be when we were grad students. Contemptuous of arbitrary authority and received wisdom, with golden hands and an inborn passion for the mysteries of cell, embryo and organism. Willadsen seems to be the genuine article - he makes me proud to be 1/8th Danish!Read this book to see how science really happens. You'll thank me."},{"Title":"Clone: The Road to Dolly and the Path Ahead","review":"Looking for an accessible guide to cloning together with sex, scandal, a putative hoax, a fraud claim, counterclaims, industrial secrets and a cast of maverick scientists and myths that makes for a greatly entertaining true story ? To find a single book which has the potential to affect one's ideas and thoughts as to what it means to be human is a rarity, but some readers might be so affected by this work. Thematically weaving between the key historical developments leading to claims for the first cloning success using adult tissue and discussions of the moral ethics of whether and why such research be conducted, Kolata's account of the making of \`Dolly' the sheep reminded me of Watson's \`The Double helix'. Not only do we read here about the manipulation of genetic material outside the realms of human replication and fertility, we are continually provoked with the wider issues relating to food production processess, the social responsibilies of the research scientist, and the role of science journalism in informing public opinion.We are also exposed to the less attractive side of running the day-to-day life of the research laboratory - the struggle with grant competition; peer pressure, review and publication demands; conference attendance and institutional sponsor politics. Kolata provides all of this in a very well written and researched book including frank (and seemingly) honest biographies of the leading players in the \`road to Dolly'. The story as presented here covers a period of just over one hundred years following Weismann's discovery of the \`loss of information' with subsequent cellular differentiations of dividing tissue. Within twenty years or so the role of the cell nucleus had been determined, and by 1938, Spemann's \`Embryonic Development and Induction' proposed the very nuclear transplant experiment that was to succeed some 60 years later. The first successful accounts of this technique involved the use of the embryonic frog tissue in the 1950s by Briggs &amp; King, but the older, more differentiated cell' nuclei proved harder to handle and maintain. In the early 1960s, Gurdon succeeds with the transfer of what were thought to be adult, fully differentiated cells taken from amphibian intestines. At about the same time as these developments were unfolding, the first symposia to address the possibility of cloning and its implications for ethics had taken place. The end of the 1960s had seen the advent of gene isolation (though curiously little is said about the discovery of DNA itself and the significance of the newly founded growth area of molecular biology) and within the next ten years we had moved from the in vitro fertilisation of mice to Louise Brown, born in 1978. That same year saw the publication of a non-fiction book claiming that the real-life \`rich, eccentric Max' has himself cloned with the assistance of a World renown scientist known by the pseudonym \`Darwin' with the assistance of a seventeen year old virgin called \`sparrow', who gives birth to a healthy baby boy. I would recommend reading Kolata for her retelling of the Rorvik (1978) story if for no other reason. The following year saw Illmensee claim to have cloned the first mice using the nucleus of embryonic stem cells and, again, we are both entertained and informed by Kolata's telling of this most remarkable tale of intrigue and collegiate suspicion of happenings in the laboratory. It was not until the 1980s\` and 90s that successful sheep, cow and eventually monkey cloning was to be completed (all still using embryonic nuclear material transfer) at least suggesting that there was no in principle reason to believe adult cloning to be beyond possibility. However, very few scientists apparently held this latter belief - and these few were not encouraged to pursue their ideas. Now suitably brought up to speed with our history of embryology, experimental biology techniques and the sweat involved in conducting seemingly unglamorous basic laboratory science, we are finally introduced to Ian Wilmut, whose research group were to achieve what to many was still \`biologically impossible'. Wilmut and his colleage Campbell postulated that the problem of cloning transplants was perhaps with tranfering the nuclear DNA at such a time inappropriate to the natural activity phases of the cell cycle. Campbell determined that the so colled G0 (G-nought) phase of the cell cycle was one of synchrony and, combined with the technique of halting induced by nutritional deprivation, thought that it was during this period that cell \`reprogramming' would be more likely successful. In March, 1996 the first clones of a mammal (sheep) were born using differentiated embryonic cell nuclei, but their announcement was largely lost to the wider world outside that of a handful of agricultural scientists. However, in July of the same year, the first sheep cloned from the fully-differentiated cell nuclei of adult tissue was born to Wilmut's lab. However, the news that was to reach the world over had first to wait out a period of great secrecy and gossip-mongering. The (true) story is revealed lucidly here, and provides another reason to read Kolata's book. And yes, in this account she was named for Dolly Parton."},{"Title":"Clone: The Road to Dolly and the Path Ahead","review":"It's nearly a decade, since I read this book. While this work was NOT a book in which to search for a proper ethical analysis, NY Times reporter Gina Kolata provided a wonderfully readable narrative of cloning \\"science\\" up to \\"Dolly.\\" I was particularly struck by certain of her inclusions:* \\"Marie Antoinette Di Berardino, a serious woman who was a cloning pioneer, and who had been studying cloning in frogs since the 1950s, said she could imagine nothing that would justify cloning a human being: 'I'm coming from a Roman Catholic background, and I'm telling you, it' killing me,' she said. 'We have lost so much respect for human life in so many ways. I just have a fear that this may be taking a step too far'\\" (pp. 36, 37).* \\"The early days of embryology were the days of the gentlemen scientists, dressed formally in coats and vests, and priding themselves on their worldly interests....those early embryologists sought the company and the comments of other great thinkers and purposely tried to envision their work in a philosophical context. Science and philosophy, in fact, were intermingled to such an extent that, [Washington University developmental biologist David] Kirk said, 'no serious scientist would think of publishing his results without trying to draw philosophical conclusions from them.' These scientists took the title Doctor of Philosophy very seriously. For much of the 19th century & in the early part of the 20th century, science was actually called natural philosophy. And 'at least until Darwin's time, a majority of biologists thought that what they were doing was elucidating God's handiwork, approaching the mind of God by studying His creations,' Kirk said\\" (pp. 48, 49).* \\"The ethics movement had its roots in real scandals and moral dilemnas of teh late 1960s and early 1970s....IN order to develop a vaccine for Hepatitis B, doctors had purposely infected mentally retarded [sic] children at the Willowbrook State Hospital in Staten Island with the liver virus....The study eventually resulted in a vaccine against this incurable disease, but the damage to the public's perception of the morals of scientists was done....Once again, it seemed [sic], the weakest and most vulnerable were being used by scientists to advance their careers\\" (pp. 77, 78).* President Clinton asked his National Bioethics Advisory Commission to respond to cloning's ethical and legal ramifications. At that time, the commission was chaired by Princeton University President Harold Shapiro. It was this same Harold Shapiro who picked Peter Singer for an endowed ethics chair at Princeton. Unbelievably, Peter Singer has maintained that human parents should be allowed to kill their newborns - up to several months. If the chair of this commission could pick such an individual for an endowed ethics chair, what sort of \\"credibility\\" could the commission of that era possibly claim? AS per Kolata, \\"the commission's final report suggested banning only the cloning of cells from people who had already been born, leaving the door open to many of the possibilities that the infertility doctors [sic] envisioned\\" (p. 244).* \\"Steen Willadsen...[was a] Danish scientist who was the first to clone a sheep from a sheep embryo cell\\" (p.129). The follow three sentences of Kolata's text are as follows: \\"In the end, it may come down to a matter of semantics, Willadsen told me. Yes, he is pretty sure that humans will be intentionally cloned one day. But, he said, 'it probably will not be called cloning' (p.248).As the Vatican's 2008Instruction Dignitas Personae on Certain Bioethical Questions,\\"Cloning is proposed for two basic purposes:reproduction....Therapeutic cloning...has been proposed as a way of producing embryonic stem cells with a predetermined genetic patrimony in order to overcome the problem of immune system rejection; this is therefore linked to the issue of the use of stem cells....\\"Human cloning is intrinsically illicit in that, by taking the ethical negativity of techniques of artificial fertilization to their extreme, it seeks to give rise to a new human being without a connection to the act of reciprocal self-giving between the spouses and, more radically, without any link to sexuality. This leads to manipulation & abuses gravely injurious to human dignity....\\"If cloning were to be done for reproduction....The fact that someone would arrogate to himself the right to determine arbitrarily the genetic characteristics of another person represents a grave offense to the dignity of that person as well as to the fundamental equality of all people....\\"From the ethical point of view, so-called therapeutic cloning is even more serious. To create embryos with the intention of destroying them, even with the intention of helping the sick, is completely incompatible with human dignity, because it makes the existence of a human being at the embryonic stage nothing more than a means to be used and destroyed. It is gravely immoral to sacrifice a human life for therapeutic ends.\\""},{"Title":"Clone: The Road to Dolly and the Path Ahead","review":"I wanted to get some background on the events leading up to the passage of the embryonic stem cell legislation that Obama signed this year.

Kolata, one of the most famous author in this field, offers numerous numbers of intriguing anecdotes in the peripheral realm of cloning. For instance, I found the Karl Ilmensee affair quite Intriguing , and a question like \\"what if a newspaper breaks the embargo policy of Nature (which happened)?\\" was answered to my satisfaction.However, no story sheds much light on the central issue of biology. I would not be surprised if many general readers of this book would think that the purpose of the cloning of sheep was to generate some artificial protein in non-human live stock. Three technologies developed in 80's and 90's, namely recombinant protein expression, transgenic animal, and cloning are very confusing for non-scientists lay persons, but author never try to disentangle this confusions.For me, I wish Kolata took a further step to provide some coherent hypothesis to explain the fundamental nature of this eureka event, as she has a good background in humanities. This type of the once-in-a-decade discovery has a nature to defy the conventional thought prevailing the era. Almost no developmental biologists thought the chromosome from somatic cells of adult mammal could gain totipotency by such a \\"primitive\\" method. Why can some scientist have the insight, while others can't? Is this a necessary byproduct of what Kuhn called paradigm? Or could this be at least an partial evidence of the relativism or instrumentalism advocated by WV Quine, or some other social contructivist?

Drawing early inspiration from 17th century Dutch genre painting, then from his studies of Manet and the early impressionists, he achieved a stunning freedom of technique and sponaneity in his watercolor landscapes. Painter and teacher, Hawthorne maintains the tension between abstracton and realism, evidenced in the wonderful color photographs in this book. His art and teachings influenced many American 20th century painters, including the abstract expressionists. His teachings about artistic vision and method are presented in his notes on painting, included in this volume. (They are also published separately in &quot;Hawthorne on Painting.&quot;) Most readers will benefit from their inclusion here as they offer an opportunity to judge his words and aesthetic principles against his paintings, rather than in a vacuum. In addition to illuminating essays by Richard Muhlberger, formerly of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Janet Flint, the text lists more than 50 museums that have Hawthorne's work in their collections.

Because there is an incredible amount of angst, self-pity, self-agrandizment, posturing, emoting, and innocent awe. It is also short, surprisingly too.Chance is a hyper-sexual ne'r' do'well whose coupling with Princess, a hyper-vain Hollywood Queen suffering from lose of face after an amazingly bad \\"come-back\\" film, lands them in Saint Cloud, Chance's old stomping grounds, and perhaps some sort of symbolic nowhere town, dead to the world and quite possibly changeless. His appearence is bad news, as he generally is bad news. Princess, who is significantly older is so wrapped in her vanity and stardom, or there-lack-of, has latched onto Chance, because they are similar and desperate for what each other has.Sweet Bird of Youth is not a nice play. These are people who are not likeable, nor funny, and their desperation almost defines them. I say almost, because they are also passionate and hopeful, even in round about ways. They are symbols of Time's heavy hand, extravegance, unfortunate fame, addicts, wayward souls.Sweet Bird of Youth belongs in the second tier of Williams' plays. After Streetcar, Cat, Glass, and with The Rose Tattoo, Suddenly, Last Summer, and Orpheus Descending. Full of loud, troubled people on point of hysteria, whose sexual, or emotional hunger is suicidal and beyond reason. But lacking in broad connection to the world, in familial dynamics and struggle. In that way I recommend Sweet Bird of Youth for the Williams' lover or admirer, not someone who wants to know his best work."},{"Title":"Sweet Bird of Youth","review":"Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) was well established as a major talent by the 1944 THE GLASS MENAGERIE. By the end of the 1950s he was easily among the best regarded dramatists in world theatre. But although Williams continued writing until the year of his death, after about 1960 he found both critical and popular success increasingly elusive.SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH opened in 1959 starring a remarkable pairing of Paul Newman and Geraldine Page and ran for about a year--but subsequent stagings and adaptations have not been as successful. A film version starring Newman and Page tampered with original script and emerged as stodgy instead of exciting; a major 1975 Broadway revival lasted fifty performances; and the play has not fared as well over time as such works as A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE and CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF. It is rarely studied and rarely performed.SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH concerns a handsome drifter named Chance Wayne who has been picked up by a neurotic and has-been movie star with the unlikely private name of The Princess Kosmonopolis and the stage name of Alexandra Del Lago. After a drug-and-alcohol fueled road trip through Florida, the two have arrived at the semi-resort community of St. Cloud, the location of which is not specified but which from other geographic references seems to be on the Mississippi gulf coast.It happens that Chance has specifically come to St. Cloud in the hope of reuniting with his teenage love Heavenly Finley. We soon learn that on his last visit Chance gave Heavenly a nasty veneral disease that ultimately resulted in a hysterctomy, and that Chance has been warned away by Heavenly's father local political power Boss Finley, a vicious racist who is behind the recent castration of a black man accused of seducing white women. Heavenly's Aunt Nonnie and Boss Finley's mistress Miss Lucy warn him away; when Alexandra Del Lago recovers from her stupor and finds that her come-back film was a success, she too urges Chance to forget his young love, accept the fact that time has passed it by, and escape with her to California. But Chance refuses to leave, even though he knows that his efforts are futile, and the play ends with the strong implication that he too will be castrated by Boss Finley's minions.There are several difficulties with the play. The first is that the story is essentially a re-writing of Williams earlier ORPHEUS DESCENDING, which was a horrendous failure on Broadway in 1957 but which is nonetheless a noticeably better script. SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH is also somewhat awkward in its shifting between realism and theatricality, the plot is somewhat implausible, and the second act is weak. But perhaps the single most deadly problem facing SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH is that there isn't a likeable character in the entire play, with the possible exception of movie star Alexandra Del Lago, who ultimately accepts herself for what she is and has the good sense to walk away before the carnage begins. And this too is yet another problem with the play: we are never allowed to see the carnage, we are only left to assume it.All things considered, SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH is not among the genuinely great Williams plays, and indeed Williams would write only one other masterpiece, the 1961 NIGHT OF THE IGUANA, before beginning the rapid slide into alcohol and drugs that sapped his talents. But oddly, the very problems with SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH are what make it interesting, challenging, intriguing; one longs to see a really good staging of it and thereby know for certain if it works better on the stage than it does on the page. Interesting, but newcomers to Williams' work would do better to begin with the more obvious titles.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Sweet Bird of Youth","review":"Don't see the movie instead of reading the play, in fact, don't see the movie at all, because it is TERRIBLE. It changes the ending completely, and lacks the overall spirit of the play. With &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth,&quot; Williams has created something touching and brilliant. If you like Williams' other plays, you will like this, but if not, you won't. A wonderful dramatic landmark. Amazing."},{"Title":"Sweet Bird of Youth","review":"The first couple of paragraphs here have been used as introduction to other plays written by Tennessee Williams and reviewed in this space. This review applies to both the stage play and the film versions with differences noted as part of the reviewPerhaps, as is the case with this reviewer, if you have come to the works of the excellent American playwright Tennessee Williams through adaptations of his plays to commercially distributed film you too will have missed some of the more controversial and intriguing aspects of his plays that had placed him at that time along with Eugene O'Neill and Arthur Miller as America's finest serious playwrights. Although some of the films have their own charms I want to address the written plays in this entry first (along with, when appropriate, commentary about Williams' extensive and detailed directing instructions).That said, there are certain limitations for a political commentator like this reviewer on the works of Williams. Although his plays, at least his best and most well-known ones, take place in the steamy South or its environs, there is virtually no acknowledgement of the race question that dominated Southern life during the period of the plays; and, for that matter was beginning to dominate national life. Thus, although it is possible to pay homage to his work on its artistic merits, I am very, very tentative about giving fulsome praise to that work on its political merits. With that proviso Williams nevertheless has created a very modern stage on which to address social questions at the personal level like homosexuality, incest and the dysfunctional family that only began to get addressed widely well after his ground-breaking work hit the stage.\\"Sweet Bird Of Youth\\" is a case in point. Not for the first time, a seemingly 1950's style All- American boy Chance who has left his hometown, his home town girl and his roots behind to drift in that endless spiral toward fame- Hollywood and the movies, naturally- comes back to claim what is his by right. On this little hometown reunion Chance is in the service of one aging and fretful actress who has her own issues with that elusive \`bird of youth'. In his return to town it appears that Chance has stirred up a hornet's nest with the local political establishment in the person of one red-neck preacher turned politician in order to better do \\"god's work\\", old Tom Findley. The object of this dispute is one Heavenly Findley, old Ton's daughter and Chance's left behind paramour who is now the subject of some scandal (due to the amorphously stated need for female-related medical treatment due to Chance's irresponsibility). Along the way we get to see how political power is distributed in a small Southern town as well as the inevitable tempting of the fates by Chance in order to win the \`brass ring' before it is too late (apparently somewhere over thirty, by my reckoning). At play's end though, where he is between a rock and a hard place, Chance may not get the chance to be Chance at thirty. Oh, that fickle bird of youth. Still, Chance, go for it."},{"Title":"Friday's Journey","review":"My sons really like this book, mainly because it's hard to find books about subways and the kids who love them! The artist does a good job showing how it looks and feels to be on the subway.

Nartaka, Keremet, Fir Bolg, Fuath, Acheri, Moirae, and the Amodines. Also three new arts: The Autumn Way, Discord, and Oniero. A dark way of harvesting glamour: Reaping.This book is the best Changeling book to come out this year, a must have for all Changeling players."},{"Title":"Denizens of the Dreaming (Changeling: The Dreaming)","review":"Denizens should have been the Year of the Reckoning book for Changeling. It hints at Dark Things Ahead, elaborates on Dark Things Before, and does a nice job of expanding material from Dreams and Nightmares. New Arts and kiths are also presented--kiths with a much more multicultural basis than the original Changeling spread, which was nice to see. Overall, the material is interesting, with moral ambiguity to taste (how DO you take races who sided with the Fomorians ages ago?).The book's main flaw is lack of detail. Very little is given about the culture and organization of the Denizen races, and even a few more hints about their part of the Dreaming would have been nice. Unfortunately, the book also references that godawful Ravnos &quot;metaplot,&quot; but that's forgiveable.A little sketchy, but overall very good Changeling material."},{"Title":"Denizens of the Dreaming (Changeling: The Dreaming)","review":"This book was not really what i was hoping it would be, it seems to mainly cover the details for running a game centering around the denizens.

The book is chock full of original ideas, everyone who reads it will find his mind stimulated; but Brague has also written an indispensable work, a work which fills a gap in western historiography: it nudges our Protestant, Anglo-American, German-dominated historical tradition into coming to grips with an important and neglected strand of Western culture: the Mediterranean-Catholic contribution which has been out of the mainstream of historical thinking at least since the late 16th century, and triumphantly so since the late 18th century. Whoever is up for an exciting journey of rediscovery, and a more complete and more accurate diagnosis of our contemporary Western world and its future will find this mercifully brief and elegant book indispensable."},{"Title":"Eccentric Culture: A Theory of Western Civilization","review":"A very simple thesis, with a lot of rich detail accompanying it.The Latin West has always thought itself secondary in culture, and doubly so: The Romans thought that for culture, you had to go someplace else, namely Greece. And the Christian West, that for religion, you had to go someplace else, namely to the Bible, most of which is from Hebrew sources.The result was a graced secondarity, not a graceless inferiority or an other-ignoring superiority. This is the root of the West's perpetual interest in, and value of, other culturesThe pivotal crisis was in the second century, when the Church decided, against Marcion, to keep the inherited Hebrew scripture in its entirely.The Greek East viewed the Greek literature as its patrimony, and took it for granted. Islam translated what it wanted and ignored the rest, content with its own superiority."},{"Title":"Imported Foundation Stock of North American Arabian Horses; Volume 2","review":"Carol Woodbridge Mulder is an exceptional lady who has know and ridden many of the truly great icons of the breed. A gifted equestrian, her first 28 years were spent in close association with the old W.K. Kellogg Arabian Ranch at Pomona, California. Amongst the many near-legendary horses that she personally knew were *Raseyn, *Raffles, Antez, Alla Amarward, Abu Farwa and *Witez II to name only a few.Unlike several present day, self-proclaimed \\"breed authorities\\" who attempt to bolster their often dubious prestige by claiming some sort of intimate friendship or association with H.H. Reese and Gladys Brown EdwardsCarol Woodbridge Mulder not only worked closely with the two foremost breed experts of that era, but owned several Arabian horses in partnership with them.In 1959, at the age of 19, Carol wrote her first magazine article and throughout the ensuing decades published hundreds more enlightening accounts in nearly every Arabian horse magazine that one could name. Her contribution to the heritage and history of the Arabian horse has been tremendous and has greatly benefitted thousands of dedicated students of the breed.She is the author of a splendid series of three large and exhaustively detailed books titled \\"Imported Foundation Stock of North American Arabian Horses,\\" which contains an abundance of unique information, statistics and extremely rare photographs of many of the most influential stallions and mares that the breed has ever known. Her detailed and precise documentation of many of the early breeders is likewise exceptional. Indeed, the accuracy of Carol Woodbridge Mulder's impeccably detailed genealogical data and flawless historic research is far superior to that of ANY other individual that has EVER written about the Arabian horse!A Glorious Task"},{"Title":"Rage","review":"Wilbur Smith has been turning out novels since the 1960's. He has lived in most of the southern nations of Africa and experienced many of the turbulant times that he has written about. Though he sometimes uses cliches ranging from broad shoulderd heros to sophisticated intelligent but very evil villians his novels deliver one to Africa. RAGE is either the fourth or perhaps the fifth installment of the Courtenay saga. It begins in the late 40's and concludes in the sixties with the struggle against apartheid in South Africa reaching violent levels. The other books in this generational series are engrossing,but like all good recreational reads their intellectual content are minimual. In RAGE Smith takes a hard look at his country and it's tragic past. Plus when this book was written Mandella was still in prison and Apartheid was the law of the land. This book must have been a difficult venture for the author, but he accomplishes the task very well. I strongly reccomend not just this work, but all his novels. they are exciting and just plain fun. Give him a try next time you are at your local bookstore and leave the latest Grisham or Crichton on the shelve. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Rage","review":"Wilbur Smith never fails to capture me with his writings. Rage is a wonderful depiction of a whole different world in South Africa. While he changes a few details it is still a very good indication of a life that many Americans do not understand.

When someone asks me why I love his work so much my reply is simply, &quot;I can see his words&quot; Absolutely wonderful."},{"Title":"Rage","review":"Rage is based on Nelson Mandella's life.

He is mister entertainment when it comes to adventure writing but seems to get the reader caught up in a nations struggle with inequality and the various issues asssociated with it than encapsulating the reader with a trade mark concorde story line.Things go too slow and the characters are developed at times too slow and at times with too much depth. This is a well written book with a great deal of history in it, however, if you started reading this book you will find it still sitting around you some weeks later. That is because it doesn't have the necessary elements to be a complete page turner."},{"Title":"Rage","review":"The book was worn--still readable- and worth not having to go OUT and search for it.

Again the characters the author has created are real and very life like.He depicts each sect of the South African culture, black, Afrikaner and English for what they really were. The Afrikaner ruthless, smart, insecure and racist. Scared to lose their identify, which they lost anyway.

I liked her section on written expression. She covers essays and even the production of poetry. I have recommended many of the techniques she covers. Her section on medication is better than what I see in many books about AD/HD. She highlights the importance of understanding how long a given medication actually lasts.

It is just a collection of papers, so there is no tutorial included on the basics of neural networks themselves. Thus you should already be familiar with the topic including the construction of neural networks via Matlab or whatever toolkit with which you feel comfortable, and you should also already be aware of the limitations and capabilities of neural networks.Since this is a compiled work, the various papers vary tremendously in quality. Personally, I thought \\"Perception: A Biological Perspective\\", the paper on \\"Figure-Ground Separation of Connected Scenic Figures\\", and \\"A New Approach to Shape From Shading\\" were the best papers with the clearest explanations and best figures. However, your mileage may vary depending on your particular interests. Some papers go as far as giving algorithmic steps, and others are little more than a pure text explanation. Quite a few papers might be interesting to the student of neuroscience more than the computer scientist as theories are presented more as models of biological vision than algorithms that can be coded. An example of this would be \\"Neural Circuits for Visual Attention in the Primate Brain\\".Parts of this book are online for your examination, so since most of the used copies are going for such high prices, you might want to look at the several online chapters before purchasing. Just put the book's title in quotations and do a Google search. It should be the third link on the returned list of addresses."},{"Title":"Neural Networks for Vision and Image Processing","review":"I'm gonna be short, if you're looking for some very complete literature in the field, you just found it.

This is the one book that brought together everything that I had previously read in other books on Buddhism and meditation. With so many approaches to meditation, it's a relief to find an experienced practitioner who eloquently maps out the elements of Buddhist meditation in relationship to the balanced development of both wisdom and compassion. In particular, I found it very helpful the way the author divides the practice of 'samatha' or tranquility meditation and 'vipassana' techniques or insight meditation. The explanation of the Four Immeasurables (kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity) and how they balance our practice that's useful to others as well as ourselves was also invaluable. The writing is condensed and to the point with many jewels of wisdom. I found myself underlining almost every other sentence. If you're looking for a clear outline for meditation practice and how to apply it to your daily practice on an off the meditation cushion, this is a great book to read, study, and put into practice."},{"Title":"Genuine Happiness: Meditation as the Path to Fulfillment","review":"I own several of Alan Wallace's books. I like them all. He presents information from a Western perspective, which I find easier to understand. Here there are specific meditation techniques presented in detail. You are encouraged to practice for a while at each stage using the suggested exercises before continuing on in the book. This book serves as a nice checklist for a complete Buddhist meditation practice, including meditative quiescence (Shamatha), (Buddhist) wisdom meditation, dream yoga and more.Alan Wallace's other book, \\"The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind\\" would be more appropriate if your interest is specifically in meditative quiescence (mind training)."},{"Title":"Genuine Happiness: Meditation as the Path to Fulfillment","review":"I read the first three chapters of \\"Genuine Happiness\\" as the textbook for a class in Tibetan meditation at a Buddhist monastery in Atlanta: a valuable supplement to techniques to quiet the \`monkey mind' of frenzied western consumers.But the book, like Tibetan Buddhist meditation itself, is not about a technique for relaxation, nor merely an escape from frantic behavior. It is a path to an awareness of the necessity for ethical behavior: a prerequisite for true happiness. And, ethical conduct is based not only on clarity of thought but also an awareness of what service to other sentient beings entails.As an entry to guided mediation, the book is helpful. (Although, mastering new concepts without the aid of an experienced teacher is worse than learning new software without at least a User's Guide.) Life is rarely \\"intuitive\\"... No meditation book can function as a self-contained manual.The profound value of this book is its gentle synthesis of the rational views of western science with eastern visions of esoteric reality that surpass a biological understanding of consciousness. The last few chapters define levels of enlightenment that exceed what most of us can attain - levels of mastery that transcend western explanations of conscious control of our physical reality. These forms of enlightenment redefine the \\"Happiness\\" of the book's title.If you are interested in a genuine path to happiness through service to others (with more self-awareness than one gets from the Boy Scout's oath), this book will be a wonderful companion for your journey."},{"Title":"Genuine Happiness: Meditation as the Path to Fulfillment","review":"I'm a Christian who is new to studying Buddhism. I find that the teachings and meditations enhancemy religion, as well as my life. I have to admit that this book was on my shelf for a while beforeI began reading it. I was a bit scared that it might be too difficult to follow for a beginner.Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. I'm a mother of a toddler and I only have 2 hours a day free to do what I want, and I chose to use up all my free time to read this book. It was really easy to read but not at all dumbed down. The meditations were also very clear and easy to follow. After reading this book I truly believe that loving everyone even your enemies is attainable in this life time. For a book to give me such inspiration and hope is absolutely amazing. This book is excellent not just for enhancing my life but for really wanting to strive for enlightenment and perfection. It's only been a week since I've read this book and just the teachings alone have already improved my life, and have caused a shift in my perspective. I think this book would be excellent for anyone in any walk of life, and any level of Buddhist knowledge. I can't believe I had a gold mine sitting in my book shelf this whole time waiting to be read. This is one of those books that you will want to share with everyone after reading it. I am in no way interested in new age books, and this does not even come close. This is the real thing, completely authentic. Alan has so much knowledge and experience on this subject, and the fact that he's a Westerner gives him an even better perspective on how to relay all his information to the modern society."},{"Title":"Genuine Happiness: Meditation as the Path to Fulfillment","review":"There are books that you read, you enjoy, & you gradually forget; there are books that you read, you think, & you apply the underlying wisdom to your life.

I had been meditating already but needed more understanding and more direction regarding meditation. I read all the way through, doing the meditations described, and then re-read most of it and re-did the meditations.

From Shamada to Vipassana then to the four immeasurables, and from ethical discipline to quiescence and then to insight, Dr. Wallace's approach will be very useful to practitioners of all levels.

I am a black college student and I am at a college where the ratio of blacks to whites is probably 1/50. Our college is small and the population of students is estimated to be 2500. In this case most of the blacks are on one of the sports teams. Where are no cultural diverse classes here for anyone here to take. This year we got a new program called Cultural Anthropology. I feel that it is necessary for everyone not just African-Americans to take a cultural diverse class to learn more about someone of another race or creed. I feel that as far as we have come as a society there are still some things we have yet to accomplish. Being the only Black in most of my classes I feel it is necessary for everyone to understand and comprehend how someone else feels and understand there history and why they, if they do, feel the way they do about certain subjects. Students, I feel, would love to learn about their history and why not put those same feelngs into learning about someone elses."},{"Title":"The Agony of Education; Black Students at a White University","review":"This book is great for anyone who wants a better understanding regarding the issue of how black students live and perform in white institutions. As a black male I was able to identify with many of the points mentioned in the book. The fact that the authors used data collected from group and individual interviews they conducted was a good idea. The only thing that kept me from giving the book a higher rating was the fact that the authors only used actual school names at certain times. I don't know if this was done to protect the subjects or what. I would have enjoyed the book better if ALL school names were mentioned that they collected data from."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As has been pointed out by everyone else,Mr. Bryson whines and complains through thewhole book. BUT, it still has a lot of laughout loud moments, getting me strange looks fromeveryone several places where I happened to be reading it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It's an account of a car journey from Des Moines, Iowa, where Bryson was born (in 1951) and raised, around small town (and some big town) America during 1987-88 written from several perspectives that give it a special interest. Bryson looks at things in the United States from the point of view of a long-time British resident. He compares what he sees and likes or (more frequently) dislikes in 1987 with what he saw making similar car trips as a child. He looks at the Deep South, the Wild West, the Rockies, New York City and New England through the eyes of a Midwesterner. An added dimension reading it now is to compare what he saw then with things twenty years later (I was reminded of reading Least Heat Moon's \\"Blue Highways.\\").He sometimes seems to be addressing a British reader as he makes his comparisons. In many ways the differences between Britain and America have narrowed, both for better and for worse. London is now a more dangerous city than New York and the English are almost as rich and as fat as the Americans.He's often misanthropic and grumpy but that adds to the entertainment value. If you want a nice guy saying nice things you buy a guidebook. It's full of great one-liners, even though sometimes he tries too hard to be funny and the jokes get repeated."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is without a doubt the funniest book I have ever read. One of the kind that tears are streaming from your eyes so that you can't see the page funny. This is a fantastic read for anyone that endured car trips with their parents when they were young."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This was a trip the author could have missed. He finds mostly small ugly towns without good motels, surly waittresses and mediocre meals. On the way he seems to somehow miss towns in the area that are unique and well rounded.I got tired of reading about his misfortunes and rude treatment. This should have been a short story. JEF"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I loved this book. Part of the reason why I loved this book is because I drive in my car every year out west from Buffalo, NY. I also have taken many car trips in the eastern part of the country. When I go on these driving trips I do it because I am reaching a destination to do some hiking and or climbing.I thought the idea of this book was great of Mr. Bryson trying to find the perfect town in small town America. The humor that Mr. Bryson has is terrific. In the end Mr. Bryson has a greater appreciation for the area of the country, which he originally comes from after exploring much of the country in his vehicle.I thought this book was very funny because it makes humor out of many American types of things. It also is a good representation of what life is like on the road. Part of the reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because I have traveled a lot of this country by car and seen many small towns. This book does offer so many interesting pieces of information throughout it. I would recommend this book to anyone that has traveled the road and seen many small towns in America. I would also recommend this book to anyone that appreciates Mr. Bryson's humor."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As a European who lived and travelled in the States some years ago, I must say that I was surprised by the very limited number of human contacts Bryson made while travelling through small-town America. He seems to be spending all his time driving alone, eating alone (fast food which he abhors) and sleeping alone, in a country rightly famous for the ease with which you can make new acquaintances.He makes no new friends, never gets invited into a local's house, casual conversation is minimal. Compared to his Aussie book (Down Under) which is rich in hilarious dialog, this one is almost 100% descriptive. If I am not mistaken, this is one of Bryson's first books which is perhaps the reason why his writing technique is not as good as in his later works. Nevertheless, if you are a Bryson fan, by all means buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I first read Bill Bryson's &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot;, detailing his experinces on the Appalachian Trail and was eager to read more of his works. While I found this book entertaining and humorous, I was mildly disappointed. At times I found myself laughing out loud. Mr. Bryson has a wonderful wit and sense of humor. But as the book wore on, I became somewhat bored, much like the author himself. He was searching for the perfect small town in America but all he found was an endless stream of commercialism and neglect. Traveling through 38 states, he comments on a few wonderful and enchanting sights but mostly complains about over development and the lack of decent food. OK, we get it, but sorry Bill, that's America. I don't care for the commercialization either but he constantly beats a dead horse. He focuses on too many negatives and fails to accentuate the positives. This is a wonderful country and the people and scenery are all part of the unique tapestry that is America. He seems to speed on through his journey and fails to stop and smell the roses. He appears more interested in getting back to England than sharing meaningful insights of small town America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson can be witty and can certainly turn a phrase, but the insights are few and far between in this book. He skewers easy targets; fat, poorly dressed tourists, southern accents, the American dependence on automobiles, strip malls, the decay of Main St mom and pop businesses, interstate highways and tacky tourist traps. There may be a few cliches he missed, but none come to mind. Bill came home to America and discovered that it isn't 1965 and it isn't Europe. Rather than discovering America, he starts with preconceived notions and merely reinforces them. His more recent book &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;, is a much more thoughtful look at America and has some genuine insight, read it instead."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I think the reviewers overrate this book, which leads me to believe that only people who completely enjoy or completely despise books decide to write reviews. If you're cynical, as my last statement proves I am, then you will enjoy Bryson's digs on small town America. But the reality is that he is only contributing to the stereotypes &quot;normal&quot; Americans love to hear. We want to laugh at accents and old fat people but you may find that some of the things he criticizes we hold dear and will defend. Is there a place on earth he can't find fault with? Approach this book with an open mind and don't take his barbs so seriously. After all, some of Bryson's shortcomings came through in this book whether he knew it or not."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Mr. Bryson's writing which sparkled when he wrote about his travels in England, seems flat in this sad story about his attempts to discover America. Perhaps the flatness mirrors the flatness of his home state of Iowa, but for whatever reason it's more of a sad commentary on the isolation and fragmentation of society. Bryson is a humorist first and travel writer second, and when the liveliness fails hims, there is little left. Putting this book down was not hard. I had expected more."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book: part humor, part travelogue, narrates Bryson's road trip across the United States and back again. Bryson travels without strict itinerary, and with frequent stops in small towns across the country. The narrative is written in classic Bryson style, with frequent diversions to explain the origin of many of life's oddities, and with constant sideline commentary. As is usually the case with Bryson, the narrative is illuminating, amusing, and shows Bryson's sense of adventure. It was a pleasure to read. Yes, Bryson is frequently critical, but it's important to note that he's an equal-opportunity offender. Wherever he goes he brings his decidedly sarcastic wit, but he also balances criticism with admiration. This is not a book with a weighty message about humanity or morality, but it is a fun read to pick up and put down at leisure. And the ability to dive in and out is one of the beautiful things about this book; one can enjoy it and put it aside at will, and it takes little time to become reengaged in Bryson's prose."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson drives aimlessly around America by himself and complains. Not his best work. Anyone who tucks into chicken fried steak every night doesn't get to critique restaurants. If he bothered to study about any culture other than Anglo-American, he might enjoy some of the areas he traveled through. He manages to use racial terms I honestly have not heard in three decades."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having been to many of the places Bryson visited in this book, I find myself wondering how he could possibly have had such an apparently unpleasant time. Bryson's wit in this volume is not just biting, it's acidic, even heartless. This book will make you chuckle, but even most of the laughs leave a bad taste in the mouth. I have greatly enjoyed three other Bryson books, but I can't really recommend this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I'm sorry I didn't read all the reviews on this before I got the audio book from the library - I would have learned more about this horrible audio book. Bill Bryson usually reads his own books and that's really the only way it can be with Bryson's books, because his humor doesn't translate well in other people. Kerry Shale, the fellow reading the book, reads very quickly (too much caffiene that day?) and while his change in voices is good, the overall effect is very bad. I listened for about 20 minutes and since the story was slow in developing I had to turn it off. If you read this one, read the actual book and don't listen to it!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This little adventure/memoir was written by a native who decided early on that he wanted to be someone else and live in a foreign country, as his life was so dull; he wanted it to be like one of the Technicolor movies we all loved. As soon as he was old enough to leave the farm behind, he settled in England 'to ride trams and understand strange languages' -- in a land with perpetually drab weather, \\"across the pond\\" 4,000 miles away, not usually sunny and bright. When in Iowa, he worked as an assistant of a sportscaster at WHO radio where I hear Don Thompson, the erstwhile movie producer, on Sunday mornings. We had that kind of broadcast on WROL here, as I observed personally one time, while Bill Ross was the gopher.Ten years later, he returns for a solo motor trip to relive old childhood yearnings and memories, and finds instead of 'home' a foreign country. \\"I wanted to travel around. I wanted to see America. I wanted to come home.\\" And so he sets out in his mother's old car to see part of the country he had left behind in his youth. He heads toward Missouri to Hannibal, the home of Mark Twain, but finds it less than he desired. By this time, he became disenchanted with his search for the elusive dream of childhood memories as he saw a few occasional Burma Shave signs along the way.Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri resembled a flatland with corn fields and hardly anything else. Of course, he bypassed Chicago. The Mississippi River didn't look as big or majestic as he had remembered it. In fact, it too was drab and brown, flat and dull like the countryside. After reaching the Tennessee/Mississippi border, the Mississippi River was broad, dangerous, and deceptively fierce, sometimes overflowing an immense section.Kentucky had rolling hills and bluegrass, purebred horses, while Jackson, Tennessee, had people who talked funny. The same in Oxford, Mississippi, so he went on to Tupelo to see the birthplace of Elvis Presley. He ventured through Oklahoma on the way to Little Big Horn in Montana and Mt. Rushmore.You'd think that, by now, he would have found some appreciation of his native land. Instead, he returned to Britain for another ten years before moving to Maine for just a few years. Some people are just never satisfied. On the bus yesterday I heard a young mother of three say she hated Tennessee. I wanted to ask her why she is here then! I hope that someday Bill Bryson will find his paradise and ideal place. He might try hiking up to Shangrila in the Himalyans. That would be quite a feat -- better than coming to the Smoky Mountains and bypassing the hardest and most dangerous of the Appalachian Trail. I had recommended the Natchez Trace, but he really is not an outdoors person. Nor am I. He went to Australia instead. Now, that is a foreign country and they really do talk funny there!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Subtract 20 or 30 points from Mark Twain's IQ and you have Bill Bryson's \\"Lost Continent.\\" It's funny at times, clever, vindictive, and mean-spirited in others, but it lacks the unique, eye-popping insights of a great comedy writer. Anybody with a sharp tongue and a sarcastic attitude could have written this book. (Why, says the reviewer jealously, didn't I write this book and make a lot of money?)\\"Lost Continent\\" is Bryson's description of his automobile journey of nearly 14,000 miles in a rented Chevette to 38 states and innumerable small towns. He missed a few important states -- Texas and Florida, for example, but he describes towns like Tupelo, Mississippi -- birthplace of you-know-who -- and gives it a bit of a thumbs-up for the quality of its strip mall. There's a few other positive moments in the book, but most of the time Bryson appears to be having a wretched time, pouring out his spite at endless waitresses in cheap roadside cafes which don't measure up to his standards of refinement and cuisine. This is irritating. Bryson is an Iowan, for heaven's sake, and he should know that uppity behavior is looked down upon in middle America -- even if you live in England and write books. His description of his father and growing up in Iowa borders on being cruel.Fortunately, Bryson seems to be honest about his own limitations and prejudices and that saves the book from being a elitist diatribe about the failings of the United States. His positive experiences in a few places -- Savannah, the Grand Canyon, and Storm Lake, Iowa leavens the negative sufficiently to make the book readable and he ends on a high note. You can zip through it in an hour or two while waiting for an airplane or a dentist.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I bought this because of the reviews, as I figured I'd be in pain from laughing so hard. I travel a lot, especially to National Parks and Battlefields.I laughed a bit, even a few times out loud, but after the first few chapters it grew a bit weary on me. It unfortunately was the same tale at every place the author went. Fat women in bad shorts, ugly rowdy kids, and dull visitor's centers. Yes, we know tourist traps are full of chuncky women in tight Bermudas, but didn't Bryson see any hideous men with them?Bryson seems almost content to head back to his flea motel and down a six-pack in bed. Not quite the type of guy to pick on everybody else for their looks.I would still recommend it for frequent travelers, but be prepared for the dislocated American (he moved to England many years back) to be really critical of people he sees along his kind of dull trip."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you're looking for a book that summarizes life in rural America as a gift for your elderly Aunt Mildred, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a social commentary of the Pre-Clinton era America, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a travel guide with detailed descriptions on where you can get a great meal or a soft bed at attractive rates, then this probably isn't the book you want. If you're looking for a book that will make you laugh out loud, then look no further. I've been through many of the towns BB mentions in The Lost Continent, so it was even more fun reading these relentlessly funny attacks on the yokels across America - I live in a town with 1,400 people and at least 500 pickup trucks, so I believe I can speak with some authority on the yokelness of this great country! And I also have a father that took the family on these awful summer vacations that are funny thinking about now but were nothing short of torture at the time.Yes, Bryson is a lazy slob that cuts corners (don't forget how he skipped at least 900 miles of the Appalachian Trail a few years back) but he just has a knack for making me laugh. My wife hates him because I'm constantly reading passages aloud to her - interrupting her reading of the latest in the \\"How to Murder Your Husband in Cunning Yet Painful Circumstances\\" mystery series.I only gave \\"The Lost Continent\\" 4 out of 5 stars because I enjoyed some of his other books even more, plus I have this longstanding problem with giving perfect scores - probably due to poor potty training or something like that. Anyways, Bryson is one of my favorite authors (along with Mark Twain & P.G. Wodehouse), so maybe my review is biased, but this is a very funny book - unless you were a big fan of President Ronald Reagan. In that case, you probably haven't laughed since they granted statehood to New Mexico, so this may not be the book you want either."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"An absolute gem of a travelogue! The author effectively weaves his early memories of traveling across the U.S. with the journey described in this book.

That book would be a better introduction to Bryson's humor and writing skill."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read this book several months ago on a plane from Atlanta to El Paso. I laughed so hard I cried and pretty soon everyone on the plane was looking at me. I was by myself but had to be moved in between two women and I shared as much as possible with them when I just couldn't stop laughing. I'm sure they thought I was nuts.

I read on as Bryson drove east. . .\\"Soon I was in the suburbs of Hartford, and then in Hartford itself, and then in the suburbs on the other side of Hartford. And then I was in Rhode Island. . .Was that really all there was to Connecticut?\\" I lost further interest. . .Bryson, however disappointing his travelogue, is a sharp and funny wit. I thought his trip foolish, but not his observations of his shed country.

And so, I finished the trip with him."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I enjoy all of Bill Bryson's books, but this was not up to some of his others., His general opinion of his experiences in his travel around the U.S. was not positive and I became a little irritated with the author."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I enjoyed reading other works by Bill Bryson, and as someone who has had a chance to drive many parts of back-roads America on business, I had higher hopes for this book, and wanted to enjoy it. But as noted by other reviewers, Bryson comes off in this work as a curmudgeon rather than a humorist. His attitude comes off as that of a \\"conservative's\\" pejorative stereotypes of an elitist, stuck-up \\"liberal\\" far too good for the likes of Wal-Mart, Gatlinburg, tourist attractions, buses, motels, fast food, and the like. What others may find rural wilderness, he calls \\"bleak,\\" \\"depressing,\\" and \\"lonely.\\" I have been to many of the locales Bryson visited, many at roughly the same time as his 1980s tour (Beaufort, Bloomsburg, Mackinaw City, etc.), and I came away with much different impressions of the same places he describes--most likely because I actually interacted with an area and its occupants as an equal, not passing through hastily as a \\"foreigner\\" even though I have a bit of an accent. My cynical impression is that those who find Bryson's travelogue humorous to the point of laugh-out-loud share a similar disdain for \\"flyover country\\" and its occupants, whereas those who live, work with, and even enjoy \\"America's heartland\\" will find this book disconcerting or depressing at best and insulting or offensive at worst. Worse, the feel of the book is that of someone setting off to tour the country just to write a book about it, not of someone taking a trip to see the country for its own sake."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson loves USA despite himself. Or does he pretend that he doesn't love USA (he lives in UK after all)? A seemingly dispassionate witness, he tells us, at the end, how much great and breathtaking his country is."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I have enjoyed several of Bill Bryson's books. However in this book , instead of being comical, he comes through as being a cynical, arrogant snob!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"a very informative and witty description of bill brysons journey through the land of his birth a lot of the lesser known bits of history were enlighting to say the least tho not to the moguls of hollywood I suspect!!! an excellent read..a good selection from amazon."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...blah, blah, blah...funny remark...blah, blah, blah...complaining about something...This is the way the whole book goes. So, if the redundant humor/satire and bashes against the US will keep you entertained then go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, it really wasn't worth it for me. I am glad he has decided to stay in England."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"So a guy takes a trip around America and finds something wrong with our country at every turn. He doesn't believe in God, hates all Republicans (especially Reagan) and disrespects war heroes like Eisenhower. If he hates America so much maybe he should move to another country. Oh wait, he did that. He just came back here to write this book and make some money."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"&quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is a huge disappointment of a book. Bryson is mean spirited, disrespectful, cynical, redundant, and seldom funny. I have not traveled to most of the states in this book, so it's not as if I was personally insulted by his comments. The only other Bryson Book I have read is a &quot;Walk in the Woods&quot;, so this book is a bit of a surprise. I doubt that I will waste my time reading any of his other books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"One could accuse the book's subtitle - Travels in Small Town America - of being misleading: Bryson spends as much time in major cities (Philadelphia, New York) and national parks, or simply driving down the Interstate listening to radio stations, as he does exploring the smaller settlements of his homeland. Even when he does get out of the car (or his motel room), he can hardly be said to 'explore': he speaks briefly with waitresses, shopkeepers and other tourists but scarcely engages with any deeper stratum of local life. One of the book's ironies, it could be said, is that Bryson sticks as religiously to the conventional tourist agenda (museums, battlefields and other 'places of interest') as the consumerist day-trippers and backpackers he ritually scorns. But then the book does not set out to be a serious travelogue. Indeed that is much of its point. It is an antidote to worthy travel literature - and, by extension, a rebuke to those who take such things too seriously. America exists for Bryson to make jokes about, deplore, occasionally appreciate and then make more jokes about. The Lost Continent reads like a cross between a good piece of travel journalism and a first-class stand-up comedy routine: it is fast-paced, relentlessly witty, shallow and eminently readable."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I am so disappointed with this book. Bryson comes off with an annoying and bitter adolescent attitude in this work. A week before I began reading The Lost Continent, I was lamenting about my nephew's 'blog. --The whole &quot;oh gee, I'm soooo much hipper than everyone else and I think I'll make fun of everyone in my writing to prove it.&quot; I see little difference between Bryson's book and my nephew's adolescent rantings.I don't have to have a happy ending or a happy book -- but Bryson is simply mean and shallow in his treatment of small town America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Reaction to Bryson's books demonstrate the huge divide between the US and UK. On this side of the water, we were able to laugh at the fun poked at us in his book,'Notes from a Small Island'. Readers in the US lacked a similar ability to see the funny side of their nation. I first read this book several years ago, and as a frequent visitor to the US, and the Mid west in particular found this book hilarious. Whilst I live in England, I am half American, but still feel able to laugh at the foibles of the American nation. Surely the fact that the American public alone didn't like this book despite its world success, and the fact that all his other books sell well there must indicate that the American readership lack an ability for self examination"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is my first Bill Bryson book, so I can't compare this book to his others. But I can say that I really enjoyed the sarcastic humor at the expense of middle America. Many authors try and fail to bring the same amount of wit to their books as Bill Bryson.Bryson's journey took place in 1988, which makes the book a little dated. But you have to wonder how much less fun the trip would be with a cell phone, email, GPS and Yelp. It's a little depressing to read about how much had changed in this country in 1988, and realize that was 20 years ago."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is like good therapy. I dare you not to laugh out loud. I would read this book every year to remember how good it is. I love his wit and ability to describe a situation. Just read it!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"One of my absolute favorite travel books . . . period. Every few pages I'd put the book down, wipe my tears, call to my wife and say, &quot;You gotta read this.&quot; Funny! Funny! Funny!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"One man's very funny view of America. Some readers below have critiqued this as cruel - I thoroughly disagree! Yes, Mr Bryson takes irreverant &quot;shots&quot; at many spots in the US (my hometown included), but always with a purpose. If you have traveled across the US in a car, this story rings true. If you like Bill's sense of humor, you'll like this. A fine accompaniment to his books on Britain, Europe and Australia."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love Bill Bryson. I really do. He's quite possibly the funniest and wittiest writer out there. This was a wonderful book and second only to Neither Here nor There. I am greatly anticipating the release of I'm a Stranger Here Myself on paperback. What's interesting is his worldwide appeal--I was introduced to him when I lived in London and took his book with me when I, too, traveled all over Europe. Keep 'em coming Bill!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is superbly readable, highly critical, completely accurate and I totally disagree with his point of view - all in one! Bryson's sense of irony is superb, and given the America he sought to re-discover - the dreamy places his father always seemed to miss when they drove around - no wonder he was disappointed. Whoever said small-town America was going to pretty? Paradoxically, Bryson portrays an accurate (in my view) picture of low-down small town America, a good comparison between rich and poor and, for an American, has a remarkable grasp of the sense of humour from ths side of the world. I don't hold with the outward criticism, but I think his descriptions are bang on.PS - his poor father gets no favours! He seems to have brought him everywhere when they were young, ungrateful git!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson's idea of &quot;discovering&quot; America is driving a few hundred miles to a new city each day, and stepping no more than 25 paces away from his car. No wonder he's so bitter over everything he finds! Everything he sees is covered with concrete, greasy spoon restaurants and annoying tacky tourists. We don't get any useful information about any place he visits, only cynical commentary on the local fat people, or obnoxious tourist trap. There are a few funny moments, but most of his writing here is so grouchy and listless that the book drags on and on and on. Anyone who can turn up their nose at Yellowstone National Park, and find absolutely no flaw with Wall Drug has missed the point somewhere."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I very much enjoyed The Lost Continent. I have read 5 of Bryson's works, including Walk in the Woods, and I thought this was his funniest. I have lived in the West, and South, and the Midwest. I thought he was dead-on. If some people can't take the truth, and laugh at themselves, well that's their problem. Being suck out here in Sand Land, I appreciated the many laughs. Thanks Bill!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Fans of Bill Bryson will enjoy this book. He's up to his usual hilarious self, with observations about America (late 1980s) that will make you laugh so hard you have to put the book down. Unfortunately, I found his occasional political observations out of place, ill-tempered and unnecessary. Without those, it would have been a much better book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I just discovered Bill Bryson a few months ago, and I have loved every book that I've read, but this is by far the most hilarious one yet. I was reading it while traveling in a car with my husband, and, after laughing out loud, would have to reread passages to him. I haven't found it on audio book, but would love to hear it in Bill's voice, which adds to his sarcastic wit."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Let me start by saying that shortly prior to 30 miles on the AT I read A Walk in the Woods and loved it. Couldn't put it down and thought Bryson was not only funny but his book was chock full of tidbits of information that I still quote four years later. I was hoping that Lost Continent would be a similar experience. I was disappointed.The problem with the book is really one of missed opportunity. I don't think that he took the time that he should have. I was amazed. One foggy and snow bound day in Yellowstone. A couple minutes in front of a giant sequoia with a crowd of people. A review of Cleveland from a bridge as he blasted through. He missed so many chances to be impressed, to see the things that make the US great. At this point, most of us know that the typical American town is not really a notable experience. We know there are too many strip malls and fast food joints. Bill should have got that out of the way early and gotten on to the rest of what was out there.The best parts of this book, for me, were his recollections of vacationing with his dad. These vacations were the inspiration for the book and in the end BB does a great job making you see how nutty, but great his dad really was.The rest of the book just sets him up to return to Iowa and realize that it is much better that he ever gave it credit for being."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Admittedly, I'm a big Bill Bryson fan, but I can't imagine that his wit wouldn't appeal to many. Lost Continent literally had we wiping tears of laughter from my eyes in certain parts and, in all others, is no less than highly entertaining. Bryson's most comical moments are when he explains the childhood drudgery of family vacation piloted by a cost cutting father. His prose evokes fond memories for those of us old enough to have &quot;suffered&quot; through long distance summer trips in automobiles without air conditioning, roadside motels, and attractions akin to the World's Biggest Ball of Twine.As Bryson ventures throughout America attempting to recapture his youth and find the quintessential American town, we see the country through his eyes which find it, at the same time, charming, ironic, tragic, and glorious - all of it encapsulated in his singular and, often uproarious, sense of satire. Lost Continent is a quick and delightful read and something all should enjoy."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you have spent time travelling within the states and also travelled abroad, you will probably love this book. To truly appreciate it, you need to have the perspective that comes from having spent some amount of time outside the good old USA. Bill Bryson has the incredible knack of being able to put into words many of the thoughts that go racing through my mind when encountering some bizarre bit of Americana. I must admit to laughing so hard that I cried, then re-reading the same passage with the same results."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is a very funny book, which certainly made me laugh. The fact that some readers have disliked Bryson's very mild criticism of his own country just goes to prove how well aimed Bryson't wit is. I have but one negative comment, which applies to all of Bill Bryson's books: he knows that his main market is Great Britain and goes out of his way to reassure his British readers that, oh, they are so lucky to be British! But you can't blame the man for protecting his source of income..."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson brings a unique viewpoint to his writing abouttravelling around America. An expatriate for twenty years he returnsto rediscover the land of his youth and--not suprpisingly--he finds that some changes have been made. Most are not to his liking. Some red-blooded American readers may take offense at Bryson's withering descriptions of the denizens of America's small towns, tourists, K-Mart, RVers, scenic highways , southern cops and cultural icons, but I found it insightful and very, very funny. Bryson contrasts the America he remembers from his childhood with the America he encounters upon his return in ways that highlight changes the rest of us might not have noticed or just accepted without too much thought. Some readers may get a little tired of Bryson's chronic crankiness and exaggerated-for-effect descripitions of people or places that arouse his ire but I think they'll find his points are generally right on the nose."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Mr. Bryson confirmed for me a lot of things I had suspected ! I love to travel in the U.S. and this book has made me look at the country and it's inhabitants in quite a different way.What a joy to read !It has greatly influenced the way I write my own trip-reports.Love to see his articles in National Geographic Magazine.As a part-time Anglophile I enjoyed his 'Notes From A Small Island' as wel"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Since I had read a couple of other books by the author, I expected to laugh out loud a little and chuckle a lot, but I didn't expect to learn so much about America as I did. This is a very enjoyable book. You can't have thick skin if you read it though. Bryson is pretty critical of some of the places he visits."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've always enjoyed a good travelogue book or two, as well as social satire &amp; commentary(aka Tom Wolfe's &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, or Nelson DeMille's &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; ..for example) - so it was a complete surprise when I picked up author Bill Bryson's book &quot; The Lost Continent&quot; which hilariously combines the above two genres. This book had me laughing every where I went with it - on the subway, buses, waiting lines (much to the raised eyebrow glances of onlookers) - and I find myself returning to it every now &amp; then for the razor-sharp wit, the hilarious observations, and Bryson's sharp eye for the absurdities in the commonplace.. This book is so enjoyable that it has become dog-earred from being passed to family members, (my 14yr old son enjoyed it during a long bus trip), friends and associates. It was my pleasure to hear Bill speak and meet this very charming and quiet-spoken man in person during one of his book-signing tours here in Montreal (and no, he is not as wickedly sarcastic in person as he appears in his books!) A real gem of a book!Kim C."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I think a fact that some of the US readers might have overlooked is that first and foremost Bill Bryson is a writer, an extremely funny one at that. About twenty years ago I travelled by car from the West Coast across continental USA all the way to the Eastern seaboard. Over the three months it took, I saw a dazzling array of sceneries, cultures and accents, all of which undoubtedly make the US a wonderfully fascinating place to visit. Mr Bryson may offend the sensibilities of some Americans but his portrait of small town America is savagely hilarious and often hits the target with spendid accuracy."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having traversed many of the highways described in this hilarious road trip account, I can tell you that Bryson's right on the money. He's snide, though, so be prepared. He's snide about everything, including himself, and at times that's all that saves him and the book from seeming hopelessly snobby. A previous reviewer pegged this book as a wake-up call. That it is. It's also great fun if you're not one to take yourself (if you're an American) too seriously."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the funniest books that I have ever read. Sometimes I would have to stop reading and do something else for awhile to give my body a chance to cool down from all the laughing. I have since gone out and bought every book that Bryson has written (having lived in England for awhile, Notes From A Small Island was a special treat). You might not like the book if you are a dedicated town booster and Bryson passed through your neighborhood, but if you do like your travelogues packed with wit this is a book for you."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've read the other reviews and they all seem to sum up the variety of perspectives I would expect. However, there is one point I feel should be addressed. I've spent much time in the town of Gettysburg as my girlfriend's family lives there. I normally wouldn't fault someone for being unfamiliar with the history or progression of the battle but Bryson is a different story. Given that Bryson himself points out the immense importance of the battle and despairs at the failure to respect the battlefield, I feel that some nitpicking is warranted. He mentions sarcastically that he could picture the Confederates advancing from the north through the town during Pickett's charge, through parking lots and tacky shops. In fact, Bryson is wholly incorrect in this description. Pickett's charge advanced from the West about a half mile south of the town across open field that has since been, and is today, open and unadulterated.I recognize this distinction as nit-picky but as someone who feels so justified in lambasting the American education system but demonstrates his own massive ignorance about an event he considers to be of monumental importance, I can't help but be disappointed in Bryson. In fact, I wonder how accurate any of his irreverent anecdotes are, or if he even went to any of these places at all.I will admit that he is enormously funny and his humor resonates with me. I find myself laughing out loud at some of his anecdotes. However, I can't help but be disappointed in a person so close minded as to hold everything that is different from his own personal lifestyle (even if he only gets a glimpsing look) in utter contempt.Prepare to be:a) offendedb) lied to and/or misinformedc) laughing at the end of it all"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Have been reading this \\"type\\" of work for many years.Once thought Mr. Bryson funny. Now, I find him mean in spirit toward anything in the USA. Note that he has decided to live in great BritainAlso, have realized his works are somewhat derivative,Please read Jean Shephard...as in Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories. And others.Jean has no mean streak, as does Mr. Bryson. I have just come to realize this. And feel sorrow that I once enjoyed Mr. Bryson....."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"In a Sunburned Country\\", \\"Made in America\\" and \\"Neither Here Nor There\\", but this book really rubbed me the wrong way. In my opinion it is 299 pages of complaining and whining. In this book Mr. Bryson comes across as being almost anti-American, and also a homophobe. I'm all for sarcasm and biting humor, and agree than America's propensity to build superhighways and strip malls and \\"main drags\\" with car dealerships and fast food joints is tiresome, but this book kind of crosses the line into a bitterness that is not enjoyable to read. If I were given the chance to take months off work to travel the route that Mr. Bryson did in this book, I would have had a great time! Mr. Bryson sure didn't - every place was boring and filled with a bunch of hicks. It appears that Mr. Bryson was wishing he was in Europe, or somewhere else. The fact that he might have been going through a difficult time in his life seems to me to come across in this book. Who wants to read the unhappy travel writer?"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Under the guise of a travel book, The Lost Continent shows Americans' extraordinary pursuit of ignorance, false innocence, and the dumbing down that occurs when a society is caught in the thralls of rabid consumerism. In a cantankerous tone that would make Mencken proud, Bryson writes about his tongue-in-cheek quest for the mythical town of American innocence, \\"Amalgam,\\" which he of course never finds. What he does find is a young, vast country full of bovine anti-intellectuals sedated by their own dream of innocence and sated by the bounty that comes so easily to them. Please bear in mind, though, that for the most part Bryson has a gentle touch and doesn't go overboard so that his jibes maintain a friendly manner. Here is a travel book that is done in the spirit of good fun and shouldn't be taken as an insult to small-town America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I gave this book one star only because Amazon doesn't allow the option to select zero stars.My husband and I have read and enjoyed many of Bill Bryson's books. In the past, we considered him one of our favorite writers. After reading this book, it will be a long time before I open another of his works.Mr Bryson's petty criticisms of the small towns through which he drove and his obvious contempt for all things Southern will leave any American who loves her country feeling a deep disdain for all things Bryson. While reading this book, there were many times my husband and I would look at one another and ask, \\"What could have happened to him to make a man from the Midwest develop such a negative view of all things American?\\" and \\"Do you think this book was REALLY written by 'our' Bill Bryson?\\" (BTW, we no longer consider him 'our' Bill Bryson.)I mentioned that Mr Bryson 'drove through' small towns in America because that's exactly what he describes in the book. After a quick, judgmental glimpse of a town, he bypasses it altogether as totally unworthy of his time, money, or attention.Bryson didn't bother to visit many of the historical attractions along the way. Apparently, he was on a very tight budget. He DID, after all, borrow his mother's old Chevette for the journey. The cost of admission to these sites require him to cut back on his beloved beer and chicken-fried steak.Last, but definitely not least, Mr Bryson showed himself to be a bigot. His contempt for 'all things white and all things Southern' along with his propensity for revisiting every bit of negative racial history every recorded during his BRIEF drive through the deep South demonstrated just how out of touch he is with the country of his birth and his, obvious, disdain for truth. He chose to ignore any progress made in race relations during the past 40 years. He chose to see, and share, his view that America is, and will always be, the country he would most like to see in 'his rearview mirror'. I, for one, welcome him to return to his country of choice and not bother to darken the doors of the home I love. The last thing the United States of American needs is one more person to describe our country in such negative terms."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I snatched this up after thoroughly enjoying \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\", but this book has forever put me off of anything else Mr. Bryson will ever write. It's relentlessly arrogant and petty, and overall just extremely tiresome. For someone who harps on and on about the lack of civility from those he encounters, he doesn't really seem capable of displaying any himself. Particularly in his encounters with waitresses he comes off as a first class jackass.If you want a narrow-minded journal of a pathetic anglophile's tour of the US, by all means pick up the book. Personally I think there are better ways to spend one's time and money."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Appropriate sub-title: 'hemorrhoidal old man, stuck on non-stop Greyhound bus with a broken toilet, shares his view of small-town America as he rides cross-country.'I'm actually surprised that the publisher sub-titled this \\"Travels in Small Town America\\", since the author rarely gets out of his car and actually talks to anyone in the small towns he travels through. It seems he's too busy disparaging the towns as he drives by to offer any real insight into the people who've created lives there.I've had the pleasure of driving across America several times in my life and never cease to be impressed with its beauty and the kindness of the people you find in its small towns. That kindness is one of the things I love most about living in my adopted small town in Colorado. Mr. Bryson's book is so lacking in detail and authenticity, one wonders if he ever got out of the car, or just sat in the back seat reading the latest issue of The New Yorker."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I got the feeling that while Bryson was writing this novel, it was more about deadlines than a first hand, interested and intrepid observance of a great land; he didn't really want to be there, doing that. For reasons known only to him, he had abandoned America for England awhile before, and perhaps whatever it was, became the underlying reason for his unenthusiastic return to homeland. Ostensibly, he had returned to take what he hoped would be a \\"Sentimental Journey\\", but wound up being dissatisfied, unamused, lonely. Perhaps \\"lonely\\" describes his journey best, because not even Katz was there to drink beer with him; he had to drink alone when he could find a waitress who would bring him one after closing time without making him feel like a leper. While traveling alone can be a boon in certain instances, it can also be a depressant, and it shows. He drove at his own speed, coast to coast, seeing towns, countrysides and cities I would absolutely love to see for myself, but he seemed unimpressed by most of it.It's an enigma. After having read \\"A Walk in The Woods\\" and \\"A sunburned Country\\", I dove into this one (\\"The Lost Continent\\" ) with abandon. But while the first two books mentioned are peppered with a caustic, biting humor livening the travel narrative, which is just my cup of tea, I felt this one lacked a lot of something important; and while I enjoyed it to a degree, I felt rather flat after suffering through his coast to coast \\"missed adventure\\" with him. As Flat as his descriptions of Nebraska or Kansas. As \\"nothing\\" as his remarks about Highway 93 to Twin Falls, Idaho; where flat topped mesas born of volcanic fire give way to the beautiful Snake River that wends it's way through a black lava canyon of spectacular vistas, surrounded by magnificent mountains in the distance - none of which he apparently saw, or if he did, neglected to write of it. The West is a country of vast distances; to travel through at high speed with the sole intent of \\"getting it over with\\" is surely a way to miss most of it.But his disrespect of the East, all the way from Georgia to Vermont, was evident too; instead of using his daring wit as a condiment to the tale as it had been in books past, it became narcissistic in this one; one can't help but feel that he had personal issues clogging his views, dragging him down with them as he sneered his way across country. In many instances, you knew exactly what he was telling was hard truth; that's always welcome - but the tempering journalistic enthusiasm so evident in prior books was struggling painfully, doggedly, trying to break the surface and never quite accomplished it.I left Bryson after spending a lot of time with him in the pages of this book, but he wasn't quite the same storyteller I tagged along with through the woods on the Appalachian Trail, or in the back country of Australia. I have mixed emotions about how to rank it; but even though I came away with the feelings I did, I would recommend it to others because there was a lot of worthwhile humor in it if you are forewarned to sidestep the depression. While I was late to the Bryson party (I always am) I have high hopes for his next book; I know he has another good one in him."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having read several Bryson books, this one ranks at the bottom. It is 299 pages of repetitive narration, \\"I got up, I drove, I ate, I got tipsy, I walked to dinner, and I went to bed.\\" Bill does nothing but make light of regional dialects and comment on the plight of small town America. At no point does he venture into an explanation of why small towns have struggling economies and why Main Street USA is half vacant; big box stores and loss of good middle class jobs to cheap overseas labor so we can all by spatulas at the Dollar Store.If Mr. Bryson would have spent more time on his feet, and out of the seat (of his car) he would have found a country full of amazing interesting individuals each with a story to tell if he would have been willing to listen. The only thing Bill listened to in this book was his wallet. He constantly griped about how \\"expensive\\" everything was wherever he went. Not once in the book did he ever complain about the price of his beer. Well, Bill, I have crossed this county several times by, car, train, plain, bicycle, and motorcycle. I have never been bored, and I have always been entertained by beautiful scenery and people.May I suggest next time you go to Taos, NM bill you actually go IN an art gallery instead of complaining about the dust and the hippies. Quite honestly Bill who cares how \\"white and link\\" our french fries are? No one!He did say one intelligent thing though, \\"Never east at a restaurant with pictures on the menu\\".Enough said. Moving on."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I do not write many reviews, but I just completed this book and really felt the need to share my thoughts since the book was so much less than I expected. And it seems like many others share my opinion.This is the third Bill Bryson book. I have previously read \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" and \\"A Walk In The Woods.\\" I doubt I would have read either of these if I read \\"the lost continent\\" first. While there are some \\"laugh our loud? passages, I felt the book was mean spirited. I understand this is a satire, but a good satire is not so negative. I suspect if Mr. Bryson was writing the book today, it would have the charm of his later books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book reads more like a \\"why I miss England\\" book. For most of the book, he complains about every part of America he drives through. True, while there are plenty of boring places, and the \\"old town\\" lifestyle that Bryson loved so much in Iowa no longer existed by the time he took his tour in the 1980s, there really is no need to make the harsh comparisons between American and England. Each place has its own merits and faults. In all honesty, I think this book would be best read by someone not from America who wants to get a baised opinion about what is wrong with the country. There is little that is funny in the book (I laughed twice--total). I bought the book hoping for a great and laugh-out-loud story like \\"Thunderbolt Kid.\\" I was sorely dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Many here have it wrong. It is not the book that is depressing. Or repetitive. Or plain. Or lacking in grand history (meaningless \\"historic markers\\" occur a-plenty). It is driving through Small Town America that is all those things. So why did someone of Bryson's intelligence not pretty it up? Why not throw in enough \\"redeeming\\" nuggets here and there? As some reviewers here suggest it would have made him more \\"quick bucks\\".The answer, of course, is the answer to that age old question - why does a writer need to be true?You picked up a book subtitled \\"Travels through Small Town America\\". What did you expect? Small Town America, especially of Bryson's sampling, primarily reveals itself to the traveler through its strip malls, and its sale of cheap calories. Conversation is whittled down to the stock oft-repeated phrases of service indifferently provided. And Bryson gives it to the reader in all its repetitive and bland glory, redeemed only by the spice of his cynicism. Not strong enough, this spice, one feels as one reads the book. But having finished it one realizes that had the spice been a lot stronger it would leave a bitter aftertaste. I think Bryson pulls his punches appropriately while being completely honest. I think he pays a bigger price for this honesty than the most dissatisfied reader. Isn't happy denial an easier state to be in when driving 6000 miles through Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Alabama...? Why constantly remind oneself that this is not fun? That one's childhood memories cannot be recovered or are disappointing when they can? Why does a writer need to be true?This is not a great book, the subject matter would not allow that. But it is a unique book. It is clear that the writer who undertook this 6000-mile drive is a dedicated traveler. I shudder to think of those 6000 miles. And I thank Bryson for doing it and sharing his journey. I don't have to."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Thematic and organizational similarities to Steinbeck's Travels With Charley and William Least Heat Moon's Blue Highways are obvious, but Bryson takes The Lost Continent into territory scarcely traveled by Steinbeck and Least Heat Moon. You see, Bryson laces humor liberally throughout his travel memoirs. The other writers' travelogues about adventures and people encountered on American roadways had less humor. That's not to say that Bryson's book surpasses those of the great, earlier writers in this genre; Bryson's approach is merely true to Bryson's chuckle-packed narrative style. Therefore, since I find Bryson's humor and storytelling so irresistible, I feel this book is a great read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I got this book from a book-swapping club and thought, since I love travel stories, I would definitely enjoy this one. I have not heard of Bill Bryson before and thought, oh, a traveling memoir ... it's perfect for summer (and for the lull before the Harry Potter storm, of which I am very anxiously waiting for the last book ...). This book is funny ~~ if you like juvenile potty humor. I have to be in the mood for it. I was in the mood for it. Normally, I am not in the mood for it since it is crude and distasteful in my opinion (which doesn't really matter much anyways!).There is one big big gripe about this book. He totally dissed on Ohio. Well, duh. If you only travel the turnpike in Ohio up to I-75 ~~ yeah, you're not going to find anything remotely attractive about the interstates. On page 172 of my book, he mentioned that he \\"awoke early and experienced the sinking senation that overcomes you when you first open your eyes and realize that instead of a normal day ahead of you, with its scatterings of simple gratifications, you are going to have a day without even the tiniest of pleasures; you are going to drive across Ohio.\\" He must have never taken a childhood vacation in Ohio. I've been through Iowa and had strep throat in his hometown of Des Moines on our way back from the Rockies ~~ all I can say is that Des Moines is fortunate enough to have a Steak and Shake because I was dying of pain and they have the best milk shakes ... and a great book store too. I'd like to point out to Mr. Bryson that he needs to check out Ohio again ~~ this time, travel on the backroads. It is a beautiful state ~~ one of the nicests in the good ol' USA.I digress. Other than the dissing of my home state, he was funny in all respects of his travels. But after awhile, you can only make fun of the people in different states for so long and after awhile, you start wishing he'd stay in places longer than a night or for a cup of coffee. Then you wish for a more indepth book on traveling stories ... but it's not that kind of book, so it is disappointing when you find out that he's just going to make fun of the natives across America. He is funny but then he isn't funny. You just have to read this book to know what I mean. However, he sure hit the RV travelers dead on! When I worked at Yellowstone National Park in my youth, we called those tourists, tourons simply because they're tourists and morons at the same time. Not very nice, I know, but I was very young. Bryson's comments about the tourists were right on though and did make me laugh.I am not rushing out to buy another Bill Bryson book because this is the first one I've read and I am not sure if it's worth the money to read him again. But then again, I might give him another chance ~~ but hopefully, his tastes have matured to where he's actually funny and insightful, instead of funny and juvenile.7-18-07"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Unfortunately, I find little to recommend this book. I am trying to finish the last quarter of the book, hoping to discover some redeeming qualities. I expected humorous descriptions and experiences. I expected to discover new places to explore on my travels. Instead, I found a mean-spirited writer, who apparently found little to recommend in small-town America. His descriptions of the many towns he visited are repetitive and boring. His thoughts about the people he met are almost universally unkind, elitist, judgemental,and sexist. Even the comments about poverty and wealth in America have the feel of predisposition, not insight. Sarcasm is a poor imitation of humor."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It was the coffee stain that first caught my attention. I was walking out of the bookstore and there sat a book with a coffee ring on it. I paused and smiled. The book looked like it came from my desk, coffee stain and all. I smiled at the yellow roadside sign with the red arrow. I had observed many of these as I crisscrossed the United States over the last several years. With all these associations, how could I not pause and begin reading?A few minutes later I walked out of the bookstore with a smile and the book under my arm. Here was a kindred spirit, a sojourner lost in his own country, navigating his way through all that was familiar and strange.Mr. Bryson encircles the United States in a large figure eight with Des Moines, Iowa in the center, as it should be. He covers every region of the nation, aghast and agape at what he sees. He describes it in dry prose punctuated by laugh-out-loud comments. Mr. Bryson is pithy and riotously funny.If you are not planning on traversing the byways of the U.S. soon, by all means read this book now. If you have a trip planned, hold off reading this. Have your own experience, then pick up this book and see how many times your paths crossed. You'll laugh out loud too."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I'd heard many great things about Bill Bryson, so when a friend loaned me this book with gushing praise, I was looking forward to a good chuckle. The most I managed was a few sardonic smirks. Mr Bryson writes in coherent sentences, although in some cases, he should remember there is such a thing as a full stop and sometimes, it's better to say things in two or three sentences instead of endless droning. His observations aren't particularly eye opening. He thinks he's better than everyone else and that all his fellow Americans are overweight uneducated red neck trailer trash. He is in turn mean, nasty, condescending and superior. I thought maybe he was trying to be funny, but it certainly didn't come across that way.Still, I kept plugging on throughout the book expecting it to get better, but it didn't. The way he described the America he saw made me want to avoid going there (even though I have been there and I enjoyed the country immensely). I guess what I don't like about his writing style is his air of superiority. It comes through in waves, although underneath he doesn't strike me as a particularly intelligent or interesting person. When a person becomes an expat from his own country and then comes back to write about it, you should at least expect some funny insights and fresh perspective. With this book, I found neither. Just a condescending moron who really should have stayed in England.Overall, the whole tone throughout the book left me uneasy and with a nasty taste in my mouth. I certainly won't be reading any more of his books, let alone spending my hard earned money on buying one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was mean-spirited, misanthropic, and cruel--I loved it. I think most of the negative reviewers of this book would benefit by lightening up a little and getting a sense of humor. If you're a blind, gung-ho, flag-waving, patriotic America-booster then this book will deflate your bubble. I think America is the greatest country the world has ever seen and I love it, but if you sincerely love your country then you will be able to criticize it and laugh at it sometimes. Bryson's hilariously sharp eye catches all of middle America's absurdities, but what saves the book's harshness is that he doesn't forget to target the biggest absurdity here--himself (yes, the [sad man] who whines about how boring everybody is around him but spends most of his time alone in a motel room drinking beer and eating candy). For me the main joke of the book is that Bryson spends most of his time trying to escape from somewhere rather than looking forward to his next stop. Yes, perhaps some of his targets are a little too easy, but still hilarious. As a travel book: 1 star. As a comedy: 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love Bill Bryson. I love to listen to his narration of his books during my long commute to work. I didn't even notice that someone else was reading this audiobook until I started to listen. No bother, it'll still be great, right? Wrong. Kerry Shale narrates this at high speed, making you wish \\"slow down\\" was an option on the cd player. He's overly sarcastic, making Bill's subtle jabs sound down-right mean. It's only 2 discs long, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been 3 or 4 if Bill had read it in that wonderful way he has. I had to stop listening after about 5 minutes."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This easily could have been a 5-star piece of work, and in fact it started out that way. Bryson's glimpse of America by car can be funny, instructive, wistful, and a good argument for seeing more of this country. Unfortunately, he clearly has some mean-spirited baggage to dispose of, because there are few people he encounters along his journey for whom he doesn't express outright contempt. Overweight women and gay men in particular seem to come in for the lion's share of ridicule. I lasted up through the phrase \\"mincing little fag\\" before I moved on to something else."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"By his own calculation, Bryson traveled over 13,000 miles across America. He complained through every one, and logged those complaints in this book. Sometimes it's funny. After he says he is colossally disappointed by Yosemite, you may think \\"Isn't he EVER happy?\\" I'm not sure if it's the British lack of exposure to sunshine that eroded his optimism, but he complained about the South, the North, the East, the West and the Midwest. My recommendation: Skip this book and read \\"Walk in the Woods\\", which is laugh-out-loud funny without the constant bellyaches."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"\\"I was headed for Nebraska. Now there's a sentence you don't want to have to say too often if you can possibly help it...\\"The incomparably hilarious Bill Bryson brings his unique brand of dry British humor to bear on small-town America, with results that are, by turns, empowering and devastating to the oddball communities he unearths.Bryson has a real nose for interesting historical tidbits, and that talent is on full display here, as time after time, he tells us the one anecdote that makes Smalltown, USA seem like a fascinating place.This isn't as good as \\"A Walk Through the Woods,\\" because it doesn't have that same sense of overarching quest to hold the story together, but the splendid writing ensures that this is miles above and beyond the typical american travelogue.Elvis Presley's birthplace, the infamously introverted Appalachian communities, Tuskegee, and Amish country are just a few of the dozens of places that get the Bryson treatment. Bryson is sure to touch on someplace you've been, or somewhere you know. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Perhaps so, but in a good natured &quot;poke-in-the-ribs&quot; sort of way.Born and raised in Iowa (&quot;I come from Des Moines. Somebody had to.&quot;), Bryson left the plains to live in England. He returns to write about the land of his childhood. What results is an engagingly humorous look of the world he left behind through his (now) foreign perspective.In the great American tradition of the road trip, Bryson - sans screaming kids - decides to venture forth to document the America he knew and offer insight on what's changed.The book is divided into two trips. One going east, through Ohio, the deep south (&quot;Welcome to Mississippi, we shoot to kill&quot;), through New England back to Des Moines. The other going west to Nebraska, New Mexico, California etc. Through his trips, Bryson details his elusive search for Amalgam, the imaginary utopian American town comprising of hte desirable characteristics of the various towns visited.While offering some astute observations, he unashamedly resorts to harp on the stereotypical which while occasionally funny, gets tiresome after awhile. Admittedly, while Bryson is one of many who have attempted this sort of transcontinental travel writing (think &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; by Steinbeck), his brand of humor is immediately recognizable to an American audience.American readers who might be a tad offended by his travelogue might want to read his take on England as well.One of the better books in the humorous travel writing genre, if there's one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Enough has been written about this book that I'll focus on trying to help the prospective reader sort it out. It is praised for being funny and for its brutal truthfulness; it is maligned for its harsh comments and putdowns. Both are true enough, so the real question is whether you would like it or not.If you have a romantic feel about small-town America, and if you're firm in your conviction that it's the world's greatest country, I doubt you'll enjoy Bryson's take on it. He sees no beauty in a plain landscape; if it's not fancy and breathtaking, it bores him, and he says so. It's safe to say that if he ever retraces his steps, there will be a few detractors here and there who'll take him to task for what he had to say about them.If on the other hand you believe that we should above all be able to take a joke, and that if it's the truth, it needs to be said even if it's pretty unflattering, you're going to really like Bryson's approach. I've seen a good portion of the parts of the nation Bryson saw, and the fact is, he's right. We can either have a good laugh on ourselves, or we can pout, but it won't change the facts--and if we don't pout, we prove ourselves maybe not to be as small-minded as he thought. And his perspective, after twenty years abroad, is fresher than ours. I think he has some great insights. Even if he's all wet, he sure speaks his mind.The only area in which his portrayal rings a little hollow is when he describes tourists. To hear Bryson talk, every American tourist he saw was an overweight, flowery-shirted, pasty-fleshed dork, talking loudly, tipping meanly and appreciating nothing. Here's a little bit of honesty for Bryson (fair's fair, right?): considering how much of America he didn't appreciate because it didn't overwhelm him with its urbanity, neatness and monumental beauty, he hasn't really given us any reason not to consider him as just another tourist conforming to his own stereotype of tourists. In fairness to him, though, let it be said that he occasionally does at least catch himself in a moment of undue harshness, and that in the end, his own home state of Iowa looks pretty good to him--flatness, down-home attitudes, croplands and all. (I could have told him that in advance and saved him a lot of driving.:))If your main goal is to enjoy humour about America, or to read perceptive observations about it, this is a must-have. Wouldn't be a bad gift for foreign friends interested in learning more about the real America, too, if you get sick of people thinking the whole country is basically L.A. If you're prone to take some harsh comments about your state or region or the people in it personally, though, Bryson may offend the heck out of you and you probably wouldn't like his book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is the sort of book that prompts one to ask, \\"what is the purpose of travel writing?\\"Should it inform us about places we will never go and people we will never meet? Amaze us with tales of grandeur and exotica? Must travel writers seek out and celebrate the remaining pockets of difference and distinction in a world all too quickly tending toward homogeneity? Or should they seek to unite us, teasing out threads of common human experience from beneath the misunderstanding and fear that so often blanket us when we contemplate The Other.Of course, good travel writing -- from the journeys of Herodotus in a Mediterranean-centered world to Eric Newby high in the Hindu Kush or Redmond O'Hanlon deep in Borneo -- does all of these things, and entertains us in the process.Not, alas, Bill Bryson -- his highest aim is to entertain, and this he manages to do roughly on the level of an extended fart joke.In this book, Mr Bryson - an American who lives in England - goes on a car journey across the continental United States. He travels alone, staying in motels and eating in restaurants. Some evenings he finds a comfortable bed or an acceptable meal. These times, he is happy and he says nice things.Much more often, however, Bill Bryson isn't happy. He dislikes the big cities, which he finds very big. He also dislikes the small towns, yes, for their smallness. He despises equally the conveniences of tourist towns and the inconvenience of towns that do not cater to tourists. He finds the East is too industrial, the West too cold and empty; the South is unpleasantly hot; there is too much corn in Iowa. On and on he goes. Everywhere, he finds stupid people.When Bill Bryson is unhappy, which is most of the time, he vents his spleen on whatever town or city happens to disappoint him. Occasionally, his invective is amusing; more often, it is predictable and juvenile. A sample of the Bryson wit, picked more or less at random: \\"... his name wasn't Mr Toerag, of course. It was Mr Superdickhead.\\"As a humorist, Bill Bryson specialises in easy targets. Overweight Americans are particular favourites, as are those with regional accents. Here is a conversation between Mr Bryson and a Mississippi police officer, both of whom are in their cars, stopped at a stoplight:... he said, \\"How yew doin'?\\" This so surprised me that I answered, in a cracking voice, \\"Pardon?\\" \\"I said how yew doin'?\\"Bryson responds that he is fine, and the officer asks if he is on vacation.\\"Yup.\\" \\"Hah doo lack Miss Hippy?\\" \\"Pardon?\\" \\"I say, \`Hah doo lack Miss Hippy?'\\" I was quietly distressed. The man was armed and Southern and I couldn't understand a word he was saying to me. \\"I'm sorry,\\" I said, \\"I'm kind of slow, and I don't understand what you're saying.\\" \\"I say\\" - and he repeated it more carefully - \\"how doo yew lack Mississippi?\\" It dawned on me. \\"Oh! I like it fine! I like it heaps! I think it's wonderful. The people are so friendly and helpful.\\" I wanted to add that I had been there for an hour and hadn't been shot at once, but the light changed and he was gone, and I sighed and thought, \\"Thank you, Jesus.\\"So Bryson escapes from his brush with the law, but not from his stereotype of the South (or from any of the many other stereotypes of Americans). The above conversation, almost the longest in the book, is one of the few times Bryson talks to someone who isn't a waitress (another group he delights in mocking).Perhaps we should feel pity for Bill Bryson as he drives around America, completely failing to engage with its people or to penetrate beyond the its service industries and, occassionally, museums. But he gives us very little reason to do so. Bill Bryson appears no deeper than his own shallow lampooning.For a part of this book, Bryson is retracing the family vacations of his childhood. But in bringing these earlier adventures to life, he relies on more of the two-dimensional caricaturing that so fails to animate the rest of the book: his mother, says Bryson, spoke only to feed the family (\\"Another sandwich, dear?\\"). His father, more fully characterised, manages to be both the most interesting and the most sympathetic person in the book. Every summer, it seems, Bryson senior would load his wife and children into the car and drive off across the continent in search of history, beauty or adventure.Although rudely depicted by his son as a skinflint, barely able to read a map, Bill Bryson's father appears to have been a man who was passionate about his country. In one scene, he is described spending an entire afternoon pacing off troop movements on some historic battlefield (much to the boredom of his son, of course). And, we are told, he frequently engaged in long, involved conversations with the strangers he happened to meet. Bryson senior was, in other words, a pretty good traveller.Too bad he didn't write a book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"\`The Lost Continent' is Bryson's first travelogue, and despite a few rough edges, many of what would become his trademarks are present. This is also one of Bryson's more serious books, commenting on the supposed decline of rural America, as friendly little towns are being paved over by endless car parks and fast food stores. As with all of Bryson's books, it is important to remember that his main interest is in telling a funny and interesting story, not strict accuracy. He will exaggerate and distort for humour, and tar a whole town or state by the actions of a few people. But even allowing for this, \`The Lost Continent' is an inconsistent book. Its best moments are laugh-out-loud funny, the research is comprehensive, and we do feel Bryson's regret at seeing the towns of his childhood become \\"Junkvilles\\". But the social commentary is very heavy-handed, repetitive, and quite patronising in parts, and actually detracts from the point he is attempting to make.At times, his criticism and commentary are spot on, and hilarious.....even now when I hear a kid crying in K-Mart I picture an overweight woman screaming \\"if you don't shut up I won't bring you back here no more!\\". At other times, he takes a very condescending approach that borders on elitism. Gee, Bill, rural people and Southerners are all inbred redneck morons? Never seen THAT stereotype before, have we? Such an approach is particularly ironic given Bryson himself is from Iowa, and seems to want to draw on his Midwestern credentials throughout the book. In fact, Bryson's a bit of a hypocrite at times; for example, he complains about poverty and social disadvantage, while at another point in the book boasts about \\"eating the GNP of Lesotho\\" at a Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant.In the beginning of the book, Bryson notes that one of his main motivations for his journey was the death of his father, and the realisation that he himself is not getting any younger. And it is possible to see this book as a sort of midlife crisis put to paper. Bryson seems to hanker for some mythical past when every town was a neat little Perfectville, and everyone was friendly and knew each other's business. As I say, at times his observations are very funny, but too often he sounds like the grumpy old man in the corner who complains about everything being better in the \\"Good Old Days\\".So \`The Lost Continent' is a bit of a mixed bag. Personally, I found his personal anecdotes (especially regarding his late father) and some of the descriptive passages the best parts of the book. But the book would have worked a lot better, and hit harder, had Bryson reigned in his smugness a bit."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson's The Lost Continent is fairly funny and entertaining, but only if you can overlook Bryson's condenscening attitude and repetitive writing style. Most episodes in the book work something like this: \\"I went somewhere I probably didn't like, saw some people I didn't like, took in an attraction I thought was tacky, and reminded myself and the reader that I was far better than all of the above.\\" For the most part, it's another example of unearned Yuppie smugness being passed off as wit; I can almost see Bryson's pinkie sticking out as he drinks latte from a disposable cup.It didn't help that only a few pages into the book, he describes a visit to a specific location I had also visited at nearly the same time. Bryson's description of the place was factually untrue, and I felt that Bryson had intentionally, and falsely, savaged a specific place because he thought it would sound funny. Again, it's not that I felt differently about the place, but that his description of it was simply false. I felt that called into question all of the subsequent descriptions.While Bryson's episodes are structurally redundant, his conversational writing style draws in the reader. When Bryson eases off on his attitude, he is genuinely funny; his descriptions of family vacations are very funny. It's my understanding that his later works do just that, so I'll probably pick up a Walk in the Woods."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've always enjoyed Bill Bryson's writing before; \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" is one of my favorites of all time, and I've enjoyed the excerpts that I've read of \\"A Walk In The Woods\\", which I'll get around to finishing one of these days. So I was quite disappointed to find that I didn't really enjoy this book, especially because it's so hard to put my finger on exactly why; there are still fascinating tidbits of information thrown into the middle of more or less unrelated discussions, and he has the same facility for a clever turn of phrase that I've enjoyed elsewhere. And many of the things he says in this book could easily have come out of the mouth of Dave Barry, and if they had, I'd almost certainly have been rolling on the floor laughing; when Bryson says them, they come across as petty and snide rather than amusingly exaggerated. This, in spite of the fact that I can't put my finger on any particular difference in how they would word things. Granted, I was frequently reading excerpts to my wife because of a particularly amusing turn of phrase or interesting piece of trivia, but overall, I just found myself rather annoyed by this pretentious snob who had so little good to say about small-town America; this despite the fact that I am as big an elitist as the next well-educated city boy. I can't explain it, but somehow, the book just rang somewhat off-key. One specific I can name that explains a bit of my reaction is that Bryson seems to want things both ways; if a place is a popular destination, he complains about how touristy it is, but if it's off the beaten track, he complains about the lack of civilized amenities."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I honestly cannot put Bryson's books down. They are good reads - I've just ordered three additional Bryson books and can't wait to recieve them.This being said - I need to re-read this book and keep a running total of just how many places he starts to go to and doesn't - because of a steep entrance fee, because of traffic, because of a plethora of reasons. I'm guessing the tally on the 'intended to' side might be greater than the tally on the 'actually experienced, as a bona fide ticket holder / road traffic warrior'. Yes, I understand what he's trying to say about Americans being easily parted with their money. However, the 'lesson' becomes annoying, and comes off as an excuse he uses to just not see many important sites first-hand.Also, try to develop a tough skin before reading this book if you are a resident of the South - or any small town anywhere in the country that could with any stretch of the imagination be considered 'backward'. My conclusion of Bryson's absolute distain for certain places, primarally but not limited to the South, is that it is so much easier to pull comedy out of the negative than the positive. Also, people are, by nature, inclined to notice the bad before the good. Bryson, especially but not limited to this earlier work, goes with the easier cliche slam against whole peoples.Don't get me started in his bizarre anti-elderly people stance. He goes on rants about Americans not recognizing national treasures. He's referring to architecture and landscape for the most part. And shows complete distain to the elderly. It reflects either a genuine over-zealous dislike, or an attempt at humor gone too far and repeated much too often.All being said, I'm still gonna read his work. It's entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson, an American who has lived for many years in England, sets out alone, in a Chevette! (maybe he should have taken a Camry), from his mother's house in Des Moines to re-live the family vacation car trips of his youth and search for the perfect small town. He travels through thirty-something states and finds a lot of nice, dotty people and endearing tackiness. As the Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff is fond of saying, \\"What a country!\\" I've spent a lot of time on the same by-ways, and drawn similar conclusions. Always perceptive and entertaining, often offensive, and a lot of good laughs."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson, a child of the 50s, used to spend each summer with his family on one of those all-American vacations that consisted of endless driving, sweltering heat and the inevitable destination that was, due to his father's preference, free and educational. He always longed for the chance to buy tacky hats with plastic crap on them and other tasteless souvenirs, and now that he's an adult, he finally gets that chance when he embarks on a nation-wide odyssey in the hopes of getting to know the country he left behind in The Lost Continent: Travels in Small Town America.Although he was born in Des Moines, Illinois (\\"Someday had to,\\" he explains on the opening page), Bryson's heart was elsewhere, and he spent most of his adult life living in England. Some 30 years after those summer journeys he's back in the states, and with no specific itinerary or time constraints, he leisurely passes from town to city, looking for the perfect place that survived from his childhood in this travelogue.Of course, America has changed since Bryson's childhood days, and instead of finding Perfect Town, U.S.A, he encounters a deluge of faceless shopping malls, unremarkable villages and far too many gas stations. His hilarious observations usually come at the expense of the people he talks to and places he visits, which almost seems to suggest an air of British snootiness that he picked up from his years living abroad. Still, there are plenty of irreverent comments (\\"I only ever knew one journalist with a truly tidy desk, and he was eventually arrested for molesting small boys. Make of that what you will; but just bear it in mind that next time somebody with a tidy desk invites you camping\\") that are just so outlandishly amusing, that it's easy to forgive him for his treatment of the occasional small town citizen.Traveling across America and being disgusted with the over-commercialization is hardly groundbreaking material. John Steinbeck, the quintessential American, did exactly that in 1962 with Travels with Charley: In Search of America. While Steinbeck is a folksy, talkative guy, Bryson instead bares his teeth. He travels alone and all along the way he doesn't strike up many conversations aside from brief chats with a plethora of waitresses and moronic country folk. He does meet up with a friend, and later a niece, but they're pushed into the background and the surroundings become the main characters. The closest we get to travel companions is when Bryson vividly describes what the past trips with his family were like. His mom says nothing other than \\"Would you like a sandwich, honey?\\" and \\"I don't know, dear.\\"Much of Bryson's journey on both coasts, and everything in between, brings up plenty woeful places, yet he does find some attractions worthy of his admiration. A rare few of the stops on his trip nostalgically remind him of his youth, from the sheer scope of the Grand Canyon (\\"Your mind, unable to deal with anything on this scare, just shuts down and for many long moments you are a human vacuum\\") and the \\"sleepy\\" college town of Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania (\\"You feel at first as if you should be wearing slippers and a bathrobe\\"). Bryson covers so much ground (38 states) and visits so many similar towns, that at times, his travelogue almost read like a list. Even the memorable places are often described as simply \\"pleasant,\\" and after a paragraph, it's off to the next destination. Like the long road trip that Bryson embarks on, The Lost Continent captures the vastness and monotony of driving across America. Because of the now-famous Bill Bryson humor, for most of it works well and there are plenty of laughs, The Lost Continent becomes more than another lackluster expressway town."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As a resident of a nasty little small town, I had a secret desire to read the Bryson had driven through our area and promptly turned around, head held high in disgust at how far from Utopia we are. After all, we don't even have a town square, much less a white picket fence or a quaint church. Alas, he probably had some good information that told him to steer clear. There was a self depricating part of my that wanted to be told that I lived in a culturally devoid cesspool, if for nothing else than to validate my own feelings.Even though I felt left out, I still enjoyed the rambling rants of a man looking for something that he knows he won't find. I am certainly not a literary critic, so I won't make a pretentious attempt to tell you how this book fits in with the rest of American literature. However, I have driven more than my fair share of this country, and have been to a few of the towns that Bryson visited (and many more just like them), and found this book a wholeheartedly amusing look at what makes us American. More importantly, he doesn't embellish the way we are (at least not obviously), and the folks out there who get indignant at reading his work are often to shortsighted to just observe that he is right!If you read this book in series with Notes From a Small Island, you will gain the perspective of Bryson applying the same formula of work to England. The fact that I read these in that order made me think that Bryson came back to America just because he had exhausted the humor potential in England (much as Jerry complains that Tim Watley converted to Judaism purely for the jokes on an episode of Seinfeld). If nothing else, this book will forever kill that desire in you to get off the interstate and go searching for the perfect small town you remember visiting when you were a kid."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is a poor book, for the most part. Bill Bryson is a good writer, as his other books prove. However, I found myself quickly tiring of his whining and negative attitude as he recounts his travels through America. This book is repetitious and a little too cynical for my taste. I much preferred A Walk in the Woods. Though Bryson has a lot of amusing tales, for the most part, the attitude of his writing made me feel a little dark, soiled and depressed at the book's end. I'm glad I only borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste my money on it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I LOVED a Walk in the Woods, and looked forward to reading this book as well, however, it was a great disappointment.During Bryson's childhood, his father and mother set out on annual family road trips. His father was thrifty (as were almost everyone's parents then), and they often visited free attractions during these long trips.Many years later, Bryson, without his wife or family, sets out on a journey through America's small towns. He decides to do it as his father did, about as inexpensively as it can be done.Bryson visits great American locales with historical attractions, but often will not spring for the admission to those great sites, complaining that they should somehow be free. This means that he's unable to comment about what these places represent-- he misses many opportunities to reflect, for better or worse, on American history, culture, and life.Bryson spends his time instead visiting one local diner or restaurant after another, making fun of a waitress' accent or the others in the diner, but not really giving meaningful insight into America, or its small towns and the people who live in them.Bryson was clearly lonely and depressed on this trip. He should have piled his wife and kids in the car as his father had, and set out, with a more reasonable budget.Read this book if you want to hear the rants of a depressed guy who would rather have been home with his wife."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I ran into this book in a bookstore in The Hague (NL) on my way to buy a new Lonely Planet for my upcoming trip to The States. Indeed I am a great fan of the USA. Until that time I had never heard of Bryson but reading the back cover in the shop the first sentence of the book ('I come from Des Moines... somebody had to) directly caught my attention. That must be fun to read!!Reading this book during the last weeks Bryson really surprised me with his very nonconformistic way of writing. His observations are very sharp and really refreshing!! Never a dull moment for the neutral, not 'over-americanized' reader. Normally I don't laugh out loud when reading something funny in books but this one was a cracker and during the 350 pages of this book I did it over and over again. And hey there all you Americans out there who feel offeded by Bryson or find his observations offensive for the people of the Midwest and all the other (obesive)Americans Bryson discribes: don't be too proud on your country and your compatriots. When travelling in Europe you can expect the same from the Dutch, the Germans , teh French and Italians for instance. Dont we all make a laugh at our curious habits! Just see it as a wink Bryson gives to the life he lived (and obviously still lives). And remember that there is a huge difference between cynical (but humourous!!)memoirs and abusive stories! I enjoyed it a lot and love the country side of your country even more! But yes, not everything in America is something to be proud of but is'n't that the same for every country...;-))). Conclusion: a very good buy! And I will definitely buy another book (Walk in the Woods should also be fun as I read the reviews) of Bryson in the coming weeks. And come back to the US over and over again for LA or NY, 'Amalgam', your National Parks and all the places in between."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Some of the comments I have heard from American friends and family weren't exactly positive. Although they thought it was somewhat funny, they felt Bill Bryson was bashing their country. Somehow they missed the fact that the whole point of Bill Bryson's writing is to show the funny side of just about everything. I never felt insulted when he came to europe and made fun of Europe, because he was write!In The Lost Continent, Bill Bryson returns to America after having lived in America for a long time, and decides to travel from his hometown Des Moines towards the south, to trace the routes his dad took their family on when he was younger. The endless markers that indicated little more than that some important person or another stopped there and might have used the bushes for a toilet three hundred years ago, the hours of travelling through the middle of nowhere, bored as hell. His description is enough to probably never want to see any of the places he visits, but his observations of the people and what life would be like in these towns are outrageously funny, as are the accents he very succesfully manages to write down.&quot;I've been here for one and a half hour and still haven't been shot!&quot; when asked how he likes the state he just entered (I believe it was Mississippi, although Bryson himself seemed to ve some trouble understanding what was said as well).As expected of a Bill Bryson book, the story is wonderful, he gets his facts right (the book is more than just a collection of jokes), his observations are hilarious, and I could wish for nothign but to have written it myself."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As soon as Bill Bryson was old enough, he packed his bags left the place of his birth, the little known Des Moines and headed for Europe, he didn't intend to return back home but eventually after many years, a marriage and a family Des Moines did lure him back and with a caustic sense of nostalgia and dry wit in abundance he returned to the land of his childhood, and drove across what for him because the lost continent that perhaps never really existed in the first place...This book was recently broadcast on BBC7 over a series of days, late at night I might add, which was not a good thing because I laughed so much I couldn't get to sleep afterward!What a wonderful way of getting into Bryson, hearing it read out to you, and though he is totally irreverent about the country of his birth, you are also aware that he has a great deal of affection for the land he choose to leave for Europe's chilly shores.Yes Mr Bryson can come across as being very judgemental about \\"hicks\\" \\"chicks\\" and we won't say the other word that rhymes with \\"hicks\\" and \\"chicks\\" but there is something quite charming about the way he rambles his way across the USA, visiting and critiquing places you and I will never probably get to see but he made me aware of a very important fact whilst I was laughing hysterically, for many of us there is a \\"lost continent\\" waiting to be rediscovered and I for one will one day go back to the place of my birth, \\"up north\\" we call it here an England and I can't wait because I know I will probably feel the same way that Mr Bryson did only on a MUCH smaller scale!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is the book that introduced me to Bill Bryson, and I will forever be grateful to my old neighbor for lending me his copy.As a person who, as a child, was trapped not once, but twice, in a cross-country trek with her family, I can relate to many of Bryson's experiences. His anecdotes concerning his childhood trips brought to mind the stories my own father would tell about his family vacations in the 1950s.In &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; Bill Bryson holds up a mirror to America, showing both the good and the bad with a wonderful sense of humor. This is a book that reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously. Bryson doesn't get much credit for the amount of research he puts in his books; he drops informational tidbits as he pokes fun, and you learn while you laugh.I've read his travel narratives about the UK and Europe, and neither have had the same impact on me as &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; simply because I know my country's foibles better. For those who love America, warts and all, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Those who have become familiar with Bill Bryson from his massively popular &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; might be a bit taken aback by &quot;The Lost Continent.&quot; While &quot;Woods&quot; is a typical Bryson book, well-researched, opinionated and, of course, first rate travel writing, Bryson smoothed the edges of his biting humor ever so slightly. That is most decidedly NOT the case with &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; in which Bryson heaps out much his trademark satire and humor which is at times decidely not good-natured.The book takes Bryon on an automobile journey across America and back, mostly through small towns and historical sights. He brings an intersting perspective in that he had spent the previous decade living in Great Britain, and this journey helped reacquaint him with America. In this, he is a perfect commentator, combining his native Midwestern sensibilities with an adult perspective in which much of what he sees he does not expect because of his long absence from his native soil.Throughout the book, Bryson make references to his father and the family trips taken across the U.S. when he was a child. In this, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is a very personal work for him. He dedicated the book to his late father and even though dad is a constance source of (very funny) satire, it also manages to be quite touching.Overall, this is an excellent work from a first rate travel writer and humorist. But if you don't like an edge to your humor, you should probably pass."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was so disappointed. I have read other Bill Bryson books and loved them. This one is terribly boring. It just goes over boring stereo-types of different regions of the U.S. I had to struggle to finish it. I kept hoping it would get more interesting, but it never does. However, Down Under (In a Sunburned Country) is hysterical, and has tons of interesting facts."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was ok, I finished it, i laughed a bit, but it was ENTIRELY TOO REPETITIVE. If you want to read a better, and funnier Bryson book try A Walk in The Woods."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After having enjoyed many of Bryson's other books, I was taken aback by the petty criticism in &quot;The Lost Continent's&quot; opening pages. It seemed as if he were trying to impress his friends back in England, tearing down all things American to establish that he wasn't really such a bloody Yank after all. Had he taken a lot of teasing over there? I wondered how uncommonly scintillating a person would have to be for Bryson not to paint him as a dullard, or how exciting a town would have to be for him not to label it a dead-end hole.As Bryson continued in his travels, however, he seemed to soften, and maybe I'm being charitable but it seemed to be a coherent process--he was falling back in love with America, and becoming one of us again. By the time he made it back to Iowa, he'd regained the ability to find beauty in everyday American life. I agree with other readers who were disappointed that he didn't get away from the interstate-fast food &quot;generica&quot; a little more, and I also wish he wouldn't resort so quickly to calling rural areas &quot;boring.&quot; Still, I'd call this one a late-inning save. I will go ahead and read &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself,&quot; but it had better not be a rehash of this."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I bought the book because I read Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" on a plane, some years ago. I laughed so hard my seatmate scootched as far away as possible, worried for my sanity--and the cola spurting from my nose. Passengers three rows back peered over their seats to view the commotion.By contrast, \\"The Lost Continent\\" seemed small and mean-spirited. It was filled with stereotypes of southerners (lazy, prejudiced, unkempt, talk slowly and unintelligibly), tourists (fat, dressed funny, were consumately rude, especially the older women), the Amish, any quaint town, big city, shopping mall, fast food joint--too crowded, greasy, unfriendly--or the one that was friendly seemed suspiciously so--they were probably from outer space and were going to take him back to their planet, though, by then, I didn't know why they'd want him. Motel/hotels were too expensive-dirty-small. Tourist attractions, too full of tourists, weather, too warm or cold.He didn't like much except the baseball hall of fame at Cooperstown, and the Grand Canyon for the thirty seconds the fog lifted; was impressed with Las Vegas.Mr. Bryson had little good to say about people, though his contacts seemed limited to getting out of his car, being disappointed with whatever, or not wanting to stand in line, and huffing back to the vehicle, driving off and getting lost--again. Not much chance to get to know a feller, that way.I was puzzled as to why this talented man continued his trip and why when he was in such a snit, he wrote a book that was bound to irritate most of the people of his natal land. No wonder he and his family moved to London.I hear it's clean, never rains, has capatious hotels, great food and service--HA!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I am a big fan of Bill Bryson and have read nearly all of his books but I didn't realize that this was his first until I read some of the reviews here. Still, I knew this book was different from his other books. As enjoyable as they were, this was the one that really had me laughing and oftentimes wiping away tears of laughter. While Bryson is always funny, he is viciously so in this book and I could see how that would not appeal to some people.While a good number of Bryson's books are travelogues of a sort, I don't think categorizing them as such really does his works justice. They are not only a man's descriptions of his travels but also windows into his very psyche. He has always poked fun at the people of various cultures he encounters during his travels but he is sometimes downright mean in this book. While I certainly don't advocate being mean to others, the fact of the matter is that Bryson strikes me as a man who is really mild-mannered and rather awkward. What we're reading in his books, and in this one in particular, is what goes on inside his head and what I really admire about this is his candor. There are often things that run through my head that I would never want anyone else to know about and so I frankly can't help but be a bit in awe of someone who actually exposes those thoughts to the light of day. I think if we're all honest with ourselves, we will have to admit that we all share the same pettiness that Bryson sometimes exhibits.As for his comments about the places to which he travels, it is true that they aren't always kind. I'm a native of Michigan and so I eagerly devoured the section of his book that had to do with Michigan and, frankly, I was surprised that it was as positive as it was. While I do love my home state, I was rather shocked that Bryson didn't comment on the tackiness of the downtown area of Mackinac Island and that he was so mild in his descriptions of the tourist trap that is Mackinaw City. Bear in mind that the island is one of my most favorite places in the world. Even so, I do acknowledge that parts of it are more than deserving of criticism. It can be very painful to hear someone criticize a place that we love but it is also worth listening because there may just be some value to their criticisms. And, if not, it's always possible to laugh with friends later over what a jerk the person doing the criticizing is.Bryson, though, is a native of the U.S. The fact that he lived in England for so long is relevant only because the changes to his native country are so shocking to him upon his return. Yes, he is critical but he is critical of every country that he visits, including England. This is proven by his book \\"Notes from a Small Island\\". Bryson is good at picking out the things about which people are most sensitive and poking at them. This will naturally not endear him to everyone but I don't think that this book singles the U.S. out in any way. Instead, I think he has a very valid point about how sad it is that the U.S. is becoming more and more generic every day--and this book was written long before you could find a Starbucks on every corner. His points bear consideration. What have we sacrificed in our quest for convenience and 24-hour service?"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After reading &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot;, which were absolutely fantastic, I figured this book was guaranteed to be entertaining. Boy, was I mistaken! Obviously a collection of some earlier work, Bill Bryson shares much more of his personal thoughts and less of the local color that made the other two books such wonderful works. After reading half the book, I put it away. I got the impression that Bryson couldn't accept that the America of his childhood had evolved, and that he refused to find anything worth praising about mid-America today. It's really a shame, because his crankiness is often charming in his other works, but here it just makes me want to tell him to go back to England. If smalltown, USA is your thing, go find a book by Charles Kuralt. He knows how to make the middle states seem appealing."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As an American living abroad for the past 12 years, I feel Bryson's book took the words out of my mouth! You have to be an American revisiting your own country after years away before you can truly understand the absolute brilliance of his writing and observations"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The first page is enough to set you up for what it is to come. The author's accounts of recreating the journeys that he made as a child around various parts of the USA strike up such clear and hilarious images. Well written and the best of his whole output so far IMHO"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson presents theanatomy of the North American continent in amanner which geography and history teachers woulddo well to adopt, a manner which would leadto an immense upsurge in popularity of these subjectsin our schools and colleges. Through the irreveranceand the joviality one is made to not only appreciatethe &quot;soul&quot; of this vast continent but also to enthuseabout its vitality and amazing diversity.Readers are seriously warned not to be caught readingthis book in crowded places (airport lounges, planes,railway stations, etc.) as they are liable to burst outwith loud guffaws at regular intervals...guffawswhich might land one in trouble with puzzledon-lookers. Readers with weak stomach musclesshould also avoid this book...bellyful oflaughter is likely to lead to medical complaints!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was the perfect companion to a x-country driving trip. Not only did it make me laugh on my breaks, butI actually made some changes tomy route based on sections of the book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is a completely uninteresting description of one mans travels through North America. Boring and self-serving, Bryson fails in his attempt to relive his childhood journeys."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is not only poorly written, it appears there was little if any research done prior to publishing, i.e. Gold was not discovered in Sutter Creek CA. He was so negative about all of America, it makes me wonder why he choose to return here. I have lived in England and found his glowing comments about this lovely country untrue in many cases. Both countries have pro's and con's. I did finish this book, but was unable to continue with the book on England."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I admit that I did not read this book in its entirety - about 1/4 of the way through the pages, I could no longer fight my urge to throw the book across the room. When the book met the floor, the spine crushed under the weight of Mr. Bryson's negativity.If you are interested in (and/or originally from) small town America, be prepared to sit through the most random set of cynicism that I have come across in recent years. It is clear that Mr. Bryson has not one, but instead has multiple chips on his shoulder. One wonders why he even decided to tour small-town America when he obviously could not get over his apparent distaste for anything mildly different than he had previously experienced.When he wasn't making fun of the 'locals', he was snidely commenting on their economic status, their history (none of which appeared to be relevant to the book)or their accents.I am originally from the Midwest, and even though I have determined that it is not the place that I wish to live for the rest of my life, I see far more that is positive about the area than negative. That's the thing about perspective, which is typically what moving away from a location will give you. Unfortunately the author offers nothing in terms of perspective, and instead only hoists the antagonistic prose down the reader's throat."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is about the fourth Bill Bryson book I've read and all have been among the funniest most enjoyable books I've ever read. This one had many laugh-out-loud moments and was great fun start to finish. One reason I read it is because my wife and I hope to do an extensive trip around the U.S. when she retires in a couple years. I've traveled through much of our country before and it's fun to hear someone else's experiences written as Bryson does. I've had many great experiences in my travels and met people of every imaginable sort and this book just stokes my desire to get out there again. I sent a copy to my daughter who lives on the opposite coast because she loves to read and I hope it will whet her desire to see more of the country including back here in gold ol' New Jersey where her parents and many relatives are. One note of caution: Some people may be offended by comments about their home towns or states or the people from those areas but I think it's all in good fun and if you can take a little kidding, there will be no harm done. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I am a fan of Bill Bryson. I simply loved his Short History of Nearly Everything and In a Sunburned Country. Just awesome stuff. Reread both several times. I liked several other of his travel books, as well.But this...this is just...bad. I mean seriously bad. He makes fun of darned near everything from his youth from his family on, and not in a funny, teasing, but affectionate way like Gene Shepherd had the sense and talent to do, but in a really nasty and distateful way. And it's just not funny. Nasty satire can be a guilty pleasure...like the old National Lampoon magazine managed from time to time (remember the Teddy Kennedy Volkswagon ad?), but this stuff is just...bad and boring.I guess Mr. Bryson is just not talented as I thought, and hoped, he was."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson was the perfect author for me and may be the perfect author for a lot of people. He has a humorous perspective and always has interesting descriptions of places he visits and can connect to the reader wonderfully.In this book, he travels around America in a car in his journey to find the perfect town, nicknamed \\"Amalstad.\\" Along the way he meets interesting people and places. Nothing escapes his commentary as he drives all around America discovering quaint, small towns and also sharing with us the story of big cities.Bill Bryson has an uncanny knack for connecting to the reader. His writing is similar to a conversation written down. He relates many of his examples to many things that ordinary people have experienced.This book is a must read for anyone. You will be surprised as you learn new things and also laugh at old, all through the eyes of a funny author."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having visited many of the locations he expounds upon I feel his general sour view on life comes through almost all the time. He certainly didn't look for some of the interesting and beautiful attributes of many places. His gratuitous foul language when offering a disgruntled view about a community certainly counters some of the very descriptive language he uses to introduce some communities or locations. I only laughed twice in the entire book; both times were when he had a big dissapointment. I started to feel that he really deserved the bad experience. This is likely my first and last time to read a Bill Bryson piece."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is a gem, which I found after enjoying Bryson's A Walk in the Woods. His humor is indeed often sophomoric, but he spreads it around evenly on himself as well as others, and taken in the right spirit, he is truly funny. Mostly I enjoyed reading along with a U.S. map in hand, learning about towns and sites I may never visit. I wish he would travel the U.S. again and write an updated version. I would love to read it!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was not my first read by Bill Bryson and I will move on to other authors after this read. As I was reading this book I wondered why I had read as much of this author as I have.Bryson tends to look down his nose at people and things that do not meet his obviously cultured standards. His anger whether displayed or passive aggressive has gotten old.An example of my disappointment in this book is the author's report of New York City. Bryson couldn't find anything interesting within the 5 boroughs of the city.His politically correct self contentment is no longer of interest to me."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Once again Bill Bryson hits the open road but this time he is in his car not on foot as he was in his book \\"A Walk In THe Woods\\". Bill travels through 38 States in search of a Mythical town that he used to see portrayed on television during his youth in the 1950's.Bill gets very close to realizing this fantasy at times but finally realizes that this town is basically a mixture of all the good things he discovers in other towns on his journey. This book is very funny and a Joy to read.It is a testament to the author's writing skills that he can make a simple road trip so entertaining and fun to read. Just like John Steinbeck in \\"Travels With Charlie\\" Bill laments the great Superhighways that he finds himself driving on, the disappearance of roadside stalls selling fresh fruit and vegetables and the absence of billboards promoting Burma Shave!!!This is a wondrous tour through small town America . Well done Bill!!!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"bill bryson....is a combination of hilarity and scholarship...i put him down as one of my guests for a &quot;fantasy dinner party&quot;...and this book is one of the reasons why"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This was probably the last Bill Bryson book I will read. I can't help feeling he put almost no effort into it. He drove around America for a few weeks, and spent a few weeks writing two, maybe three drafts. As one of his earlier books, he throws in some often strained \\"hilarity\\" (which sometimes was actually pretty funny, had me laughing out loud and looking forward to reading more), in the style of Paul Rieser's \\"Babyhood\\". His descriptive writing is sometimes good, but nothing so very special overall. But the real problem with this book is that he did nothing on his trips but wander around in a car, and the only people he spoke with were waitresses, order-takers at fast food joints, hotel clerks and gas station attendants--and then the only conversation was about how to meet his needs of the moment, and his only commentary is on how inept they were at doing that. Bill dresses up his little jaunt with some cheap talk about American wealth and industrial structure, to make it seem like serious commentary. But this is no journey to discover America. Compare to \\"Blue Highways\\" by William Least-Heat-Moon, and you will see how facile this book really is. Even a book about Bill Bryson driving around America getting into drunken brawls and looking for prostitutes would have been more interesting."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Take time out to travel with Bryson through the backroads and cities of the USA and discover laid back rural America and the pulse of its metropolitan cities : But be warned : buckle up for the time of your life. The book is highly informative but does, with one sentence, never mind numerous pages, conjure up sharp images of achy-tummy-kind-of-funny. Oprah get a life and give your Book Club a breather - you need go no further than this one to find your spirit in the sheer abandonment of spontaneous laughter. This is not just a funny book - it rockets you into countless, glorious laugh out loud responses. Made me a Bryson addict for life - Come to dinner Bill !"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book gets off to a roaring start. I found it hilarious, though many would find it offensive. Unfortunately, Bill quickly tires of his journey, and the last 80% of the book is non-stop whining. He complains about EVERYTHING."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Usually, Bryson is down right-laugh out loud funny... This book was a whiney travelogue of uninteresting places.There are many lovely, interesting small towns throughout the US, Bryson didn't find one of them. And similarly, there are numerous unique characters in the country and Bryson didn't meet any of them. Just traveling around small towns, expecting some sort of revelation about yourself and life growing up in the middle of nowhere... could happen, but didn't.Not a bright spot among these leaves!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was out in Philadelphia - a very fun and interesting city (if you ignore this book)- when I read this book. What an incredible disappointment. &quot;Razor sharp wit&quot; is too kind of a description of Bryson's wit. Bryson is down right mean in this book. This is a man who made a conscious decision not to live in the United States who returns to supposedly find his &quot;roots&quot; in Iowa. Hey, keep your eyes open. Bryson was more intent on beating it as fast as he could across America to get a book to print for his editors. Although I do agree, the Midwest can be &quot;heavy&quot; even from the perspective of this home-grown Illini, the Midwest also has the most genuinely nice people, pork as a main food group, the best county fairs, little league and every rib fest known to mankind. He seems to have overlooked the POSITIVE aspects of Americans by only reaching for the surface. A Walk in the Woods is a much more enjoyable and funny read than this book. Obviously, putting one foot in front of the other makes one look closer at one's surroundings. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's breakneck tour through small American towns (his running gag is that he's in search of an elusive perfect nostalgic town he calls &quot;Amalgam&quot;) is terribly witty and occasionally dead-on in its lacerating descriptions of American tackiness and silliness. But often his insights are laced with the kind of acid you-can't-get-me cruelty that only an expatriate (Bryson lives in London) can pull off. His wonder at America's foolishness sometimes crosses right over the line to contempt, and that undercuts the truth in his descriptions. Beyond that, he has so much turf to cover (38 states), that he often doesn't do more than drive through a town and criticize the strip malls -- which are of course hideous -- or talk to anyone besides waitresses, motel clerks and cops, who are not always civilization's greatest ambassadors, in America or anywhere else. In a purely technical vein, his gleeful and often funny habit of inventing obviously untrue details forces a reader to wonder, after a while, how much of the more plausible description might also be false.Bryson's a smart guy and a genuine wit. And it's a funny book. But his contemptuousness eats away at his power as a writer and as a guide to his own journey."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I couldn't get past the first few pages and wish I had taken the time to read the reviews of this mean spirited, pompous, derogatory spew from this writer before spending my money. With the daily partisan hatred being flung from the halls of Congress, I didn't need to read it when I was trying to \\"unwind\\" with what was falsely marketed as a \\"hilarious account of one man's rediscovery of America.\\" Hilarious?? Rediscovery of America?? Nothing funny about it. Go back to England, Mr. Bryson!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I had read &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; and loved it. So much so, that all my family members got it as a Christmas gift. On recommendation of a classmate, I checked this book out from the library. Thank god I didn't buy it. It took me forever to read. Mostly because he was just plain mean. I kept picking it up, thinking that it was going to get better. NO. If you aren't into this book within the first 50 pages, your not going to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The publication of the new Bill Bryson boom is now a landmark in my calendar, but this is the book which set it all off. It's simply one of the funniest books I've ever read.However, the book was published some years before A Walk In The Woods, and made Bryson very popular in the UK well before the latter book broke him in the USA. I'd always wondered what US residents would make of his observations on their country, and it's fascinating now to see how varied the reactions are below. These range from the ecstatic to the 'how dare he have a go at the US when he hasn't lived here for 20 years'.So, I'd simply say this. The writing is first class and witty throughout. If Bryson seems a little jaundiced at times, I think this simply shows that he's lived in the UK for 20 years, and that he's illustrating how different the US and British sense of humour can be. But I don't think he's bad-mouthing his country of birth. If anything, the book is affectionate about the country, warts and all. In fact, since the day I read this book, I've wanted to emulate his journey - I only need 3 months off work!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Like lots of folks, my first experience of Bryson was reading his genuinely hilarious account of his Appalachian Trail adventures. So, when I found \\"The Lost Continent\\" on sale at a flea market for a dollar, I snapped it up. Now I'm relieved that that is all it cost me. I started the book with high hopes not only because I'd enjoyed \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" but because I, too, would love to find the perfect small town. I thought that Bryson might help in that quest. In fact, the reason for two stars, rather than one or none, is that he does help in that endeavor. Right from start this book jolted me. [...]. There is some point at which humor crosses the line and becomes just plain nasty. Bryson crosses it frequently; his early chapters are almost unremittingly meanspirited. As just one example, he continually ridicules his father, for whom he claims to have affection, yet seems unaware that he describes exactly the same qualities in himself - for which he finds no fault, but blames others. Specifically, he laughs at his father's difficulty in finding an access road to a tourist attraction to which thousands of others have gained access, yet, in Oxford, Mississippi, Bryson is unable to find William Faulkner's house, a \\"feat\\" thousands of tourists have clearly accomplished. Instead Bryson pokes fun at the polite woman who tries to give him directions. There is no question that Bill Bryson has a very readable style and there is also no question that many of his insights are spot-on funny and perceptive. But were it not for my wish to find \\"perfect\\" small towns to visit, I would have quit the book very early. I genuinely hated - no other word for it - the harshness of his not-at-all funny atttacks on countless people and places."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I purchased this book after I finished reading another of Bryson's books, \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" What a mistake. Bryson's attempts at humor in this book aren't all that funny. His observations about people and places seem unnecessarily cruel. Prehaps Bryson needs to be reminded that the people he makes fun of in this book aren't cardboard cutouts in the landscape of his reality, they are human beings.I have to contrast his views on small town America with those of the late Charles Kuralt. Kuralt always managed to find beauty in the places he visited and goodness in the people he met. Bryson, on the other hand, fails to see the prosperity that the endless fields in the heartland represent. His constant need to demean and make fun of the people who cross his path makes me wonder what could possible motivate him to be so mean-spirited.Might I suggest that Bryson take a tour of a ravaged African nation...prehaps he might come back a greater appreciation of this nation and its people."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"In recounting his journeys through small-town U.S.A., Bryson provides some hilarious episodes and some insights - particularly about the over-commercialization of the landscape and careless destruction of natural and historical treasures. But this book is marred by too many complaints about bad food and lodging as well as careless generalizations, especially about the South. He also appears to have made almost no meaningful contacts with the locals in his travels. Compare this book to William Least Heat Moon's &quot;Blue Highways,&quot; and you will see that Moon is much, much better."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I found this book to be a real disappointment. I was excited to read a book by someone who had done what I've done a number of times - driving cross country and stopping to learn about the land and people - as much as you can in a brief travel. Mr.Bryson seems to have given a cursory look wherever he went. His appraisals seemed to reside, for the most part (okay - a few exceptions) in preconceived notions. It was disappointing - very few insights and a lot of maintaining the sterotypes that are so easily applied to small towns. I'd suggest on his next trip he get out of the car and talk to the people a bit more. The book made me want to go out on my own so that this wasn't the last picture in my mind - it's not much of a picture."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Mean-spirited meandering, arrogant, and self-absorbed.... Confuses ridicule with humor. Since Bryson moved to England and &quot;became&quot; cultured, he appears to view America as a vast wasteland populated with cretinous unwashed bumpkins. Try as I might, I could not bring myself to finish this awful book. I strongly suggest you find your reading pleasure elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Brysons book 'The Lost Continent' sucks. I picked up this book from the library expecting it to be like his other novel, Bill Bryson Down Under. Instead, all I got was (as another reviewer commented) a hate trip down memory lane full of his gratuitous dislike for his home country. The book reads like an adolescent wrote it in high school. He talks about the epidemic of bloated women, calls each town boring, picks on each stereotype he can possibly comment on and doesn't offer much in the way of entertainment. You also get the sense he's a patriot for his adopted country, England, and doesn't have a mote of pride for where he was born. Apparently the grass is greener on the other side for this fellow. I enjoyed Bill Bryson's 'Down Under' as a resident Aussie, but this book has turned me off all Bryson. Trash"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I loved \\"Walk in the Woods\\" so was expecting something along the same lines. However, it didn't take long to realize this was not going to be the same funny and entertaining experience. Shortly into the book it became apparent the book was a vehicle for the author to ridicule everything he dislikes about the US, small-town America, people, and his past. The book is one snide comment after another throughout. The writing is dull, condescending, judgmental, arrogant, and uninteresting. Unfortunately, the writing doesn't even entertain because it's not critical-funny, it's mean-unfunny. The book is page after page of the author telling us how much better he is than everyone else. Save your time and skip this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was really fun to read. Although I didn't find it to be the gut-busting funny that several people apparently do, I did find myself humorously amused throughout most of the reading. One thing is for sure, and that is that Bryson sees American people the way that they really are. I didn't find him to be as condescending as some reviewers did, but rather he seemed to be admitting that he's no better but still finds our ignorance, apathy, laziness, obesity, etc., annoying. It is really great to have unbiased eyes looking at our ways of life and perhaps causing us to consider doing better. I was hoping to learn a bit more about the places he visited, but that aspect is simply absent. This is not an eloquent travel journal. Instead it is Bryson's rant about how he perceives the people he meets during his travels. With that being said, he has pretty good perception, and his rants are totally amusing."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love travel books, and this was a fun one. Bryson drives from Iowa to New England, passing through countless small towns, and also such storied American cities as Charleston, New York City, and Plymouth. Then he drives westward nearly to the Pacific Ocean. Bryson's western loop seems more natural wonder-oriented, as he passes through such magnificent places as Death Valley, Grand Canyon, and Yellowstone.Bryson is British, though he has spent much of his life in the US. His wry, stranger-in-a-strange-land observations on encounters in small-town restaurants and attractions will make you laugh. However, at times Bryson doesn't seem to have enjoyed his trip very much, and his blatant relief at coming home to Des Moines echoes Dorothy Gale in saying, \\"There's no place like home.\\" I've crossed Iowa a few times, and my feelings are the near-opposite of Bryson's. There's nothing like finally escaping the cornfields and flatlands of Iowa!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you'd find humorous the profound misery of someone driving across the country and intentionally avoiding the most interesting parts, and I do, then this book is a nice read. It reads incredibly quickly, as there isn't much information to digest. This is time-passing stuff....plane or bathroom reading, plenty monotonous enough to put you to sleep. But it's also more relevant than ever, and Bryson's acidic observations about the often terrible people that inhabit small town America seem quaint compared with what he might find there now, 20 years later."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was very witty and fun to read. When I read the reviews here it seems that many of those who didn't like it were probably expecting more of a travel guide. This is not a guide to America or it's towns. It is a recounting of a personal journey in which Bryson is searching for the American towns he remembered from his childhood. \\"I wanted to go back to the magic places of my youth-...and see if they were as good as I remembered them being\\" Because he is searching for the magic and for the most part he is not finding it, there is a lot of negative thinking along the way. But we get to enjoy the ride and the wonderful, funny bits of nostalgia as he recounts bits of the many past family vacations, endearing us to his late father and perhaps finding bits of our own past in these stories. He is giving us his opinion of these places, sharing his feelings through these humorous anecdotes as he ventures into the towns and cities along the way. This was a lonely quest but we are allowed to share his thoughts about what he sees has happened to the country vs. his idealized vision from childhood. The places never seem to have the \\"magic\\" and he is often irritated by this and by the tourists and unfriendly people he encounters. The closest he seems to come to finding the magic is at the baseball museum in Cooperstown where he loses himself for three hours, reconnecting to a part of his past that he shared with his sportswriter dad. When he returns home to his Mom's in Des Moines he finds \\"There was just something about it that looked friendly and decent and nice. ...for the first time in a long time I almost felt serene.\\"He has discovered that America has changed but he still finds it endearing when he returns to his home town.Bill Bryson's writing is always enjoyable. He is not Mark Twain, but there were times I got to thinking about Innocents Abroad as I was reading some of his sarcasm and cynicism. It was an enjoyable trip."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Have read a bunch of Bryson over the years; From Troublesome words to Shakespeare to Neither Here Nor There. Bryson has an amazing talent. (Although Walk in the Woods was not my cup of tea) but generally I love his travel books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The first thing I'll remind the reader is that this look at smalltown America took place in the late 1980's. So it is interesting to read what he Bryson sees changing in our country that actually came into being. (Example - our culture lacks patience; we want everything right now.) (Example 2 - visit to the Ford museum finds mostly foreign cars in the parking lot) I found the book well written and very witty.There is an underlying sad tone to the book though. Bryson is recreating some family trips following the death of his father. So he is remembering past trips and missing his father. Also, he is finding some parts of the country where Americans are not as friendly as he had hoped. He remembers the warmth of people during his childhood trips.I would recommend this book for those who enjoy books with a bite and a healthy dose of sarcasm. Also, the comparisons are interesting, from Bryson's childhood to what he finds in the 80's to what you the reader see happening today."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read this after having been through and in a few of the places Bill Bryson mentions in The Lost Continent : Travels in Small-town America, so at the time I found parts of it highly entertaining. Accounts of Nowheresville, USA are not going to be too interesting if you get lots and lots and lots of them, though."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I think Bill Bryson can be very funny. \\"In A Sunburned Land\\" was hilarious, whereas this was pretty much trite and dated humor. In fact it reminded me of the kind of humor undergraduate English Majors at overated eastern liberal arts colleges would find funny. The beginning of the book is an ongoing insult of everyone, the middle he calms dawn, and he ends really trying to force some funny. It's a very dated and poor effort by a usually funny man. Skip it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is another book by a smug expatriate making facile criticisms about life in America. He does this with a fraction of the wit of Paul Theroux. The book is about a road trip he makes across the United States after living many years in England. The problem is, he sticks to long stretches of interstate highway venturing off rarely for a tourist attraction, lodging or food. He then laments the boring stretches of highway, the fastfood (which he always seems to eat) and the motel rooms. He rarely talks to any people except those that work in the aforementioned establishments. He comes off as the fat, ignorant, small-minded and cheap midwestern American that he attempts to label everyone else. He travels to National Parks but doe not venture far from the parking lots. His trip is my idea of a nightmare: logging endless miles trying to hit as many states as possible, seeking out the well-received stereotypes for each area. His father whom he tries to belittle comes off as helluva guy, less smallminded than his son turned out to be."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Other Amazon reviewers have touched on most of what I would say about this book (leaves one prone to extended periods incapacitated by laughter, brings on violent urges to read it aloud to any available form of animate life). Bryson induces these symptoms with his ability to let us see the world through his insider/outsider perspective. He turns the obvious over and shows us the idiocies, idiosyncracies, and illusions of everyday life. Best of all, he takes nothing, especially not himself, too seriously, and yet doesn't lose sight of what is really important"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After reading only half of this book it's clear Bryson is bored. Perhaps he should just put away the typewriter, go work at Walmart as a greeter and work on his social skills.(Acually, I would buy that book!) Or maybe he should go out into the middle of a lightening storm so he can almost get hit by lightening. Maybe that would jolt some life back into his writing.I'm used to, and can enjoy, Bryon's quasi-European thumbing of his nose on small town America and its inhabitants. But, I've read my computer manual with more facination. A day in the life of Bryson on the road: Get up, eat breakfast at lowlife cafe, drive under grey skies, look at stupid plaque denoting historical significance of area, eat lunch at a lowlife cafe, drive, reflect on childhood with father, eat dinner at lowlife cafe, get a hotel, watch the local access channel and ponder how it reflects stupid Americans, go to bed, repeat past day all over again....and again, and again.I'll read his Austrailian book due to all the great reviews. It may sound crazy, but I actually feel a little bit bad for Bryson. He seemed very sad as he drove...and sadly missed...a great country."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson hilariously captures the unique combination of delight, embarrassment, and boredom that only a drive across the United States can bring. Anyone who has taken the cross-country drive with the family will recognize the America Bryson captures so well. For every toxic passage that leads the reader to question whether Bryson is a misanthrope (e.g., his numerous descriptions of obese, tacky American tourists), there's a passage of pure delight, such as Bryson's description of the squares in downtown Savannah, Georgia. Despite any clear plot other than to keep moving and see everything, Bryson through his wit and insight compels the reader to join him on this journey.It's an understatement to call Bryson funny -- several passages had me laughing out loud. This is the first of Bryson's works that I've read, and I'm looking forward to diving into the rest of them."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book focus' on Byson's trip through small town Amercia looking for the perfect small town. Part autobiographical (stories about growing up in rural Iowa and his family vacations), and part travel commentary, this book is laugh out loud funny. Bryson has some sharp comments on US race relations, and doesn't think much of the South, but his commentary is largely dead on.A thoroughly enjoyable read, covering raods most of us will never travel. Very well done."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Hit the road with Bryson and you can never be at a loss for things to complain about, to make fun of, and sometimes to take seriously. Here I am reading this in 2003 and I find many things a little outdated but informative and entertaining nonetheless. For example, Bryson travels to Yellowstone National Park less than a year before it was hit by its most ferocious fire in recent history (1988). He tunes in to Jimmy Swaggart feeling remorse for his transgressions with tears endlessly rolling down his cheeks.Bryson can get a little annoying at times when you think he is most probably just making up names of people and places. Making fun of people's accents can be tiresome at times. Just to keep his reader engrossed, he imbues his narrative with digressions about his family, his relatives, and his fantasies, which is another way of emphasizing how tedious driving across large swaths of land in some parts of the country can be. The change of attitude from detesting his home state to finding it as the best place it can be at the end of his road trip was comforting.As a traveler, Bryson is hard to categorize. He is definitely not a typical tourist as he detests tourist traps, theme parks, and overpriced historical and quasi-historical landmarks. He does not seem to be an &quot;outdoorsy&quot; person, for even if he makes diversions to national parks, as opposed to passing by and not stopping, there is hardly any mention of day hikes. This, however, can be explained by the off-season timing of his trips to most of the national parks, especially in the West. He revels in taking side roads and byways to check out both natural and historical destinations, and does not mind pushing more miles (40-70 miles) just to find a reasonable place to stay, to dine, or to have a big breakfast. His sense of place is strong, perhaps owing to what he referred to as the Midwesterner's bent for knowing their geographical directions given the topographical monotony of their region.A map of the 48 states, or a composite showing his fall trip to the eastern half and his spring trip to the western half of the country would have been helpful in guiding people through his personal road trip.I am partial to the western part of the United States in terms of desirable travel destinations, and I did look forward to the beginning of his western journey starting with Colorado and New Mexico. I was therefore offended by his remark on the profusion of Spanish place names, where an attitude smacked of ugly Americanism, a trait that did not seem to have been diluted after two decades of living in Britain. Here's an excerpt from page 272: &quot;...so that every place in the Southwest is called San this or Santa that. Driving across the Southwest is like an 800-mile religious procession. The worst name on the whole continent is the Sangre de Cristo Mountains...have you ever heard of a more inane name for any geographical feature?&quot; I guess it takes an upbringing in a Spanish-infused culture to gain an appreciation for Spanish nomenclature. If anything, the names are melodious, it not vividly descriptive. What to say of &quot;Sierra Nevada&quot; (snowy mountains)? Or &quot;La Sal Mountains&quot; (salt mountains) in southeastern Utah? Bryson would have thought that ridiculous, when the Spanish explorers, in the middle of red-rock desert, thought they were seeing salt instead of snow on the mountain crests! &quot;Sangre de Cristo&quot; (blood of Christ) is a powerful description for the color of the mountains at dusk. Is the inaneness, according to our dear author, because of the morbid nature of the description??? These Spanish names are beautiful, and they testify to the permanent hold Spanish exploration has on this huge geographical area of the country.The names given by the Spanish, in my opinion, are more imaginative and descriptive than some of the English names such as &quot;Collegiate Peaks&quot; (Colorado), &quot;Green Mountains&quot; (Vermont), &quot;White Mountains&quot; (New Hampshire, California, and Arizona), &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; and &quot;Smoky Mountains&quot;."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"While humorous at times, the book seems to be an endless dialouge of Mr. Bryson's dissappointment of small town America. The author does a good job of describing the countless towns he visits enabling the reader to be an armchair traveller with a good view of life in U.S., but I found myself depressed at the end of each chapter as he conveys his distaste for the people, food, accomidations and atmosphere of every town he visits.If you want Bryson at his best read A Walk In The Woods, a &quot;pee-your-pants&quot; funny book of his travels on the Appalachian Trail"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I enjoyed Bryson's Walk in the Woods and recommend it frequently. I wish I could say the same about this book. Bryson would be the ultimate joykill on a road trip: arrogant, exceedingly negative and critical, and unable to poke fun at himself. Buy Walk in the Woods instead."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After spending most of my life seeing the rest of the world, I just completed a spectacular 11-month drive on the two-lane roads of America. Although I agree there are plenty of warts, such as fast-food restaurants in embarrassing numbers, I chalked those up to &quot;progress&quot; in a country that is otherwise truly magnificent, and I'll never stop being grateful that it's mine. Am just glad I didn't depend on Bryson's opinion before the trip, or I'd never have realized the dream of a lifetime! His writing style is clever and witty - too bad America-bashing is how he employs it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I am a big fan of Bill Bryson, his books are great, and they always make me laugh. This book however fell short, all it could muster was a few chuckles. I liked the book, it was however somewhat repetetive with lots of talk about gas stations and grubby restaurants and Bill's harsh reviews of most of the towns he travelled through. It was an interesting book nonetheless. If you're a big Bryson fan, might as well read it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"JUST READ THIS BOOK ON A PLANE GOING BACK TO FRANCE, SPEND SOME WEEKS IN THE DEEP NOWHERE FROM THE DEEP AMERICA, THIS VIEW POINT REFLECTS EXACTLY WHAT AN EUROPEAN CAN FEEL ABOUT UNITED STATES : A MELT OF LOVE (YES, REALLY !)

C'EST A LA FOIS UNE CRUELLE SATIRE DE L'AMERIQUE PROFONDE MAIS AUSSI UNE VISION EFFRAYEE DE CE QUE SONT (OU VONT DEVENIR) LES EUROPEENS."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I always enjoy Bill Bryson's sense of humor. I do wish that, occasionally, he would give those of us who chose to remain in Iowa a slight break. We're really not all fat and stupid, or farmers! I know he came from Des Moines and grew up within my decade but I think he has lost the Iowa loyalty that most of us have. Other than that, I think his book is a lot of fun and I will continue reading his interpretations of America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"In keepin' with some 'o the otha remarks on this hear review page, I'd jus' like ta say that Mr. Bill Bryson is condasendin' of 'Merica, condasendin' of 'Merican values, and - above all - condasendin' of 'Merican small towns and the fine folk and farm animals who inhibit them. How he could live on some depressin', foggy lil' island like England (which we dun saved durin' WWII and protected during the Cold War, lessin' it become some Soviet satellite) for two whole decades and then return to the good ol' US of A and NOT APPRECIATE the value of strip malls. clogged highways, and fried chicken joints is beyond me. This book may be funny to them there thinkin' folks, but what Mr. Bryson's got to realize is that thinkin' folks like him is the overwhelming minority, and to that I say good riddance. An' heck, if someone actually listened to his whinin' and criticizin', then 'Merica might actually start changin'; it might start listenin' to the people, and imagine what where that might lead. The glasses in England may be half empty Mr. Bryson (and I reckon they's plenty smudgy, too), but the ones hear in the Land of the Free are ALWAYS half full. So, why don't you saddle on up and ride on back across the Pacific to yer' beloved Britain. What's that? You did? Well, good!PS: I really enjoyed your 'A Short History of Nearly Everything.' 'Mother Tongue' was enlightening too.Billy-Joe Barndoor, author"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"My daughter and I were in a bookstore a few years ago and the saleslady said she had just read this book. I think it's hilarious. I sent Mr. Bryson a letter in care of the publishing company and got a nice letter from England from him several months later - he said it probably came to him via &quot;snail mail&quot;- my daughter and I each have copies of most of his books. I haven't read the newest about Australia but I'm sure I'll add it to my collection. I understand he is now living back in the U.S."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson could be a fine writer if he wasnt so enamored with himself. While going on a 36 state trip for most people would be exciting and fun, Bryson makes it out to be the most boring and inane trip of all time. If he had spent a little more time telling us about the wonderful places he visited instead of the many way he can find them unappealing, he would have a fine book. I think he lived in the UK far too long.Not only was this book a waste of time, it was a waste of his."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I quit about halfway through this book. Making fun of people does not hold my interest and is not humorous."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Except for the Little Brown Church in the Vale, it is hard to find anything of consequence to put on a viewmaster slide of Iowa, Bill Bryson's native state. Directions are important to Midwesterners. There is an absence of landmarks in middle America.At Pella there is a tulip festival every May. Speech in southern Illinois is more southern than midwestern. The author drives to Oxford, Mississippi. The students at the university there look serene, and it is impossible to imagine their parents rioting against the entrance of James Meredith. Tupelo is thirty miles east. Columbus, Mississippi is a jewel. In Columbus, per the COMMERICAL DISPATCH, the police don't have crimes, they have activities. Next, passing through Alabama, Bryson is in Tuscaloosa, Selma, and Tuskegee. In Auburn Bryson wonders why there isn't a decent bookstore since it is a college town.The Little White House of Warm Springs, Georgia is of interest. The cottage is snug and appealing. At Lafayetter Square in Savannah there are brick paths, trickling fountains, and Spanish moss. There are two hundred year old houses. There is perfection. There are one thousand historic buildings in Savannah. Beaufort, South Carolina has mansions, too, and a little parrk and an marina. At Charleston there is detailed Victorian ornateness.In the Great Smoky Mountains the author stays at Bennett's Court, and old-fashioned motel. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most popular national park. In Gatlinburg Bryson goes to the Ripley Believe It or Not Museum. Mount Vernon is genuine, educational, interesting, unlike Williamsburg. Delaware is the most obscure of all of the American states. After visiting friends in Philadelphia and enjoying a view of Fairmont Park, Bryson has a good time touring the Eisenhower farm near Gettysburg. He states a long bus ride in America resembles a prison stay. He leaves his car in Bloomsburg with friends to go to the Big Apple. Later he hits New England and proceeds westward to return to the midwest, Clevemland. He drives to Toledo on the Ohio Turnpike, and then to Dearborn, Michigan.The Henry Ford Museum is in Dearborn. It is enthralling and the scale is breathtaking. No cars or motorized vehicles are allowed on Mackinac Island. In Nebraska the author looks for Winterset, birthplace of John Wayne, and Red Cloud for the Willa Cather connection. Dropping down to Kansas to Russell, (Bob Dole), he finds that Dodge City is West. Holcomb, IN COLD BLOOD, is beyond Dodge City. Bryson dubs the Clutter murders grisly and sensational. It seems that IN COLD BLOOD had been banned from the public library in Holcomb. People hated the book.Cripple Creek and some of the other famous places in Colorado now cater to tourists. He visits St John's campus in Santa Fe, New Mexico to see his niece. Nothing prepares a person for seeing the Grand Canyon. Nevada is the state with the highest crime rate. California yeilds recollections of television watching in childhood. Sequoia National Park is an exciting prospect, an opportunity to drive through a tree.Sun Valley, Idaho was built in the thirties, it seems, by the Union Pacific Railroad as a ski resort. Yellowstone is the oldest national park in the world. Bryson believes Custer was an idiot and a brute. There wasn't much to the Battle of Little Bighorn. Bryson tries to eat in Sundance and discovers the restaurant has been comandeered by Shriners. He travels to South Dakota to Mount Rushmore, seeing it is free, and moves next into Minnesota and Iowa, to his relief. After Storm Lake, another college town, the trip is completed.Parts of the book are very funny."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Save your money, don't buy this book. Too bad I can't give this book a NO-STAR rating. Bryson seems to find little to like in the US. He's surprised by the sand on Cape Cod and amazed by southern accents. I got a few laughs at the start of this book, but soon it turned nasty and cynical. Bryson wants to follow in the footsteps of Dave Barry, but Barry offers humor without the caustic bite I find in Bryson's writing. I got halfway through this book and tossed it in the paper-recycle bin."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"A boring trip written by a fat, coarse author. I'm thankful I've traveled many of the states that make up the USA without Bryson's help. It is true that many people in the United States regret the demise of the Americana of our cities and towns, but his portrayal was oftentimes unfair or simply incorrect. Too many drinks do an eye blear. Under those circumstances it might have been better for us and Mr. Bryson had he just forgotten this entire trip. Thank goodness, he writes more humorously and intellectually and less self-centeredly in his later years."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Just because a writer can turna phrase doesn't make what he says funny. Apparently Bryson needed to make a car payment so he cranked out this book. There clearly is not a town or a person in America that Bill Bryson cares for, so it's a good thing he lives in England. This is not a gentle joshing of small town quirks or traditions - it's outright trashing of everything he sees right down to calling the waitresses ugly and wishing he could bash an old lady's head because she talked too much. I didn't finish it, and frankly, I'm not turning it back to the used bookstore - I'm throwing it away. You want a travelogue through small-town America? Go read Steinbeck or Charles Kuralt, or plenty of others."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I bought this book in Gatwick London; and read it on the way to Pennsylvania. I then worked in the US for a year. I was very much engaged by this book. 'A Walk in the Woods' is a great read but this is even better. I understand why people living in the USA might be upset by the book, but Bryson is after all, a US citizen. The UK is THE home of the USA, and vice-versa. The USA-UK allegiance is the most important in history."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After reading this waggish travel book I've made up my mind to see the Grand Canyon - one day -and never to eat food provided by any establishment connected to a highway especially if the food is described as a &quot;Pastie&quot; cf English cuisine. Travelling through 38 states driving his mother's Chevette, sleeping in motels, visiting tourist sites, national parks and towns he renames to protect the innocent, Mr Bryson's candid comments, fun about local accents ( &quot; how doo yew lack Mississippi?), potted statistics and historical info make for an enjoyable read. Most amusing bits to me: his interaction with waitresses. &quot; The hostess came over. She was chewing gum and didn't look over friendly. ' Help you?' She said. 'I'd like a table for one, please.' She clicked her gum in an unattractive fashion. 'We're closed.' 'You look pretty open to me.' 'It's a private party. They've (the Shriners) reserved the restaurant for the evening.' ' I'm stranger in town. Can you tell me where else I can get something to eat!' She grinned, clearly pleased to be able to give me some bad news. 'We're the only restaurant in Sundance' she said."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"In many ways your typical 'i went here and did this' travel book, but with one major exception...this is actually very, very funny. What basically adds up to a series of stories connected by the mythical search for Amalgam, USA and the author (and America's) lost youth and inocence. I have no idea where Bryson finds some of the hilarious historical annecdotes but the really memorable moments are snippets from HIS past life. A real classic."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"'The Lost Continent' should come with a government health warning: DANGER! READING THIS BOOK MAY SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH! I laughed so loud, so long and so much that I was convulsed with physical pain. As the tears rolled down my cheeks and I clutched my ribs, doubled up with mirth, my kids asked &quot;What's wrong, dad?&quot; And I tried to explain (when I was able to catch enough breath) that, far from there being anything wrong, it was the effect this wonderful book was having on me.It is a hilarious, sarcastic, in-yer-face look at the States through ex-pat Bryson's eyes. His style might not appeal to everyone (if some of the readers' reviews on this page are anything to go by), but his time away from the land of his birth has given him a distance which enables him to perceive things which those who have not been away might either not be aware of, or prefer to overlook. And, boy, does he notice things. Few aspects of the American way of life escape his scrutiny.And that's the real gist of the book. Bryson is not just out to do a hatchet job, in fact, I'm not even sure he IS doing a hatchet job. What he does is display a real compassion and concern for the way in which his native country - the lost continent of the title - has lost its way in the decades he has been away.Readers who castigate this book are surely overlooking the fact that, deep down, it is a heartfelt plea from an American to Americans to stop and take a look at themselves and take stock of just what is happening to their wonderful country.It would have been easy for Bryson merely to have cracked a string of jokes and poked fun. That would have been the mark of a lesser writer. No, the real beauty of the book lies in the way in which he transcends this and makes his book into a valuable piece of social commentary.To the reviewers on this page who have mumped about the book and given it one measly star, I say - lighten up! It takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown!To anyone who is looking for a SERIOUSLY funny read and is interested in a travel book which is not afraid to go beyond the bounds of 'accepted' travel writing, I urge you to buy a copy of 'The Lost Continent' a.s.a.p., if not sooner!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It is clear half way through this thing that the author hates, among so many other things, strip malls, fast food chains, cheap motels, tourist traps and old people. Yet he drives endlessly through America searching them out - on a good day, endlessly complaining and on a bad day - making fun of them. What starts out as a mission of discovery turns into a mission of ridicule. The beauty of America lies in its diversity. Yet if you if you were from another planet and read this travelogue first, you wouldn't even stop in for a cup of coffee. And that's really too bad."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson should be ashamed of himself. &quot;Lost Continent&quot; is one of the biggest rip-offs of a travel book that I have ever read. Few could argue with his conclusion that small-town America is a plastic-and-Big-Mac cultural wasteland. But his attempt to fob this book off as some sort of substantive commentary borders on fraud. He picks an easy target and follows that up with an embarassingly lazy reporting regimen which consists of driving around the country, stopping at motels for the night, and resuming this in-depth &quot;research&quot; this next morning. How is anyone going to get a feel for small-town America -- or anywhere, for that matter -- if the only people they interact with are gas station attendants, motel receptionists and the occasional ticket-booth person at a local tourist attraction? And he seems totally blind to his hypocrisy. In effect, he becomes what he so condescendingly condemns about small-town America, -- the junk food, slap-dash, tacky &quot;culture&quot;, the low-value products -- by lustily wolfing down Big Macs and cranking out a shoddy book that doesn't come close to scratching the surface of his stated subject. Rather than the cultured and disgusted observer he appears to want to be seen as, Bryson's true identity is revealed with this book: fat, lazy crank. There's plenty of other thoughtful, in-depth travel writing on the market. Don't encourage Bryson's to perpetrate further scams by shelling out for this one. Dan Martin, Singapore"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I got this book after greatly enjoying \\"A Walk in the Woods.\\" I had been so interested with that book I wanted to hike the Appalachian Trail!This book was just the opposite. Bryson provides a disappointing description of his travels around the United States, picking on most of the places he visits by highlighting their lowlights."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As I find my self struggling to finish this book, I think Bill Bryson and I have something in common. He should stop traveling, because clearly he does not enjoy it; I should stop reading his negative rants and raves about small town America, because, frankly, it is getting painful. Reading this book has put me in a terribly bad mood -- his negativity is causing me to toss and turn all night, and to meet even the best dreams with sarcastic criticism. I am very disappointed, mostly because I LOVED &quot;A Walk in the Woods.&quot; Perhaps the travels chronicled in &quot;A Lost Continent&quot; are too fraught with negative childhood memories, and he can't get over it and enjoy some of the amazing experiences he could have had. I want to write my own book, &quot;The Lost Bill Bradley: The trip that could have been.&quot; I'll re-trace his steps, and show the world all the great things he missed. Skip this book, but I would encourage you to read &quot;A Walk in the Woods,&quot; which is really rather enjoyable. I only hope that &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; (which I also bought based on my feelings about &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;) is better."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill's writing always amuses me. I love all he does.Although not \\"deep\\" by any stretch of the imagination, his observations ring true more often than not."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson writes a book taking the mickey out of the Brits, and the Brits all review it saying how funny and accurate it is. Bryson writes a book taking the mickey out of us Americans and we become terribly offended and complain that it's not classic travel literature. Lighten up guys, he's joking. Is our self-esteem so insecure that we cannot take a bit of mocking? Maybe that's what Euros don't like about us...."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love Bill Bryson's books. Love the way he writes. But in \\"Lost Continent\\" (and also \\"Neither Here Nor There\\", his European travel account) he tirelessly complains about everything. Towns aren't pretty enough. Towns are too prettified. Too loud. Too quiet. The people are fat. The television programming is terrible. The awful food. The expensive prices. On and on and on.The irony is that Bryson himself is fat and slovenly, and in \\"Lost\\" drives, of all cars, a Chevette. How is it that Bryson can complain about American's lack of cultural appreciation and yet for every hotel he stays at in America (and Europe, in \\"Neither here nor there\\") the one thing he's sure to comment on is the television and/or the TV programming at the hotel, as if that were a reason a person travels.In short, Bill, you are yourself the embodiment of the fat American traveler from Des Moines that you take such pains to deride throughtout both of these books. It's no wonder you always travel alone - you'd be an excrutiating travel companion."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was practically forced into my hands by someone who knows I am from the MidWest, not far from Kankakee, which Bryson mentions on page 42....and my daughters went to school in DeKalb, the very name of which Bryson finds unpleasant. I consider myself somewhat &quot;cosmopolitan,&quot; having grown up in Chicago and now living in San Jose, but I spent 25 years in the middle of my life in one of those sleepy little farm towns with the grain elevators. Those people he depicts as dumb, uneducated, totally uninformed, etc. are really the backbone of America, the people who keep her fed, working, taxes paid, etc. It's also very odd to me that we all know it is politically incorrect to point out people's differences or features or disabilities and make fun of them. We can't make ethnic jokes or &quot;gimp jokes&quot; without being thought insensitive. Yet in page after page, he makes disparaging remarks about any overweight person he encounters, even if he thinks he is being clever by calling them &quot;clammy&quot; or &quot;meaty.&quot; He makes an automatic judgement that each of those overweight persons (usually a woman is his target) is somehow unworthy, not interesting, not entirely clean, sloppily dressed, and not a good wife or mother. If you think this is an exaggeration, re-read those paragraphs. Apparently to him, being fat is the number one sin in mid-America.Yes, some towns have only a gas station and a Dairy Queen and their idea of a good time is the annual summer all-town picnic. But that's their life. The idea of traveling is to observe and to enjoy the culture, food, scenery, and ideas of others, not to laugh at it and go away smugly congratulating yourself on being &quot;better than them.&quot;I tried, but I could not finish this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson is a delightful and funny book about his 38-state road trip throughout the United States. In many respects, Bryson reminds me of Tony Horowitz (Confederates in the Attic, Baghdad without a Map), although with more of a dark side.Bryson grew up in Iowa, but then moved to England after graduating from college. Twenty years later, \\"I became quietly seized with the nostalgia that overcomes you when you have reached the middle of your life and your father has recently died and it dawns on you that when he went he took some of you with him. I wanted to go back to the magic places of my youth.\\" Having lost my own dad two months ago, I can certainly identify with this sentiment. The other purpose of his trip was to discover the perfect small town. He was looking for \\"a place of harmony and industry, a place without shopping malls and oceanic parking lots, without factories and drive-in churches.\\" Borrowing his mother's Chevette, he sets out across America.Bryson visits cities and small towns, national parks and local curiosities. Throughout his travels, he regales us with his observations and witticisms. He gets sidetracked from some intended destinations due to the weather, road closures, etc. He decides to skip the Biltmore Estate when he discovers that the entrance fee is $17.50 (and this is in 1990). He bails out on Beaufort, SC when he comes upon a sign prohibiting just about everything--\\"I don't know what sort of mini-Stalins they have running the council in Beaufort.\\" He is disappointed in a number of towns including Holcomb, Kansas (site of the famous Clutter murders from In Cold Blood) and Mark Twain's hometown, Hannibal, Missouri. Some places are a pleasant surprise including Philadelphia, although \\"No other city in American pursues the twin ideals of corruption and incompetence with quite the same enthusiasm.\\" And then there are the places that he finds just awesome. The mansions in Newport, RI are \\"a cross between a wedding cake and a state capital building\\" and as for the Grand Canyon, \\"no matter how many times you read about it or see it pictured, it still takes you breath away.\\"Bryson's road trip also provides him with a chance to reminisce about his family vacations. I had tears rolling down my cheeks reading about the \\"bombs\\" he and his siblings lobbed out the window made up of Ohio Blue Tip matches stuck into apples and oranges. He also reflects on all the changes since he grew up in the US, including billboards and RVs. \\"RVs are like life-support on wheels. Astronauts go to the moon with less backup.\\"My only complaint is that Bryson didn't always get his facts quite right. Lucy Mercer was not FDR's secretary, but Eleanor's social secretary and it's doubtful that they did any \\"rustic bonking\\" at Warm Springs, GA. But overall, I truly enjoyed The Lost Continent and will definitely be reading more of Bryson in the future."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I picked this book up after reading \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"Mother Toungue,\\" both amazing books that broadened my appreciation for life and nourished me with laughter. This older book was not up to par with his newer writing. I won't re-hash the premise and mechanics of this book (it's already been done well), but I will say that I laughed through the first third, smirked through the middle third, and dutifully soldiered on to the end. I got the impression that he was too tired to appreciate part two of his trip, and perhaps would have been more charitable (or at least funnier) had he put more time between the two trips. Whereas the first half was imaginative in its snarkiness, the second half read like a flight log penned by an AM Talk Radio host (Very rough paraphrase): \\"Went to Bilgewater, MT and found the most convenient (sic)ho el and the waitress at the only restaurant was a gum-chewing twit. What a dump. Went to Muffinthatch, KS and found the most convenient hotel and I was afraid the waitress would spit in my food.\\" And so on...On the other hand, the tone Bryson gradually affects in the book mimics beautifully the weary, inarticulate crabbiness you'd experience at the end of a long road trip, the kind of curmudgeonly disdain for all which we would all begin to feel after the seventeenth dive diner in nineteen days of a roadtrip across the American West.Bottom line: Don't pay full price for this book. Find it at a library or bargain bin, read the first half for painfully frequent bouts of laughter, and then set it aside before it gets tedious.A final note: one should not search for great small towns in America by aimlessly traveling the interstate. The sort of small towns that might have uplifted Bryson were probably lurking on nearby state and local roads. For anyone considering a great American roadtrip who is looking for a shade of De Toqueville, try looking up cities that have won various civic awards like \\"All American City,\\" and \\"Most Livable City.\\" I think you'll have better luck."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"That old saw, \\"you can never go home\\" has rarely been more in evidence than in this book by then-expatriate Bryson. Having lived England for over a decade, he decides to return to his native Iowa and embark on a hazily conceived cross-country road trip. The \\"road trip\\" is a distinctly American invention, born of the combination of affluence, the interstate highway system, and the size of America. It's usually invoked as a framework on which to build a tale of discovery, and here Bryson intends to rediscover and ostensibly celebrate small-town America. Touching base in Des Moines to see his mother, he sets out to locate a real-life version of the perfect movie-set small towns of his childhood films.He begins the trip with frequent stories about his now-dead father, who would drag the family on horrendous family vacations each summer. Unfortunately, his father merely comes across as a cliche bumbling father, always getting lost, too proud to ask for directions, stingy, and choleric toward the equally cliche kids in the back seat. Thankfully as Bryson moves outside of the zone of his childhood vacations, stories of his father disappear. This allows the meat of the book to emerge&oacute;small town America. And in Bryson's eyes, it's not a pretty scene. It doesn't take long for him to realize that chain stores have spread their tentacles across the land and places that might have once have character are now becoming anonymous assemblages of strip malls and parking lots. Because Bryson's been overseas, he assumes a stunned \\"what happened!?\\" attitude to this transformation. What happened is the inexorable intersection of a capitalist economy with a consumer society, where chain operations enjoy the economies scale that allow them to offer the cheapest prices to the consumer, who naturally responds. Bryson (rightfully) rails against the loss of character and individuality this engenders in communities across the country. Of course, this is a trend that has only increased in the fifteen years since the book first appeared, and there's little end in sight.To be sure, Bryson's account is not meant to be a fair-minded, clinical observation. Clearly intended for a British audience, Bryson is always keen to make a broad generalization, cheap joke, snide jibe, or catty comment about what and who he encounters. While this is sometimes entertaining, it often crosses into sheer mean-spiritedness. A particular target of his is the overweight, which he seems to believe is a uniquely American phenomenon&oacute;rich, when you see statistics suggesting that the British are on their way to passing Americans in the obesity stakes. In any event, there's lots of haranguing about fast food, bad food, scummy hotels, lame tourist traps, and the interchangeability of so many small towns. Eventually, he realizes that the perfect town doesn't exist (although there are three or four he ends up really liking), and he'll have to piece it together in his head from the standout parts of different places.The 14,000 mile, 38 state (he doesn't get to the deep south, the Pacific Northwest, or the upper northeast) trip isn't very useful per se. Anyone who knows nothing about the backroads of America is going to be horrified, anyone who has a bad opinion about the backroads of America will find plenty of confirmation, and anyone who likes the backroads of America (or lives there) will probably be infuriated. Ultimately, much of the book has a kind of distasteful elitist tone to it, when Bryson does stumble across something he likes, it's treated as an unexpected boon that's all the more shocking for being in the hinterland. I've read almost every one of his other books, and for the most part, greatly enjoyed them, but this isn't of nearly the same quality."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Funny, but Mr. Bryson tries too hard making the book funny for his English audience. Most of his preconceptions are outdated. Since the book is 10 years old, some of that is understandable. It would have been better had he compared his actual experience against the preconception rather than telling of the foreboding preconception and then fitting the experience to it. If you're from the UK and love this book -- great, but it's not an actual depection of reality in the USA."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"While I have enjoyed other books by Bryson, especially Made in America, I found this one to me more mean spirited than funny. I, like some of the other reviewers, have been to many of the places written about here and do not recognize them from Bryson's descriptions."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Generally I find Bill Bryson audio books a great way to distract myself while cleaning or doing other hideous things, but this one is the exception. When I discovered that it was a 2-CD audio book, I assumed that it must be the abridged version. Now I don't think so--the narrator talks so fast that I'm surprised the second CD was even necessary. The charm of a Bryson audio book is its story-telling feel. The auctioneer pace of this book lacks that particular charm. I had to continually pause the book to catch my mental breath.The story itself lacks the charm of \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" or \\"Notes from a Small Island.\\" After living for 20 years in England, Bill Bryson decides to take a road trip through America, beginning in Iowa where he grew up. Unlike the other Bryson books, the author is overwhelmingly negative about almost everything he encounters. In his other books, Bryson encounters oddities and odd people in a humorous fashion, sometimes even with delight. This book is completely different, almost hostile. If you are a Bryson fan desperate for a new Bryson book, you might enjoy it. If you are not familiar with Bryson, try \\"Mother Tongue,\\" \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything,\\" or \\"In a Sunburned Country.\\""},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Yes, this is a funny book. Bill Bryson is funny, but his editors give him too much leeway. If you want to write about small town America then get off the Interstate Highways! And when you do get off the highway do not be surprised if staying in a motel with a superior attitude does not cause each town to open its secrets to you and invite you in. Fact of the matter is, the reason he comes across so many surly people in his travels in America or England is probably because most everyone he meets doesn't like him. It was with amazement that I read his &quot;revelations&quot; about how the interstate highways are all the same. Well, duuuh! I think with even the smallest foresight one would realize this and a good editor very quickly would say &quot;Uh Bill, can you get off I95 sometime?&quot; part way through his trip. If you want a true travel story about a funny guy travelling through small town America, read &quot;Out West&quot; by Dayton Duncan - small town America is still out there."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The Lost Continent is Bill Bryson's account of his random wanderings through America. It's important to take note of exactly who Bryson is; he's an Anglophile who lived for 20 years in England, and he's also a native of Iowa. This book is exactly what you'd expect from a man like that.Bryson searches for small town perfection and, for the most part, fails to find it. (This is not surprising; he has made a career out of disappointment. He obtained similar results on a tour of England, and he loves *that* county.) Instead, he finds modern America: strip malls, shopping centers, and truck stops interspersed with occasional historic landmarks and scenes of great beauty.The author states in the beginning of the book that his journey was inspired by the death of his father. Bryson describes his father as a tight-fisted, irrascible man constantly in search of (free) historic monuments. Although Bryson spends a good chunk of time making fun of his father, his narrative is stunning support for theories of genetics. Bryson whines about the cost of motels ($30 - $40), rants about the cost of admission to tourist attractions ($2.50 - $15.00, for the most part), and shows a remarkable ability to seek out the dullest portions of any town.This is a humorous look at the parts of America that most Americans are smart enough to avoid. The narrative just brings you a little too close to an author who seems to have made it his life's work to be just slightly more irritable and irrational than the next guy."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious, and Bill Bryson, is, in my opinion, the best writer the planet ever produced.Boy oh boy do I envy anyone who has not read Bill Bryson's books, because you still have all that pleasure in front of you!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"We all know what big cities are like, but how about small towns? Of course Bill Bryson did not (& obviously could not) visit all small towns in his home country, this book satisfied my curiosity towards small towns in America.I guess there's always irresistible charm of overland travel, and Bryson described his overland trip with hilarious writing style.One suggestion: if the editor could add a route map at the beginning of book showing Bryson's itinerary, it would be even better."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is typical Bill Bryson, ie one very funny book.

He has a lot of good things ,and not so good things to say about us. Not a very deep read, but definitely an enjoyable one.And informative, too.

I have never laughed out loud reading anything before I read this book. With tongue firmly planted in cheek, Bill Bryson wends his way down memory lane mixed with the bite of present day reality. This is one hilarious story. I liked it so much I bought the audio version and had to stop and cringe when the narrator refered to Nehi pop as &quot;Neh-hee&quot; rather than &quot;Nee-high&quot; - who edits these things?

This book documents a trip by car around America, starting and ending in Des Moines, after many years in the UK. The ostensible theme of the book is a search for the perfect small town; a sort of Ray Bradbury idealization of fifties America. There's no such town, of course, but Bryson just uses the theme as a springboard for some of the funniest descriptions, stories, and digressions I have ever read.When I started reading this book, I laughed so much my wife wouldn't let me read it in bed. Then she picked it up and discovered how funny it was, and wanted to read it before me. Eventually we compromised, and kept it in the car; the rule was that whoever was driving had to read it to the driver. Several times, however, the reader was laughing so hard that they couldn't get comprehensible words out, and the driver had to pull over to the hard shoulder and grab the book for themselves.Yes, he's a curmudgeon, as other reviewers here have noticed. That's just his style. He's not deep, either; his occasional ruminations aren't negligible, but he's no Mark Twain. But he has an acidly sharp eye for inanity and stupidity, and his anecdotal technique is flawless.His other travel books are along much the same lines, but to me this is the funniest, though &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; does show he is capable of good introspective writing. &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is sharp, satirical, acute, and unkind--wickedly funny in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished \`Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie. the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in \`In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of \`Lost Continent' and \`In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in \\"In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is my third Bill Bryson book. Thank goodness this was not my first, for I probably would not have picked up &quot;In a Sunburned Country,&quot; and &quot;A Walk In The Woods.&quot;Where Bryson's latest books are droll, witty and endearing, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is frequently petty, forced and mean. In this book Bryson travels around 38 states in a beat up Chevette, often through small towns and out of the way places not usually visited by many. He didn't have a very good trip.Most of this book revolves around the author's put-downs of people he sees and caustic comments about places he visits. After a few hundred pages, the observations seem awfully gratuitous. Where disappointments, angst and difficult people were treated with amusement in his later books, here he often dismisses similar trials here with the brilliant and trenchant observation &quot;FU&quot;. Not much authorship in those moments.Not to say that there aren't some funny passages. Several times on the train, I found myself reading out loud. However, I also found myself speed reading ahead several times, an unfortunate first for a Bryson Book. Bryson's later works also weave a good deal of interesting historical background and place descriptions into the book. That is almost totally missing in this effort.He occasionally comes up with some awfully good writing. For example, he described driving toward the mountains in Colorado as &quot;driving into the opening credits of a Paramount Picture.&quot; (sic). Unfortunately, there are not enough of those moments and instead too many paragraphs describing how he had another bad meal in another bad town with too many ice cream and pizza parlors and not enough ambiance or fetching waitresses to suit his tastes. Bryson has produced much better. But don't let this book (or review) put you off an author whose books can be very satisfying companions. Just go for his more recent stuff."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Pity poor Bill Bryson. He had the chance many of his readers would love to have--travel throughout the US with apparently no money or time constraints. (Even if a Chevy Chevette may not be everyone's idea of comfortable travel!) However, the main word Bryson can find to describe places he doesn't care for is the oft-repeated &quot;boring.&quot; The Mississippi River is &quot;flat and dull,&quot; and merely driving is almost invariably &quot;boring,&quot; unless the scenery is spectacular. Ah, what's a guy to do when he has book to write? Carry on, despite overcrowded national parks, sleepy small towns, ignorant people and the occasional threatening weather. Still, in spite of the negative attitude Bryson so frequently adopts, the book is entertaining and enlightening. Perhaps I enjoyed it so much because I agree with so many of Bryson's views about the over-commercialization of America's natural wonders and historical places. I also sympathize with his regrets for the lost small towns, particularly the downtowns which have been decimated by the development of malls, strip malls, large discount stores and fast food franchises until all small towns look depressingly the same. Perhaps the best thing one can say about a book like this is that it made me want to make my own journey of exploration, to discover the country on my own. And that, I believe, is the response any travel writer would love to have. Bryson succeeds and so I recommend the book to all readers who can smile at the foibles of America and Americans, including, perhaps, themselves."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It seems that Bill Bryson is into the same things as me. In &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; he tackled my top hobby, hiking ridiculously long distances. In this book, he covers my other hobby, driving ridiculously long distances. Bryson's travelogue through small towns in 38 states is very observant and often hysterically funny. He's got good insights into the attitudes and friendliness (or lack thereof) of people in different regions of the country, and he writes thoughtfully on the destruction of America's small town charm by never-ending stretches of strip malls and fast food joints.But even though Bryson is very thoughtful and funny, this book can really get on your nerves at times. This is because Bryson is an extremely arrogant and tactless man. He dislikes everybody with different backgrounds than him, and every place that is different from his home area. He calls people and even entire groups of people obscene names throughout the book. He's got a serious problem with fat jokes, obsessively ripping on overweight people in extremely cruel ways. (By the way, look at the picture of Bryson on the back cover. You can only see his head and shoulders, but he still doesn't look like the skinniest guy in the world). Bryson demeans people who choose to live in big cities, which he can't understand, and he demeans people who live in the countryside, which he also can't understand. He hates people who can't follow directions, but gets lost several times in the book himself. At the lowest points of the book, Bryson mentions how he wants to punch an old lady in the head for cutting in line, how he wants to whack a panhandler with a stick, and how he would like to slap a little boy in Vermont just for being ugly. And he's going to get in a lot of trouble if he doesn't tone down his descriptions of poor black people in the South.Bryson also can't stand any of the places he visits. Through most of the book, he obnoxiously rolls into a location expecting simplistic stereotypes, then criticizes each place for not living up to his unrealistic expectations (a major problem in the section covering New England). He calls almost every small town backwards and boring without taking the time to explore, and passes judgment on large cities (Cleveland and Detroit) after driving right through without stopping. He even finds a way to hate the tremendous national parks out west, like Yosemite for having road signs that aren't descriptive enough, or Sequoia because he couldn't drive his car through a tree (and manages to insult the trees in the process). So I can sort of enjoy Bryson's books on a general level, but I sure was glad when he got back home and brought this book to a close."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Since many of the reviews below do a fine job of describing this book's general attributes, I'll just mention a few things you'd best remember when reading a Bill Bryson book, particularly The Lost Continent:First, Mr Bryson's doesn't write guidebooks or serious travelogues. He writes anti-guidebooks. Much of The Lost Continent is a counterpoint -- indeed a cure -- for the attacks of 'Meaningfulness And Insight' one sometimes suffers when reading even the best of the 'serious' travel writers such as Jonathan Raban.Second, he's not making fun of the places he goes, the people he meets, and the things he sees because he's a big old meanie. He's trying to be funny, and he tells the unvarnished truth about what he sees and experiences, unlike many travel writers --both professional and amateur -- who simply cannot admit they've come a long way to see something, only to find it disappointing. Mr Bryson is criticized in many reviews for being a 'tourist' not a 'traveler', but it's only tourists who think every sight they see is fascinating simply because they've chosen to see it.Third, Mr Bryson's not 'arrogant' because he doesn't praise everything about America and Americans. In fact, if American readers can hold back their splutters of outrage, they'd realize very quickly that he's *including himself* in nearly all the jokes he makes. A surpassingly ignorant reviewer below has asserted, for example, that our Bill's a hypocrite because he makes jokes about fat people, but then dines on a six-pack and candy bars. Well, of course he does -- Mr Bryson's acknowledging that, for all his griping about fast food and convenience stores and fat bellies, he's no better able to resist temptation than any other American. How many other travel writers -- or any writers at all -- allow us to see them being so fallible? This is arrogance?Finally, I would recommend that the careful reader of The Lost Continent will find much more here than humorous description and anecdote, although both abound. There's also a story. Its only real character, of course, is Bill Bryson, but it's a character who is ultimately open to and changed by his experiences, both in making his comic journeys and in the remembrances of his boyhood his travels evoke. Mr Bryson is seeking more than just an elusive epitome of small-town America; he's trying to learn how to be an American again after a long time away, and he's finding it tough going at times. As an American (an Iowan, even) who's lived overseas for more than a decade myself, I find this story more and more compelling every time I come back to visit both 'lost continents' -- the real one, and this fine book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It would be a real stretch to say that Bill Bryson thoroughly researches everything he writes about, goes out of his way to learn about and see and document only the most interesting aspects of places, and presents his portraits of places fairly and with an effort to see every side of both places and issues.A real stretch.But, it wouldn't be a stretch at all to say that Bill Bryson is undeniably loaded with wit and humor. This book is, I believe, Bill Bryson's very funniest. I laughed so hard at his descriptions of eating in small town diners that I woke my wife up who was sleeping next to me, several times. I tried to read passages from it to my brother over the phone, but couldn't get certain words out because I was silenced by laughing, by the sort of full-body laughing usually only high schoolers drinking milk get to enjoy.This book is not an objective or a thorough or a totally accurate picture of America; its passages about the West, places I'm especially familiar with, almost appalled me at the total lack of effort Bryson made to go out of his way to see anything other than major attractions like the Grand Canyon. Even there, he just stood on the edge and looked over. However, what this book is, is funny. Very funny. Dangerously funny, especially if you ever find yourself hiding in an Anne Frank-style bunker, living secretly in fear of the government, where laughing very loudly could end your life.I highly recommend this book. Writers about American subjects will find quotable quotes on almost every region, and lovers of good comedy will find a very enjoyable read.Plus, and I couldn't believe this, it's really well-indexed."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I rather like Bill's writing style and lets face it when it comes to humourous travel writing Mr Bryson is a genius. Before setting out to comment on this book I read a sample of the reviews already penned and what a disappointment! I note the reviews are mainly by Americans who, some of them it would seem, have taken it all a little too seriously, have lost the plot, and quite obviously dont take to criticism.The human race and this rock we call Earth is diverse and varied and Mr Bryson has had the immense fortune to have swallowed a large chunk of it. This book is penned in his own inimitable style and reflects his own personal views/opinion, which we are all entitled to give and should respect. I like the way he seems to stand back and with time seemingly to have been slowed to an imperceptible pace he captures all the myriad foibles and characteristics of the American way of life. So what if America is loud, brash and over commercialised, dont ya just love it! I'd love to see the waitresses with beehive hairdo's, the awful, mind numbing television shows, the small town tacky museums, the endless plains and digitless/limbless farmers of Iowa - all so I could say &quot;yup Billy boy, yer were right&quot;. I rather think dear old Mr Piper got a hard deal seeing as he is now pushing up the daises but maybe the good lord thought that the Brysons had suffered enough.I am fortunate to live in Yorkshire, England where Bill lived for 20 years and is quite obviously where he got his zest for life. I have been enjoyed America's enchanting character many times and I love her just the way she is - may she never change. This book is a dammed good read, it kept me gripped from the word go and its a crying shame that any criticisms appear here at all. Buy the book, dont have any preconceptions, read it through Mr Bryson's eyes and enjoy the finest piece of narrative I have digested in a long while!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I should state up front that I am a huge fan of Bryson's and usually snatch up his books the moment they hit the bookstores. I re-read this one recently and had a few thoughts to share.Compared to his books about England and Europe, this one falls a little flat. There's a lot more personal observation and anecdote and less history. The constant references to his father (cheap, bad driver, obsessed with historical trivia) grow a little wearing. One can't help wondering what the rest of the family thinks of all this.As a veteran of long road trips across North America myself, I can sympathize with the boredom he feels. If it weren't for the changing geography, it would be hard to tell where you are sometimes; everywhere you see the same tourist junk, fast food and strip malls. Bryson is rightly outraged at the disappearance of local &quot;character&quot; and the cheesiness of mass culture.I think many of the negative reviews come from people outraged to find their own hometowns, states or regions slighted, which is understandable but does colour their opinion too much, I think. Try to set aside the outrage and ask where Bryson is coming from.There's one thing Bryson consistently does in his books which I find very tiresome: pointing out women he finds fat or disgusting, enumerating their faults, and even extrapolating on their character flaws, personality defects, etc. Bill, I'm a big fan, but you're no poster boy for sculpted abs yourself. ;) Even if you were, it wouldn't give this observations any validity. It's a cheap, nasty, adolescent thing to do and frankly I expect better. (OK, off my soapbox now)Overall, a book that locates the tackier, more disappointing sides of American life in a very amusing fashion. Let's not try to pretend that everything about America is always wonderful, pretty or important."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson can write, that's for sure. And he's sarcastic -- that's what drew me to this book. But he's also terribly insecure. While I wouldn't dare get overly defensive about America, I do take umbrage with Bryson's need to go after the easy targets with impunity. His caricature of the South was shallow and his stereotyping of the Midwest horribly unoriginal, but the elitist attitude Bryson had towards small town American folks was irritating. His experiences with The Dumb are universal -- I've had the same reaction to dumb people all over the world. Being dumb is hardly unique to the US. And yes, we might be fat and ugly in the States, but I would hardly turn to Britain to improve my dietary and fashion sense. Bottom-line, Bryson has some funny episodes, but he didn't try hard enough to be witty. If you want to read someone who can amuse you in his travels of America without insulting everybody around him, try Calvin Trillin -- the wit is original, the writing better, and the insecurities less palpable."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Bryson's book about his journey through small town America. Several times I was laughing out loud and had to read aloud to my husband. If you are from a small town, you will be able to relate to the author's observations and experiences. Yes, he does at times seem a bit cruel in his comments but take it with a grain of salt. His genuine love for his home country is obvious. I recommend the book for several good laughs."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is the second book I've read of Bryson's &amp; being from Iowa myself, understand his humor perfectly. I don't agree with all of his conclusions/assumptions of our diverse country, but it does take you on a imaginative journey. A must read for any U.S. traveller."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is an unpleasant little curmudgeon, and it shows all over this book. When he comes home from England and decides to drive around his native country, he is shocked - shocked! - to find that:A) The distances are long and a lot of them are boring. B) Poor people don't live in quaint little cottages, but in distasteful trailers, and their dress sense isn't always the greatest. C) People who cater to tourists like to make money, and some of their advertising claims are inflated.Bryson's livestock mentality toward women is a dead giveaway of the Midwestern upbringing he tries so hard to put behind him. Oh, and what is up with his love of pricey boutiques? He always approves when he finds a town that has converted itself into an upscale tourist mall (Warm Springs, Ga. for one). Evidently tourist traps are fine as long as they're tasteful and expensive. This is the kind of predictable America-bashing that Brits and Europeans love (which is fine - nobody's asking them to come here). It gets boring pretty fast, especially since some of his rants are practically verbatim copies of one another: he drives into a town with an ugly strip, eats some bad food, goes back to a saggy motel bed and watches some cheesy TV. Every so often he adds a run-in with a rude waitress or a big mean RV for levity. Whee!It's hard to understand why Bryson went on this trip if he knew from the start what he would find. In fact, you have to wonder whether he really bothered to do all that driving. He could just as easily have written all this from some cozy armchair without ever having to leave England. Bill, take up a hobby or something. I hear tae-bo is great for the endorphins."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"After having read another book by Bill Bryson, &quot;A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,&quot; I was prepared to love this book. Unfortunately, it came nowhere near meeting my expectations.Perhaps I expected too much. I suppose a part of me was comparing it to Steinbeck's &quot;Travels With Charlie,&quot; which isn't really fair. &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is really meant to be a witty account of the author's travels through America in search of The Perfect Small Town.Unfortunately, the one thing that struck me most in this book was that Bill Bryson spent an awfully large amount of time driving in his car being bored. He makes snide remarks about every person he meets who doesn't immediately welcome him to the community (and even about the few who do) but his description of his appearance and of his conversations with the locals lead me to wonder whether anyone in his or her right mind would really want to talk to him at all.I did make it through the entire book, and I did chuckle a few times, but I am still looking for that witty update to &quot;Travels with Charlie.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson continually bemoans the obesity of Americans. Continually. It gets rather tiresome. While I wouldn't label Bryson as obese, I certainly wouldn't say that he was all that fit.The book gave me the impression that he spent little more than an hour in each of the towns he visited which is hardly enough time to form an impression of any value. Gas station here, fat woman there.This isn't traveling, Bryson. It is simply driving and stopping for gas."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As a reader from the much maligned town of Carbondale, Il., I feel compelled to set the record straight. Bryson's account of his brief visit to my hometown is simply not true. (Bill- you can't buy beer in convenience stores in Carbondale. I know. My family has been in the liquor business for almost 40 years.) If ONE of his accounts is embellished, or, more accurately, a LIE, how can a reader believe anything written here? Go ahead...make up moderately entertaining, if negative and patronizing, tales about travels in America. But be sure to file them under Fiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Let me start by saying that I love all things Bill Bryson. I have laughed until I've cried at ceretain parts of every book he has written, and regularly relisten to \\"A Short History\\" on audiobook. Anybody that can make that much science that interesting is next to godliness in my book.However.I got \\"Lost Continent\\" on audiobook to listen to while working on a project in my studio. I had only read a blurb about what it was about, and loving Bryson, I picked it up sight unseen. I only got about halfway through before I just gave up, came home, and immediately deleted the whole set from my iPod. I don't know if it is his age at the time of writing, or some superiority complex from living abroad or what, but this is HORRIBLE.There is almost none of his characteristic wit. He is insulting, degrading, and flat out crude for large parts of this tale. As far as I can tell, he did nothing but complain about how terrible everywhere he went was. In listening to 4 hours worth of storytelling, I can safely say he only found about 25 minutes worth of good stuff to talk about.Frankly I was shocked at how overtly negative the whole tone is through the story. It was just so unlike anything else I had read of his. At one point I even stopped to wonder if there just happened to be another author out there with the same name and I had grabbed someone else by accident. I stopped listening partly to prevent my opinion of him from dropping any lower - everything else of his has been so wonderful and I usually recommend him to all my friends!On an audiobook sidenote, I did not care for the reader either. While he had a pleasant enough voice to listen to, he did not speak in the manner that Bryson does (when reading audio books at least) and really added to the overtly sarcastic and degrading tone of the story. Yikes."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was very disappointed in, and angered by, this book. Having lived in a couple of the small towns that Bryson skewers I was unpleasantly surprised at the arrogant, belittling tone he takes. If all you know about small towns is what you read in this book, you'd assume that all small-town residents fit the stereotype of being backward, country bumpkins who are a bit slow on the uptake and clearly can't match wits with such a pithy author. He insults both the towns and the residents. He mocked one town for being in his drive-thru view little more than a series of strip malls. Having lived in that particular town, it's obvious that he didn't venture a block or two off the main street, where beautiful scenery is plentiful. And I would also add that this town is the friendliest place I've ever lived. If Bryson's intention was to come off as a big city elitist he succeeded."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book proved to be a disappointment. Whereas Bryson was witty and entertaining in books such as A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned Country, he was simply profane and sarcastic in Lost Continent. His generalizations were based on first impressions and left me with the feeling that he wrote the book without taking the time to research the subject. He wrote with a definate bias. Bill should have stayed in England if he thinks so little of the USA."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I understand that Bill wrote this book from an English point of view, even though he was born in Iowa. And although I have to agree that we have a country full of fat people, strip malls, bad food, sleazy advertisements and in-your-face cheap touristy places, there are some beautiful regions in this country that Bill completely overlooked.He not once talked personally to a bartender, waitress, other tourist about why they were where they were. (What brought someone to live in Why Not, Mississsippi, for instance). He never spoke to a native American, to a Black Southerner, etc. He never gave a reason for any place to exist.This book may have some funny moments, but it lacks an intimate, personal aspect. Everything Bill writes about is fat, boring, cheap or tasteless. Maybe all the cheap beer he drank every night ended up influencing his attitude? I have travelled to many of the same places he has seen and loved them all for the diversity. How can South Carolina be boring? Or even New Hampshire?Surely this book is a hit in Europe right now, though, but here in the US this book ranks the worst of Bill's writings. I am glad I borrowed this book from the county library; it's a waste of money."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Billy Bryson is a very gifted travel writer, almost a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to a writer, for he follows his curiosities when he writes and his works display his vast wealth of knowledge. Such is the case with \\"The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America.\\" Perhaps this is an inappropriate subtitle for there is not necessarily a ton of insight into small towns, but there certainly is a lot of insight into what makes America and its citizens tick. It is part travelogue, part memoir, part rant, part stand-up act. It is a laugh-out-loud read that doesn't seem too dated even though it was written over twenty years ago.Bryson, an Iowa native, returns home from his adopted land of England, and sets off on a journey to discover the perfect American small town, the kind that you used to see on classic TV shows. What he finds is that no such place actually exists, but there are amalgams that can be made and a few towns that come pretty darn close. He begins his trip heading east, describing his hotel stops, the troubles of the road, and the strange humans he encounters. Perhaps the funniest parts of his travels are Bryson's attempt to capture regional dialect in print form - not an easy task, but one this author manages with aplomb. After a short pit stop at home in Iowa, Bryson heads west, hoping to hit some of the highlights that he never got to see on those vacations his father would drag his family on.After a while, Bryson's narrative can get repetitive and why he chooses to visit certain places in certain states is a little befuddling. Yet he mixes these visits - like Colonial Williamsburg, the Grand Canyon, and Gettysburg - wit interesting trivia and other information. Throughout the course of this travelogue Bryson employs his trademark sarcastic wit, a turn off for some I am certain, but one I greatly appreciate. Bryson laments what has happened to his homeland, how small towns have been destroyed by strip malls and fast food restaurants, but more so by how so few seem to care about this change. \\"The Lost Continent\\" is certainly not Bryson's best work, but it is an intriguing look at America by an ex-pat son who could see it like no one else."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Detailing two long, looping drives around the United States during the 1980s, Bryson provides a glimpse of what America looked like during this period. While his tone is often a bit dismissive or snarky, his impressions are necessarily colored by his expectations based on his childhood travel experiences and his adulthood life abroad. Having visited many of the same places, many within the last couple of years of so, it is interesting to note how little some of these places have changed during the intervening decades since his visit. My own experiences out west have been similar, in that we traveled a long distance in a short time, and of necessity, didn't have time to explore any place to any great depth, so that my impressions, like those recorded here by Bryson are superficial. For those looking for an in depth guide to the various destinations Bryson visited during his travels are going to be disappointed. Bryson didn't spend more than a day in any one place, and often his visits were much shorter than that. Because of this, the portraits of his stops are little more than first impressions, which is, perhaps, a bit unfair to the people and places he writes about. But when compiled as a whole, these glimpses into individual locations combine to show how incredibly vast and diverse America is. This is probably the saving grace of this otherwise pedestrian book...that it highlights the diversity of landscapes and cultures that make up the patchwork of our vast nation."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was ready for a book with funny insights into American culture. Instead I learned that 1)Americans are fat, and 2)build ugly fast food restaurants. This book has some mildly amusing parts, but nothing laugh-out-loud funny. A book to borrow, but not to buy."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book effectively illustrates the point that left-leaning liberals - in this case the author - can engage in narrow-minded bigotry and intolerance with the best of 'em. Bryson's broad generalizations about people, based on nothing more than geography, accent, or occupation, are at times so hateful that the book is hard to read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I will admit that I could hardly finish this depressing rant. I found no entertainment whatsoever in the snobbish criticism that the immature Bryson tried to pass off as humor. I had thoroughly enjoyed A Short History of Nearly Everything (2003) as well as Down Under (2000), and picked up The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town America (1989) based upon those experiences. What a disappointment! His objective of rediscovering his home country was completely overshadowed by his negativity and fast-food approach to 'experiencing' small towns in America. Bryson demonstrates that if you focus upon the negatives, you will almost certainly miss the positives of any town, in any country. As Americans who lived in Norway, Indonesia and Abu Dhabi, and traveled extensively in many other countries, my wife and I learned early that the investment in travel will be wasted if one doesn't take the time to discover and savor the positives while seeking to understand the negatives. A travel book that finds the right balance, with both humor and insight, is worthwhile and entertaining. This one did not, and is not."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I don't think this book really deserves hate, but...Okay, well, I just went on a three week long trip, much of it through small town America, so when I came home and saw this book lying on the coffee table, abandoned by my sister, I snapped it up because I was interested in what Bill Bryson would have to say about the trip I just took. I expected to laugh and to repeatedly nod along in agreement about how, yes, that's EXACTLY what Jeffery City, WY is like.I was sorely disappointed.Not so much about the laughing. There was some of that to be had. My issue is that, even in 1989, this book didn't describe how things were. It didn't even come close. This book is catered to the exact opposite of people who see things through rose-colored glasses - it's catered to those people who see things through turd colored glasses that are also rather opaque. It's like he just took every stereotype that ever was and wrote a book on that. I partially doubt that he even went on the trip.It's not just because of all the judgmental/prejudice/whatever crap that people have already complained about (and, I have to tell you after having sat around as a bunch of Wyoming ranchers explained to me exactly what went on during the Tang dynasty and all the physics behind launching rockets, I will never assume small town America is full of dumb people again). It's because he was just plain wrong. It was like he didn't research anything. People don't live in national parks? Uh, well, someone lives in the middle of Dinosaur AND they lease the land to ranchers. People live in the Grand Tetons and even Yellowstone. Also, I find it highly unlikely no one was hiking or biking in Great Smoky Mountain when he was there. The hiking areas there are packed and have been that way for a long time. I don't think it's possible to hike at GSM without running up someone else's butt. Not to mention all the horseback riding. No more billboards with cheesy poems and interesting cut-out pictures? Every small town was littered with fast food chains and malls? What road was he driving down? I drove 250 miles and through three towns before I even found a non-diesel gas station. I'd have killed for any sort of real restaurant or diner.I'm not going to list everything that was factually incorrect or off, but there was a lot, which I really picked up on as I'd just driven to a lot of the places he went to (or I live near them) and I know it hasn't magically changed in 20 years (or even 50 years, for that matter). It really put me off. I could deal with all the petty stereotypes (anti-Southern much?) because they made me laugh (as did all the comments about Southerners), but it was all so... fake. Like he flew to the America on another planet or the America in a really bad British angstfest, written and produced by people who'd never seen America or Americans and only knew them through parodies or soap operas or their mother's best friend's uncle's father-in-law's brother. I couldn't relate to it and so I was disappointed and will look elsewhere for my hilariously deprecating fiction on America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is a popular travel writer and humorist who was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, and has lived in England for twenty years. Upon the death of his father, Bryson became very nostalgic, especailly about the many road-trip vacations his dad would take the family on. In order to commemorate his dad, recapture some of the happiness of his youth, and reaquaint himself with the land of his birth, Bryson takes two extensive road trips.One is a fall trip into the Deep South, up the Atlantic Coast, through New England, up Michigan, down Wisconsin, and home. The second is a spring trip through Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, through New Mexico to Las Vegas, to the Pacific Coast, through Nevada, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, and then back to Des Moines.Throughout the book, Bryson attempts to strike a humorous balance between the places themselves, the mind-numbing frustration of long-distance driving, and his own travel anecdotes. I most enjoyed the parts when Bryson describes the places themselves and the people he encountered. To Bryson, there must not have been much difference between the various places as he felt compelled to continually comment on the plethora of crappy souvenier merchandise and the fact that he finds most things boring or gaudy. When he actually enjoys being at a place and takes to the time to give the reader a brief history lesson, describe some of the unique buildings or scenery, or talk about the way of life in this place, I most enjoy the book.Unfortunately, most of the book describes funny anectodes from his road trips--getting bored in Carbondale, Illinois; getting drunk in Santa Fe, New Mexico; being refused service at the only diner in a Wyoming town; searching for feminine hygene products in Bryson City; etc--and also describes his thoughts on traveling, searching for local radio stations, and other scenes from the highway. While Bryson struck a good balance between the three, this reader would have preferred a greater focus to be put on the towns visited--but this is a matter of personal preference.In all, the book was a quick and fun read. I laughed out loud at times, found myself wanting to take my own road trip, and was generally envious of and entertained by Bryson's trip across America. I recommend it and look forward to reading his other travel narratives."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I enjoyed Bryson's more recent books, so I went back to this one and found it rather tedious.This book would be a lot more enjoyable if Bryson wasn't so negative about everything. I wish I had a dollar for every time he said he was disappointed at some town or landmark he encountered. If I were him, I would have turned around and went home long before the end of the journey.One insight I gained though - he talks a lot about how his father was a grump during the annual family vacations. It's clear that Bryson is a chip off the old block."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's book is full of fun observations, though some are a bit dated, taking place 15 years ago. But he turns a cynical eye on the american highways and byways and is not afraid to tell it like he see it. Having lived in England for years, yet having grown up in the midwest, he brings a certain inside-outsider view on things. But as other reviewers have pointed out, he can get a bit cranky. Part of it, yes, can be attributed to the fact that the country of ourse is so vast, and what we are used to in our area may be very different from other areas and lifestyles - witness the differences between cities and the Montana / Dakotas that he writes about.I'm a bit disappointed also that a lot of his writing is not about what he saw or how it made him feel but rather was &quot;I saw A, then drove to B&quot; and so on. Still, there were many times when he put observations together and made me laugh out loud. I guess part of my feelings is that the book was uneven. He writes of trying to find the Sequoia tree that you can drive through, and upon figuring that it was in northern rather than central California, he just turns it into another whine and complaint. He was let down from perception not meshing with reality, but he really had no one to blame for this, hence he just is pissy.Overall - Light. Frothy. Enjoyable reading definitely. A good chance for those of us who are in one area to see under the veneer of the rest of the country."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"America is a strange place. In one oversized country it is possible to find both the best and the worst imaginable of people, places, and things. Mr. Bryson's quest to develop an entire and coherent picture is a daunting one, filled with both humor and pathos. In the end, his report from the road is one of mixed feelings. He finds humor in the irony and incongruity of America, yet at the same time he laments the disappearance of the America he once knew or at least believed to exist.Certainly, this is not the rollicking tale of humor interspersed with serious observations that was found in A Walk in the Woods or Notes from a Small Island. The Lost Continent is more somber. It is not devoid of humor, quite the opposite. Mr. Bryson is able to elicit a good laugh from the reader in some of the most serious passages. It is simply that between reflections on his father and the lost world of his childhood, and the state of present day America and all we have lost over the past twenty years, the reader is left with a book far more serious than they may have expected.To say that this is not Mr. Bryson's best work would be somewhat neglectful of the fact that it contains many laudable and well formed critiques of a variety of topics, from hospital care to the interstate system. Perhaps we too hastily seek to put Mr. Bryson into that cadre of writers of domestic and pedestrian humor; to expect from his work the same thing we expect of, say, Mr. Dave Barry. This is a disservice to Mr. Bryson. He is an intelligent and reflective writer. His humor is never without cause and he rejoices in lampooning the ridiculous wherever he observes it. In sum, he is not easily put into a box.As with all of Mr. Bryson's works, save I'm a Stranger Here Myself (the painfully Americanized version of his vastly superior English edition titled Notes from a Big Country), The Lost Continent is recommended. However, the reader should be in the spirit to both laugh and ponder his way through the book. It is more complex that it seems or than it is advertised by the publisher. Read it with the expectation that you will not be entertained without paying for it with a few moments of pause and contemplation."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I'm a Bryson fan anyway, but I'd have to say this is in a class with \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"In A Sunburned Country.\\" Bryson, who at the time he wrote this book (late eighties) was living in England, drives his mother's Chevette through thirty-eight states. Loosely, he's in search of the perfect American town; more to the point, it's a great opportunity to see America through Bill Bryson's eyes.We read of his attitudes towards the south; his experiences as a child on family vacations; the difference between attitudes in the Midwest and everywhere else; and his encounter with someone who really wants to know whether they can smoke on a Grayhound bus.His commentary is always witty and occasionally acerbic. Bryson appears to have written the book for an English audience (or at least have been influenced by living in England for so long), and occasional lapses into English English (as opposed to American English) may distract occasionally. Overall, though, the book is well-written and provides a laugh and a half a page."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I loved this book. He does whine, he does offend but nonetheless he's terriby funny. His observations are uniquely his own with a mix of American brash and British dry wit. We should all laugh more. Be forewarned on the whining part and have a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's one of my favorite travel writers. Hilarious. A Walk in the Woods is my favorite of his. This one is about his travels around small-town America, which isn't as interesting for someone who knows what small-town America is like. And I thought Bryson's sarcasm was a little snotty and mean in places, but pretty enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson has the humor of Dave Barry and the travel instincts of a less snobbish Paul Theroux. The mix is pure pleasure and at times so hilarious it should come with the warning: read in privacy unless you don't mind helpless displays of public cackles and tears on planes, trains and automobiles. A native of Des Moines and a longtime resident of London he takes this nostalgic tour across his homeland with a flask of vinegar and a pot of honey. He can't help feeling love and appreciation for the sometimes pathetic but often well meaning yokels he encounters on this quest to find the perfect small town. At his best he is as perceptive and scathing as Mark Twain but walks away enamored with a country obsessed with gaudiness and quick buck fixes of dubious glamor.Haven't we all met the Reaganite good old boy who injects his diatribes about how Nixon was robbed without concern to the general drift of the conversation only to turn a corner and be wowed by the generosity and spaciousness of the guy one seat over on the barstool! It's actually a tough love letter that rings true and makes the affection sound genuine and earned."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson is a very good travel writer and a clever social critic, but people expecting a book on par with A Walk in the Woods might find themselves a bit disappointed. Bryson is very funny, but I think he employs an English sense of humor which tends to run a bit more biting than the American brand. He's clever, he's more accurate than many of us want to admit, but it gets tough to read a couple hundred pages from someone who sounds an awful lot like a cynic. Like the back of the book says, he's as observant as de Tocqueville, but he's less optimistic. A good book from a good writer, but be warned."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is the second Bryson book I have read and I honestly need to take a break. He's funny and his observations are usually correct (though he could use some tact in sharing them), but as my boyfriend said (who was reading over my shoulder), &quot;Man, he's cranky.&quot; That about sums it up, he's cranky and this is a cranky account of the US.Granted, he went 6,000+ miles in 34 days or some ridiculous thing like that and subsisted on junk food for most of it. That would make most of us pretty cranky. But I think that America gets the shaft in this book. There are plenty of wonderful things about being country folk, about family values, even about capitalism (though I agree with him, the Strip Mall is out of control).I also think that his quest is a bit misguided as he skipped some of the best &quot;little towns&quot; out there, such as Santa Barbara (which he probably would have said was too &quot;rich&quot;), Ithaca, NY (too &quot;hippy&quot;), New Canaan, CT (again, too &quot;hoity toity&quot;) and Chapel Hill, NC (well, it's just about perfect). Maybe he should do this again, and we could help him out?! And why stop in NYC at all? Why not Boston? It had no rhyme or reason and PLEASE someone tell him that Columbus Day is not the time to go to Cape Cod. Every other weekend it is a beautiful, idyllic place.Ok, I'm rambling. Final word: funny in parts, but way too critical and perhaps I am just feeling a bit patriotic these days, but I love America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson, in a touch of nostalgia for the United States, leaves his family and adopted home in Great Britain for a trip throughout the United States. He begins and ends his travels in his former home state of Iowa which he finds delightful. Covering thousands of miles throughout the United States traveling alone by car, he visits numerous cities, small towns and occasional tourist traps.Bryson's stories are hilarious but often have a biting edge to them. He finds a few places which gratify him, but mostly he finds disappointment. Too many times he seems to be in places or situations that he does not like. He often is critical, even nasty, in the descriptions of people he meets along the way. Although the account of his trip is funny, one is left wondering why he bothered to travel at all if he found so little pleasure in the people and places he encountered."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If anyone has ever traveled by car to some far off destination, this book will ring true for you. I laughed so much at many parts that I had to put the book away because I could not see the pages. Mr. Bryson writes from the point of view of a comman ordinary person, its easy to read, understand and empathise with his experiences. I loved this book!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is one of the funniest authors around. I recently finished Lost Continent, one of his earlier books, and found it very enjoyable. Bryson is able to have a unique perspective on America, being both a native Iowan - but one that has been away from America for many years. Bryson's commentaries on many of the changes in America were very insightful. Overall, I found this book much more rough around the edges than some of his more recent books, but still a very funny read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is a book about Bill Bryon's cross-country road trip across the United States. This is more a pleasure read than a book to use as a travel reference as he covers so much ground that he has to fly by places and misses quite a bit.He is, as usual, quite funny and very fussy!! He likes to complain so don't take it personally if he happens to rag on your little town. I have been to a few of the places he ragged on and actually found them quite pleasant. Mostly I think he is just looking for humor in places and also for perfection.It is a good book for outsiders considering a trip to the US who can't decide which section of the country to visit. He covers the East coast, the south, the midwest, the wild west and some of the north. He drives through, I believe, about 38 states. He does not visit Texas, Alaska or Hawaii and I think he also skips Florida but I don't really remember. He does hit most major cities and several National Parks. If you do decide to come, do more research than Bill b/c since he covered so much ground in such a short time he had to miss quite a bit... like if he only saw Times Square and 5th Avenue in NY he missed A LOT(and no wonder he was frightened! heehee).This book was quite useful b/c there are now many new places on my long list of places I want to go! You will get some good ideas for long weekend road trips if you live in the US or Canada.I only gave this book 3 stars because I gave his other book &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; 5 stars and to be fair to that book which I think is even better than this one I could only give this one 3. But I highly recommend it especially if you are already a Bryson fan. Bravo Bryson!!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The previous reviewers who gave this book 1 or 2 stars are, I noticed, either really full of themselves or they're from the midwest....the very place Bryson *really* socks it to. I spent far too many years in the midwest and I've gotta say Bryson is RIGHT ON THE MONEY! Hilariously cynical in all the right ways. Yeah, if you're a &quot;serious armchair traveller,&quot; you might wanna pass on this one. However, if you appreciate a twisted, off color sense of humor....GO FOR IT!!! You will NOT be disappointed!! And did I mention it's FUNNY?!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you appreciate (and understand)sarcasm and have ever ridden in the back seat of a wood-panelled station wagon, you'll love this book. Bill Bryson reminisces about the quirks of family vacations and skewers strip malls, tourist traps, small towns, and American culture.While I lived in the UK, Bill Bryson had attained cult-like status with his satiric look at British culture. The British adore his wit and sarcasm where many of my fellow Americans, alas, don't get it and take personal offense when he pokes fun at Mississippi or Iowa.Try &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot; and &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; after you read this."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"unless you want to have strangers wondering if you are insane with laughter. This is easily the funniest book I've ever read. If you've ever been in the back seat of a car as a small child, you will not be able to contain yourself. Remember, you were warned!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"re>Carbondale, IllinoisThis must be a tale of fiction. The accuracy of Carbondale, Illinois is very lacking. #1 Sounds to me like he drive through the center of town TWICE and missed everything. KFC & LJSilvers are BLOCKS apart and there is no \\"white wall\\" around either forcing one to drive from one location to the next. Never has been. And neither has moved since they came to town.

After living in England for many years, the author comes home and tries to findthe small town America he remembers from old tv shows. He mostly fails, but his sardonicwit and clear point of view makes this a hilarious and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read this book when it came out a long time ago, and just came across it now. I don't recall the details, which are extensively covered in the other reviews. I do remember, however, that it was one of the few books which made me laugh incredibly hard, and often. Bryson is a very witty guy, using understated tone to illuminate the patently absurd in hilarious fashion. That alone rates it 5 stars.Pick up his Walk in the Woods, not as funny, but just as enjoyable recollection of his walk of the Appalachian Trail with an old buddy. Lots of good environmental insight, laced with many bits of humor.I'd skip Sunburned Country, which i just couldn't get into at all."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Smugly sarcastic. Bryson makes derogatory comments throughout, then apologizes with a wink, wink, just kidding. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Like most of Bryson's books, especially \\"In A Sunburned Country\\" which is his exhaustive book about Australia, he could have had the same effect in 100 fewer pages. I, as someone who has also published a travel book and numerous articles, love the history and culture of these places, but it rambles. And Bryson is, as usual, condescending. As someone who moved from the coastal elite towns of LA and DC to the Heartland or \\"Nowheresville,\\" Bryson should not mock places like Des Moines so much. Iowa's capital city, like the rest of America's heart, is a great place to live and visit. That he spent time in London, where Muslim Jihadists threaten to take over each day, and loved it, is telling. Nonetheless, even a pompous liberal elite like Bryson, when talented, can be entertaining."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having lived in the States for two years during the early eighties, I snorted my way through this all too familiar landscape. Anyone who has ever tried to buy a ticket at Cincinatti airport and been treated to a lecture on the merits of the death penalty by the person on the other side of the counter or ever eaten at an 'International' House of Pancakes will laugh too. Though his voyage is random, he experiences enough of America's cultural diversity to form his conclusions, many of them justifiably harsh. It would be unfair to say that Bryson relishes this critique. There is the distinct sense that he is sitting behind the wheel of his car for much of the journey in aghast disbelief, quite unable to understand what has become of his own country and unsure of where it's headed. The Lost Continent is informative and for the most part, objective and it contains much of the hallmark deadpan irony with a fiesta of wisecracks throw in for good measure. Whatever you're feelings about Mr B's conclusions, you won't be bored."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson is an American ex-patriot (or at least he was when he wrote this) living in the UK. He had written a travelogue in the UK that skewered much of life in the countryside, and he came back to the US to do the same here. His claim is that he's looking for &quot;Amalgam&quot;, the perfect small town. Unfortunately, Bryson sees the world backwards through the eyes of a ten year old kid. He's constantly putting down what America has become because it just doesn't compare with what he remembered it as when he was on vacation as a kid. Here's a news flash, Bill -- nothing does. We sit back on our laurels and bitch about how the Walmartization of America has destroyed small town commerce, all the time whining because you can't buy gasoline before noon on Sundays. The world has changed, and just because the guy who ran &quot;Cockroach World&quot; has been run out of business by Disney World, it's not necessarily a bad thing. Bryson manages to make it most of the way around the country (he hits 38 states), pissing and moaning the whole way about anything that isn't 1) free, 2) fitting with his view of what society should be, and 3) unchanged since his Dad drove him there 30 years earlier. The book is amusing in large part, but it's the Don Rickles type of humour -- if you don't take an insult well, you'll have a hard time with this. But it's a quick read, and from a nostalgia standpoint, Bryson is spot on."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"A British friend gave me this book to read. He found it hilarious, as did I. When it comes to the foibles and warts found in our society, Bryson is right on the money."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It's embarassing to read this book in public; it was laugh-out-loud hilarious...I got lots of bizarre stares from fellow commuters! Having grown up in the Midwest close to Iowa and traveled extensively through small town America, I can attest to the truth in Mr. Bryson's comments...he is dead-on perfect with his observations and descriptions. And while he does point out the obvious targets, he also admits that there is some kind of beauty and simplicity to small town life that he misses, that he envies, and that he holds dear. This is not a pot-shot book. This is one of the funniest and truthful books out there."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I have experienced many of the places Bryson described in this wonderful book. With each stop, I enjoyed reliving the journey. Bill wrote in a way that made me laugh... often. I was sorry to finish the book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Every chapter has a laughable story, and I shared some of the stories with co-workers. We all loved the story about the panty shields with funnel dot protection (TM). At times, I felt that Bryson might have met some of my relatives in the South. His very short description of the San Joaquin Valley in California was bleak, but so is the valley.In addition to the stories about his travels as an adult, he also shared memories about what it was like to vacation around the country through the eyes of child at a time when exploration of our country was just becoming achievable for any American family who owned a station wagon."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having read a part of his new book &quot;Notes from a big Country-1998&quot; I was inspired to grab anything he wrote. This book in not as funny as his latest, which dissappointed me as I bought it for humour,but all the same it held my interest. As a book on travel, it does get a bit slow part way through, but pressing on was worth it. I can't wait to read another of his books. Being his first they can only get better."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I have only been to America once in my life (the obligatory trip to Disneyland). Reading Bill Bryson's experiences in small town America has sparked a yearning to return. His accounts of the people he met and the places he visited are both very funny and display a great deal of warmth towards his country and fellow citizens. (I look forward to him visiting Australia in the not to distant future and 'taking the piss' out of us!!-to quote an Aussie expression). In the meantime I will be brushing up on my southern dialect and I look forward to 'mahking the skwayer' some day in Savannah!!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was given to me by a friend who knew that 1) I enjoy this style of sarcastic humor, and 2) I'm from Iowa. Bryson perfectly captures that strange mixture of fondness and boredom that I experience when I think of the Midwest and of those family vacations to someplace else. Forget all those comments that Bryson spent too much time in England; his perspective is uniquely American. My only regret about this book is that he didn't spend more time skewering my adopted state of California. I'm looking forward to reading Bryson's other books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This gem from Bryson remains the funniest travel book ever published. At least one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is one of those rare books that will elicit deep belly laughs. Bryson spares no one with his barbs as he travels the U.S. (by the way, he also does not pull any punches when commenting on Europe in &quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot;). The book is loaded with interesting trivial americana asides. Those who think Bryson is too mean or negative should relax and get a sense of humor. After all, can't we all agree that Cairo, Ohio (pronounced &quot;Kay-ro&quot; in Ohio) probably is a dump."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"What is there left to say ?? Brysons' first travel novel gives him plenty of oppurtunity to be at his funniest - that is when he is dwelling on the negative.Throughout the whole novel Bryson shares a private joke with the reader - something which an ex-pat American or Brit can readily identify with.Although 'Neither here nor there' is overall a funnier book I would still give this one ten out of ten.Read this and you require to know very little else about America should you visit it !! Oh yeah ...and by the way ... it made me move to America!!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I had not read anything by Bill Bryson previously and having bought it on impulse, took it with me on a long flight recently during which I made quite a scene by constantly having to guffah out loud - he really has a wonderful style of writing and the ability to get you to laugh even when you are trying to do your best to restrain yourself, look serious and not be a nuiscance to your fellow-passengers! I have not quite so much enjoyed a read since the days of reading authors like S J Perelman and James Thurber. Incidentally was Thurber also not from Ohio? Columbus, Ohio if my memory is right. Has his house not been turned into a museum and how could Bill Bryson not have visited it? I visit the US regularly though mainly the big cities, but having read this book I shall take try and get out to look for the mythical town that Bill was also looking for."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you're from a small town, you'll find this book especially entertaining. Bryson basically drives around the nation, making fun of each small town that he drives through as he searches for \\"the perfect American small town.\\"This guy, Bryson, has the coolest job in the world. He goes on little adventures, and writes about them. Did I miss this booth at career day?"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Why is it that so many travel writers pretend that travelling and writing is the last thing they want to do? and that everywhere they visit they would prefer to be sitting at home, eating only familiar food and meeting only people they already know and understand well.I was told Bill Bryson was a gifted, lucid writer, but I am hoping this my first introduction to him was far from his best. He keeps acting like someone is forcing him to travel through small-town America and endure the culture shock (he is from Iowa, but would very much prefer to be in England) and constantly complains of the small-town Americans as uncultured, overfed boors. Now, I dont disagree entirely with his view of country folk - but that is how country folk are in nearly every country in the world, and Americans are actually friendlier and more open-minded than in many other countries I have visited.He also exaggerates his feeling out-of-place, suggesting that, for instance, unkempt Northerners like himself might get beaten up in the (prejudiced, obviously) South. Since I - a dark-skinned Indian - have driven through remote parts of the South and Texas - about the same time as Bryson did , this seems especially silly.Where he might provide some insight into rural American life or culture, he chooses instead for shameless praise of Britain or Europe . Sprinkled throughout, for apparent entertainment, are juvenile attempts at humor - usually references to bodily functions or stupid sexual jokes.The British - during the War - used to refer to Americans as 'Overfed, Oversexed, and Over here'. Might they be referring to Bryson?"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I picked up this book hoping for the hilarity, irony and insight that I've found in other Bryson works, but was deeply disappointed. There are a few funny and keenly observed passages, but they are overwhelmed by a narrative that is predominantly shallow, repetitive and -- my biggest objection -- haughty and mean-spirited. Bryson is by and large a bracing, talented writer, but this work proves that even great talent can take a wrong turn."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As has been noted well over 200 times here, this work is the account of a rather lengthy road trip Bryson took covering 38 of our states. Now Bryson is one of those writers you either like or you dislike. As we can tell by some of the reviews here, he does have a way about him, or at least his writing dose, that sort of rubs some people the wrong way. Even though I am a fan of this particular author and count some of his more recent work among my favorite reads, I can understand perfectly the hostility of some readers. This is particularly true with this account of his journey where he tried to recapture the feeling and essence of some of the places he had visited with his family as a young boy, while at the same time trying to find his \\"perfect American town.\\" Mr. Bryson steps on a lot of toes here.Now as for the good, the bad and the ugly; let's start with the good and work toward the ugly:The Good: Bill Bryson is a good writer. He can be a very funny writer. He is a keen observer and there is no doubt, after reading his more recent works, that he is an excellent researcher. I found myself snickering and even laughing quite often while reading the book being reviewed here. Some of his snappy comments on the way we live are truly funny. We all have at one time or the other had the same thoughts Bryson has had, but he has an excellent way of articulating his. He is quite skillful at this. I also enjoyed his critique of various aspects of our society, even though some of his observations were quite painful...truthful, but painful. A people who cannot laugh at themselves are in big trouble. An examination of where we have been, where we are, and where we are possibly going as a nation is healthy from time to time. Bryson is able to give us a bit of a different slant on things and does it quite well. I know that it is easy to take offense when someone makes fun of your particular area of the country, your culture, your way of life, but after reading this book, you will note that the author does not play favorites...be bashes just about everything he sees and ever one he sees or meets with the same sarcastic and snotty zeal. This aspect of the book was fun, healthy and enlightening.The Bad: Whine, whine, whine. We all have or moments of whining now and then; it is human nature. Bryson though takes this whining to a new level; almost a nonstop level. This can be a bit annoying at times. As an example we learn very quickly that the author does not like the Golden Arches, or any other fast food chain for that matter. Well neither do I, but it did not take be 36 years to learn to simply shut up about it and go find somewhere else to eat. It is not like someone is twisting your arm. Having traveled through almost ever section of the country the author traveled through...several times I might add, I have never one time found myself in a situation where I was forced to eat Big Macs. Bryson keeps eating them and whining about them...go figure. This is one example of many, many, many. Good grief, the whine list is endless!At the same time the author is whining about food, he is taking some pretty sharp jabs at groups of people who really have not much control over their situation. He seems to hate all tourists, all of them being fat, loud and poorly dressed. He hates all regional accents (more about that under the heading \\"Ugly\\"). He despises all poor people, unemployed people, rich Republicans, Rich Democrats, motels, restraints, monuments, road signs, fat people, old people, and did I mention fat people? After reading a few pages, I am not at all sure if he is overly fond of his mom and other members of his family.It was almost as if the author had a pre-set notion of where all the ugly places were in American, why they were ugly, and then set out to find them. While I agree with many of his observations, I can also assure you that there is far more beauty than ugliness in each and every place he visited. You merely have to look to see it. This most certainly includes the people he seems to have such distain for.The Ugly: There were a couple of places in the book that truly offended me. The first was when he tied into the black lady who was running the visitor center in the Deep South and tried to helped him. He ranted for over a page, making fun of her black southern dialect...really mean spirited of him I thought. The second time is when he more or less summed up all Native Americans as \\"drunken Indians\\" driving around in trashed out, over sized cars, weaving all over the road. This was his description of the Native Americans who live on the reservations of the west. Again, mean and tacky. I would not want to say it was racist, per se, but it sure sort of smelled like it. If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck......!Now there is not much doubt that Bill Bryson is a bit of an elitist. After reading this and some of his other works, there is not much doubt on that account. Or might I say a want to be elitist. That is okay though...everyone has to be something. But knowing Mr. Bryson's background, I could not help thinking of the main protagonist and narrator of Tobias Wolff's wonderful bookOld School. It is sort of sad then you think about it. I can see a lot of Bryson in that young man in this story.This is an amusing read on many levels. I found that as I read it I became more interested in this author's maturing as a writer, this being his first work, and comparing it with the work he is turning out now.The book is okay, just be sure you know what you are getting into before you start reading it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Actually, 3.4 stars. I am always up for a good American road trip book and I have very much enjoyed Bill Bryson's other books. What I got was early Bryson before he found his heart and an America that was beginning to go to seed on its own indifferent overindulgences. If you have not read anything else by Bill Bryson, do not start with this. He got much better in a hurry and wrote some unmissable books, which you might not be inspired to go for if all you've read is this and ended up with a mild case of indigestion. And that would be a shame.Anyway, in the late 1980's, Iowa native Bryson, who had spent his adult life to date living in England, returned stateside after his dad's death to rediscover America in much the same way his childhood vacations always went--a ramble by car through the heartland. He envisioned stopping in those small town motels with neon signs that had pots of flowers outside and a nice courtyard pool. He envisioned dining on decent local cuisine in a corner restaurant and later shambling about town on foot, discovering its pleasantries. He headed southeast from Des Moines on the first half of a figure eight shaped path that would hit 38 of the 48 contiguous states before he was done, in his mother's old Chevette. After a promising start in Pella, Iowa, things mostly don't go perfectly. He is often bored, the food and food service often not good, and he finds Americans mostly fat and leading unexamined lives while their heritage slips through their fingers.Bryson makes a lot of bratty jokes and it is obvious he is writing more for his audience in England than here (when he describes the size of a place, for instance, he compares it to Shropshire). He reminds me of people who say they are licensed to tell Polish jokes because they are of Polish descent. That said, the reason I did not demote this more stars is that he was not wrong and not overly cruel about our unexamined lives circa 1987-88. Looking at his picture in time, America was an accident ready to happen. Now obesity is an epidemic, as is the wanton development and lack of municipal planning that has emptied our small towns and ringed our national parks and historic sites. It seemed to him then that we had lost an incredible amount of our cultural heritage already but for those of us who had progressively absorbed it daily without really paying attention, it is really hitting home now."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Originally published on SensiblySassy.blogspot.comLost Continent:Well a couple years ago I read Bill Bryson's book Neither Here nor There and it was a hilarious guide through Europe. So when I saw Lost Continent on the shelves I instantly wanted to read about Bill's road trip through the U.S. Within the first five pages I was chuckling to myself and out loud. (Luckily Jon was the only one sitting next to me on the plane as I read) By the time the hour and a half flight touched back down on the ground I had polished off quite a few pages.As the book went on I began to feel less enamored with the book than I initially had. The tone shifted from funny to cranky as the trip/book wore on. Now I wonder if it is the fact that the trip began to take its toll on Bryson or if he felt that crotchety was a good tone for him to switch to-we may never know. Overall if you were to sample some of Bryson's work I would absolutley recommend Neither Here nor There over Lost Continent . Neither Here nor There gives you a hilarious and personal guide through Europe whereas Lost Continent really helps you remember what it was like to take loooong car rides with your parents-the good and the bad."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Certainly not Bryson's best. But I still love his ever present cynicism. I felt he was a lot more negative in this book than in \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\" . Which deals with some of the same topics.If you are an avid Bryson reader, then yes do take the time and read it. However do not expect for it to live up to some of his other works."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The cover and liner blurbs of &quot;savagely funny&quot;, &quot;facetious text jollies&quot; (you have to expect something complete undecipherable from the Scots), and &quot;..a serious indictment of the American way of life&quot; seem a little over the top for a decidedly readable travelog. Bryson's book was meant for consumption during the inevitable airport delays and seems to comfortably fit in with those who prefer to read USA Today and spend a couple of hours each evening glued to the tube.I found the most interesting parts of the book to be when Bryson talked about his family, his own community, and, yes, Mr. Morrisey the milkman. Since this was written nearly a decade ago, some of his observational wit would be considered a tad politically incorrect these days. I would have liked to have seen the author spend a little time in some of the &quot;forgettable&quot; bergs along his travels in an attempt to probe deeper into why these people are where they are and do what they do. The glossing over, with distain of places like Cripple Creek and Wiscasset, caused me endless disspointment throughout the book.Having lived as an expat in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for 14 years, and originally coming from the Midwest myself, I did identify with Bryson's &quot;stranger in my own land&quot; sentiments. There is considerable truth to the term of reverse culture shock and this book's strength lies in Bryson's repeated examples of an expat's &quot;selected recollections&quot; when comparing home to his/her home away from home.Put this book in your briefcase or carry-on bag. Recommeded reading for world-travellers and required reading for expats making their way back to the U.S.A. after a few years abroad."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson's lazy shallow 1989 cheap shot of a debut wilts to his exceptional work of just a few years later. Bryson is a funny provocative man - the thoughtful 'A Walk in the Woods' & the informed ecstatic 'In A Sunburned Country' are excellent books, even better on tape/CD as read by the author. (Bill Bryson is a superb reader - I highly recommend you pick up any of the audio versions.)But 13 years on, Bryson may regret \\"The Lost Continent.\\" It's a simple tale of a European expatriate eager to trash America, driving (never walking or meeting) to any city/town/site that might confirm his set opinions and match his sloppy travel planning. It's a tale of a very silly ignorant man.It's interesting that a writer who condemns fast-pace fast-food instant-gratification American culture drops so many phrases like \\"I drove on...\\", \\"Driving on...,\\" \\"Within minutes I reached...\\". These phrases don't happen sometimes - they happen with every other page. This is obviously the work of a writer who spends too much time driving. How American. Even in his best writing, Bill Bryson is not a physical guy. He gets his best material from research, and mostly, just talking with the locals. In this book, he mocks roadside sad-eyes but barely lifts a finger to question, talk or ask. He doesn't give the locals a chance. Worse, Bryson wastes a lot of ink comparing TV commercial excess with his boring truck-pit surroundings. Like TV was ever about reality?...What did he expect? I myself have driven many thousands of miles in Nowhereville, Boondock, Hicktown. In fact, I've driven most the routes Bryson took. Yes, there isn't much culture, yes it's mostly truck pits, sure it's hard to find good food. But I never expected more - I knew what to expect, and took my experience for what it was. I was in the 'nowhere zone' of USA highways - I accepted it as just that. Bryson takes those experiences and condemns the nation.Bill Bryson saves his worst pitch for the last 2 pages. He writes \\"Well, that was my trip more or less.\\" (This is as bad as a high-school student writing \\"in conclusion...\\") He then writes \\"I saw pretty much everything I wanted to see and a good deal I didn't.\\" This says more about the author and his sloppy aimless travel path. What would you say about a tourist who drove through Santa Fe but didn't bother to experience Navajo Nation? What would you say about a guy who drove through the (winter-closed) North Rim Grand Canyon but didn't bother to check unique Sedona Arizona? Or a bizarre clutz who checks out non-descript flat Pueblo Colorado, makes a point to see Aspen, and - like Inspector Clouseu - gets snowed under. Bryson did not see Denver or even Boulder - he just saw podunk towns. He didn't see Seattle, he didn't see Zion or Bryce Canyon, he didn't check out San Francisco, hike Lake Tahoe, experience Yosemete, or even climb a hill in Yellowstone.What would you say about that travel-writer? A jackass. Obviously Bill Bryson has come a long long way in the decade since. Check out his wonderful recent stuff - skip this."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Very humorous description of a life growing up in small town america and the search for the perfect town. Well written and entertaining."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you're looking for a diatribe of total exaggeration and falsity, this is your book. Did I say book? Maybe doorstop would be a better description.Having grown up, and traveled extensively through the areas that the author describes with such deft fictitousness, I question whether he ever actually has been to the places he relates.I grew up in the Mid-West and moved out to the West Coast (Portland/San Diego) in my late teens, but the lifestyles the author describes of Iowa in particular are so bent out of proportion, and contrived, that this is one book that should definitely be left in the outhouse."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As hilarious as when I read this book several years ago. Bill Bryson's wit and verve comes across on every page - there is not a dull moment in this travelogue. There are many \\"laugh out loud\\" moments in this book, which can be somewhat embarrassing as I read a lot in public places - such as metros, buses, parks...And not only laughter - Mr. Bryson can penetrate through to the lost soul of America with his sly observations - on consumerism, language, modes of travel... Not much escapes the vision of Bill Bryson. His perceptions range at different levels and he is able to turn the humour over to himself as well.After twenty years from publication date there is still much that is valid and real in these pages - and laughter is ever so important!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I purchased this based on a friend's recommendation even though several people claim the book is full of complaining. This book is actually really entertaining, I found the small towns he traveled to to be interesting and some gave me a good laugh. There are few small towns in my own state and this book definitely reminded me of them. I think anyone who has traveled by car can sympathize with boring landscapes and getting lost using a road map. I really like how he describes the people and places in this book, and I am looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson takes you along on a tour of America, in a Chevette. Hilarity ensues.Seriously though, this book is interesting because it focuses on the small towns that make up the united states. Bryson delves into what makes a \\"perfect\\" town and eventually decides that such a thing probably doesn't exist. The book came out a while ago so some of it feels a bit dated but its that good kind of dated, like hearing a song from your childhood on a car's stereo as it drives by. Nostalgic with a touch of cynicism. In other words, a good book to read while feeling contemplative. Or when planning a roadtrip."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It helps to be from the Midwest to understand this one, but it is full of belly-buster laughs...and wherever you are from, you have to be willing to laugh at yourself (or your neighbors, if it makes you feel better). Definitely worth a winter read!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is a very talented and entertaining writer. He always manages to get a good chuckle out of his reader. This book does not dissapoint!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson published this book twenty years ago in 1989. Not long ago, and obviously many of the concepts about American culture and lifestyle described in \\"The Lost Continent\\" not only continue to exist to today, but are even more enhanced and pervasive. In author Bill Bryson, I saw myself. I have already looked through the eyes of Bryson. My perceptions were not as negative as his, but I noticed many things the author did as well.A lot of this book's focus, is subjective perception. And these perceptions are after Bryson recently returned to the US. Over time, his perceptions likely adapted and he got used to his surroundings. I see Reverse Culture Shock in this book. I've had RCS myself.Bryson's perceptions and critiques are shared by many Americans that live abroad and then return to the USA. Bryson perceived his native country in a different way, after having lived in Britain for years. Such observations with \\"fresh eyes,\\" a different mentality, or changes of perception are very, very, common upon returning. I've experienced this and know many people who have felt the same way. Feelings of being a \\"stranger in a familiar land,\\" perhaps. Being more critical. Disliking certain things that you never even thought about nor considered, before you left your country. These different perceptions about our native cultures would not occur if we hadn't left to live overseas.Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Bryson spends time describing life there growing up and also returning to observe the changes of his home-town. He noted the staunch and loud political partisanship by a neighbor, when he was young. Polarization that still exists, or is even more pervasive today, in the United States. In this book the journey starts and ends in...Des Moines. Symbolic perhaps, and sentimental.One quote that summed up the author's experience on his journey through the US, focuses particularly on Des Moines: \\"There are three things you just can't do in life. You can't beat the phone company, you can't make a waiter see you until he's ready to see you, and you can't go home again.\\"Bryson has the knack to explain with appropriate detail and narrate with well-put wit. One of my faves are \\"that's not true. I made it up,\\" when he explains a joke he writes. Few authors do this.Bryson's Observations: not negative, just different. And shared by many.He spent time on the road in the US. This means, eating out. He would go to many franchise restaurants and notice particular things, perhaps moreso because he'd been living in Britain for several years. He observed that \\"all around me people were eating pizzas the size of wheels....the menu was dazzling in variety. It went on for pages....\\" (Page 63). He noted how big people had gotten and how much they could eat, as the portions were so large. And since this book was written 20 years ago, obesity levels have risen significantly.He then observed the number #1 American pastime: shopping.The author walked into large malls, department stores, and supermarkets. Here is a description of K-Mart:\\"K-Marts are a chain of discount stores and they are really depressing places. You could take Mother Theresa to to a K-Mart and she would get depressed.\\" He notes the stores themselves are not depressing. It's the customers that shop there: Every woman there as has least 4 children and they all look as if they have been fathered by a different men. The woman always weighs 250 pounds She is always walloping a child and bawling 'if you don't behave Ronnie, I 'm not gonna bring you back here no more.' As if Ronnie could ever give a toss about going to K-Mart again.\\"Bryson seemed a bit negative towards the Southern part of the US. He noted historical occurrences of the past and nuanced them to his perceptions of places and people in the region, on his journey. He didn't particularly like Mississippi.When a person lives away from the their home-country the length of time that Bryson did, there are often varying degrees and depths of Reverse Culture Shock. Reverse Culture Shock is a phenomenon that does exist and has been studied extensively.Contrary to many others that have read this book, I didn't laugh, and I didn't find it funny. But I did find it good. I've read other, more cheery works by Bill Bryson and he's still one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The Lost Continent drives the reader through small town America. Told with a sense of humor and attention to detail, Bryson makes the reader feel like they are riding in the passengers seat as he drives from one town to another. As he drives into familiar towns, he shares his reflections on how life was and how it has changed over time. An interesting read for someone who enjoys long cross country road trips."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is the third Bryson book that I've read in three months; Bill's persona has become my friend. In fact, I felt like I was in the back seat during his travels around America. I'm so old that I have been to most of the places where \\"we\\" traveled. Bryson's wit makes small town USA interesting, and sometimes sad for the \\"good old days\\" when our communities resembled our collective character. There is some disdain for big box chain stores and restaurants that dot every landscape and meld our communities into boring familiarity regardless of where we go. \\"We\\" had similar feelings about most of the places. I enjoyed the ride. \\"We\\" laughed a lot."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This just doesn't compare to his earlier two books, nor to his recent memoir. I thought Kerry Shale did a poor job of narrating and finding Bryson's pace. Bryson did a wonderful job of narrating his own memoir (\\"The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid\\") and should insist upon doing the rest of his stories on CD."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The short version: I love Bryson's other books, I hated this one.Why?#1. Mean-spirited whining about how he hates everything. That got old real fast.#2. Not much in it that's funny. I don't think I cracked a smile the whole way. It lacked the wit of Bryson's other books, and so was stale and boring.#3. Gratuitous use of profanity. I'm not some old church lady, so spare the \\"Prude\\" comments. I just don't see that the profanity added anything at all. It wasn't funny, it was out of place--like he just threw it in hoping it would make the stuff around it funny. It didn't.If you've never read Bryson's work, skip this one and start with anything else he's written. If you like Bryson's work and want to read everything he ever wrote, still, don't buy this one. Maybe borrow it from your library, because you won't be reading it again."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"A window-shoppers' guide to the United States, The Lost Continent is an array of towns,scenery and people given but passing glances. A head-spinning tour of thirty-eight states,Bryson whisks us along freeways and back roads at a dizzying. However brisk, this tourdoesn't inhibit Bryson's expressing views on the merit of everything he sees. Nearly everysmall community is boring. The few urban centers he enters are dangerous [in his eyes],confusing and dirty. National parks or historical sites are crowded with obnoxious,overweight or overage tourists. In short, this book leaves you with the idea that wherever ishome is where you should remain. In his case, this is Des Moines, Iowa. To those who haveseen Iowa or met Iowans, the proposal has some merit.After a sojourn in Britain, Bryson has [temporarily] returned to the American Midwest tolaunch a journey of exploration. To those living elsewhere, the American term &quot;Midwest&quot; issomething of a puzzle. Bryson reinforces the perception of the region being rather &quot;Middle&quot;as he tours various American cities, towns and villages. The contrast between &quot;small town&quot;and urban America remains as stark as it was in Mencken's day. &quot;Middle&quot; America appearsdrab, self-contained, inward looking and static, changing only in details. The urban scene isrushed, dynamic, perceived dangerous and swamped by consumerism. The culturaladvantages of cities are ignored. In fact almost the only observation on cultural elements ishis failure to find a bookstore in Auburn, Alabama, a college town.Bryson has a keen capacity for observation. His Iowa roots remain the fundament of his view,but he observes American communities of all sizes with a penetrating eye. Such a perspectivecan only be achieved by one who has been elsewhere and retains a receptive outlook. Havingknown Midwesterners who traveled the world and seen nothing, his breadth of vision isrefreshing. Imparting his observations with stinging wit, he keeps his readers in keenexpectation for the next phase of the journey. His style encourages you to remain with him ashe rapidly moves across the face of the United States. The pace is hectic - the thoughtfulreader may pause to wonder how Bryson can render his judgments with the limited time heremains in each place. Those seeking more penetrating views of America should be readinghistories, not travel accounts.This is a very American view of the world. The title contains &quot;Continent&quot;, but even closebrushes with Canada are avoided; after all, this is where American winters originate. Heeven expresses the &quot;belief - no, the understanding-that America is the richest and mostpowerful nation on earth because God likes us best.&quot; It's a view he clearly subscribes to, evenif the &quot;real America&quot; abides around Des Moines. A consummate Midwesterner, Bryson thriceglimpses the Atlantic Ocean without comment, but never reaches the Pacific. He likesmountains, so long as they don't produce snow, and unspoiled hilly country. Well, don't weall?Bryson's wit leaves us breathless. His descriptive ability brings us beside him, in the car,restaurant or strolling along a Main Street. Droll observations keep us happily entranced,impatient to have him reveal and react to his next disappointment or discovery. and concealshis lack of depth. The pace is too fast to allow us to see what's lacking until the final pages.By then, it's far too late. We've come to sympathize with his encounters with unpleasantwaitresses, inhabiting grungy motels and missing meals. Instead of research, he has MobileTravel Guides, distilled versions of history and geography. These booklets don't fail him, butthen he asks little of them. Even when they don't provide sufficient information on whichroads to follow, he blames the locals for failing to provide proper road signs. Given that somany of the routes he takes are for local transport and not interstate tourism, the lack ishardly surprising. He doesn't live and pay taxes in the communities he chastises.A traveller's account, not a guidebook; even his criticisms are charming since it's his feelings being expressed. He doesn't demand you follow either his route or his thinking. Indeed,there are many places where suggestions are offered and could be followed. The NationalParks Service's role in Yosemite and Yellowstone parks are examples. Better managementrequires better knowledge of conditions. He doesn't state it explicitly, yet it's fairly clear thatthe Service is well down on the list of American priorities and requires elevating.In short, this is an entertaining read, but not something to take on a driving trip to theseplaces. In many ways, it's best read by those who've already been where he visits. It maybring back fond memories or otherwise. But, if nothing else, this book is certain to bring atleast a smile.A brief request to other readers: those who grasp the reference to Booker T. Washington andhis later musical career are free to write this reviewer with an explanation. Please state yourage, location, the title of the tune made famous and who used that tune for commercial ends.There's a real generation gap here, and it would be interesting to see how many fell into it.* Ray Kinsella in &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I kept my husband awake by laughing constantly while I read this book at bedtime."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson crosses the line between humorous sarcasm to just plain bitter, hateful commentary on perfectly lovely spots. He greedily latches on to any stereotype available and exploits it. He happily criticizes events and places he doesn't even visit. I'm sorry he had such a miserable childhood and angry relationship with his father, but I don't think that justifies trashing an entire country. To Bill, I offer sympathies for a sorrowful youth that has obviously left deep an painful scars even well into his adult years.I'm so sad to have spent money on this book. I loved Bryson's Walk in the Woods, and hope to enjoy the Sunburned Country. But the Lost Continent is going in the trash."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I had hoped for a humorous look at America but was stunned to find caustic remarks instead. This reminds me Bill Kaufmann's book Dispatches from the Muck Dog Gazette. There is no affection for small towns here. For some reason, the authors of both books find it amusing to bash small towns instead of embracing them for what they are. I'm barely three chapters into the book and plan on tossing it. I will not buy another Bill Bryson book again."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"To quote Bryson himself (page 95): \\"It's not often that you see an idea that stupid brought to fruition.\\"First page is simular to the last page, as is everything in between.

Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions. This CD totally KILLS that. First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.

While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I enjoy travel, mainly for the opportunity it gives me to add to my own travelogue. I was tipped off to Bill Bryson by another Amazon member and sought out this book because it was closest to my own interest. I was assured that it would be witty and revealing.The only thing it reveals is that Bryson has no wit.He searches for America's small towns (What an original idea for a traveler!), only to become disappointed in every single small town he visits. The entire book is one scathing review of small town America after another. His caricatures of small town citizens are insulting. There's nothing quaint about his observations. That Bryson can call himself a traveler may be the only amusing thing about the book. The man shows no joy for the process in any chapter at all. He takes a few stabs at Jimmy Swaggart (Never heard THAT before!) and movie theaters in some attempt to paint himself as Jean Shepherd.He recalls feeling uncomfortable as a long-haired hippie draft dodger visiting Mississippi on the way to a beach vacation in Florida during the Veitnam war. Apparently, the way the people sitting in one diner stared at him forever left him with the impression that the South is full of inbred homicidal maniacs. Looking at his picture on the back cover and trying to imagine that face on a long-haired hippie teenager, I'd be forced to side with the Mississippi freaks.The liner notes also reveal that he spent two decades living in England. From what I can tell, this was not nearly enough time. I emplore the man to return to London where his criticisms of true Americana may be more fashionable.I propose that his time across the pond has left him completely out of touch with life in rural America. He admits to feeling uncomfortable around blacks, snobbish around whites and generally disheartened that things didn't remain a sterile, Ward Cleaver environment in his absence.And throughout his journey, what is the one thing he discovers that makes it all worthwhile? Des Moines - his hometown. It might have been a touching revelation if this guy didn't come across as such a jerk and the Des Moines gimmick didn't come off as such a ....gimmick.This one goes into the garage sale."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Riding in the passenger seat with Bill Bryson through 38 states and 14,000 miles makes for a highly comical and riveting drive. A hoot!Some reviewers tag the book as condescending, sarcastic and sneering. Bryson calls it as he see's it...just how things really seem.Along with pointing out positive attributes of our country, how can one also not notice the moronicities and ludicrousness which fevers the nation, whether it be in the people we encounter, the places, etc? Bryson is a genius in this category.In addition to his side-splitting activities from town to town and state to state, he rediscovers not only America but also his youth with many, many hilarious situations. Embellishments travel directly to the tickle-bone."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book will make you laugh out loud"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I had a similar experience to Bill's. I spent 9 years living in Hove, England. I read the book right before I returned back home to settle down and just had to laugh at the observations and wonder what I would see differently.

I passed the book on to several friends who had not travelled to many of the places Bryson explores, but who came back to me with high praises nevertheless. For anyone who truly appreciates the distinctly different flavors of our nation's cities and regions, this book is a pure treasure. Thanks to Bryson, those of us who have been to Des Moines, Boston, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, can relive many of our own observations at the time.

What I got instead, was a mean-spirited, spiteful, disappointing ride around 14,000 miles of America. Bill, can you honestly expect me to believe that in 14,000 miles you didn't find one town, that could make you happy? I often hoped the tone of the book would change, but it never really did. I did enjoy your re-telling of your travels with your father. He sounds like a much more interesting traveller than you have become.I'm glad I read Walk in the Woods first...no one would have been able to convince me to pick it up had I read this book first.If you are looking for a true book about Small Town America I would suggest Travels with Charley by John Steinbeck or my perennial favorite, Blue Highways by William Least Heat Moon."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is a very disappointing book! The premise is that Bryson, raised in Des Moines and now living in England, comes back to revisit some of the places his father took the family on dreadful summer family vacations. The book has a promising start, with a very amusing description of life in Des Moines and rural Iowa. But once he hits the road (2 big loops, one through the East and one through the West), it gets pretty dreadful. Bryson never stays long enough anywhere to get to know anything about the places he visits (a few hours in Williamsburg, a few hours at the Grand Canyon, straight through Jackson Hole without stopping,...). He seems singularly bad a finding pleasant places to stay or decent places to eat. Bryson doesn't select high or low points to describe in detail, but seems to give about the same emphasis to almost every place he stays. The good thing about this book is that, if you have short periods in which to read something, it's really easy to put this one down in the middle of a chapter."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read A Walk in the Woods, and though it had a slow section in the middle I thoroughly enjoyed it. So therefore for my birthday I asked for and received the Lost Continent. What a mistake that was. I read it until he was in North Carolina. That was about 5 states too far! I literally threw it at the wall after I read yet another condescending slam on some poor American slob just like me. What an ignorant idiot this guy is (or was back then). He should have stayed in England if America sucks so bad. I buy books to read and keep. This is absolutely the first, and hopefully the last that I ever threw away, and then made sure I dumped coffee grounds on it in the trash the next morning. Take that Bryson.

He timed his destinations in seasons of bad weather and missed so many opportunities. I did enjoy his anecdotes of traveling with his family during his childhood. I suggest, now that he is older, another road trip. Only this time consult an almanac so he can see things that are not covered in fog, snow, and sleet. I have enjoyed other books of his but cannot recommend this one.

Trust me I lived in a small town in Illinois and I know what it is like. I do agree that sometimes he is little too frank, but thats his style and thats the beauty of the book. He not only makes fun of small town America, but he laughs at himself. This is the first book I have read by him, and I am already reading his other book on Europe.

He writes what we are all thinking at some time."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've thoroughly enjoyed several other books by Bill Bryson, but this one has to be considered a sad disappointment. Virtually all of it comes off sounding vicious and mean-spirited, in spite of the author's intention of being humorous.He travels across America in his mother's Chevette (doing damage to it and never exhibiting any sign of remorse), eats at dumpy, greasy diners so as to have plenty of bad food to complain about, stays at roach motels in order to whine about the lousy accommodations, gripes about the dumpiness of poor, small towns in the U.S. and then has the unmitigated gall to say that Lady Bird Johnson's campaign to remove ugly billboards from the interstate highway system was a colossal mistake. Yeah, Bill, your appreciation for the beauty of billboards shows what an eye for culture you've got.He spends fifteen seconds passing through some small town and has the amazing ability to know exactly how everyone there wastes their lives. Whatever tiny sliver of some state he sees is somehow, to him, indicative of the entire state. And if he meets one person in a town that he isn't impressed with, it means that every single person in that state is somehow ugly, uneducated and overweight. Oddly enough, if he happens to encounter somebody who is well-educated, that doen't mean that everyone else is, too. No sweeping generalizations allowed if it would mean that something was good rather than bad. And his repetitious negative comments about the weight of everybody he encounters get awfully tiresome. That appears to be the absolutely, positively most important thing about all Americans in Mr. Bryson's eyes.This entire book sounds patronizing and so, so smugly superior. Mr. Bryson probably pats himself on the back at frequent intervals for being so much smarter, wittier, better educated than anyone else in the entire nation. And the meanest remarks he seems to reserve for his own parents, who must have been more than glad to see him take off for Europe."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I didn't like this book at all. I've been many of the places that Bryson visits in the book. I grew up in the same part of the country that he comes from. I hoped that this book would be a funny and light-hearted look at a side of America that I call home. While it is somewhat humorous, I found that his constant sarcasm and cynisism negated most of the laughs.Plain and simple, he pokes fun at America as a foreigner. I was hoping for a book that read like a buddy joking with me. Instead, reading this book is like listening to a girlfriend pointing out all that is wrong with me."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Since I am iconoclastic and have a sardonic sense of humor a number of friends told me how hysterical this book was prompting me to buy it. However, I had reservations based upon my disappointment with Bryson's &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;. About half way through this book my sentiments with this book were similar. Initially his observations make you laugh, but they soon begin to sound shrill and sometimes mean. The ongoing descriptons of gluttonous and overweight Americans quickly become old and ring unkind. They are also ironic from someone who continually describes retiring to his hotel room with a six pack and a package of Reeses cups.For those who enjoy sardonic humor the book starts out strong. Bryson skewers mundane, middle brow, consumption obsessed American culture. However, Bryson often undermines his valid points about the suffocation of America's small towns due to those proliferation of soleless strip malls along the highways lining the communities' outskirts. The author is an unabashed Anglophile and rather than simply allowing these apt observations to stand by themselves he diminishes them by pointing out how these American communities pale in his eyes when compared with those of Britain. He also suggests that welcoming, seemingly credulous,Americans are somehow less capable, even less intelligent, and certainly less sophisticated (in his opinion) than their British counterparts.Clearly there are many things than can be improved in the United States and we have wasted much of our heritage through unrestained commericalism and development. However, Philadelphia is more than a slum, New York is more than a citadel of crime and depravity, and there are certainly more than a few handsome, viable, culturally sophisticated communities in the entire United States. At the end of his tour of the country he clearly nostalgically, but almost begrudeonly, warms to and acknowledges that there are some positive aspects of American culture, At that point, however, the reader has become alienated. Many of us realize what is lacking in many of our communities and we don't need Bill Bryson to validate what's right about the United States or much less to suggest that England is the ideal prototype for us to model."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson is a very funny writer. He pokes fun at everything and everyone, including himself, which is good, because he's clearly a fussy, cheap, crotchety, fat old jerk. The self-deprecation goes a long way to mitigate his lack of appeal. This book is extremely humorous - Bryson's got real comic timing - but it has all the weight of a Dave Barry column. Bryson never explores small town America, despite his purported intent; he just visits the same tourist traps any of us would on a cross country trip. This isn't bad, necessarily; it's just not exactly a rumination on the &quot;lost America.&quot; If you want that, get William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways or Jonathan Raban's Hunting Mister Heartbreak - two excellent books about the real underbelly of non-corporate America. Bryson's book is a great read, but it doesn't say anything that any halfway observant person hasn't already grasped about mainstream America."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I usually like Bill Bryson's books - Notes from a Small Island, a Walk in the Woods, I'm a Stranger Here Myself, A Short History of Nearly Everything, all made me laugh. But not The Lost Continent. This one was one long complaint of a roadtrip; Bryson doesn't seem to find anything he enjoys until he gets to Yellowstone. There's no detail of his travels, just a repetitive litany of how bad the food is, how horrible the motel, how fat the tourists, and how dull the road. It's not worth the read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I thought this had great potential to be an extremely entertaining book. Mr. Bryson however has spent too much time in England away from his beloved Midwest. He was right that the people in the Midwest are the most hospitable that you can meet, however each state has wonderful people if you are a wonderful person. His view on America and Americans was funny at times but mostly just mean and vindictive when he didn't feel his was treated to even his low standards."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"There is plenty to satirize and poke fun at in America but make it clever,do it with incite, and do it with humor. After thoroughly enjoying 2 Bryson books, A Walk in The Woods, and, A Short History of Nearly Everything, this was very disappointing.It started, laugh out loud funny but...by the 3rd chapter or so, I was thinking I was wasting my time. I felt by the end it was a book he wrote for easy money.He drives from town to town, staying in cheap motels, watching TV in the evenings and makes virtually no attempt to engage the locals. He bemoans the changes and commercialization that has transformed many locations since his family visited in his childhood, any of us could make those observations. His attitude is condescending. He simply makes sarcastic remarks and draws conclusions about towns and people based on buying gas, renting a motel room or eating in a local restaraunt. Making fun of waitreses and people who were genuinely trying to help him is not my idea of a humorous, or inciteful look at America.The fact that Bryson is an observant, humorous, mid-westerner who has lived abroad for 20+ years should have made for an A-1 read. Instead, I told my wife and sons, forget this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book represents the best of Bryson's work to-date. He completely captures the heart and soul of towns throughout America. Bryson has an amazing talent of bringing you with him to these towns such as Pella, Iowa or Springfield, Illinois. He offers a unique perspective on Americans within each place he visits on this journey. Bryson inspires you to want to drive across America and experience each little thing like eating in a small diner or talking to locals throughout the country. Great book filled with detailed description about the place he visits and the people he mets along the way."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've just finished The Lost Continent and am still recovering from the experience. Bill Bryson's devastating wit and keen perceptions are right on target. I had tears rolling down my face, collapsing in helpless laughter when reading about tacky souvenir shops in Savannah and Gatlinburg and pig-out marathons in Pennyslvania Dutch restaurants and boring nonsense on historical markers. He never misses an opportunity to zing Americans for their lack of taste but he also lovingly describes scenic back roads and the few small towns that are still thriving, or are at least interesting (especially if they resist the lure of fast food chains and WalMarts). Anyone who went on endless car trips as a kid will definitely love this book. I must read more by Mr. Bryson!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I purchased the book (The Lost Continent - Travels in Small Town America) some time back and finally got around to reading it. Am disappointed in Bill Bryson with this book. Years ago I was given his book (A Walk in the Woods) and loved it. But this book about travel in small town America exposed Bill Bryson's very Liberal political bent. Even Mr. Bryson admitted that he was a lifelong Democrat. But he exposes the typical 'superiority - elitist' mindset of liberals in this book. When Mr. Bryson began to demean Republicans, and especially Southerners, I became upset with his book. He even lets the Liberal-Democrat anti-Christian mindset come through. You know - he makes humor at the expense of Southners and Christians, just as the late night TV talk shows do. I quit reading his book at chapter 7. There is no one I would give this book to, so into the trash it went.Tony L"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was a big fan of Bryson's book, A Walk In the Woods, which detailed his (somewhat truncated) journey along the Appalachian Trail. So it was with a sense of optimism that I opened his much older tome, The Lost Continent, seeking some insight as to life journeying through small-town America.That is how the book bills itself, but it's very misleading. I've identified several problems:(1) The book really does not discover small-town America or describe it at all. I found myself hopeful at several points when Bryson encountered odd small-towns in far-flung locales, but he never gives this anything but superficial treatment. This would have been much better if the focus of the book was Bryson's awkward interactions - say, at a little league game, or at a church fundraiser - with locals. I can't recall a single instance of that, except for his half-misogynistic descriptions of coffee-shop waitresses and the cheap banter between the two. In short, I didn't learn much about small-town America at all.(2) As to point (1), the book really focuses on a lot of big cities or obvious tourist attractions (e.g., downtown Philadelphia, Mt. Rushmore????) with superficial descriptions that could have been lifted from an encyclopedia. This was not what I expected or paid for.(3) Bryson traveled...alone. Is it me or is this just plain weird? In A Walk In the Woods, Bryson's interaction with his hiking companion made the book. Here, Bryson comes across as a fat, angry, loner recluse who talks to no one in the 38 states he visited. Sorry. The weirdness factor irked me.(4) I'm not sure there was a point to the book. Like I mentioned earlier, if this was a book about trying to find the perfect small-town in America (and eventually, say, finding it), then the book would be compelling and interesting. As it stands, the book is little more than a sarcastic version of a Mobil Travel Guide from the late 1980s.The only reason I give this two stars is that Bryson is funny. He delivers a few one-liners and zingers that are ones I'll remember. Many people, though, will find his humor arrogant. However, even this is not enough to make up for a book that is little more than one man's random (and increasingly angry) dictations along America's highways."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is a collection of stories about Bryson's trip around the country in search for the perfect small town, which calls &quot;Amalgam&quot;. It begins with a hilarious take on the Midwest (most notably Iowa, his home State) and stories from the family vacations of his youth. It is a travel book, and not intended as great literature, but it is truly laugh out loud funny. It is, I believe, a fair indictment of certain aspects of out society as reflected in the author's travels. A little caustic (think on the road with David Letterman), but really, really funny."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is rather un-patriotic, which is real fun and a real pain to those who think that the States are the most beautiful, exciting and grandiose country in the world. Well, they aren't. They can be downright boring and ridiculous and tacky; as tacky as it can get. Bryson is a sarcastic travel writer, enriched by his European experience that few Americans can grasp. A very entertaining book, harsh on the American Way of Life small-town version."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I've read and enjoyed other Bryson books, but this one was just not that funny. I feel sorry that some people who have never visited the US might read this and think we are a nation of Crudvilles. Bryson cracks on Beaufort SC because it's made up of retirees and military. So? I didn't know he disliked military families so much. I can tell by his anti-conservative attacks early on, but I don't understand this. He keeps telling us how cheap his father was, but he rants at the admission fees and evidently stays at cheap motels (pool tables with sheets for beds). The book has Small Town in the title but he visits Dearborn, New York City, DC, etc. It has its funny moments but overall I was left at the end thinking, \\"What DOES he like?\\""},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I'll start by saying I'm a Bill Bryson fan, having started by reading his book \\"A Walk in the Woods\\". He got me reading books again after a very long pause. As a 50-something babyboomer having grown up in Kansas before moving cross-country to Southern California 30 years ago, I found this book to offer a deeply introspective, yet hilarious, look at my childhood travels with the family. Also, as a devoted road-tripper, I felt as if I was travelling right along with Bill in an adventure that many of us would love to take given the time and appropriate situation in our lives. Bill's writing in this book, as well as his other books I've read, comes from a somewhat sarcastic style. I think this is his best, at least the equal to his \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" bestseller. The guy's got a knack for telling a story in a way that makes you feel instantly comfortable, want to travel with him - and see the humor,delight and yet experience insight into life's travels. If you are the kind of person who longs for the open road and appreciates a very genuine and intellectually humorous point of view, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was hoping that I would add dozens of interesting places to our vacation destinations for years to come. He could have presented the towns in a humorous manner without being so synical and negative.. The United States has many wonderful towns with very caring and interesting people."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I truly do not understand the hyperbolic praise lavished on this book. It stunk! His snooty, snotty tone made me feel like a captive stuck in his car as he plodded blindly across country. The notion of a cross-country trip rehashing childhood memories and providing opportunity for contemporary social commentary is a fine one, but good Lord this man couldn't be more snide if he tried! His goal seemed to be to find the bad in everything. I only feel sorry for him that he wasted his time and travels in this way. I did not find his rants and raves witty in the least; They were simply pathetic and unkind. And for crying out loud, has he ever heard of planning? He came to my home state of Massachusetts only to wander Provincetown a bit and then head up to Haverhill, of all places? It's his own fault for missing the beauty of this state. This is why they invented a little thing called \\"Travel Guides.\\" They GUIDE you in your TRAVELS to see the best of a particular area. Hello? Mr. Bryson? Ever heard of them? He seems to think any exit he chooses should blindly lead him to his \\"Amalgram,\\" or perfect town. Wishful thinking, my snooty, snotty friend. Readers, don't even bother with this one. If I sound mad, I am. There's nothing worse than wasting time on a book hyped up as funny that is anything but. (I confess, I read only the first half - then I came to my sense and did the equivalent of jumping out of his front seat onto the highway rather than continue being stuck with his interminable griping.)"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson's account of his journey through America leaves much to be desired in terms of wit, creativity, and respect for his subjects. In &quot;The Lost Continent,&quot; Bryson fails to share any insight on the United States or its citzens, but rather manages to bash both categories in a totally unobjective way that belies his overrated essence.While missing or barely grazing some parts of the country that are essential to its being (Boston, Texas, and Florida are just some of the subjects that are not mentioned), Bryson relates his depressing story of a nation apparently defined only by its dying downtowns and moronic diner waitresses (the dozens of inane conversations with the former that the author relates are each a spectacle of his lack of both creativity and civility.) In fact, the only region on which he passes high judgment is his home state of Iowa.Furthermore, Bryson's heavy-handed discussion of race relations and his consistent objectification of women seem more appropriate for a book written in 1959, not 1989.Bill Bryson is clearly writing for an audience that already disdains America and gets a kick out of his belittling of its residents. This book is worth reading only to further one's understanding of why ex-patriates should remain that way."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"What boring, superficial stuff! I could pick up better and more interesting and funnier impressions of a place by driving through it at sixty miles an hour than this deadbeat can by hanging around for a week!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Mr. Bryson is a writer of astonishingly meager abilities...here is a potentially rich and fascinating subject to which he has failed miserably to do justice, and the monumental chip on his shoulder makes for tortured reading. If I could have awarded him 0 stars, I would have! Look elsewhere for intelligent, enlightened, and humorous travel writing!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Brutal humour. I have read it three times and still laugh out loud. It appears this book has hit a raw nerve in some of my more sensitive fellow Americans, but if we can't laugh at ourselves what fun is there? Relax,it's the American way.God Bless Bill Bryson"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson's travelogue of the United States can be best described as a side-splitter. Like many of the others who have reviewed this book for Amazon, I found myself reading it out loud to anyone who was close by. A great way to make friends at crowded airports. This is the tale of Bryson's travels as a young adult with many references to his childhood experiences in Iowa doing such things as traveling on summer vacation with his parents and sister. While the book has a definite Iowa slant, his experiences are so universal that they will be enjoyed by all. What man has not wondered why the nubile cuties of his youth look as if they had swallowed airmattresses 10 or 15 years later. Bryson is cynical, jaded, snide and sentimental all at the same time. A good book for anyone who has traveled to Boston, Washington DC and particularly good for anyone with Iowa roots. And, by the way, his mother seems to be still alive and well - I saw an article in the Des Moines Register recently with her byline"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Fortunately this is not the first book from Bill Bryson I ever read or I would have given up. It is very insulting to Americans, especially small town people. Although his humor is at times funny it's also offensive (to me anyway). Even though he was born American, he was living in the UK and flew over to write this book. He portrays the heart of our nation as a bunch of idiots basically. Skip this one and get \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" instead."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one. As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it. Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all: one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity. Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Ostensibly in search of the perfect small town, Bryson drives all over the United States and finds nothing but ugliness. It never seems to dawn on him that the bleakness he sees all around him has nothing to do with America and everything to do with what's inside his own head. Every town he visits is a disappointment. The downtowns are dull, or the traffic's too heavy, or the food is bad, or there are too many trailers. Even the rich ones are awful--they have too many yuppies and they feel like stage sets. He even manages to revile a town in New Hampshire because the people there smile at him too much.Peacham, Vermont, on the other hand, is almost perfect. In that town, Bryson never spots a soul. He also likes another completely empty town, a summer resort in northern Michigan that has shut down for the winter season. It's Bryson's idea of heaven, and he can't stop raving about its spectacular empty mansions--not, that is, until he reaches a completely false community constructed by Henry Ford, who collected the houses of great men like Lincoln and Edison and gathered them into a kind of ghost town for heroes. Of course Bryson likes this place--there's no risk of encountering an actual inhabitant. Every person who once actually lived in those houses is dead.Bryson reserves his greatest scorn, though, for people. Everyone he sees is too fat, too old, too sad, or they drive too slowly. And worst of all, there's those doggoned waitresses! The fools won't stop trying to help him, refilling his water glass, asking if he needs anything else, thanking him for his requests. In return, he fantasizes about squirting them with ketchup and congratulates himself for never leaving tips. He does seem to like his mother, but that's about it for humanity. I hope she likes him back, because I certainly don't.I couldn't stop imagining wistfully what a writer like Garrison Keillor might have done with material like this--a writer who is a true humorist and not just an insult machine, a person whose mind is open enough and imagination is rich enough to discover what's actually worth knowing about the places where real people live. From a mind like Keillor's, the story of a trip like this one might have been entertaining. From Bryson's, it will sour your stomach, glaze over your vision with one more layer of dusty disappointment, and waste a stretch of your time."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Just briefly here--I'm not going to go through the whole book. I like Bill Bryson and know that obviously the guy is very smart and a talented, entertaining writer. Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" are favorites. OK, so I was disappointed in this. Why? I gained no insights into American life, small town or urban. And I found the overall tone of the book a little too negative in that Bryson at times seemed to be just mocking the small town folk with their funny ways of talkin', their funny names, their overall ignorance. Duh, for lack of a better word... I've traveled myself around this continent. He complains too much. I love being on the road. \\"Lost\\" he says. I may have missed something but did he mean it ironically? I don't feel like just laughing at rednecks and small town weirdos. I mean I already do. But if I read a book--ESPECIALLY by a guy as sharp as Bryson--I'd like better jokes and insights than I come up with. I kept feeling like, \\"tell me something I don't know\\". And our cities are dirty and violent. Yep. Bryson did his trip in the late 80s but that isn't so long ago. Well I got the impression the book was largely written for his British audience about that crazy, forever mind-bendingly backward, foreign land of his childhood. The funny thing with this book is the author has largely become a stranger to his own country but I can't relate enough to the x-pat's trip. It is all too familiar."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I'd read four Bryson books before I read this one, and this is the funniest of the lot. Irreverence and biting wit on almost every page. I've definitely had more laughs from this book than any other I've ever read.I can only assume that the people who are giving this riveting work a meager one star are the kind of people who are more than happy to laugh at Bryson poking fun at anyone else, but when his inimitable humor is directed at them it ceases to be funny. Kinda reinforces some Bryson's observations in this excellent work.Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I am a Bill Bryson fan but this book got old very quickly. Older middle aged readers might relate, as I did, to the endless car trips we took when we were young, in my case from Pittsburgh to Miami Beach in the summer without air conditioning. We loved the Burma Shave signs.The book did have a touch of Bryson's droll humor, but complaining is not funny and endlessly finding fault left me a bit defensive about small town America. I think younger readers would find it hard to connect with this book at all, other than as a history lesson, and the story of small towns in America is much more pleasant than depicted by Bryson. Maybe his writing can be better appreciated when his target is not so close to home."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This is a very funny book. Bryson's two road trips, covering 38 of the 48 continental United States, wind through many famous sites and cities as well as many small towns and endless boring miles in the Midwest. He takes these routes in search of the idyllic small towns he remembers from his youth and imagines, but instead finds that the strip malls, fast food joints and cheap hotels that dominate larger towns have taken hold everywhere. His descriptions of the people and places he visits are hilarious and I think it is too bad some reviewers take his comments personally. He was certainly exaggerating and generalizing his statments for humor, but that makes it entertaining. Certainly he comes off a bit whiny and sometimes mean, but that is Bryson's style and the way he writes all of his books. This is the most enjoyable Bryson book I've read to this point and I think anyone who has ever taken a car trip will appreciate it. It is excellent summer vacation reading."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's travel books, of which I've read several, don't require you to actually travel for enjoyment. I'm fairly certain this is the first of his travel adventures put into novel form, and although not as enjoyable as his later commentary on the U.S. (I'm A Stranger Here Myself) it's quite funny nonetheless. Buy it, read it, and then read his later works. You'll get a kick out of it.For what it's worth, I gave it 4 stars because it's a very funny book -- but if my review does not sound like a typical four star review, that's because his later works deserve 6 stars on the five star scale."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I spent this last summer reading the entire collection of Bryson's books and after much thought and energy give THE LOST CONTINENT: TRAVELS IN SMALL TOWN AMERICA the prize for being his finest work to date.As a writer, Bryson combines the genres of travelouge with personal memoir and in LOST CONTINENT achieves that unique voice that is all his. Always able to deftly combine erudite scholarship with personal insight and extremely salty humour, Bryson leads his audience through a personal journey of not only the American landscape but also his spititual topography as well.As he journeys across small town America- in a search for \\"Anytown USA\\" (an amalgam of all those MGM/Capraesque bygone hamlets), he wistfully searches to reclaim all the memories of his father. His father, a sportswriter, apparently led the Bryson brood on a multitude of spendthrift odysseys. As Bryson retraces the journeys of his childhood he relives so many rich memories that alternate between the comical and the honestly nostalgic without resorting to cheap sentimentality.Bryson constantly reveals little known histories and local color all the while criticizing and celebrating the subtle nuances that make up the American landscape. He takes shots at the obvious- strip malls, over commericalization and cheap tourist traps in ways that both raise the reader's ire and appeals to the sense of whimsy as well.Probably Bryson's greatest trick lies in his ability to inspire his reader to undertake similar journeys.A great read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson, living as an expatriate in London, returns to his roots in Des Moines and, borrowing his mother's Chevette, travels through 14,000 miles and thirty-eight states and looks at America. He did not really like what he saw in this often-entertaining and sometimes-annoying book.The Chevette was a pretty dreadful little car and perhaps it is not surprising that Bill Bryson seems to have travelled with his sarcasm gauge on full all the time. \\"The Lost Continent\\" is sub-titled \\"Travels in Small-Town America\\" but it should be \\"Travels Through Small-Town America\\" as the author does not get out of his car very much. He is on a Road Trip, which means driving endless numbing miles and meeting only those people essential to the Road Trip concept: waitresses, clerks in cheap motels and gas station attendants. He is looking for the one Perfect American Town, blended of all those virtues he imagines small towns in the United States enjoy and which he calls Amalgam.When he writes about his family and experiences growing up, Bill Bryson is very funny. There are parts of the book where you have to laugh out loud-the account of eating at the restaurant in Pennsylvania Dutch country where \\"I ate so much my armpits bulged\\"-and other parts that are less successful. Bill Bryson has an eye for funny detail but at the same time the reader has a feeling that he is patronizing of people who have not travelled, are poorly-educated or pronounce \\"Mississippi\\" the way people in Mississippi do. He badgers someone about why \\"Cairo\\" in Illinois is pronounced \\"Kay-ro,\\" a question that probably nobody could answer and could be just as suitably asked of him and Des Moines.There are unattractive aspects of life in America, including gun-related violence, an apparently low level of general knowledge, a grim history of racism and a national spiral into obesity but the people populating this book are only there to reinforce Bill Bryson's prejudices about the crumminess of his home country. But it would have been nice to see his wit directed at television producers, evangelists and politicians and for him to have stayed longer in a town that just required to fill up the tank or sleep for a night. Cooperstown, for example, was a town he liked for the Baseball Hall of Fame, but he does not mention the scholarship program available for all the high-school graduates there or how the town has successfully kept out the chain hotels and fast food places that so blight America everywhere else. \\"Welcome to Des Moines. This is What Death is Like.\\" is how he describes his hometown. Well, perhaps if you have never seen pictures of Grozny, the Chechen capital, or Kabul. And by the end of the book, Bill Bryson, the returning semi-Brit, is reconciled to his hometown again.Thrown together? Yes. Uneven? Yes. Quite funny in places? Absolutely."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love this book. It was the first Bill Bryson book I ever read, and it's still my favorite (just barely squeaking by A Walk In The Woods).I have a love for the offbeat, and quite frankly, Bill's travels in the book are like my dream vacation. If it's kitschy, I want to see it. If it's famous, more so.Because of this book, I once travelled 2 hours by car while on a business trip to Michigan so I could visit the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. If Bill hadn't written so lovingly about it, I might not have thought of it when I was on the trip. This is now MY favorite museum as well. Thanks Bill! Keep writing!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It's not supposed to be a serious travel book, people! Maybe it's because I have lived in many of the places Bryson describes in this book, but I recognize all these types of people he meets along the way and he is dead-on in his descriptions. This book made me a Bryson fan forever, although some of his other book never quite hit this level of hilarity (with the exception of A Walk in the Woods). I used to read this on the train to work, and I had to clamp a hand over my mouth to keep from laughing aloud! This is one of my alltime favorite books! Just TRY it!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"He's a bad man is Bill Bryson. He says all the things I wish I'd thought of first. \\"Some of the shops were just a bit twee, I must admit. One of them was called The Cutest Little Shop In Town, which made me want to have the Quickest Little Puke in the County\\". In his irreverent drive around The States, Bryson never leaves you in any doubt about what he likes and what he doesn't like. Of one town, he says, \\"I walked up Thames Street, where some fine old sea captains' homes were fighting a losing battle with litter and dog sh*t and the encroachment of gas stations and car transmission places. It was all very sad. This was a place where the people didn't seem to care, or perhaps just didn't notice how shabby they had let things grow. It reminded me of London.\\" So, are you left in any doubt? And when he sings the praise of a town or region, he sings it high.The Lost Continent is both informative and amusing - very amusing. Bryson's satirical observations are splendidly catalogued and beautifully tailored for the job in hand. Five out of five for an excellent journey, minus one for some slightly more tedious moments part way through."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read this book several years ago...this was my first of many Bill Bryson books in fact. I was on a flight from Ireland to the USA, sitting in the middle of the plane, next to a kindly American Catholic Priest from Rhode Island, and two middle-aged American women. I giggled and laughed out loud so many times that they all kept asking me 'Why...What...' I attempted to read to them from the book. I'm not sure that they found the humour as funny as I did...and I kept giggling as I read. I think this book is well worth a read. I am an American living in Ireland for 10+ years...and it IS healthy to have a laugh about our great, quirky, interesting and mundane all at the same time, country!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was my introduction to the cynical, twisted but always hilarious mind and writing of Bill Bryson. The basic premise was to re-discover America after years of exile(?) in Great Britain by driving around the country and observing how life had changed in his absence.A number of reviewers are put off by the fact that he does not hold everything that he encounters in mystical awe. He does on occasion, approach a mean-spirited tone, but more often than not his comments hit the mark. Others point out that he never stops and talks to the people of the country, but simply drives through. Well, isn't that pretty much what America is today, a driving society.All in all, a funny book that will bring back memories of that great institution, the Family vacation. If you've enjoyed Bryson's other works, by all means check this one out, you won't be dissapointed. If you're looking for an earnest travel log or some gentle folksy humor, you'd best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I loved this book. Bryson captures my many memories of family vacations stuffed in the back seat of a station wagon with my sister and brother with frugal but loving parents in the front seat. Hours spent on long highways driving through small towns before interstates were built are accurately captured with brutal reality and sarcastic humor and wit by Bryson. WARNING: If you don't have the ability to laugh at yourself you will not like this book. Bryson pokes fun at everybody, including you, whoever you are. But Bryson also pokes fun at himself. If you ever spent interminable hours staring out a car window on a cross country drive and you have a good sense of humor, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"What a disappointment! I have read all of Bill Bryson's other books eagerly and they were some of the best entertainment I've had with a mix of sarcasm and an appreciation for life. This newest book is written by a Bill Bryson who has evidently become a bitter old man. His humor is weak, and his sarcasm is mean and cold. He has none of the balance of positive with negative that made his previous books a delight. If you love Bill Bryson . . . don't buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Try as I might, I found this book neither witty nor real. After the first chapter, one could only sumise Mr. Bryson to be a very unhappy person, and using writing as his tool for therapy. Every sentence of every chapter is such a dreary and negative depiction of people and life in the States. My only question... why did he choose to move back to the States?"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book is hilarious and I am very disappointed in some of the poor reviews I have read. Just because Bill Bryson pokes fun at some aspects of americans doesn't mean he hates america. Who could write a whole about a country they couldn't stand? The guy even moved back to the U.S. after leaving overseas for many years. Get a sense of humor. If you want a boring travelougue that will put you to sleep then go read something else. By the way, read Fark.com daily and you'll see what kind of nuts live here in the U.S. Laughing is the only to dull the pain!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; isn't his best work, but it's still pretty good. Compared to his other books (I've read &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; and &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;), this one doesn't seem to have much of a spark. It feels like he wrote it more for himself, and less for his readers, as a way to reacquaint himself with the United States after a 10-year stint in England. That said, I enjoyed reading &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; all the same. Sure, his bleating and whining about American foibles gets a little old, but his sense of humor and poignant observations are classic Bryson: just good, clean cantankerous fun. If you're looking for a great piece of travel writing, I don't recommend &quot;The Lost Continent.&quot; Nor will you like it if you're thin-skinned about American criticism. But if you want a quick and enjoyable read, with plenty of humorous tales, then Bryson, as usual, won't disappoint you here."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"It's quite clear from some of the previous reviews that this uproariously hilarious book has riled some of Bryson's rather humourless compatriots. Yes, he is scathing about the creeping homogeneity of life in the US (something which is creeping malevolently over to Europe - thanks guys) and some of his countrymen's insularity, parochialism and sheer ignorance but this book is imbued with a deep sense of loss and regret. Bryson is quite transparently upset at how his country is being dumbed-down and how the huge corporate chains and malls are destroying downtowns and communities across the nation. Unfortunately, many of your reviewers chose to see The Lost Continent as an affront to their patriotism rather than as a long-overdue wake-up call. It's now probably too late."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson, an expatriot from London, comes to America for a swing through 38 states. He whines, through sarcastic humor, about what a terrible place most of america is, with its strip malls or dead country towns. Then he hits historical places, and he whines that it is too expensive to visit the place, so he doesn't; never mind that it is expensive to run these places. He whines about how terrible the food is and how we americans don't like to walk. The billing of the book is an expat who views america after having been gone for many years. I would have rather he just stayed away and not written the book!!! If you want to read a good travel book, see Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter S. Thompson or On the Road, Jack Kerouac."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Mr. Bryson may appeal to certain types, but I find no humour in his trashing of small town life in America. Bryson finds great pleasure in seeking out the worst in every town he \\"visits,\\" then writes disparagingly about the inhabitants, even mocking the various dialects he encounters. He paints a negative image of the places he visits, often perpetuating outdated stereotypes in order to make the place seem worse. Anyone who goes looking for the worst elements of a locale will likely find them. He then exaggerates those findings. Such great talent has he.Mr. Bryson seems to have a rather high opinion of himself, but his writing reveals that he is actually full of himself (and full of something else). He lived in England for a number of years apparently curing him of his American upbringing. Now he has returned to report back to the rest of the world how bad his native country really is.His boorish exaggerations, intentional disparaging remarks, frequent use of vulgar language, and lack of any genuine interest in his subject matter (other than to sell books) leads me to believe he is a less decent form of life than any of the people he so mercilessly belittles in his book. For all their perceived shortcomings, those people are authentic. Bryson is a phony, and I might add, a very unattractive bloke himself.What a shame so many readers fall for his second-rate comedy.Please move back to England Bryson, and don't return."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I love car trips and also have memories of childhood back seat adventures, so I looked forward to this read. I made it about half way through and gave it up as a depressing waste of time. For a much better look at regional quirks and differences I recommend another mid-westerner, Calvin Trillin. In ALICE, LET'S EAT, for example, he visits places with people much different from himself...and writes with great wit about what he sees and does. If he makes a bit of fun of his adventures it is infused with a fondness for the people he meets and a delightful self deprecating attitude. Quite the opposite of Bryson's arrogant attitude."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Unless you're one of those truely pathetic types who cannot stomach ANY criticism of America and Americans, you'll love 'The Lost Continent'. It is probably Bill Bryson's finest work, which is really saying something, since he is one of the finest writers around today.And fair's fair: We thoroughly enjoyed reading Bryson's hysterically ascerbic and witty comments about Europe, Europeans and other people and places, so we ought to love it when he gives us the very same treatment, and the fact is he does it so much better than anybody else!*** SPOILER ALERT ***But here's a tip for you sad types who would call French Fries \\"Freedom Fries\\": At the end of 'The Lost Continent', in the last few pages -- the ones you didn't see because you had a tantrum and threw the book down after only making it to around page 7 -- Bryson recants, and expresses his undying admiration and love for America and Americans."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The Lost Continent: Travels in Small-Town AmericaHow I enjoyed this audiobook--what a hoot! Once again, I was charmed by Bill Bryson's words and his wry sense of humor. His take on traveling the highways and by-ways will have you giggling and commenting out loud. In trying to maneuver his way through intersections fraught with highway signs (or the lack thereof) to deciphering the local dialect (especially in the deep South) will keep you entertained and nodding your head in agreement. After listening, I was ready to put on my traveling shoes.The only thing negative I have to say about the audio version is that while the intonations were mostly spot on, the reader (Kerry Shale) talked way too fast and, for me, that took away some of the enjoyment of listening. I would have preferred a more leisurely read.But overall, it was quite good and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Like the author, I grew up in Iowa. And that's primarily why I read this book. Bryson returns to the USA after working for years in Britain and takes a nostalgic roadtrip through small town America. Yes, some of his humor and observations are sarcastic, but that's part of the fun. The reader has to understand the need for us to laugh at our idiosyncracies and inconsitencies. It's apparent that some reviewers here took offense instead of smiling, and a writer always runs that risk when using satire as a comedic device. Some folks are too insecure or just plain dull to enjoy it. If you have a sense of humor and don't feel threatened by the occasional parody, then you'll enjoy this book. If you can only take everything literally, stick to the newspaper."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The title of my review says it all. That's pretty much what the book is, over and over. Yes, it gets a little repetitive, but Bryson makes it funny the whole way. My guess is that if someone else tried to write this book, you could read the first ten pages and then stop without missing anything.Bryson's style is really easy to read. I polished off all 300 pages of this over the course of two or three days in spite of my efforts to go slow and take the scenic route. It's the kind of book you can read for many hours straight without a break, and then when you finally do decide to stop for the night, it's only because you should get to sleep.The book is split into the two halves of his trip, East and West. Bryson doesn't hesitate to poke fun, mock, and at times be downright mean to the towns he goes through. Sometimes they're just asking for it.Overall, the book is a quick read that's worth it. A little repetitive, but loaded with funny quips and observations."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is a wonderfully gifted, clever, witty writer. At his best, he can be utterly charming and/or side-splittingly funny. Much of Lost Continent, however, is not his best. Indeed, much of it is just plain mean-spirited. His targets here are so easy. He seeks out the tacky places, then lampoons them as tacky. Well, yes. At times, he displays a mean-spiritedness that is almost scary, such as when, while listening to a banal conversation among a few Georgia ladies about birthdays that they or family members share w Presidents. Innocuous enough, if banal, right? I mean, most of my conversations &amp; Bryson's I would venture, are equally banal, if eavesdropped upon. Bryson's reaction: &quot;I toyed for a moment with the idea of grabbing the woman by both ears &amp; driving her forehead into my knee.&quot; Whoa, Bill! Go straight to anger management class, do not pass go, do not collect $200. And the unresolved issues with the father! Get a shrink! There are enough honest laughs here that I can't rate it less than 3 stars. But lighten up, big guy! At least he did in Walk in the Woods. I look forward to his new travelogue in Australia, if firm hopes that he has now exorcised all his demons."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Having just completed a 30,000 mile road trip to photograph citizens in 53 towns in the USA with the funniest names you've ever heard, I can tell you that Bryson's observations are excruciatingly on target and snortingly funny. He sees beneath the contrived commercial and pointless idiocies that coat America's boonies and larger towns. It's satire with an appropriate but minimal garnish of respect and every word is true. He sees us as we are and makes us laugh out loud. I want him in my car for my next foray into the boonies. If you don't think he's funny, then you must be in his line of fire."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"As with most of Bryson's books, he reveals too much of his own personality, which is pretty distasteful. This rather privileged baby boomer son of the American upper-middle class (he admits that his father was a well-paid sportswriter) roams across the country, finding fault with virtually everything he sees and experiences. It's amazing and disheartening how many of his observations are just exercises in bashing the white American working class and lower-middle class, those &quot;tacky&quot; people who actually shop at K-Mart. While in those sections that describe his travels in the Southern states he takes great pains to express his sympathy for oppressed blacks, he has no compunctions in writing about lower-class whites in language that would be considered incredibly racist if his victims were members of racial or ethnic minority groups.On the other hand, the last few chapters of the book, when he has finished his grand circuit of the United States and has finally returned to his beloved Iowa, degenerate into almost a hokey Midwestern boosterism. He tells us ad nauseum about the wonderful, homespun virtues of the Midwest, and especially Iowa, in contrast to the alleged coldness and hostility of Westerners and Southerners. (Perhaps people in the latter two regions had seen his photo in his previous books and recognized him, which might explain their behavior; I certainly wouldn't want any contact with Bryson.) Ironically, Bryson chose to settle in New England when he finally returned to the United States, which suggests that his nostalgia for the good old Midwest was short-lived.I finished this book, which Bryson dedicated to his late father, with the impression that it was a kind of emotional catharsis for him after his father's death. There seems to be a strong whiff of unfinished business about this whole work, as if it were a long apology to a parent with whom he had lost contact forever.In short, Bryson is an glib but shallow writer with a bad case of Anglophilia. If he finds American life so repugnant, he should probably return the the U.K. permanently and take out British citizenship."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"There are two view that readers seem to take on Bill Bryson : thos that enjoy the humorous side of his books and those who appreciate the travel.This, in my opinion, is the only book in which he has managed to excel at both.Though born in Des Moine, Iowa, Mr. Bryson spent many years living in England. His travels through small town USA are therefor part-tourist, part-native. His insights are very accurate and his desciptions are informative without being dull.Once or twice, he overdoes the humor by repeating a joke, but he more than makes up for that in othe parts of the book. Mr. Bryson shows us a side of the US that not many of us see in our mad-dash everyday lives. I first read this book while living in England and then again after living in Arizona for a number of years. Having had the benefit of spending time in both places, I appreciated the humor more the second time around.The Lost Continent is not a guide book and you're not going to find it too much use if you're planning a drive across the country. However, it's a useful book to read if you want to take a little time to notice the smaller, less significant parts of the world that we pass by.And it's still the best of all his books."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I was given &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; by a dear friend of mine who lives in the UK and has been a Bryson fan for years. I was anticipating a sharp, wicked and biting commentary on America today. Instead I read all that I could on the plane back to the US before finally throwing it aside in disgust. It was so painfully awful an experience that I have not fully forgiven my well meaning, but completely misguided friend.Bryon returns to America after years of living, happily it seems, in England. He attempts to find the perfect small town and document his travels and adventures along the way, but by the time he reached my home states of Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, I had my doubts that he had even journeyed the places he mentions.His anecdotes are so obviously self contrived that I kept waiting for a Dave Barry like insertion of &quot;This REALLY did happen!&quot; or &quot;I swear that THIS part is true!&quot; I am sure that there is a waitress in rural America who still has her own teeth, but Bryson was hard pressed to encounter one.Let's face it - it is easy to make fun of the rural South, but Bryson seems stymied for ammunition without refering to the horrors of racial strife in the past - curiously he never encounters a single instance of racial conflict. He is stopped by a thickly accented policeman who asks how he is enjoying his trip, and is &quot;wink-wink&quot; amazed to leave the encouter without being shot. HELLO! Busing in Boston! Shootings in Bed Stuy, NY! You would think that Bryson hadn't read a newspaper in the last 20 years.I think the incident that irked me most was his condensending attitude toward some young women who had never heard of Thomas Hardy, and yet he brags of never having read Faulkner. WILLIAM FAULKNER for god's sake - and Bryson professes to be a writer?! Perhaps a copy of the Cliff Notes might help him dig through &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; but then, that might require him to actually learn something true and real about the American South.I haved lived in the US all my life, but I have worked for major British companies for the last 4 years. I have also spent a small amount of time in the UK and I belive that I have some understanding of the differences that seperate our cultures. It seems to me that Bryson's mean spirited writings are driven by his own insecurities. Face it baby, you are one of us no matter how much time you spend in London and no matter how rounded you now form your vowels."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bill Bryson is one of my favorite authors, however this book was a big let down. The book describes Mr.Bryson's experience while traveling through the United States and reflects his opinions relating to those experiences. Unfortunatly, all of those experiences are negative. It is appearant that Mr. Bryson did not hold a high opinion of the U.S. or it's Citizens at the time of this writing. Though Mr.Bryson began as a travel writer,his real strength lies in his history based books. I'm still a Bryson fan. This just isn't my favorite."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I read 3 of Bill Bryson's books prior to this one - A Walk in the Woods, In a Sunburned Country and The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid. The idea of a roadtrip across America written by him sounded delicious.The Lost Continent was written before those 3 books and I didn't find it as enjoyable. There is the same lilting prose and some really laugh-out-loud funny descriptions but then he went too far I guess trying to be funny. I'm not sure who he thought his audience was but I would bet it would have insulted at least some of the people living in the towns he visited. I thought some of the comments were outright rude and judgemental and I don't even live in the US. He generally wrote as if he would thankfully never come that way again. I finished it just to see if there was some sort of full-circle realization but not really. This was an excellent theme for the writer, so full of material with which to display his writing charm. I wish he could write this book now, but what's done is done.If I were Bryson, I would let this book drift out of print."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I liked it. Pretty funny. Fairly harsh and quite critical of general American society. It is very frank. He didn't pull punches. He called the towns as he saw them. I spent 10 days in Europe last summer and when I came back, there were a lot of things about American society that really drove me nuts. I can see how spending several years in England, especially if you have a rather 'liberal' ideology could lead you to making several of the comments that he did in the book. (I'm not saying Europe is the greatest place on earth, it is just different, and some of that difference is better). Lots of Americans are way overweight. Lots of Americans don't walk anywhere. In most places in America, it is damn near impossible to walk anywhere without climbing over barriers or worry about being hit by a car.The book is basically one pot-shot after another, since he doesn't spend enough time in any one town to get to really know anyone or truly get to know anything about the town. You have to read the book for what it is, one long road trip with the only destination being returning home. Just long stretches of road with small towns along the way for stopping points to sleep in. It is a light read, but not very enlightening. Still pretty funny."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"When I first started reading this book I thought it was great. I'm American but I certainly think America can be very culturally barren. When Bryson went to town on America and it's people I thought it was hillarious. He is very funny, honest, and mean. And I loved it. The problem is that all this book does is have him drive to a small town and make fun of people there and then go to another town and do the same thing. When I was about halfway through the book I realized that I could choose any chapter at random and it wouldn't matter. I quit halfway through because the book was going nowhere. There doesn't seem to any real point to his book other than that he thinks Americans are stupid and that their towns suck. He doesn't develop anything about that such as why this is the case, what it means to the world, or even what's so great about living in Britain. Overall this book was just an exercise in being a .... I do that everyday of my life but you don't see me writing a book about it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I should have taken note of the reviews for this book. He gets weary and critical from the get-go and never lets up, even after a winter break! I know many of the places and agree with many of his observations but he could have &quot;lightened up&quot; a bit! A better read for a third of the price!"},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This book was the worst of all of Bryson's books that I have read! It is a nonstop complaint of cities and farmland alike. Bryson has absolutely nothing good to say about most of the places he visits. He writes of trying to find the \\"perfect\\" American town, yet he never ventures far enough to really find it. Instead, he rambles on about horrible food (of course the food will be bad if you don't want to spend any money), boring radio stations (cds or mixes would solve this problem), and mean americans (I would not be friendly either if you are going to complain about my neighbors and business). Please. This country has a lot to offer, and Bryson did not showcase much of it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Think of this premise: Take a road trip, write a supremely boring book with some of the dumbest cliche jokes on the planet, and because your name is Bill Bryson, make a whole bunch of money.I do recommend this book if you are stuck in prison doing a life sentence and its either read The Lost Continent or stare at the walls of your cell. For me, I'd stare at the walls.To be fair and talk about the contents of the book, it is the recounting of Bill taking a road trip to attempt to remind himself of what small town America is like. He remembered it from his childhood and returned from living in England to see if his memories were what small town America is really like.In the end, The Lost Continent is as readable as the phone book."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"A friend gave me this book for Christmas and I just recently took the time to read it. I'm glad I did. Bryson's descriptions of the people he met in his travels seem to hit the nail on the head and made me say \\"I know that guy\\". On the other hand I couldn't understand why it was that Bryson made this trip alone. (Maybe the rest of his family was mad at him.) I found his comments about his father to be distasteful. Most of the places he visited he wrote about negatively, finding fault at the least little thing, with very few exceptions. It was as if he expected them to jump with joy upon his arrival. He apparently ran into some trouble in the west as he spent a lot of time denigrating their way of life as compared to the mid-west, and then to top if off he moves to Hanover, N.H.?? There is no doubt that there is a lot of humor, or just plain funniness in his writing, but at the same time there seems to be a lot of \\"put downs\\", the waitresses, the bar tenders, the gas station attendents, etc. I wouldn't recommend this book as a travel guide because I think Bryson missed many of the really interesting places in the U.S. He seemed determined to visit the little out of the way places that are just trying to survive. Anyway, I did find the book entertaining, mostly because of his descriptions of people, i.e. the breakfast waitress was really and accurate description of what most of us have experienced, but we must also remember these are usually young people trying to earn enough money to go back to college in the fall...Bryson seems to ignore this. Probably he would do better as a stand-up comic. I would recommend this book if somebody wanted something to just plain laugh at, but not to find a true description of the America that I know."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"While author Bill Bryson was a child in Iowa, his family took many road trips to other places by car. Bill, now a 36 year old expatriate, decides to retrace these trips to recapture the whimsical, nostalgic memories of his 1950s childhood. Bill's narration is definitely funny and spot-on. I couldn't help but hold my breath until he got to towns I'd been to or knew of, to see how his brain interpreted it."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"This reads like a book the author wrote to fulfil some contractual obligation.The 'plot' can be summarized as follows: Drive a car into a small town, check into some hotel, make disparaging comments on a few people and then do it all over again. There are some genuinely funny moments in the book but at times it does feel like the author is trying too hard to be funny. Also, a place is pretty or ugly depending on the author's mood.IMO, other reviewers who are offended by the author are missing the point as I don't think he was being serious (I thought this was a dead giveaway when he makes jokes on his parents). But then again, am not an American who grew up in a small town, so its easier for me to feel that way.All in all, a harmless little book which can (will) be forgotten the moment you turn the last page."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I laughed so many times reading this book, it hurt my belly. I recognized many people just like the ones I grew up with back home.This look at the foibles of small town America will have you rolling on the floor.... and sharing with your friends the devastating slices of life he so ably portrays.Get this book for no other reason than to lend it to your best (open-minded) friends."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"The Lost Continent, by Bill Bryson is a hilarious book. It talks about his trip across the country and back.Bryson is from Iowa, and some of the book is spent making fun of his own people.Bill starts his trip in Des Moines, where he has lived for his whole life, retracking the trips that his father had taken the family on. His father's death is what initiated his whole trip.Bryson is a great writer especially if you like funny stories. I can't remember laughing out loud at a book before I read this. He is also very descriptive when he writes. I could visualize every aspect of the book. I have no trouble relating to this book either; it really seems like he is a \\"normal\\", (if you will), type of guy.The setting may be the most important part of the book because Bryson is contsantly describing where he is and what it is like. I feel like I am \\"there\\" when he describes the towns, roads, and people.It is easy to make a plot like this quite boaring, but with the comedy and descriptiveness, Bill Bryson does a wonderful job of keeping your attention.Enjoy Bill's trip through America. This is really a must read."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"Bryson's account proves to me that education leaves a lot to be desired. Some quotes...&quot;the Sunday New York Times - and it's well worth every trembling leaf. So what if our grandchildren have no oxygen to breathe? F**ck 'em&quot;. &quot;The average Southerner has the speech patterns of someone slipping in and out of consciousness&quot;. &quot;I was alone with a small bag of pathetic treats in the most boring town in America&quot;. I think the most boring part of the trip was Bryson himself. Although his writing shows glimpses of real humor, and real wit, most of his attempted humor is at the expense of real people. People who wisely left this pompous fool alone. I'm glad I picked up the hardcover version of this book at a garage sale for 50 cents. Then again, maybe I overpaid."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"I picked this up because it looked like a fun read of a time gone by in Middle America. I expected a lively rolicking tale.I got into the first chaper, flipped thru, read random paragraphs and the book is now in my Goodwill pile.This was my first Bill Bryson book. A friend was raving about A Walk in the Woods and Bryson's writing. I stopped her and said I wasn't going to waste my money. I cited my experience with this book. \\"Oh. Ah. Yeah.\\" She said. \\"Yeah. I wouldn't've read anything else by Bryson if that were my first book of his either.\\"That pretty much sums it up. The author comes across as a petty, mean-spirited, prejudiced SOB with a crude sense of humour. I really wish I could get my money back."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent","review":"If you are an idealist, this book is not for you.However, if you dont see the world through rose-colored glasses, lack the American trait of calling a turd a flower, and have a sharp sense of humor this is the best book you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Weekend Crafter: Stamping: Beautiful Ways to Decorate Paper, Fabric, Wood, and Ceramics in a Weekend","review":"I will use this book as a resource.Ms. Bawden does a great job of describing and illustrating different stamping techniques.

She also instructs on how to choose and use pre-manufactured stamps and tools. She then uses them in many different projects which are very well photographed step-by-step.The stamping that she does is concentrated on crafts for the home and decorating.

Though she does show how to create beautiful and original cards and stationery.I've already used a couple of her ideas and am excited to try more."},{"Title":"Penal Colony","review":"This collection was edited by Kafka's great friend, the man who saved his writings from the flames, Max Brod. It contains the work which Kafka published in his lifetime, including 'Meditation' 'The Judgment' The Metamorphosis' ' The Country Doctor' ' In the Penal Colony' and three pieces of travel- writing.Had Brod obeyed his friend's instruction and burned his work, then this present collection would be what we have of Kafka. We would not have the Journals, the Letters to his Father, Milena, and others, the novels, The Castle, the Trial, most of Amerika.Nonetheless even from what there is in this volume alone we can see that we are dealing with one of world Literature's great originals. The uncanny and mysterious character of Kafka's writing, those strange riffs of reasoning which take us to places in imagination we have never been before pervade this volume.Two illustrations. First, the Bucket Rider a small story , a parable of the human soul in search of heat, and help meeting the cruelty of winter cold and the merciless human heart. The other, ' Metamorphosis' in which Kafkean self- contempt seems to find its most perfect embodiment, and in which we observe Gregor Samsa struggling to communicate with his family and the world to remain alive, only to be rejected in the end by those he loves and cares about.Camus said that Kafka is a writer that must be reread and reread if he is to be addressed properly. The element of parable in his writing is a major element in urging us to this rereading. In the famous 'Before the Law' and in the 'Imperial Messenger' we have two examples in which there is that improbable Kafkean combination of a special fate and chosenness combined with a cosmic impossibility and failure.I would have preferred to see introductions to each seperate piece here including details of the first publication of the work, and if possible of Kafka's considerations regarding each work. That is I would have preferred more extensive editorial work here.But this lapse cannot detract from the remarkable power of these stories. Rereading them after quite a few years away from them I am again struck by how wholly different Kafka seems from any other writer. I don't think that even Borges could teach him how to better write his Parable."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"I wish I could give this more then 5 stars. It is the most comprehensive book I've read for hands-on healing for animals. The author doesn't just offer hand placements but provides a wealth of information on other aspects that effect the pet's overall well being. The book covers scientific evidence of healing, explains auras and chakras, environmental impacts, animal communication - including a meditation for developing the ability, properties for working with crystal energy, and astrological signs that influence your pet. The last chapter discusses complementary therapies such as acupuncture, homeopathy, and chiropractic.The only challenge I have is in the beginning of the book the author seems to oversimplify the ability for anyone to provide hands-on healing. I do believe we all have the innate ability to channel universal energy, but I believe a lot of us have \\"forgotten\\" who we are and our natural abilities. Later in the text the author does acknowledge it may take years for an individual to develop this inherent ability. Personally I recommend taking a class, whether it is Reiki, TT, HT, or any other energy healing modality if you're interested in hands on healing."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"I am a certified holistic health practitoner, and the owner of Reiki4Paws in Arizona. As a practitioner, I get many questions and often need to find resources for clients, so I read many books. This book is one of the best resources I've read for people who are new to energy healing. I actually bought a copy for my vet. Ms. Coates explains the basics clearly, without confusing readers about the different names for different philosophies or modalities. Many of the differences come about simply through evolution of one method or cultural differences. In this book, the basics are presented, along with scientific information. Readers also get enough information to do further research, if they desire."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"I have read many books on healing, but this one is a winner, not only for beginners but for experienced healers.When you start out learning to heal it can be a confusing time, but this book puts you on the right track immediately with simple and easy to understand methods.If you love animals this book also can be a great source of comfort to be able to apply these methods that are taught in such simple terms to a loved animal."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"This is one of the BEST books I have encountered on healing energy work for animals.I use it extensively and highly recommend it to all animal lovers.My dogs give it a big \\"paws up\\"!"},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"This is the best empathic book for fellow empaths and pet lovers.

I rate #1 on the healing practice,and excellent for beginners of being healers."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"I love this book. It's very comprehensive and in addition to teaching on animal chakras and healing through those, Coates discusses the use of crystals which I found to be very helpful. Her discussion of the brachial or key chakra that not many other healers discuss with animals I found to be spot on with my own feelings, and without this book I would not have been able to help my own dog Millie.If Coates' methods seem simple - it's because they are. I was lucky enough to attend a workshop with Margrit Coates and healing really is something we all have the ability to do quite simply. She's very down-to-earth which should hopefully not put off those who are unconvinced by new age stuff. And she does say that healing is not a preferred route to going to a holistic vet first. If you can't get to see her personally as I think she spends most of her time in the UK, I thoroughly recommend the book. She also does a DVD that I think only plays on UK DVD players or computers that take it. The CDs I also find nice when massaging animals."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"This was wonderful!

She has lived with me since she was about 3 months old. She is now 5 years old and still runs and hides every time I or anyone comes around her. She is constantly in the \\"fight or flight\\" mode that her mother taught her. She has never scratched me and allows me to touch her when she is cornered but was always alert. I was hoping that Reiki healing would help her trust me and relax. The day I received my attunement I went home and started working on Gizzi. I intuitively focused on her lower back area. During our 3rd session, she liked it so much she repositioned herself with her back to me so she could get the full effect. Once I got the book and reviewed the chakras for cats, ironically the areas that I intuitively focused on were her Base Chakra, which governs instinct, survival and instinct and the Sacral Chakra which governs relationships and emotional needs.With more treatments I am confident that she will eventually worm up to me.This book is required reading for animal lovers."},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"If you are interested REIKI and healing the animal world than this book is a must read - I both enjoyed and learned alot from this reading.MEC"},{"Title":"Hands-On Healing for Pets: The Animal Lover's Essential Guide to Using Healing Energy","review":"This is a very wonderful, extremely informative book.

I've periodically searched for this book for the last twenty years, and now I'm so glad to have read it. It helps to explain why I enjoyed the man's novels so much.I was aware that Mr. Shute worked in aeronautical engineering, but had no idea he played such an important role in the industry. I had pictured his early engineering work much like his character in &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot;, a task oriented almost 'nerd-like' man with no interest beyond the laboratory. In an age when people seem to do all possible to elevate their public persona it is refreshing to look at a man who possessed humility.I realize now how Mr. Shute could develop such wonderful characters in his novels, people with a full range of foibles but also the quiet courage that perserveres through struggles. He had his own life and his own dignity to build upon."},{"Title":"Slide rule;: The autobiography of an engineer","review":"The detailed account of the design and transatlantic flight of the dirigible R-100 is the most fascinating part of this book.

What it doesn't contain is any guidance as to HOW to improvise successfully. While some might argue that improvisation, by definition, is something you make up yourself, I believe that a few examples would be very helpful to a beginner musician (after all, who else would want to buy this book?). Another thing, this book amazingly doesn't contain the Blues scale. Big mistake! In summing it up, I'd rather pay a few dollars more for something that lives up to its title."},{"Title":"Confessions of a basketball gypsy: The Rick Barry story","review":"I was hoping given this came out when Rick Barry was in the ABA with the New York Nets that there'd be a lot more insight into that era of the rival league. It's more Barry pining for a return to the NBA after his jump to the Oakland Oaks backfired after a season and the team moved to Washington.The book is a basically done in the oral history style and features, of course, Barry himself as well as his father-in-law Bruce Hale (who coached him at the University of Miami as well as with the Oakland Oaks...that helps explains why Barry jumped from the San Francisco Warriors), other players, coaches, etc.I did get to learn a lot about college ball in Miami back in the days before Miami really was on the sports map. The whole early days in the NBA on the Warriors and playing in San Francisco is great for those of us who only caught onto the team after their move across the SF Bay to Oakland.Also, those of us who follow basketball know Barry got fired from his post-playing gig for some racist comments. Maybe they should have read this book first. He criticizes some black players as being lazy but the words somehow come out all wrong (even if you read it carefully and see Barry is ...well, I don't know he's trying to say):\\"The civil-rights movement has come to dominate every area of our life. Maybe it's more important, maybe until justice prevails it should be dominant, but it is destructive to an athletic team. Some of the blacks on the Caps were disinterested in basketball. If they weren't playing they blamed it on racial prejudice. If they got called for a foul they called the ref a bigot...\\" It goes on a bit more and all this may be 100% true that happened but how can you say that even in the late 1960s or early 1970s? Also, given Barry was notorious for whining to refs for foul calls, it seems incongruous he did not understand the difference between words in battle vs. actual viewpoints. Did he honestly think blacks who may have called refs bigots were bigots?When you get to this part of the book (p. 170 in my edition) it is jarring as up till then you have no idea it's coming. I have harped on this much too long so let's look at some of the positives. Starting with the cover which is unintentional comedy at its best. So the marketing geniuses in the '70s figured an iconic shot of Barry driving the lane, shooting a jumper or tossing a free throw in his unique underhanded style not work and went with leather vest ready for the disco look.I loved the stuff on Nate Thurmond--one of the truly underrated greats of the NBA--and also on travel during that era. Learning about the number of exhibition games teams played (basically to make money more than get players ready for the season) was a shock. It's like the NBA went barnstorming for the pre-season.In the end, though, reading this shows how much sportswriting and player biographies have grown. Compared to, say, the Oscar Robertson, Jerry West or Pete Maravich bios that have come out in the 21st century, this is extremely weak effort."},{"Title":"Confessions of a basketball gypsy: The Rick Barry story","review":"What an intersting story 40 year old book but really fun to see how times have stayed the same about people. and hes quite a intersting guy"},{"Title":"Stories from Holy Writ","review":"Helen Waddell was a sensitive translator of Mediaeval Latin Lyrics, into beautiful English verse, published in two much praised books,one named above and \\"More Latin Lyrics\\". \\"Stories from Holy Writ\\" could be said to be charming \\"spin-offs\\" from her work on translations and studies in mediaeval literature.

He summarizes objectively, with no interpretation to suit his beliefs, but gives criticism which shows the weaknesses of their individual thought.At the end, he gives an overview of the existential philosophy. The tension between consciousness and Being, a mystery which cannot be defined, yet is the reality of humankind, is the preoccupation of these philosophers, as philosophy's attempt to rationalize the universe, eradicating being, has tottered and now crumbled.In brief, this is a helpful guide to works that can be cryptic or impenetrable. Recommended to any who want the tenets of existentialism elucidated."},{"Title":"Six Existentialist Thinkers","review":"Even if you are a neophyte in philosophy (as I am ) I think you will find this book extremely interesting.

If that is your interest in this book you will be fooled as I was. There is relatively little specific material about the species. However, Mr Mathewson has done a nice job of informing the reader about hunting waterfowl on the northwest coast. He talks of the various birds as well as the tools used to pursue them in that region. His ability to inform the reader at the same he reports a story from his past is enjoyable to say the least. The pencil sketches of Mr. Hagerbaumer add to these stories. For me, I was sad when I finished the book, which is an indication of my appreciation of it."},{"Title":"Big December Canvasbacks, Revised","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The binder and section dividers feature lovely photographs and I thought the format was promising. The problem, however is in the contents. The author's style is clumsily self-conscious and she doesn't have an original idea.(In all fairness, there is not much new on the Law of Attraction. The trick is in a fresh presentation.) The book is packed with quotations of other people's works and song lyrics. Apparently, the author once ordered one book and another, a book of inspirational quotations, came instead She found this book wonderfully inspirational and each chapter features not just one or two quotes, but sometimes pages of them. Sorry, if I wanted to read Conversations with God I, II and III, The Nature of Personal Reality or any of the others she relies on, I would not have been reading her book. This over reliance on quotes is disruptive and contributes to the careful, term paperish effect.This book quickly loses focus, jumping wildly from a clunky law of attraction formula to a recitation of the author's traumatic and abusive childhood and journey through different recovery modalities. While I credit her for addressing these challenges, it reads like a bad episode of Dr. Phil. It is somewhat troubling that she disparages the classic twelve step method as it does not fit within the precepts of her message.The author refers to her higher self as \\"Angel\\". If you subscribe to the traditional definition of angels as being messengers of God, you will find his usage jarring.If you are interested in the law of Attraction, there are many fine books that present it in an accessible manner. You can't go wrong with the classic Dynamic Laws of Prosperity by Catherine Ponder. The Abraham -Hicks materials provide a contemporary look at the law of attraction as do the Attractor Factor by Joe Vitale and Lynne Grabhorn's Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting. Michale Losier's Law of Attraction workbook is simple but effective while The Sedona Method and Larry Crane's Abundance Course are superb tutorials on releasing. If you opt for this offering you will receive a really neat binder and a headache."},{"Title":"Life : A Complete Operating Manual : The Secret to Life Unveiled : Who You Really Are, How Life Really Operates, and How to Unleash the Incredible Power Within!","review":"Lauren Tratar's book &quot;Life&quot;, A Complete Operating Manual is absolutely terrific!!!

Aikman and later by R. Chetwynd-Hayes, no mean supernatural authors themselves. Some of the paperbacks in this series, which winds its way up to the \\"20th Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories\\" are now collectors' items and worth over a hundred dollars apiece.For this first book in the series, Robert Aickman selected eleven supernatural tales, including his own \\"The Trains.\\" He also writes an introduction in which he states, \\"There are only about thirty or forty first-class ghost stories in the whole of western literature.\\"That's a challenge indeed, since this complete series contains well over 200 ghost stories!These are the stories in the Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories:\\"The Travelling Grave\\" by L.P. Hartley--This is definitely one of Aickman's 'first-class ghost stories' and it is funny in the full meaning of the phrase 'hysterically funny.' A man is invited to spend a week-end in the country, arrives late and discovers that his host and the rest of the guests are playing a game of hide-and-seek.\\"The Ghost Ship\\" by Richard Middleton--This story is also humorous, but it lacks the hysterical edge of \\"The Travelling Grave.\\" A ghostly galleon runs aground in the middle of a turnip field during a violent wind storm. Unfortunately for the peace of a nearby village, the captain and his ghostly crew are very fond of rum.\\"Squire Toby's Will\\" by J. Sheridan Le Fanu--The roistering, hard-living Squire Toby dies, leaving his two sons at each other's throats through the provisions of his will. The younger son inherits, then discovers another will leaving the property to his older brother. While he dithers about what to do with it, the older brother dies. Two mourners enter the mansion but are never seen to leave.\\"The Voice in the Night\\" by William Hope Hodgson--A ship becalmed in the Northern Pacific gets a strange visitor. The last line of this story is particularly horrible: \\"Then the oars were dipped, the boat shot out of the patch of light, and the--the thing went nodding into the mist.\\"\\"Three Miles Up\\" by Elizabeth Jane Howard--The English Canal System has some strange stories told about it, and this is one of the strangest and scariest. Never pick up strangers who want to hitch a ride on your boat, even if she's willing to cook and do the laundry.\\"The Rocking-Horse Winner\\" by D.H. Lawrence--In order to help pay off his parents' debts, a little boy gets racing tips while riding his rocking horse.\\"The Wendigo\\" by Algernon Blackwood-- This author was a pantheist and a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, eventually branching out into Buddhism and Rosicrucianism, and his stories reveal a deep, mystical appreciation of Nature, with a capital 'N.' He spent many summers in the backwoods of Canada and \\"The Wendigo\\" is probably the most eerie creation of this idyllic period of his life.\\"The Crown Derby Plate\\" by Marjorie Bowen--Martha Pym is missing one plate from her antique Crown Derby collection. She would do almost anything to complete her set, but when the plate finally falls into her hands, she immediately gives it away. So would you, considering the source.\\"The Trains\\" by Robert Aickman--Two lost hikers on the moors are forced to seek shelter from a rainstorm in a mansion built right over the top of a railroad. MiMi and Margaret learn quite a bit about trains from their host whose grandfather built both the house and the railroad beneath it. A woman seems to be hiding from them in the upper reaches of the house.\\"The Old Nurse's Story\\" by Mrs. Gaskell--Here's an old classic that all ghost story connoisseurs must read at least once. A young orphan and her loving nursemaid must go to live with a distant great-aunt in Northumberland. The five-year-old soon wins over her new relative and the staff of the once-grand mansion, but who is the little girl who keeps begging her to come out and play in the storm?\\"Seaton's Aunt\\" by Walter de la Mare--A rather unlikeable schoolboy has a repulsive aunt who seems to despise him. This is one of those moody stories where I'm never sure whether ghosts or paranoia got the upper hand."},{"Title":"HRISANTHI&apos;S LEGACY","review":"Seamlessly constructed,Hrisanthi's Legacy is a humdinger of a good read from page one. It's a multilayered history of three generations of strong, resourceful, often courageous women. Their family journey begins in Greece, pauses for a while in South America, and settles in the rough and tumble town of Butte, Montana, before they finally discover the golden vistas of an early Los Angeles in the days when its luster was untarnished. The author is a masterful story-teller who balances understandably emotional remembrances with a tightly written style. Her own story details a lively career as a trailblazer in health care public relations. That highly successful career had its origins in a girlhood complaint the author made to her mother, saying she wanted nothing more than to escape the limitations of her surroundings in Butte. True to her practical heritage,the mother pointed her daughter to the only way out -- education. Such was the inventive nature that sustained the family during hard times. Such too are the quick-witted women who populate the book and who will delight readers with their strength under pressure.\`"},{"Title":"HRISANTHI&apos;S LEGACY","review":"From the Old World to the New, this Greek family lives through good times and bad, guided by the courageous spirit of Grandmother Hrisanthi. Living as a child in rough, frontier-like Butte, Montana, in what was considered the wrong side of the tracks, the author finds fun and adventure in her rich family life. After finishing college, Pappas moves first to Washington D.C., then Los Angeles, where she begins a distingushed career in hospital public relations. We see L.A. in all its smog-free freshness and gaze through star-struck eyes at old-fashioned Hollywood glamour. Joining her in L.A., Pappas's family combines their beloved Greek traditions with all the cultural advantages of a burgeoning city. A trip to Greece fifty years after her grandmother left melts the years for Pappas and renews firm family bonds with the family that never left. The same indominable spirit of Hrisanthi lives on, in Greece and America."},{"Title":"HRISANTHI&apos;S LEGACY","review":"Beginning with her chldhood in Butte, Montana and continuing through her adulthood in Los Angeles, California, Irene credits her Greek heritage and her mother's determination in each adventure and challenge.

But her writing style encompasses the ear of a poet as well.Once started, I couldn't put the book down. It's a fabulous read."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"A must read for anyone who can't quite shake the feeling that we're all being taken for a ride. The prose is excellent, if exotic, and while certain characters aren't developed as much as one might hope, Grand's storytelling abilities are strong and make for a vastly enjoyable read.This book is probably not for everyone. An open mind may be essential. If you're living in New York and suspect you may be working too much, this book will resonate."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"This is an absolutely amazing book, some sort of crazy progeny of Terry Gilliam &amp; Joan Didion. With mesmerizing precision David Grand simultaneously constructs &amp; unravels this fantastical nightmare-futuristic world and yet manages to ground it in reality: in delicate, emotional humanity &amp; true if mind-boggling recent American history. Yes, twisted &amp; grim &amp; haunting, a little angry and perhaps a lot odd, but so refreshingly unique &amp; mostly just pure brilliance."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"...to this particular perversion of humanism.Trapped in a late-capitalist megalopolis, I am in touch with the feelings of alienation and schizophrenia that so many people seem to lament. In anonymity and depersonalization there seems a comfort and security that appeals to the destitute in all of us. Louse gave me an eye into the mind of the pyramid-builder, the servant so spiritually bankrupt that he vests his emotions in the dreams of a despot in order to achieve a sense of belonging, a justification for his fate. The narrative rolls along just past the fingertips of the protagonist's will, fate constantly upsetting his expectations as in a hardboiled-noir. But this is no nostalgia piece, no literary conceit - this is a well-told story, a vision of how a torturer can manipulate the tortured, regardless of the end or environment. Read in one sitting, it captivates in its honest treatment of soul's bleak horizons."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"Louse reads like Don Delillo, James Ellroy, David Foster Wallace and Terry Gilliam all wrote a novel together--and it worked absolutely perfectly, allowing the best parts of each of them to shine. Louse is based loosely on the last days of Howard Hughes, when the man has completely lost himself to his obsession with hygiene and mania for absolute power, locked himself in the penthouse of his own casino and surrounded himself with troops of supposedly absolutely loyal servants. Louse is the most perfect combination of maverick originality, obvious intelligence, and entertaining storytelling in a novel in a long, long time."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"I got taken into this work because the writing is so good, but when I finished the book I wondered what the point of it all was. I get the whole grey-flannel suit metaphor and I was alive when all the news about Howard Hughes's last days made the news so I think I more or less grasped the point of this novel, but it seemed so unambitious and the metaphor for all us working stiffs didn't really take me anywhere very interesting. And, the ending seemed to get pasted on in a hurry as if the author suddenly ran out of interesting things to do with his characters. So, a disappointment overall, but the sentence-by-sentence writing was quite good and I would certainly take a look at this author's later books. After all, I felt the same way about _The Broom of the System_, and look where that led!"},{"Title":"Louse","review":"A strange, Kafkaesque first novel, \\"Louse,\\" portrays the proscribed existence of Herman Q. Louse, indentured valet to the despotic, Howard Hughes-like mogul, Herbert \\"Poppy\\" Blackwell. Louse cannot remember a time before; his world is defined by the drugged, antiseptic, rule-bound confines of Poppy's \\"Resort Town of G.\\"Poppy is a repellent bony pile of flesh in a bed. \\"His skin is like moth-eaten velvet and shimmers like the phosphorescence of a crashed wave. I fear that a slip of the finger will puncture or bruise its cloudy sheen.\\" His sterile bedroom, a self-imposed prison, is sealed against bugs, bacteria and dirt. Louse's duties are rigidly ritualistic.Outside Poppy's room, surveillance cameras monitor behavior, even in the cell-like bedrooms (complete with a spy hole for watching your neighbor). Transgressions, \\"acts of free will\\" trigger fines, for, it appears, the \\"Resort's\\" inhabitants are gambling debtors, confined to work off their casino losses. Whispers of scandal and conspiracy abound; Louse tries to ignore them, fearing at worst a trap, at best, pointless rumormongering, an activity which seems to supply the only recreation and social contact.Organized in short chapters, Louse's bewildered narration is interspersed with official documents defining the \\"Resort's\\" organization and rules. The reader understands no better than Louse what is real. Cracks begin to appear in the stultifying routine. Unexpected deviations startle and confuse. Dragged into the unknown conspiracy, Louse fears a trap, a test. But images of an outside existence begin flashing in his head. \\" \`I must be ready for my pharmaceutical, Ms. Lonesome,' I say with my teeth clenched.\\"The walls of Resort G appear to be crumbling.Darkly humorous, Grand's deadpan, paranoid delivery combined with the officialese of bizarre documents draws the reader into a surrealistic, claustrophobic world."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"Part quasi-science fiction, part social satire, the one thing that can be said about David Grand's \\"Louse\\" is that it pays homage to Orwell's \\"1984\\" in its description of a hermetically sealed corporate world, ostensibly a gambling casino. The workers, who have been brainwashed to forget their past lives, must closely obey certain arbitrary rules, or get punished, or even tortured. The main character, Louse (sort of like the butler played by Anthony Hopkins in \\"Remains of the Day\\"), who occasionally has glimpses of his former life, serves as a cog in a corporate nightmare as the head honcho's right hand man and narcotic administer. He can hardly comprehend the world he has become a part of, nor does he try very hard to. At one point, a conspiracy brews, but neither Louse nor the reader can figure out who exactly is behind it, nor whether it actually succeeds.As an Orwellian version of corporate America, \\"Louse\\" is only partially successful. Although the book was a fairly intense read, it doesn't hold a candle to the much better \\"1984,\\" and, frankly, I was relieved when I finished. Still, I would like to see what David Grand writes next; he obviously has a talent for presenting ideas in an unusual manner."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"This book doesn't describe alienation - it is alienation. Fromcharacters who become familiar and yet are still nondescript to a plotthat unfolds but doesn't involve, reading Louse is like watching life go by from your window. If you want to read a better book in a similar vein, read The Physiognomy by Jeffrey Ford, which manages to both draw compelling characters and make a wide ranging commentary on modern life."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"Finally there is a book with vision, a book that stands out among the barrage of new writers that continue to sound alike, look alike. It is like a modern combination of Gogol and Kafka,and yet it is entirely new. The story is eerily funny, and the view as a whole is intelligent, brilliant. Grand is an author to watch, as he will become one of this genertions major writers."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"A novel dense with precise language, dark comedy, chilling atmosphere, and brimming with ideas, Louse dares create the world where the individual is sacrificed for the good of the coporation, where identity is the currency for survival. Not necessarily original themes, but Grand's unique and twisted handling of them makes Louse as addictive a novel I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"Some books are earthshattering. Some change people's lives. And some are just ink on paper, not actually formulating into an engaging story. &quot;Louse,&quot; unfortunately, is one of the third kinds of books. Failing to evoke anything at all, it ends up being as sterile and dull as the penthouse.Herbert Horatio Blackwell is a reclusive, eccentric mogul who hides away from the world (and germs) in a carefully sterilized penthouse atop a casino. He employs and controls compulsive gamblers, who pay off their debts by sacrificing their long-term memories and becoming his devoted slaves. One of these is his manservant Herman Louse.In the detached little community of G, Louse encounters a subversive element. This is a problem, since he has been brainwashed into subservience. But as he tries to ignore the conspiracy brewing around him, he inadvertantly gets drawn into it.&quot;Louse&quot; does pretty well in concept, with its bizarre otherworldly setting, strange characters and robotic civilization. It's hard to tell if this surreal setting is even in our world. And the concept of a &quot;king&quot; who controls people is always a winner, especially if there's a twist. In concept, at least, David Grand cannot be faulted.The problem with &quot;Louse&quot;? Unlike Kafka, it fails to evoke any emotional response at all. Kafka could evoke horror, misery and despair. Grand can't do that. It's arguable that this is deliberate, a reflection of the sterile life that Louse and the others are leading, but there's no emotion in scenes like Louse's flashbacks, or near the end. Everything is painfully clinical and detached, even when some kind of vividity is called for.The dialogue is almost as bad. The characters tend to exchange short, random sentences that sound like Hemingway on acid. The descriptions are uneven and minimal, and most of the supporting characters have only a few words to describe them physically or mentally. This is not so bad, because virtually all of them speak and seem to think alike.Blackwell is hard to take seriously, since he's so obviously a copy of Howard Hughes (the lives of his parents, his movies, planes, and phobia about bacteria). Louse isn't a particularly engaging narrator -- one of the problems with a narrator who feels nothing is that the reader then feels nothing. Supporting characters are similarly two-dimensional.&quot;Louse&quot; has an unengaging title and an unexciting storyline. Not recommended for those who like even a spark of inspiration in their book reading."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"In Louse, Grand brilliantly and hilariously illuminates the interstitial moments of one's worst anxiety dreams and magnifies their existence in mind altering complexity. The narrative is pristine and subtle in its execution, the details and images, bizarre, and the overall effect, vertiginous."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"Louse suffers from an all-pervasive and sometimes overwhelming attention to surface. Unfortunately, beneath the gleaming, perfect surface the book presents, is a rather dull, contrived and merely half-conceived story. The author is facile, there is no doubt of that. His facility, however (with form, with phraseology, with tonality), does not overcome the relative clumsiness of the actual story.Designed more to seduce than to deliver, this book left me bored and empty. All those pages, all those words; nothing said."},{"Title":"Louse","review":"The town of G? Poppy? POPPY? Blackwell?

The protagonist is pretty but insecure and the hero is handsome, charming but not entirely trustworthy. This is not Howatch's best but is readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Waiting Sands","review":"I liked the main character, but as a gothic romance tale, this was very predictable. I could tell who the killer was pretty much from the beginning and how it was all going to turn out. Or perhaps I've just read too many gothic romances, as this is one of my favorite categories of books. However, I think a writer can remain in a genre and still come up with a unique, surprise ending as well as an entertaining book.All in all, this was a fast read and an interesting book."},{"Title":"The Waiting Sands","review":"I think and hope that this is one of Ms. Howatch's earliest books.

It covers almost every area of Islam and would be very enjoyable to Muslims, new Muslims and non-Muslims, who are curious and want to learn. I found it to be straight forward, uplifting and positive. It places a wonderful light on Islam; it's teachings, principles, and morals. Quotes are taken directly from the Quran to show it's points. I would definitely recommend it! As a Muslim it reminds me of why I am a Muslim and why I believe, and it has strengthened my beliefs.

Fiction)","review":"Hemingway alluded to this book in his masterpiece &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, claiming that &quot;The Purple Land&quot; is dangerous reading if read too late in life. By this he meant that it entices the reader to want to go to South America, particularly to Uruguay. I found this to be true upon concluding this book myself. The reader vicariously lives through an adventurous, young Englishman, Richard Lamb, in his journeys in Argentina and Uruguay. Discover how he meets his loving wife, his mistresses, and the rebellious banditos who attempt to overthrow the opressive Uruguayan government. Slow at times, nail-biting at others, but the story is not too long. Just right.

I had never heard nor read anything about this Hudson fellow until I recently began to read &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, which, as you may know, is Ernest Hemingway's first novel. Hemingway nonchalantly mentions Hudson and the travels of Lamb briefly in his story. I was intrigued as I gathered Hemingway himself had read the book and apparently liked it well enough to mention. Or perhaps I am mistaken. Regardless, this book is really as series of tales of adventures in the jungles of South America. You meet the natives, the food, the lifestyle and the beautiful girls (as you might expect; latino woman are notably lovely, in my experience). It should be noted, however, that the author, being a product of his times no doubt, is not particularly sensitive to political correctness."},{"Title":"The purple land: Being the narrative of one Richard Lamb's adventures in the Banda Oriental in South America as told by himself, (Everyman's library.
