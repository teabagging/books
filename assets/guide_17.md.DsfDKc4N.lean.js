After reading the book I really regret having purchased it. Most of the remarks in it are negative and not particularly interesting. There was a lot about his personal animosity towards various individuals, but very little about politics or any other kind of useful insight. There was also a complete lack of self analysis and not a lot of humor. Oh well. I would not reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I watched Tucker give a preview of his book on C-Span at the Miami Book Fair and couldn't wait to order the book. It was great from page 1 but when I got to page 142 I just couldn't believe what I was reading. Mr. Carlson is totally believable so I have no doubt this is an accurate account.I hope he writes a book like this every year as he does have a knack for interacting with some real &quot;characters&quot; in and around the world of politics and the media."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Few people can write about politics and make it entertaining. Tucker Carlson absolutely has this gift. Liberals, conservatives, and non-politicos equally will enjoy hearing stories about the drunked James Traficiant, Bill Press eating a whole pound of fudge, James Carville revealing his sexual fantasies to the entire Crossfire audiecne, and so much more. My girlfriend who doesn't follow politics at all was dying to read this before I even finished. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"As a Democrat who watches Crossfire from work daily, I have grown to like Tucker for his spontaneous wit and analysis ... even if I disagree. There was a lot of clever insight and stories. I'd be inclined to give it more stars, but it was somewhat short."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker reveals some shocking insider tidbits sure to blow you away. Among them, is an unnamed Souther Senator who candidly confided in Tucker at a Washington dinner of how he was sleeping with his hot new intern from Texas. Later it was revealed that the Senator had been impotent for years due to prostate surgery. Tucker's candor, wit, and bowtie make for quite a read. The part where he chronicles his dalliance with Margaret Carlson and an unnamed Crossfire co-host and their affinity for roleplaying with nothing but bowties on was somewhat appalling, but nonetheless, it makes for an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"As a young man, Tucker's quick rise at CNN is praiseworthy and this behind the scenes look at his media experiences is fascinating. He had me laughing out loud at many of his stories, especially his description of interviewing the Rev. Jesse Jackson. You won't be disappointed with Tuckor's wit and candor. I highly recommend this book and look forward to Tucker's future work."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I'm not a TV or celebrity junkie, but I have often wondered about the personal characteristics of many public figures. This book lays them out. Flat. And with style, grace, and humor. Carlson has the obligatory section on Monica Lewinsky, for example, but he focuses on her California doctor instead of what we have been told by the media, ad nauseum. And what a doctor! Then there are portraits of others, from Senator McCain to Bill Press, all surely accurate (Carlson is, after all, a journalist) and vastly entertaining. His great gift, however, is to paint a brilliant picture of a personality without being snide or vicious. He even portrays himself. In fact, the scene of Carlson edging over the fat sleeping Moroccan gent to try to get back to his cramped airline seat - and landing on the screaming guy's lap... I'm laughing out loud again as I write this. That scene alone is worth the modest price of this book. It is a 5 star read, perfect for a Christmas gift. I only wish it was longer -- and no, you can't borrow mine."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Carlson is a waste of space, and his writing is a waste of trees. If you delight in ignorance and misinformation, he's your man."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I always knew that Tucker Carlson's dad was a major player in the right wing media/think tank world. So it's easy to see how Tucky's connections helped him. He's such a cutie! I'd love to pinch his ice cream cheeks! (I wonder if Arianna did!) And I'll bet he wouldn't have a comeback to *that*! What I *did not* know, is that Tucker comes from authorial royalty, if you will. His parents penned the classic: Don't Sweat the Small Stuff in Love: by Richard Carlson and Kristine Carlson. Obviously, Tucker hasn't fallen too far from the tree, as he doesn't sweat the small stuff in politics! The beauty of Tucky is that he doesn't question the status quo, or any quo at all. He knows that politics is for fun and profit, to be joked about in the DC/media echo chamber. And now we get a front row seat! Luckily, Tucky lets us in on the fun (not the big joke, that we don't get paid for *our* relative nonsense), that policy - or the personalities and sound bites that &quot;front&quot; real policy - shouldn't be taken seriously. Don't sweat the small stuff! In other words, if you've got enough bread, enjoy the circus! &quot;My Adventures&quot; is non-threatening, fluffy, and self-preserving, as cotton candy (light blue or pink, whatever!)! Tucky stays true to the current political era, where the son rides pop's coattails, but isn't so darn serious! Kudos!"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker Carlson has always been one of my favorite conservative television personalities and this rookie effort does not disappoint. He is witty, thoughtful, and on the money every time. This book is less about his political views than it is a personal memoir of his experiences at CNN, and it makes for a fascinating behind the scenes read. Don't worry however, Tucker's views come through loud and clear, although not in the \\"Liberal-bashing\\" fashion that is so en vogue among his counterparts Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. One could only wish that this offering was longer, or that a second book is in the works!"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker Carlson, the witty, politically conservative co-host of Crossfire, has been one of those few on the right who actually seem less dogmatic than practical. Like P.J. O'Rourke, Carlson has a sense of humor, and this book serves not as yet another diatribe against &quot;the liberals&quot; who seem to be running things (The &quot;liberal media&quot; myth is a popular one, nevermind that almost all news operations are beginning to lean rightwards to counter those charges, and the most popular cable news outlet is Fox, full of rabid disgusting neanderthals).The book is a nice trip through Carlson's career in a non-chronological way. You read about his many experiences as a journalist and public figure, his own brush with rape accusations, and his many tales of &quot;only in Washington&quot; shenanigans on both sides of the aisle. Carlson comes across as far more tolerant of his opposite number on the left, and even goes so far as to call James Carville one of his &quot;favorite people&quot;.All in all, this is NOT a book for the Ann Coulter/Rush Limbaugh set. This is a fun read, and while I disagree with him politically, I don't feel like a hypocrite when I say he is a born storyteller. Liberals and jerks, erm, Conservatives alike, will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Even though some things he says may be \\"obvious\\" I don't think they were that obvious because people haven't said them and not everyone experiences the TV world from the inside. I learned a lot and won't so easily make mistakes or misunderstandings that he did after reading this book. If you're in the TV field, this book probably would bore you more. But if you aren't in the TV field or like Carlson, this may be an interesting read.A few times, he goes a bit off-topic. An example that sticks out is when he talks about his biggest fan, but then talks about his friend Bill after the other story. His short story about Bill really should have been another chapter rather than stuck in with the chapter \\"Your Biggest Fan!\\"He promotes or kinda promotes cigarette smoking which I don't like. Though, he smokes himself, so he might be a bit of a hypocrite if he were not to support smoking.He also has a \\"thing\\" with Canada that he carries around even after the book, but I feel that he is doing that to keep interest and not necessarily because he really likes or hates Canada per se.It's interesting how people say they think he's liberal, but he consider himself more conservative. I do tend to see him as a moderate like at least one other reviewer on here. I'm surprised that he hasn't mentioned any of the PBS showings he'd been on too. I think I saw him on PBS before he was on Crossfire. I'd never seen Crossfire, but I'd definitely heard about it.Carlson should've tried making his own Crossfire mugs and using them and selling them himself if possible. That would really bring the irony out of CNN not giving him a mug with his show name on it."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker Carlsons genuine, affable nature comes to roost in this short, easy to read book. He tells a few funny stories & gives an inside peek into the cable news industry. For the price & time it takes to read, you can't go wrong"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker doesn't waste time into pulling his reader right into the heart of the tumultuous world of cable news, from the ill-fated Spin Room to his seat on the CNN flagship Crossfire. Anyone who watches Crossfire knows Tucker to be the most informed, and without a doubt most reasonable &quot;conservative&quot; voice on television, and his first book doesn't disappoint.That said, the book is no policy wonk manifesto, as it is concerned mainly with his experiences, anecdotes and cocktail party stories of his (brief) career to date. Each are well chosen, and he uses them to amplify the handful of maxims he has gleamed from his time in the business.If your looking for a fun and light read on the characters in our nation's capital, Tucker will be glad to serve as your personal guide!!!"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Although I am a very ardent liberal, I both enjoy and respect Tucker Carlson. He has principles, which is always nice to see in the opposition. That his writing is so damn entertaining only adds to this favorable perception.The book is a very light read, and I enjoyed every page of it. If you've ever seen him on TV and been entertained, he maintains that level in the book. If you weren't impressed with one of his appearances, try the book anyway. It's very entertaining, and not written with any overt political motive."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"This is a fun read, perfect for a four-hour airline flight. Don't worry too much about being offended (or even engaged) by the author's political views. There is no depth, mostly just a montage of reasonably good anecdotes. It reads about like this: This guy I knew was a real pistol. Speaking of pistols, I knew another guy who was against gun control. Speaking of control, there was this other guy with a bladder problem. You know the Latin word for bladder is...He lingers a bit on Sen. John McCain and what it's like to be a semi-famous TV personality. An interesting bit of promotional backspin: Carlson mentions a deranged fan by name and gives the URL for her Web site. I plugged the address into my browser (little expecting said deranged fan to still be there) and was taken to an Amazon ad for, of all things, Al Franken's latest book. Hmmmmm."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Perhaps I am in the minority on this one but much to my surprise I really did not enjoy this one very much at all. Quite possibly I am missing something or maybe the humor just went right over my head but for the most part I found \\"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News\\" to be neither informative nor very humorous. In fact, I thought it was rather juvenile. I was really quite surprised because I have enjoyed much of Tucker Carlson's work on television and agree with him on quite a few issues. I found his writing in this book to be rambling and at times quite tedious. The book contains very little of a substantive nature. Although I get sucked in every once in a while I find books like this to be largely a waste of my time. It kind of reminds me what cable news has evolved into over the past several years. Continuing coverage of people discussed in this book like Monica Lewinsky, Jerry Falwell, James Traficant and Dick Morris, to name just a few, contribute little to an intellgent discussion of important national issues. Maybe if you are just looking for a chuckle this book will fill the bill. Otherwise, I would recommend that you pass on \\"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News\\" There are so many better ways so spend your time!"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Carlson is not only witty and entertaining in describing his experiences with contemporary politicians and pundits, he almost always (and, often, surprisingly) names names. I suspect his candor may come back to haunt him at some point in his career, but a large part of his appeal is that he genuinely doesn't seem to care. He strikes me as a &quot;let the chips fall where they may&quot; kind of person and one who is sometimes bewildered by the oddities of the well-known characters he encounters. (He offers plausible theories for some of the more outrageous patterns of behavior that he's observed.) Regardless of your political views, I predict you will like this book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"If you are a political aficionado, regardless of your partisanship, you owe it to yourself to pick this book up. Yeah, you learn intriguing insider tidbits and some sleaze on politicians, pundits, and the like, but that's just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. For instance, Tucker reveals how his \\"biggest fan\\" claimed that he violated her in a restaurant in plain view of others, and in a bloody manner to boot, only to send him an email a month after the supposed incident proclaiming, \\"You're great.\\"From a deranged psychiatrist who went coastal on Tucker claiming he was crazy to his hilarious fan feedback that he sent back to demented fans to the ingenious letter that he composed to bail out his college roommate from an econ midterm, you'll laugh out loud almost incessantly. Tucker tells of his drunk radio interview from the infamous Dick Morris suite and of the other Tucker Carlson and how he was mistaken before a speech as this individual(hilarious). His tells of hi interviews with an admittedly drunk Jim Traficant who, by the way, groped the CNN makeup girl.A few months later, after he was facing 60 years in prison and $2 Million in fines for rackateering, extortion, and bribery, Traficant came on again, this time safely by remote, pleading, \\"Tell the girls at CNN that if I get convicted, I'm going to be looking for conjugal visits.\\" Good stuff."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I am a conservative and I just didnt like this book very much. The best part was the dirt on James Carvile, that was funny. Over all this was just a boring book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"In Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News the author provides a pleasurable read even if imparting little in the way of political wisdom.Carlson's narration spares few details and one has the feeling that his publishers were pleasantly surprised with the richness of his account. His onscreen adventures began, improbably enough, with the OJ trial in 1995. It seems that the offices of The Weekly Standard were called by Dan Rather's booker in the hopes of finding a reporter to provide a conservative take on the trial, and Carlson, as he was the first one back from lunch, accepted the invitation.A few years and many appearances later, our author was transformed from a chain-smoking journo to a smoke-free, media celebrity. He even got falsely accused of rape by a stalker fan (which says all one needs to know about his renown). Carlson briefly had his own show with Bill Press called Spin Room and currently he is one of the hosts on Crossfire.Before relaying more specifics about the book, let me state, as a disclaimer, that I am personally not a fan of this author. Previously, I've always anticipated his views on politics with the same interest that I have in glasses of room temperature skim milk.Carlson himself cites the concerns that Congressman Tom Delay had about his representing the conservative side before the nation. He believed Carlson \\"too liberal to represent the Right on the air.\\" Frankly, I agreed with the Congressman before reading a page of the memoir and, after finishing it, I still agree with him. CNN needs guys like Carlson to be rightists in name, as the rest of us would not let Bill Press or Paul Begala dominate us with their informercials.The author has warm affection for the likes of James Carville and Bill Press. He also seems to lament Senator McCain's loss to President Bush in the 2000 Republican primary, which is rather disturbing as McCain's goal, in regards to the Republican Party, was that we should \\"burn it down.\\"It may well be worth buying the book just to read about the catty way in which Carlson deals with Barney Frank after the Congressman berated a producer who tried to adjust his blazer (the horror!): \\"I made a mental note to devote the rest of my life to subverting Frank's career.\\" He does a noble job.This is by no means a philosophical work, but it was a great deal of fun to read. As many liberal comedians have painfully illustrated in the past, you do not have to be on the exact same ideological page as your audience in order to entertain. Tucker Carlson was on a mission to lightly and gleefully depict some of the strange politicians, partisans, and parasites that he has known on from cable news and he has succeeded admirably. Now if he could just lose that bowtie. Anyway, if you're short a present or two, you might consider his memoir for just about anyone who likes to laugh."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I so wanted to like this book (I listened to it on tape). Mr Carlson is a good thinker and for the most part fair in his assessments. Listening to him on tape was great for my beltway commute. However my biggest disappointments were the use of so much profanity (I think it is more pronounced when you hear it vice reading it) and the way he would seemed to need to counterbalance any criticism of Republicans with even more criticism of Democrats with similar issues. For example he mentions the Trent Lott debacle. He makes it seems however that Mr. Lott's downfall was because of partisan politics and (if my memory is correct ) doesn't mention at all the part the Republicans (the President included) and the conservative media played in Mr Lott losing his job. On the other hand he goes to great lengths to dredge up information on Sen Byrd and his affiliation with the Klan and his remarks about not wanting to serve with &quot;Negroes&quot;.All in all I am a fan of Mr Carlson and enjoyed the book. Wished he had spent a little more time talking about his time in cable news and not going off on little rehashing of history that had little to do with his experiences and more to do with filling some pages in his book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I wanted to like Tucker Carlson's book. He has the opportunity to show the interesting side of politics. The truth is, the writing is horrible. I wouldn't waste the money on this book new. I'm sure there will be plenty of used available soon."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker Carlson is the perennially smug right-wing conservative with the affected bow tie on CNN's soon-to-be-canceled afternoon political soap opera \\"Crossfire.\\" If this anorexic volume is any indication of his writing ability, his career as a print journalist isn't much healthier.This is what they call in publishing a \\"McBook,\\" the kind of thing that TV sitcom stars churn out in a week and serve to a credulous public to make a quick buck. \\"Journalism is really pretty easy,\\" Carlson writes at one point. Which is arguably true, assuming of course that you're a complete hack.Not that this book is total garbage: it's not. But it's so thin and insubstantial, sounding at times like something Carlson cranked out at his desk during his lunch hour, that unless you're eager to waste your money buying a book that's sure to be remaindered faster than you can say, \\"Where Are The Weapons of Mass Destruction?\\" it's not worth your time.There are, however, some good things in it. I particularly liked Carlson's breathless encomium to British journalists: \\"I've run into a lot of them while covering stories, and generally they're impressive: witty, well-educated, and physically brave. They're also frequently drunk. As a rule, a British reporter will begin boozing at the first opportunity, and won't stop until he passes out or you run out of money.\\" This is, as Gore Vidal would say, splendid stuff. And the story of how Carlson was falsely accused of rape by a self-proclaimed mentally ill fan, a false charge that ended up costing Carlson $14,000 in legal fees, is pretty amusing (although I'm sure it wasn't for Carlson, who does everything but print the woman's home phone number).Carlson takes some engagingly heterodox positions, including taking on Fox News self-absorbed blowhard Bill O'Reilly for being a self-absorbed blowhard who has started to believe his own publicity. His account of how O'Reilly boasted of his faux-credentials as a war correspondent at a discussion panel in Washington on \\"The Press in Wartime\\" in front of many of the real thing, which, as Carlson points out, is \\"a little like bragging about your National Guard experience to a room full of Navy SEALs,\\" is surprisingly honest coming from an avowed conservative. It's nice to know that Carlson can occasionally espouse positions that are somewhat more intelligent than the ones he spews on cable television.But it's not enough for me to recommend \\"Politicians, Partisans and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News,\\" which is a puny little book that tries to capitalize in a cynical way on its author's rapidly shrinking fifteen minutes of fame. Unless you're the kind of person who buys every single book on politics that comes down the Beltway, give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"If someone gives you this book for free, politely accept it and use it for kindling. If no one offers you this book for free, don't waste your money. The author fails to engage anyone but himself and fails to recognize the irony of his own book's title."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"It is amazing that Carlson, who makes a living of spouting untruths and playing the show-biz game like Limbaugh, would criticize others for behaviors that make him popular himself. If you want pure fiction, there are better alternatives. If you want &quot;fake&quot; news, tune into the Daily Show."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I was only passingly familiar with Tucker Carlson before cracking the binding of his book, POLITICIANS, PARTISANS, AND PARASITES. I vaguely recalled a few articles he had done for The Weekly Standard and The American Spectator, and I knew that he was on CNN's Crossfire. The problem is that at casa de Hartlaub we don't really tune in to CNN all that much, and as for Crossfire ... if I started watching James Carville with any regularity it would be the mark of a behavior deviation so devastating that my family would probably ship me off for that long promised 30-day psychological evaluation. While Crossfire appears to be on its last legs, Carlson's career trajectory is only beginning, if POLITICIANS, PARTISANS, AND PARASITES is any indication.For one thing, Carlson is really funny. His written delivery is very conversational. Reading POLITICIANS, PARTISANS, AND PARASITES is like having this hip, smart, observant guy over for dinner and being happy to let him monopolize the conversation for the entire evening. Carlson is right to center right politically, but he doesn't beat you over the head with it. He chooses his battles wisely and almost always wins them. But POLITICIANS, PARTISANS, AND PARASITES isn't a regurgitation of Carlson's views. It's a breezy, entertaining account of Carlson's experiences in television journalism and reporting.Carlson's accounts of his adventures in the trenches of television news journalism are not presented in an orderly fashion. It's not quite stream of consciousness but the link between one topic and another can be a bit tenuous. You're not really going to care, however. Carlson is so entertaining and funny that you'll be more than happy to sit back and let him drive at 100 words per minute while he maintains a nonstop monologue concerning what is flying by. His most entertaining accounts concern being on the campaign trail with John McCain, his trip to Vietnam (again, with John McCain), the crashing and burning of his first television program, The Spin Room, and his dead-on descriptions of Carville.But Carlson's literary audience will not be limited to conservatives. Liberals who have not lost their sense of humor will find plenty to enjoy in Carlson's accounts as well. Carlson pins Jerry Falwell and Larry Klayman to the wall with his laser-like scrutiny and does it so well that even if you like those gentlemen you won't mind. Well, you will, but you'll be too busy laughing to let it bother you for long.POLITICIANS, PARTISANS AND PARASITES is a series of dead-on critiques and observations of current events, television news, and the people and personalities behind both. Its substance more than makes up for what it lacks in organization. This is Carlson's first book, but it hopefully will not be his last. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"A short, quick read, Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites is Tucker Carlson's account of his television career. It is mostly a personal, autobiographical account of his own experiences, rather than an analytical treatment of the business--although he does draw some general conclusions about the field. The book deals more with personalities than with issues.Carlson begins with his largely accidental beginnings in TV--from his first brief appearance during the O.J. Simpson trial (a gig he landed somewhat randomly, by returning early from lunch to the Weekly Standard office) to the phone call during the 2000 election asking him, on the fly, to host a new show on CNN, The Spin Room. Throughout its life, that show always retained a thrown-together quality to it, with Carlson and Press often relying on gifts to furnish the set. They never did get custom coffee mugs, and Carlson's final attempt intersected with the end of the show--the promotional department knew of the show's end before Carlson and would not give him the mugs. From there, Carlson migrated to Crossfire, CNN's one-time premier political show, and watched as it, too, fell, unable to compete with Fox's primetime lineup.Carlson despises partisans, whom he differentiates from ideologues. The distinction is rooted in partisans' blind adherence to the party line, but I'm not convinced that the distinction is an apt one. He likes people who speak their minds and go out on limbs, who aren't afraid to be outrageous. Jesse Jackson is a phony, whose phoniness is enhanced by TV. Al Sharpton, Carlson suggests, can think for himself, even if he is wrong. Jim Traficant added color when he showed up for an interview drunk and accosted the show's female floor director. John McCain--whose 2000 presidential campaign Carlson reported and covers extensively in the book--is praised for his never-mind-the-consequences approach to politics, but even the admiring Carlson admits that McCain played to the media. Bill Press, former co-host of The Spin Zone, comes off as a decent, funny, hardworking guy who loves to eat on the set.In general, Carlson seems to believe that TV shapes its &quot;participants&quot; more than the other way around. Shows certainly are influenced by their hosts, but TV has a way of changing people. It enlarges not only physical traits but also personalities and idiosyncrasies as well: everything seems larger on television. It can give one an inflated opinion of himself. If a host isn't careful, his larger-than-life, seemingly all-knowing, accentuated personality can seep into his private persona (e.g. Bill O'Reilly, as Carlson posits). As a career, TV offers an unstable, fragile one that can disappear in the blink of an eye. Of media bias, Carlson doesn't seem to acknowledge its existence; instead, producers, he says, aren't driven by politics but by polls--the &quot;ideology of the poll.&quot;Carlson says nothing earth shattering, nothing surprising, nothing controversial. He provides little depth on the TV media business or on virtually anything that goes on behind-the-scenes. Nevertheless, written lightheartedly and humorously, the book will surely entertain media and political junkies alike."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I never saw Tucker Carlson on Crossfire, but I wish I had based on this book. Carlson strikes me as a moderate, not really a conservative, and this was one of very few books that delve into politics without an overload of spin. Limbaugh on the right, and Franken on the left, try to make their audiences angry while they entertain. Tucker appears to have no agenda. To some, that might make him seem tame, but to me, it was refreshing. He has many entertaining and enlightening stories to tell, so if you want a break from party warfare, but you are still fascinated by politics, this might be for you."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Tucker Carlson, who co-hosts CNN's Crossfire has written an enlightening and amusing book on his three years at CNN.I have watched Crossfire only rarely, but I happened to hear Tucker speak about his experiences at a televised book conference in Miami, Florida not too long ago.He described, with dry wit and obvious fondness, the colorful characters he interviewed and worked with in the most powerful and weirdest medium there is. I was entranced by his insight and intelligence and immediately ordered his new book, Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites.This book was one of the most entertaining reads I have had in a long time. His intimate portraits of Al Sharpton, John McCain, James Carville, Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, and many others are not to be missed.Tucker has seen television from the inside and describes it without rancor and without pulling any punches. Both in his speech and in the book, he mentioned expecting to be fired at anytime because of his enthusiasm for airing his views.I hope it doesn't happen soon, because we need more TV personalities with his sense of humor. To get the flavor of Tucker's humor, see his interview by Kevin Holtsberry in August of this year.He has written a great book. Read it."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"Since I rarely watch CNN, I dont see Crossfire. But I did manage to catch him sparring with Al Franken on Tim Russert, and was impressed with his handling of Franken. They plugged his book, and I got it the next day. This book gives us, the political junkie, an insight into the personalities of the politicos we love and abhor. Want to know what people like Jesse Jackson,Jim Traficant, and James Carville do behind the news curtain? Carlson also ruminates fairly on the O'Reilly phenomenon as well, so even if youre on the left side of the aisle in politics, you'll hear some scoop on the other side. Anyone interested in the managed personalities of the talking heads we are addicted to listening to should buy this. Try and get it on discount, maybe wait for paperback because its rather expensive, and you'll kill it in 3 days.

Tucker Carlson is our favorite. We love everything about him, his looks,his hair,and of course his cute bow tie. I always new Tucker was smart, now I also know what a good sense of humor he has. This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. If you would like a look at the lighter side of politics,I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. Carlson seems less partisan here than elsewhere. He freely bashes and praises liberals and conservatives alike. Speaking as a Washingtonian, his stories ring true. I would have given it 5 stars, but it was way too short for the price."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I'm an unabashed liberal who picked this book up merely out of curiousity. I got into it both quickly and unexpectedly, Tucker really does go after both sides of the aisle, and does it in a way that is both informative and entertaining. It is very short (I finished it in 3 trips to Borders), but a lot of fun and it holds some real insight into both the state of our political discourse and the innor workings of the political media.An easy 5 stars if not for the length. Props to Tucker for writing a book all political observers can enjoy."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"I had to read this book for my government class and I found it very enjoyable. I had watched Crossfire on CNN with Tucker before I read the book and always thought him to be an amusing guy. This book reads just like how he talks on the show, full of wit and bite. The stories he tells will make you laugh and his love for the game of politics is refreshing in a world of people who think politics is some sort of religion with no funny faults. I would recommend this book for any one looking for a short and funny read with a focus on the absurd of politics and media.PS: His section on the McCain 2000 presedential campaign is brillaint. So if you like McCain it is a must read."},{"Title":"Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News","review":"If you want (a) a learned discussion of major national issues or (b) a grim anti-liberal tirade, this book is not the book for you. But if you want to spend an hour or two reading amusing stories about Carlson's fellow pundits (and the occasional politician), this book is perfect. It is a cute, fun piece of fluff - the modern equivalent of the Hollywood fan magazines of decades past (except of course about the press instead of about actors)."},{"Title":"Foucault's Challenge: Discourse, Knowledge, and Power in Education","review":"The single best source I have found that takes Foucault's challenging ideas and applies them to educational theory (and to some extent, practice). In particular, a meaty opening essay by Popkewitz is clear and insightful, representing Foucault comprehensibly--skillfully applying his insights to important contemporary issues like the construction of &quot;the child&quot;, cumpulsory schooling, conceptualizations of curriculum, and school &quot;reform&quot;. I strongly recommend this for people who had given up on trying to find something coherent from &quot;post-&quot; discourses to apply to educational theory. I have assigned it as a reading in a graduate course on critical theories of education and students have responded well to it."},{"Title":"Foucault's Challenge: Discourse, Knowledge, and Power in Education","review":"As a teacher with strong philosophical opinions that are essentially anti- teacher and anti- school, its important to find a text which sheds more light on where you see yourself inside an educational institution as a practitioner.

What sets this book apart is how it's entertaining anecdotes about famous calligrapher personalities, from ten dynasties and the PRC, help to bring this ancient and beautiful art form to life. As well, the history of calligraphy back to the earliest forms of writing from pictographic characters to the major styles of script still in use today are all touched on. The section on appreciating Chinese calligraphy is short and without illustration, but gets across well the essence. A number of black and white illustrations are presented elsewhere in the book to show styles of writing, calligraphy tools, and methods, among other things. Other interesting sections include Chinese calligraphy in the world today, and Chinese calligraphy and other arts. All in all, an accessible and enjoyable introduction to one of the great art forms of Asia."},{"Title":"Eleanor of Acquitaine and the Four Kings","review":"This bio is more about Henry the Second, than Eleanor. Now granted, there is a significant period of time where Eleanor is locked up in her lonely castle, and according to other biographers, no letters or correspondance remain from that time.

What is mixed? She answers it in a positive way fit for 4 to 8 year old readers. The storey might be sweet, sentimental and syrupy to adults; but so what. Adults need to be reminded of the way things SHOULD be. There is no harm in letting a child know (adults most of all)that there is HOPE.

It provides a good children's story as well as a positive multicultural message. I am bored by books that just say the equivalent of \\"You are special!\\" \\"I love you!\\" with no story behind them. Other reviewers have criticized the book for the larger-than-life language that is used at the end, but I think the words provide more inspiration than everyday words, the same way Martin Luther King and other great speechgivers do.One minor caveat about the book: several of the characters speak in a more colloquial manner (\\"Baby, don't pay her no never mind,\\" \\"She doesn't favor a soul in your family,\\" \\"mama,\\" \\"folks.\\") Since no one in my or my husband's family speaks this way, sometimes it feels stilted rolling off my tongue.The author of the book is a professional actress in Minneapolis, where I used to live, and this was her first children's book, which may explain the dramatic language. Her second book about the character Hope is called \\"Family\\" but isn't nearly as good."},{"Title":"Hope (Picture Books)","review":"Every single child should have this book-- it teaches about different cultures and race in a positive way. The different language and sayings teaches us that we are all different, yet the same. Whether you have a multi-racial child, or just child, why not buy this book and enjoy something different. while possibly celebrating the differnces we have in culture, language, color, etc.One reviewer called the language overly dramatic. I think this just shows how different we are with different backgrounds . Although I have never heard anyone actually speak like this, it doesn't mean someone is less intelligent.Racism is so sublte and rampant in our society...what better way to start an opening than with a story read to a child??"},{"Title":"Hope (Picture Books)","review":"This book is so amazing. I didn't remember what it was about when I was going to read it to my daughter before bed time. Then I started reading it and when I got to the spot were her Aunt is telling her the story I lost it and starting crying. My daughter is bi-racial and it is hard for me to find books that help her understand how special she is and this book does it. I asked my mom to read it to her and she started crying also.

But listening to Lifelines has changed everything for me. Though the series focuses on personal writing for insight and healing, the natural clarity with which Christina illustrates the importance of The Story -- and the excellent exercises that are included in the set -- have made it possible to both capture and learn from my own life's stories AND become a better and more courageous writer all around. I set aside a portion of my morning every day for listening to Lifelines and writing. What a wonderful, wonderful thing she has created here."},{"Title":"Lifelines","review":"\\"Only you can discover exactly why it is that you write. I write to leave evidence that I was here, and to make my life journey as fully conscious as I can.\\" ~Christina BaldwinChristina Baldwin's beautiful voice leads the listener into a writing journey. She tells stories of her own experience with writing a diary and then explores a variety of exciting possibilities. If you are interested in writing a journal, creating a scrapbook or even writing the story of your life, then this is an excellent starting point. Christina Baldwin uncovers the true reasons we write, why we must write and why we love to write. She introduces \\"Flow Writing,\\" \\"Collage Journals,\\" and \\"Day Books.\\" The main topics include:Why Do We Write?A Brief History of WritingThe Types of Writing - online, computer, pen and paperWriting a LifelineWriting our way out of DespairWriting a Love LetterCreating GoalsConversations with your SoulCreating a Writing SanctuaryMaking Time for WritingWriting about RelationshipsHow to Create Journals for GiftsBringing Art into the Writing ProcessStarting a Writing GroupYou may find yourself listening to each CD more than once before moving onto the next CD. The topics are inspiring and there are so many ideas for making writing part of your life.If you especially enjoy any part of the CDs, there is a way to quickly find the area on the CD by marking it on the sheet of topics. There is also a card set with topics from each CD. On card eleven:\\"Consider making special books that hold the best of what you have to say, and giving them as gifts to loved ones.\\"Christina Baldwin is right when she says that writing organizes life. You may also enjoy her book: One to One: Self-Understanding through Journal Writing. She is an author, educator, speaker and retreat leader who specializes in the process of personal writing. Her teaching style is more than inspiring.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Lifelines","review":"For many thousands of years, people have been leaving their marks to tell a story. In the caves of Lascaux, pictographs became the first journal entries. \\"Story is really all we have of ourselves,\\" says Christina Baldwin, the visionary who started (or perhaps we should say restarted) the personal writing movement. Baldwin's own writing story is one that began when she picked out words she knew from the newspaper, something I remember doing myself. Later, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, she buried a metal box of precious objects \\"to save [her] story,\\" including her own journal and The Diary of Anne Frank.Recording Lifelines was an opportunity for Baldwin to define and develop her philosophy of writing and life story, which became a gift of inspiration and affirmation for listeners. If you are about to begin a writing practice, you will receive guidance from a wise teacher. If you are already writing, and even if you have been doing so for a long time, you will be reminded of how important a lifeline writing is. The wonder of a recording is it's as if the speaker is talking directly to you. Another benefit to listening to a CD is being able to hear a writing mentor's voice even while driving in the car. I remember particular stories from Lifelines with a memory of the place where I heard them.When Baldwin published One to One: Self-Understanding through Journal Writing in 1977, the Library of Congress had to create a new category for her pioneering work. It was followed by Life's Companion: Journal Writing as a Spiritual Quest, which the author wrote because she wanted to find her \\"tribe.\\" You will find a review of the latter book on this site, and on www.storycirclebookreviews.org. Calling the Circle: The First and Future Culture describes the way of council where story is part of the decision-making. \\"The circle calls us to remember ourselves as carriers of the story,\\" Baldwin says. This is the methodology she and partner Ann Linnea have shared around the world through their business, PeerSpirit, Inc. Baldwin's fourth book published in 2002, The Seven Whispers: A Spiritual Practice for Times Like These, invites people into exploring their relationship to the Divine. Her most recent book is Storycatcher: Making Sense of Our Lives through the Power and Practice of Story. See my review elsewhere on this site, and on www.storycirclebookreviews.orgAs I describe Baldwin's books, all of which I've read, I recall my story of writing on my own and writing in the circle. We write to organize life, guide ourselves through life's transitions, reveal parts of our unexpressed selves, and to pass stories from generation to generation like a lifeline. But \\"only you can discover exactly why it is that you write,\\" according to Baldwin. \\"I write to leave evidence that I was here, and to make my life journey as fully conscious as I can.\\"Along with the stories and personal experiences the author shares is practical advice and writing exercises. The most inspiring of these are included on thirteen Lifeline cards. One of her suggestions for getting onto the page is a foundational exercise called \\"flow writing.\\" Close your eyes. When you open them, let the first thing you see be your opening word. Write for five minutes. Baldwin admits her own resistance to writing and advises, \\"Writing is a relationship that includes our resistance to it.\\" I was so grateful to hear that. Listing her own ten essentials for her writing relationship, the author prompts listeners to create their own. \\"Look at how you create the time, the space, the environment, the permission that you need. This is likely to be an evolving list as you learn more about what truly supports your writing.\\"As you respond to life events, you begin the \\"Spiral of Experience\\" with a \\"survivor's tale.\\" Questioning and acknowledging consequences leads to \\"the story of integration,\\" taking you deeper into understanding how a particular event fits into the larger story of your life. Finally, through compassion and acceptance, you enter new territory--the \\"story of insight and meaning.\\"Writing is good for your health. It boosts the immune system. It brings you into focus. And writing can help you learn to love your body, waking up the chakras of the body that is your home. As an embodied writer, you can ask yourself, \\"What are the five senses I can put on the page?\\" You can write yourself out of overwhelm and write for social healing as well as for personal healing. Baldwin suggests bringing the world onto the page. Make a collage and write commentary on what is going on in the outside world. It's okay to be opinionated on the page. As you practice on the page, you articulate your life. \\"Personal writing is a private process that serves as the source of significant change in our journey. We proceed from the story into action.\\"\\"Practice certainty of purpose\\", Baldwin advises. \\"Articulate your understanding of the covenant you have made with life. Write it down, read it out loud to yourself, edit and refine it, work with it. Place this message where it will guide you again and again.\\"by Mary Ann Moorefor Story Circle Book Reviewswww.storycirclebookreviewsorgreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"This is my first Aimee Leduc novel, and I am happy to say that it came as a pleasant surprise. On my previous visit to Paris (in 1999), I was startled to see tough paratroopers armed with automatic rifles at the Chatelet-Les Halles metro station patrolling the platforms and corridors. Paris is no longer the city of Maurice Chevalier, or even Georges Simenon: What we have here is a rougher and edgier city with a compact tourist core surrounded by miles of slumlike banlieus along the edges.Cara Black's flics barely have the time to deal with murder, when other events like terror-driven explosions and a horrible TGV accident in the station. Rumanian thugs in cheap exercise suits abound, selling their muscle to developers and with an eye on the main chance, whatever it may be. The Bastille area, site of a notorious castle/prison torn down in 1789, is now dominated by the huge Opera Bastille. The local neighborhood, however, is being forcibly torn down and redeveloped.In walks private investigator Aimee Leduc. In the first few pages of MURDER IN THE BASTILLE, she is brutally attacked in an alley and blinded as a result of a damaged artery. For most of the novel, she can see nothing around her. The onus for the investigation falls on her dwarfish partner Rene, with occasional help en passant from overburdened police officers who knew her father on the force.I look forward to reading the other novels in the series."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"Murder in the Bastille is the adventure that draws the reader to Aimee Leduc's side from the beginning. The story begins with Aimee in a restaurant. At a nearby table, she spots a woman who is wearing an identical Chinese silk top. When the woman leaves, Aimee notices that she has left behind her cell phone and goes after her to return it. Down a side street in pursuit of the woman, Aimee is violently attacked. When she comes to, she is blind. From here, readers, hone all your senses, and go with Aimee on this new journey to find the answers to this multi-faceted mystery. I particularly enjoyed &quot;Bastille&quot; because we get to see different dimensions of Aimee as a person, given her new vulnerabilities. Her condition also gives us a chance to view Rene in a broader light as his role becomes instrumental in putting all the pieces together. If you want someone to show you around Paris, with an attitude of free-spirit and freshness, jump into Aimee's pack and hang on tight. Cara Black, has proven to be, once again, a worthy and able tourguide through the Paris streets."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"Black just keeps getting better and better, and &quot;Murder in the Bastille&quot; is her best Aimee Leduc mystery yet. Aimee's blindness has given her a depth that only comes throught trial and experience and Black has adroitly handled her heroine's inner growth. The independence that Aimee has shown in the previous books here takes on an edgy sadness that fills in her character and really brings her to life. Her partner, Rene, too, comes into his own in this 4th book of the series.The plot of &quot;Bastille&quot; is smooth and the considerable action connects readily. As always, Paris itself is a character, and the dark dreams and gritty contemporary reality of the city are as rich and delicious as an espress on a rainy day. Escape to Paris as easily as opening the cover."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"Murder in the Bastille is my first Aimee Leduc mystery, but it won't be my last. Not only do the backstreet Paris scenes ring true, so do the complex relationships. Readers who bring a little something to the book themselves will enjoy it more than dullards who look for simplistic answers with every loose thread neatly snipped. Cara Black's in media res approach makes me want to go backwards and forwards in this intelligent series. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"Aimee is mistaken for another woman and attacked in the Passage de la Boule Blanche, near the Opera Bastille and the Hopital Quinze Vingts. Her optic nerve is injured, causing blindness; the other woman, Josiane, is murdered. Her struggle to deal with the loss of control that this brings and her acceptance of help in order to learn how to continue doing her job despite this handicap reveals her vulnerability and brings her closer to us. We also get to know Rene better as he is forced to come out of the office, gathering information and functioning on the street to help Aimee find the murderer of Josiane. A new romantic subplot (and a discovery of an existing character's romantic feelings) makes us curious about Aimee's future love life.The plot line is clearer & more absorbing, there are fewer characters, and as a result, this book is more relaxing to read and we know the characters better. There are some memorable bit players - Mathieu, the restorer of antique furniture; Mimi, the retired madam; and Bibi, the Downs syndrome boy whose excellent observation skills help solve the case and also move one of the flics to deal with his family issues. The perpetrator is not easily identified & Aimee makes a few mistakes here too before blundering into the place that reveals his identity. Black's picture of \\"les vieux\\" who have lived in the Bastille all their lives being thrown out of their dwellings by thugs hired by developers rings true, and her thumbnail portraits of these people are not easily forgotten.My one reason for not giving this book five stars has to do with the lack of integration between the different plot threads - the \\"development\\" angle (connected with the murder from the beginning) and a terrorist/smuggling plot thread which emerges later. Black does bring them together at the end, but the characters that ring the truest are those who figure in the other plot thread - even that of the person who turns out to be the attacker. The terrorist thread is not as well developed & suffers from the same episodic quality familiar from Black's earlier books.Black succeeds in making her Bastille book more of a story and less of a travelogue/lecture on the history of every famous place that turns up. Yes, a few well-known spots are mentioned and you can google them and plan to go there on your next trip. I began to quite like the Bastille area and want to explore it more! But it is nicer to see Black coming into her own as a writer and moving beyond her obsession with the minutiae of the history of Paris."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"With each Aimee Leduc novel, Cara Black gets better--ever more deft and graceful at storytelling and characterization, while still giving us the intensity of Paris. At the very start of this book, Aimee is attacked and blinded. The police suggest she was the victim of a serial killer. But was she? Aimee struggles to navigate in the world of the blind while considering several unfolding crimes. Among the wonderful things about this book is the emergence of her partner Rene from prop sidekick status--it is Rene who acts to uncover crucial evidence, and Black's portrait of him is powerful and poignant. The action takes place in a Paris that is not a tourist fantasy but a tough metropolis. As ever, no other writer today gives us Paris like this. Black remains that rarity--a marvelous storyteller who believes readers have a brain."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"Love the series - love Aimee, Rene. Each book offers a bit more info and a more experience with Aimee as she faces mysteries and challenges with boldness and grace. This book offers her a particular challenge with her own abilities. I like the fact that, while this is a beloved series, there is always growth in the characters - and often we see those around the main characters grappling with their own issues and learning more by the end. This book allows us to witness changes in perceptions about others, about what disabilities are, and I loved it. I'm reading more and I hope to see more and more of Rene - he may be Aimee's true soul mate."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"I just love these books!

For the LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.'\\" -- 1 Samuel 16:7 (NKJV)Can you think of another recent mystery series based in Paris that provides such rich detail about a neighborhood, its history, its current inhabitants, the lives of those on society's margins, and intriguing looks at a quartier's underground quirks? Anyone who has read more than two books in the series is bound to have found that combination to be intriguing.I suspect that some people discover Cara Black in the mistaken belief that she provides for Paris what Donna Leon does for Venice. Mais, non! Ms. Leon takes you into the places that tourists would like to go while Ms. Black takes you to places that many tourists probably pray they will never see.There's also an intriguing choice of detectives by Cara Black that breaks the mold. Her heroine, Aimee Leduc, doesn't want to be an investigator. She just wants to wear vintage designer clothes bought for little, to have exciting times with handsome \\"bad\\" boys, and to earn enough money as a computer security consultant at Leduc Detective to keep her home and business. Her pain is not understanding what happened to her mother and father, an intriguing thread that ties the series together. Rene Friant, her partner, is a genius at hacking into computer systems and is an expert in martial arts despite being a dwarf who walks in pain.Now, if you like offbeat, this series has it.I felt that with this book, the novels took a definite turn for the better.As the dust jacket copy reveals, the book opens with an apparent coincidence, Aimee and another woman in the same restaurant wearing identical outfits. When Aimee searches for her look-alike, she's attacked and loses her sight. The other woman is found murdered. The police connect the two events to a series of murders . . . but Aimee isn't so sure that's the right answer. Who did it?You'll find that the police are more obtuse than usual, which can make the story a little annoying.The ultimate motive is well hidden and adds a chilling element to a dark story.There's also a romantic element that will appeal to those who like a bit of sexual attraction in their murder mysteries.Have more fun in the Bastille than the prisoners did during the Ancien Regime there!"},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"I loved this book. Rene plays a much larger role which allows us to learn more about him and to see Aimee through his eyes. I feel like I got to know them both better.Aimee losing her sight is such an interesting and unique twist. She is no longer the fearless detective. She is vulnerable and it only makes her personality more interesting and complex.I can't wait to continue with this series.

The main character is a leftist private detective, who dislikes the incompetent and corrupt police (but is the daughter of a senior Prefecture of Police officer), who has a weakness for bad boys, Couture fashion and cigarettes, and is possibly the most annoying character I have read. The author has no clue about criminal investigations, French law enforcement, weapons, or forensics, but besides that...Also the author besides her socialist leaning drivel and improbable plot lines, has the charming ability of making Paris the City of Light, seem as drab, grimy and nearly appealing as Detroit."},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","review":"lots of misdirection and confusion with no conclusion.stock characters left undeveloped.paris-o-philes might like the scenery."},{"Title":"Joseph Franke and Teresa M. Telecky. Reptiles as Pets: An Examination of the Trade in Live Reptiles in the United States. (book review): An article from: Journal of International Wildlife Law & Policy","review":"As a herpetologist and member of a herpetological society, I appreciate the HSUS for highlighting some of the problems associated with the trade in live reptiles. However, I strongly disagree with their conclusion that the reptile trade must be ended. Maintaining captive reptiles can be a rewarding and educational experience, and in some cases may have significant conservation value. The problems highlighted in this book can be better overcome by effective education and research.While it is true that reptiles may carry salmonella, the disease is easily prevented through practicing basic hygiene such as washing one's hands after contact with a reptile. A great majority of salmonella cases are from improperly cooked poultry. The CDC (center for disease control & prevention) has identified 17 zoonotic diseases (diseases transfered from animals to humans) in dogs and 16 diseases in cats. Why are there no political persuasive reports asking for a ban on cats and dogs?I also find it quite erroneous that the pet trade is the largest conribution to the demise of wild reptiles. In truth, the pet trade's effect on the native population has been dwindling as herpetoculture continues to improve and offer healthier, captive bred reptiles.Lastly, the report highlights that some reptiles are dangerous (such as venomous snakes, large constrictors, and crocodilians). However, the number of fatalties and incidents resulting from captive reptiles is extremely low compared to domestic dog attacks, where according to the dog bite law website, at least 800,000 individuals are attacked and of that number, at least 15,000 are serious enough to require hospitalization. Shouldn't the HSUS (or H$U$ I should say) be calling for a dog ban instead?"},{"Title":"Cut To The Chase (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"I loved this book! It was hot, sweet, and the characters were sympathetic, warm people I really liked. It was also funny, especially the heroine's cravings and mood swings.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cut To The Chase (Harlequin Temptation)","review":"Unrealistic is too gentle a word to describe this book... The plot leads the reader in several different paths and then drops the storyline when it &quot;makes sense&quot; to do so... Nothing ever gets fleshed out. In addition, the cliches and language used in this book are ones that you would expect a high schooler to use. The conversation actually sunk to the level of sounding like, &quot;I was ALL hormonal...&quot; What professional author actually writes like that?Finally, what are the odds that a couple, one of which being a PREGNANT woman, will meet, &quot;fall in love&quot; and decide to get married within a week?!?

Although this book is the oldest of all that I read, it gave me the clearest, most realistic picture of Peace Corps life. Beyond that, it was a story that touched me deeply. Too many Peace Corps stories drown in sentimentalism or self-admiration or cutesy life lessons learned. Living Poor avoids these traps and is a great story, whether or not you are contemplating Peace Corps."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"I was fortunate enough to grow up in Ecuador and was the daughter of a good friend of his. This book, like his others, brings out the curmudgeonly appeal he had for me as a young girl playing in his courtyard. His straightforward dark humor, playing on the subtleties of his life, is present throughout this book. I found this book to reflect the nature of South American Ex-Pats, new and old, bringing that fervent desire to belong and not belong to the adopted culture. To me this is also about trying to make an impact learning and teaching, creating and destroying.I highly prize this book, and am so saddened that I will never again read another book from this man.If you are interested in South America, the nature of Ex-patriotism, and living in a culture outside your own, this is one book to have in your library."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"In 1988, my wife and I decided to join the Peace Corps.

Although every Peace Corps volunteer's experience is different (and our's was totally different from the authors) after our two years in Ecuador this book still rings true This book is brutally honost.

It was an extremely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"Down to Earth and very detailed account of this man's experience in Ecuador in the 1960s as a Peace Corps Volunteer. There are many things a person in the Corps can relate to regarding Moritz Thomsen's inner thoughts about his role and responsibilities, environment, and people he dealt with. He gave a lot of honesty in himself and his personal perceptions. I would recommend this book to those considering applying or serving in the Peace Corps. One note, is that the training today is much different than it was in the 1960s. There are numerous books about the Peace Corps experience from RPCVs who served and they also are worth looking into."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"My Peace Corps experience was quite different from Mr. Thomson's on the surface. I went to an Arabic country in Africa as opposed to a South American Country. I was in my 20s as opposed to late 40s. My training was in country and quite different. I was a teacher instead of a farmer and lived in a large metropolitan city.However, having said all that there were several times I thought\\"Whoa!\\" this is exactly what happened to me! And this is something that no non-PCV would ever understand.For example, he described the emotional feeling he had from living in Equador similar to the feeling of first falling in love except that this feeling was constant. I had that feeling about Morocco and I STILL have it to this day 30 years later.He doesn't sugar coat the experience either and describes the hardships of which there were many. Underlying these descriptions were a message that they made him a better person. Ah, how I can relate.Excellent book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"Mr. Thomsen's views of life in the peace corps had me laughing outloud one moment and almost crying the next. His jaded perspective of this institution and the problems with dealing in a third world mentality made me think of pushing my own life's challenges. The characters involved and the Ecuadorean coastal culture are similar to Wouk's &quot;Life is a Carnival&quot; , one of my favorites also. Although I never served in the Peace Corps I have a better feel for the trials and tribulations of the task now that I have read this book"},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"Although I was a Peace Corps volunteer I did not read this in preparation of my service (although I wish I had). I was drawn to this book after reading a friend's copy of Moritz's \\"Farm on the River of Emeralds\\" which was such an excellent book I wanted to read more of Moritz's writing. I was not disappointed by \\"Living Poor\\". As referred to in the subtitle this is a chronicle of Moritz's experience joining the Peace Corps and traveling to Ecuador where he spends most of the next four years working with the people of Rio Verde, a village on the Pacific Coast near Esmeraldas.I think \\"Farm on the River of Emeralds\\" is a better literary work and reflects the development of Moritz as a writer as well as his enriched experience over time in Ecuador. This did not reduce my enjoyment and appreciation of \\"Living Poor\\". This is a book that reveals poverty as deeply and as powerfully as Rohinton Mistry's novel on India, \\"A Fine Balance\\".Moritz is an excellent observer of people and writes of their appearance, mannerism, and background with portrait accuracy but also with humor and sensitivity. I remember a description of a woman in the village that was feared by all the families. She was a bruja, a witch that could cast spells and control people with her \\"brews of secret leaves\\". Moritz meets and describes her...\\"She had great square teeth, strong and yellow, and her smile was like some aristocratic but fading French countess right out of Proust. She was in her sixties but her hair was still dark and tied in two teenaged pigtails; they stuck out wildly from out beneath a limp and incredibly well used straw hat, the top of which was broken and hinged. When you talked to her on the beach and a breeze was blowing the top of the hat kept opening and closing mysteriously, as though it was trying to send you a secret message without..her seeing.\\"I did not read Moritz as having a dark perspective as mentioned by some previous reviewers here. He is just very honest, perhaps a little self depreciative but very capable of showing the struggles, joy and humor of the people of this little village in Ecuador. I now consider him one of my favorite authors and very much look forward to reading \\"Farm on the River Emeralds\\" again and his last book about his life in Ecuador \\"The Saddest Pleasure\\"."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"This remains one of my favorite books of all time...it's survived four library donations in the past 30 years...Tried to find Thomsen before he died, unfortunately could not...not sure he ever knew he was a great author...hope others got to him with that snippet of info and that he died happy...He nailed the peace corps...gave it the best it ever had from any of us...i love the man and wish we had more like him..."},{"Title":"Living poor: A Peace Corps chronicle","review":"This book is the answer to The Ugly American.

That is the path I hope to take as I embark on my 2+ year experience. I guess this book did not provide the inspiration I was looking for. I'm sure I'll feel differently after I return.

I am a Theroux fan, and his comment inspired me to read Living Poor. I am glad that I did. In Living Poor, Thomsen recounts his experiences in 1960s Ecuador in an interesting and surprising narrative.Thomsen - a 48-year-old, California farmer wasn't the typical volunteer. Once in Ecuador, Thomsen tried to help the people in Rio Verde (the village where he worked). Fortunately, Thomsen was a skilled writer and Living Poor brings Ecuador alive for the reader. Consider the following passage:\\"The restaurant was on the beach and we sat outside in wicker chairs and watched the sailboats leaving with the offshore night wind, their lamps clustered together closely as they disappeared into the night, beautiful and vulnerable as fireflies on the great expanse of tranquil sea. And off to the north in the darkness Rio Verde slept, that faithless lover.\\" (p. 298).Living Poor takes a while to build momentum. However, in the latter part of the book Thomsen recounts his mounting concerns as his time in Rio Verde neared its end. The reader cheers for Thomsen, hoping that his projects will work. Eventually, the story comes to a surprising close.After reading this book, I concluded that I could never be in the Peace Corps, but I do admire the volunteers.

Thomsen towed no party line but rather described his experience in great detail, some may agree too much detail. Although a great book for aspiring volunteers which may aid them to temper their missionary tendencies with a dose of reality, the book is over-written.

But should we therefore suspect that a flaming \\"King James Version Only\\" man, such as the Rev. Marion \\"Pat\\" Robertson, is homosexual as well? I think not! I cannot believe that Pat Robertson is a closeted gay just because he strongly prefers the so-called \\"Sodomy-tolerant\\" KJV. That Pat suffers from a deep homosexual panic about the very possibility of closeted gayness? Okay, sure. But can you blame him? How would you like to have spent your puberty and Saturday nights in the dorms and closets of an all-boys military school in Tennessee if you were a cute teenaged, sexually ambiguous, youth named \\"Marion\\"? Truly, if the atheists and homosexuals of this world knew one tenth of what the bullies at that military school put him through, such as the nickname, \\"Minnie Mouse,\\" then I think they'd better understand Pat Robertson's passion to \\"ride with the king\\" - with King James, that is!But let me add this, in Pat's defense: if King James and Pat Robertson should ever meet in Heaven, it will not be Marion \\"Pat\\" Robertson who is the first one to say, \\"Tickle me Elmo!\\" I know Pat well enough to vouch that he would never ask another man to tickle his elmo; or another woman, for that matter. If anyone tickles Pat Robertson's elmo, it will be Pat himself.Besides, King James did not personally translate the \\"King James\\" Version. As the King of England, James merely put up the cash for the fifty British scholars who did the actual work - most of whom, granted, were gayer than Truman Capote on a spring day in Amsterdam. That interesting historical fact may explain why the allegedly \\"homo-tolerant\\" Authorised Version goes easy on the biblical heroes, David and Jonathan, and on the prophet Daniel, and the apostle John; but it can shed no light on the Marion Pat Robertson mystery, nor will the behavior of those fifty dissolute KJV translators ever get Pat to change his position. For one thing, they're dead. Seriously, in these \\"end times,\\" when Jesus could be returning at any minute, it would be a mistake for English readers to reject the Authorised Version of the Bible simply on whatever nagging doubts they may have concerning the Jacobean nature of Rev.

There's always &quot;The Bible Designed to Be Read as Living Literature,&quot; but who wants to be cheated by abridgment (to say nothing of RSV substitutions)? This lovely Ivy Books paperback is the perfect answer to this dilemma. Its virtue is to present the KJV in a readable format, sans additions of any kind, with a majestic veined-granite cover. It places the Bible as a book among other books, without making it humble. A comfort in the hands and easy on the eyes, this edition allows the majesty of this Renaissance cathedral of Words to speak to the reader with all the billowing grandeur of its majestic style and substance.

I was a little disappointed when it wasn't the correct version, but that was my fault, not the seller or publisher. I should have read the description more carefully.Now for the happy results. :)Regarding reading the Holy Book in non-digital format:I'm a gadgeteer, so reading the Lord's words off anything without a backlight felt odd at first. Also, paper Bibles i've owned were pocket types, and this is much bigger. However, I soon grew accustomed to it, and began to enjoy it more than the iPad/iPhone/pocket Bibles I have. I liked that I can have my fingers in several chapters at once, to instantly reference several verses at once without copy/paste and digital delays. It doesn't require a battery or Internet connection. My toddler son can handle it and crinkle pages, and don't have to worry about \\"screen-time\\" exposure, or us inadvertently damaging a $700 device with prune juice.Regarding the physical nature of this particular Bible:Upon opening this beautiful Bible, I was filled with instant admiration for the paper quality, binding, font size, font type, red letter quality, weight, feel, gold edges, and general look. I'm still in awe of how little it costs to buy this much quality.Regarding the Nelson version:In reading the KJV version of the Bible, it does require some research on my part to figure out certain words and concepts. However, Nelson translates many difficult words by adding a small \\"T\\" next to a difficult word, Translating it at the end of the verse. He also adds an \\"R\\" for Read-along. This is very helpful, and saves tons of research outside the Bible. Now for the best feature: Nelson has added little star outlines in the Old Testament, next to passages that make prophesies about our Lord's birth, life, ministry, and death. Then, in the New Testament, he has filled in the stars, for fulfilled prophesies. This is just so wonderful, and again, saves lots of research outside the Bible. He also adds \\"family history\\" blank pages at the head of the book, sweetly encouraging the owner to see the Bible as a constant in the variable flux of life. While people are born, live, and die, God's word was and is always there, reinforced by his promises.Regarding the King James version:The KJV had to endure the short break-in period, where it was breaking me in to its beautiful yet old language. Then, we clicked, and I just felt that of all the translations I tried, this is the closest to the real thing. Also, quoting the KJV has power and commands attention. It just feels like God's word. I can't explain it, but it's worth the effort. It's also the most accurate, much more than the NIV, NLT, and NKJV. The spirit of the Word is there in every translation, and all have their advantages. The KJV, though, is the most accurate, and suffered the least from modernization. For instance, in every version, Exodus 22:28 says \\"do not blaspheme God\\" or \\"don't revile God\\", except in the KJV. It states, \\"Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people\\" (Ex 22:28, KJV) \\"gods\\", not \\"God\\", in direct reference to the earlier passages describing respect given to the \\"judges\\" to be appointed over the Jews, referred to in Hebrew as Elohim, or (plural) gods, since they do God's bidding on earth. Even Nelson translated it incorrectly (the only error I found yet). Only the original KJV text has it right.Conclusion:This Nelson KJV Bible is just wonderful. Everything about it is glorious and beautiful. Buy it with confidence.~ Your humble servant in Christ, Rush Hamden."},{"Title":"Holy Bible","review":"Bible is great just a light blue cover no problem,enjoy reading with good size letters"},{"Title":"New Perspectives on Creating Web Pages with HTML -- Introductory","review":"This book is GREAT for self study.

Dr Dunn is rightly one of the foremost scholars of our times, and the vast majority of his conclusions, while sometimes overly cautious, are brilliant.Before I get into my critique of the book, let me first defend Jimmy Dunn the man. Too many people accuse him of being \\"liberal\\" and \\"unorthodox\\". Dunn is trying to tell us what he thinks *Paul* believed about Jesus, and not necessarily what he personally thinks of Him. Dunn loves Jesus Christ dearly, and that has certainly come out in his writings. He is simply trying to avoid putting his personal theology in his books; something that other scholars would do well to imitate.This book will give a person all the information they need to know about early Christology. He walks you through--on a very detailed path--all the titles and descriptions of Christ that have made people believe Christ to be a preexistent being, and then puts those titles back into context. How would \\"Son of God\\" have been understood in Jesus' time? How would preexistence have been understood? These are all questions brilliantly answered by Dunn. What is interesting is that I came away from this book MORE convinced of Jesus' divinity and LESS that Christ was a preexisting entity. While Dunn clearly states in the introduction that he is not writing an apologia defending orthodox Christianity, this is precisely what he does, but far more brilliantly and comprehensively (and historically accurate!) than more popular authors (like Josh McDowell).I only gave it 3 out of 5 stars because there are times that hhe is overly cautious and unclear. After drawing conclusions, it would be nice if he could have speculated a little about the results of the implications; in other words, if Paul identified Christ with Sophia, what did that mean in terms of how Paul viewed the man Jesus? I also gave it 3 out of 5 stars because of his treatment of Phil. 2:5-11. For, say, while criticizing some scholars for choosing one meaning of morphe and running with it, he essentially does the same thing with the phrase \\"becoming in the likeness of men\\", an awkward translation, to say the least. Also, while disagreeing with J Murphy-O'Connor's analysis of I Cor. 8:6, he only states that he is wrong, and does not get into specific points as to *why* he is wrong. This can give the impression that Dunn *wants* Murphy-O'Connor to be wrong.One should also be aware that in his equally necessary Theology of Paul the Apostle, his views on preexistence appear to have soften somewhat. Therefore, it's a good idea to buy both.In any event, if you are looking into the origin of the Incarnation, and of course, the divinity of Christ, and if you are willing to learn a lot of information, buy this book and check out his claims for yourself. You will most definitely never read the New Testament the same way again, and you will appreciate Christ all the more by understanding him vis a vis the first Christians."},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"&quot;Christology&quot; is not just the study of Christ, but typically refers to beliefs of Jesus and to what extent he was divine. 'High Christology' being mostly divine and a 'low Christology' being mostly man. Despite what you have been taught in Sunday School the debate over who Jesus was and to what extent is he divine has gone on since the first century. Here Dunn compiles all the arguments for a variety of 'titles' attributed to Jesus and examines each one in detail. Rather than giving one particular theological point, he discusses the issues debated by the different scholars giving the reader a clear understanding on each of the titles. If you enjoy studying religion and christianity, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"\\"Christology\\" is the attempt to describe the nature and mission of Jesus by studying the documents of the New Testament and their relationship to the Hebrew Bible as well as the apocryphal and non-canonical literature of Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity.Dunn examines in detail the various titles of Jesus - Son of Man, Son of God, Messiah, the Logos, God incarnate, etc. - and shows how these concepts were most likely understood at the time they were first used. He describes the history of these terms in Jewish thought, and traces how these terms evolved during the formative years of Christianity.Dunn generally leans towards the idea that the earliest Christian tradition viewed Jesus as a human being specially chosen by God for a unique role in the salvation of the Jewish people and - secondarily - of all people. Yet, somewhat inconsistently, at the end he claims that the late development of \\"high Christology\\" - of Jesus viewed as the divine second person of the Holy Trinity - is an acceptable and logical development of the earlier view of Jesus as a divinely chosen human being.That is my only quibble with a book that otherwise exhibits sound scholarship and reasoned argument. Perhaps most of us moderns - Dunn included - are infected with the Hegelian idea that whatever happens in the world - if it involves major historical trends and Ideas - somehow enjoys Divine blessing, even if it seemingly contradicts our understandings of the Divine Will. But I digress . . . as a thorough exploration of the progression and development of the Christian understanding of the nature and role of Jesus, this book is a \\"must have.\\""},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"This is a \\"must read\\" book. I have read about six first rate books written by James D.G.Dunn long after the one I am reviewing, but it is fascinating to see how his learning has expanded and to be able to trace its development. Frankly, I think this book must be read to fully understand what he has accomplished in the years since this book was published. Readers will get an honest appraisal of the status of Jesus Christ in the unfolding of God's plans for the cosmos.Gary Charles Leedes"},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"Dunn's purpose for writing this book is evident in the subtitle: It is to trace the development of the doctrine of incarnation through the NT. The manner which he proposes to accomplish this is \\"to let the NT writers speak for themselves, to understand their words as they would have intended, to hear them as their first readers would have heard them\\" (9). Only then can one see \\"How and in what terms did the doctrine of the incarnation first come to expression\\". (10)In each chapter Dunn examines an individual Christological title or concept found in the New Testament in a diachronic fashion (at least according to his dating of New Testament documents). The order of discussion is the pre-Christian material and thought that might have influenced New Testament writers, the testimony of Jesus, early Christian kerygma, Paul, the Synoptic Gospels, Hebrews, and John.Dunn acknowledges that divine sonship was a common idea in pre-Christian thought but finds no idea of a son of God pre-existing and becoming a man to bring salvation. Mark viewed Jesus as Son beginning at His baptism. The concept evolves more in Matthew and Luke since they trace it to His virgin conception. In fact, Dunn believes the very idea of virgin birth is in direct conflict with the idea of preexistence. He writes, \\"It is a begetting, a becoming which is in view, the coming into existence of one who will be called, and will in fact be, the Son of God, not the transition of a pre-existent being to become the soul of a human baby or the metamorphosis of a divine being into a human foetus.\\" (51) The idea of a pre-existent son was not developed until Hebrews was written, but then it only means in \\"idea\\" not reality. The full concept of incarnation of the Son of God is first found in John.Concerning the Son of Man, Dunn determines that in Daniel he is only a symbol for corporate Israel and not a pre-existent heavenly being. Therefore, pre-existence cannot be inferred from the Son of Man title in the gospels. Jesus' use of this title concerning himself in John 3:13 and 6:62 clearly do refer to pre-existence and therefore are rejected as being historically accurate. Instead, they are a Johannine redaction.Adam Christology, according to Dunn, deals with Jesus' resurrection and exaltation not pre-existence. He finds this concept in places where it is unclear that such a motif was ever intended. He classifies Philippians 2:6-7 and 2 Corinthians 8:9 as part of the First Adam-Second Adam motif in order to deny pre-existence.According to Dunn, in pre-Christian Judaism Wisdom is nothing more than \\"vivid personification.\\" It was a function of God, \\"a way of speaking about God himself, of expressing God's active involvement with his world and his people without comprising his transcendence.\\" (176) So, Paul's association of Christ with wisdom is identifying Christ \\"with the creative power and action of God\\" not with a pre-existent being. (182)\\"Logos christology . . . provided the bridge between the earliest Wisdom christology of Paul and the subsequent Son christology of the classic creeds.\\" (213-4) It is only here that a full scale idea of incarnation if found in the New Testament.Dunn does not define incarnation from the beginning. The problem with this is that at many points he claims a doctrine of incarnation is not evident. To make such a claim on must be working with a clear definition. His definition, based on what is said not to be incarnation, seems to be a divine preexistent being independent from God that became a human being. The idea of independence seems (at least in the view of this reviewer) to be different than a distinct person within the Trinity. His apparent, although unstated, definition of incarnation seems to points to ditheism.His exegetical methodology is divide and conquer. He approaches a text with the idea that since incarnation and preexistence is not clearly found anywhere else such an interpretation of the passage under consideration while possible should not be accepted if any other possible interpretation can be offered. In other words, any interpretation that does not include preexistence and incarnation, no matter how far fetched, is to be preferred over one that does include preexistence. Such line of reasoning is absurd. No passage teaches it so this passage cannot. The other passages are treated the same way. Granted, he does not say that such interpretations are impossible, only that they are a last resort.Dunn's view of Scripture is far too low to satisfy anyone even inclined toward inerrancy. He holds the Gospel of John to be unreliable historically. He maintains that \\"It would be verging on the irresponsible to use the Johannine testimony on Jesus' divine sonship in our attempt to uncover the self-consciousness of Jesus himself.\\" (31) Dunn also abandons the unity of Scripture. He asserts that, \\"Christology should not be narrowly confined to one particular assessment of Christ, nor should it insist on squeezing all different NT conceptualizations into one particular \`shape,' but it should recognize that from the first, the significance of Christ could only be apprehended by a diversity of formulations which though not always strictly compatible with each other were not regarded as rendering each other invalid.\\" (267)Based on Dunn's conclusions, until the writing of John's gospel (probably written in the second century according to Dunn) the highest Christology that any Christian ever held an adoptionist Christology. Paul only saw Jesus as a being created in time that was an instrument of God's saving activity toward humanity. The importance of Christ's person was purely functional.The titles \\"Lord\\" and \\"Christ\\" are not given proper attention. Dunn ignores Paul's close association of Jesus with the Father in his epistolary greetings. 1 Peter 1:11 is also neglected. Dunn is aware of its importance because the only time it is mentioned he admits that it might speak of Christ as Spirit prior to His existence on earth (161). With such a confession it is strange that he never addresses it or offers another possible interpretation. One if left to assume this is because even Dunn with all his creativity could not conjure up another possible interpretation.Dunn should be commended for his proposal to allow the New Testament to speak for itself. Unfortunately, he does not allow it to do so in this book. While Dunn criticizes evangelicals for allowing their a priories based on the creeds to color their interpretation of the text, he has allowed his own critical views and drive for scholarly innovation to color his.If one considers creativity and a lot of references as the mark of excellence of biblical scholarship, then he need look no further than this book. Dunn gives evidence of diligence in research. There are over seventy pages of endnotes. He has compiled an impressive bibliography measuring about fifty pages in length. However, if one considers solid methodology and good exegesis as a must, then he will find this wanting."},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"This is an astoundingly well-researched book. Dunn's work on the titles ascribed to and/or accepted by Jesus started a fruitful debate on the subject -- a debate to which he continued to contribute. Since the discussion has progressed beyond this book, it is somewhat dated; but it is foundational and still of primary value. To understand recent scholarship in Christology, one needs to be familiar with this book.For the novice, I might recommend beginning with Part Four of Dunn's \\"Jesus Remembered\\" and, if your appetite is stimulated, following with this more in-depth (although earlier) treatment."},{"Title":"Christology in the Making: A New Testament Inquiry Into the Origins of the Doctrine of the Incarnation","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my Christology class. I could hardly finish it because I didn't expect it to be so liberal. Dunn asserts that Jesus wasn't divine, but it was His followers who later came to believe He was divine. The Holy Spirit, for Dunn, is merely the power of God, but not the divine person, one of the Trinity. For me it was enough to doubt the orthodoxy of Dunn's theological convictions. After I finished the book I shared my observations with my NT prof. He said, \\"Well, I've read another book by Dunn and I think that he is at least a binitarian\\". I added, \\"Judging to \\"Christology In the Making\\" James Dunn is a unitarian\\".If you are an orthodox believer, you have extra money and you want to exercise in apologetics, you can buy this book. You shouldn't be a sophisticated expert in the New Testament in order to find multiple flaws in Dunn's arguments. The interaction with the book will help to shape your Christology but definitely it will not contribute in your orthodoxy.If you don't have extra money and want to spend what you have wisely buy either \\"The Lord Jesus Christ\\" by Larry Hurtado, \\"The Many Faces of the Christ\\" by Ben Witherington, or the all-time bestseller \\"The Christology of the New Testament\\" by Oscar Cullmann."},{"Title":"A Reputable Rake (Harlequin Historical)","review":"I bought this book because of all the 5 star reviews but it was just plain boring! If you like the English society scene of going from ball room to ball room AND entertainment to entertainment AND insipid conversations AND women being taught how to pimp themselves out then you will love this book. I hated it! Morgana and Sloane continually felt themselves pulled together, but constantly pulled away from each other over and over again, it was tiresome. I didn't care what happened to either one of them, if they got together or not!"},{"Title":"A Reputable Rake (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Cyprian Sloane is a man much put upon. He worked for the crown secretly during the war, living dangerously and building up a dark reputation as a cover. Unfortunately, after the war he is viewed as a smuggler and a profiteer, although men like Castlereagh try to help him from becoming a social outcast. What led him down that road was the hatred of his father, the Earl of Dorton, and his half-brother, Lord Rawley. Cyprian's mother was a second wife who ended up running off with another man (after much harsh treatment), and his father gave Cyprian his name as punishment. He was acknowledged as a son, but viewed and treated as a despised [...].Sloane has not let that hinder him... much. He led the life he wanted to, uncaring about his reputation. But now he feels like standing up to his father and half-brother by becoming accepted by society, despite his past. He will become respectable. He's helped by his wealth and is wooing the beautiful well-born daughter of one of his father's friends (who needs Sloane's money badly). Through Castlereagh, he's allowed at Almack's, one of the bastions of respectability. His father threatens to see him shunned, but Sloane enjoys a challenge.But a stumbling-block to Sloane's ambitions threatens in the form of the very singular Morgana Hart, the unconventional daughter of a diplomat who ends up being Sloane's neighbor. He meets her as she's fighting off a tough from a brothel who is attempting to take her maid's wayward sister. Sloane knows that his plans of finding a firm place in society will easily be thwarted by the least hint of impropriety (his father and others will make sure he is to blame for anything they can possibly conceive of), and he knows Morgana is Trouble. He should marry the sweet and beautiful Lady Hannah and stay far away from Morgana. But sometimes it's true that Once a Rake, Always a Rake... and Trouble or not, Morgana intrigues him.I enjoyed this romance. Cyprian's hard life is gradually revealed and it explains much, but he never wallows in angst or self-pity. He remains strong throughout. Yes, Lady Hannah isn't really the one for him, but she's not a total mis-match, either, so he doesn't seem foolish or misguided in considering her as a wife. Nor is his desire to become respectable unworthy or unwise. He has much to offer if he can move in society and perhaps pursue a political career. And his father and brother deserve to have his presence thrown in their faces.Morgana is a worthy partner for him. She's caring, but strong. She is not ashamed of being unconventional, yet she does envy those like Lady Hannah who can attract men like Sloane. She makes risky choices, but they are understandable and they are not done lightly.It is a delight to watch two such strong, bright and worthy people interact and have a memorable and growing--and fun and exciting and occasionally dangerous-- romance."},{"Title":"A Reputable Rake (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Cyprian Sloane has a wretched reputation. A known rake, gambler and smuggler, he also worked as a spy. But those days are over. Sloane is determined to be accepted by society and gain respectability.

Unfortunately, in doing so, she has acquired a house full of ladies of the evening. Morgana's plan has gone slightly awry. Now, she has placed her reputation in jeopardy. And Sloane's as well.Sloane is faced with a decision. His goal of respectability or Morgana. Unless he can find a way to have both, he must chose one over the other.My favorite part of reading A Reputable Rake was the way in which Ms. Gaston drew me into the story. I was unable to see a tidy resolution to Sloane's dilemma and that's what makes this such a great story. You are turning every page with anticipation to see HOW these two will find their happily ever after. Because, after getting to know Morgana and Sloane, I was desperate for them to find happiness together. Ms. Gaston did not disappoint.I'm a big fan of historical romance. And, I have been missing out on a really great author. If A Reputable Rake is typical of Ms. Gaston's writing, Diane Gaston writes really good historical romances.

He embraced the life of a rake, gambler, smuggler, even though some of those deeds were committed as a cover-up while spying for the crown during the war. Now, he wants respectability, not so much for himself, but to rub it in the face of a father who has always despised him. As he took steps to gain his rightful place in ton society he crossed paths with the caring, determined, and outspoken Miss Morgana Hart. Without choosing to, he became embroiled in Morgana's latest madcap scheme of turning four destitute young woman into \`courtesans'. If discovered, any inroads he'd made for a successful entr&#65533;e into ton society and a suitable betrothal to a respectable but boring young woman would all be for naught. Sloane would have to make a decision as to whether retribution for the cruelty of his childhood was worth losing the remarkable woman he'd come to love.Ms. Gaston is a remarkably gifted author of extremely well written regency tales which encompass an amazing zest for creativity. I find her stories original, bringing to life well-developed characters that will remain in your thoughts long after the last page has turned.

This created a fair bit of tension, but of the page-turning sort -- the good kind!Sloane's physical heroism, past exploits, and spy work afford him the means to get needed information about those who are a real danger to Morgana and her charges. But Morgana's plans for 'educating' these young women fly squarely in the face of Sloane's plans for respectability and his hoped-for acceptance into the upper echelons of Regency society. His motivations for wanting this respectability are also not typical at all, but I don't want to give it away. Suffice it to say, Ms. Gaston's characters are ORIGINAL, fresh, and different.Morgana is quite outspoken and unconventional, but not in an annoying way. I liked her immediately. Ms. Gaston's characters are quite simply the most \\"realistic\\" of any romances I've read, and I've read my share of them. They're beautiful but flawed characters, with quirks and foibles such as we all have. The reader feels great empathy for them; we truly care what will become of them. Even her secondary characters seem very real;I especially love Elliot, Robert Duprey(if he cares about Mary Phipps, that's all I need!), Rose, Lucy, and Cripps.. oh, and the Dowager Lady Hart... and Miss Moore, too, and \\"Madame Bisou\\"...they all seem like real people.The love scenes are beautiful -- somewhat delayed, due to the plotline constraints.. anything earlier wouldn't have fit the character's traits. But WELL WORTH the wait!A plot twist at the novel's end is quite brilliant. Indeed I wondered how Sloane could possibly manage to stay with Morgana without playing the complete cad in a previous near-betrothal, but the solution was perfect.This novel is rich and full of beauty -- the characters grow before our eyes, and learn so much about themselves and about their own motives; and Morgana, thanks to Sloane, finally comes to believe she is desirable and beautiful. I was left quite starry-eyed, reading it all. A REPUTABLE RAKE is definitely a 'keeper', and I eagerly await the author's next effort."},{"Title":"A Reputable Rake (Harlequin Historical)","review":"The third book by Diane Gaston, A Reputable Rake, is the best thus far! Turning once more to the seamier side of London Ton life, Diane Gaston tells the story of a rake in the course of redemption and a well-bred young woman treading on the edge of the abyss of social suicide.Cyprian Sloane, gambling partner of Lord Keating in The Wagering Widow, is a cuckoo-in-the-nest and has never been allowed to forget it; his vengeful father even named him Cyprian, meaning whore, in order to embarrass his faithless wife. Excluded from family life, Cyprian embarked on a series of adventures as a young man including, we gather, spying for the government during the war with France. (Sadly this background is largely undeveloped and I wanted to know more as these adventures were fundamental in terms of his character development.)Morgana Hart is the daughter of a diplomat who grew up in the Peninsula during the war and, we are given to understand, witnessed harsh and difficult events. They have strengthened her, however, and she is independent minded and straightforward.In the story, she becomes entangled with four young women who are about to enter the life of prostitutes and Morgana rescues them and takes them into her home. They all seem determined to become \\"ladies of the night\\" anyway so she decides that at the very least they ought to become high class courtesans a la Harriette Wilson, the most famous of the Regency demi-monde. She inadvertently sets up a \\"school for courtesans\\".Cyprian Sloane, already attracted to her, finds himself living next door to her and although the Ton pairs him off with her silly, flighty young cousin, he finds himself becoming more and more involved in Morgana's life in order to restrain her somewhat nave efforts to school her girls. However, it eventually becomes clear to him that the reputation he is trying so hard to resurrect is likely to be destroyed by his involvement with her and harsh words are exchanged.The story moves on through excursions to various Ton and demi-monde events and as in every good romance, eventually things get straightened out. The pull of sexual as well as intellectual attraction between these two is strong. Eventually, despite themselves, they find themselves unable to resist each other and the author gives us a highly charged scene of consummation.I do hope Diane Gaston continues at the same pace. As I noted in another review, she brings a strong, polished style of writing, shows evidence of careful research into her setting and period and her own working background enables her to create quite powerful characters and conflicts. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Reputable Rake (Harlequin Historical)","review":"Unmistakably, Diane Gaston's approach to the Regency period is often SURPRISING and her newest novel, A REPUTABLE RAKE, is no exception!

However, now she pushes the boundary! Her neighbor, the dashing Cyprian Sloane, thinks her latest liberal idea will surely bring about their damnation! A plan to turn destitute girls into courtesans is . . . unbelievable! Does this lovely woman not know what she is doing? After all, she is a member of the 'Beau monde'! Yet, she will destroy everything - EVERYTHING - Cyprian Sloane has accomplished. All Cyprian wants, is acceptance - an entry into proper society - and that little hoyden, Morgana Hart, is hell-bent on ruining it!Initially, author Diane Gaston made romance history by writing her stunner THE MYSTERIOUS MISS M. Such lofty achievements are generally hard to duplicate! Nevertheless, in A REPUTABLE RAKE, the threat of societal destruction and a troublesome, rival Madam nicely establish the story's \\"rocky road.\\" But, it is the glandular pull between Morgana and Sloane that is truly Gaston's trump card. Whenever her two lovers are together, Gaston's pages practically steam. Unfortunately, the author chose to delay the much anticipated buff action. Regrettably, when her lovers finally got it on, it felt forced. This is a shame, for Gaston had the PRIZE - THE PRIZE to exploit - the courtesan instructions. Just imagine the rakish Sloane and the innocent Morgana experimenting with her sexual lessons! The \\"Golden Prize\\" was there . . . there for the taking . . .A REPUTABLE RAKE does refer to characters and references from the author's previous two books, but such recognition has absolutely no effect on this read.

This is something that mathematicians have known since Kenneth Arrow published his impossibility theorem in 1950. That theorem states that no voting system based on ranked preferences can possibly meet a set of selected criteria when there are three or more alternatives. This idea was expanded on by Allan Gibbard and Mark Satterwaite, who proved that with three or more alternatives, there is no reasonable voting system that cannot be manipulated. In other words, it is always possible for voters to benefit by casting a disingenuous vote. In this book, Taylor sets down the mathematical foundations for these results as well as presenting several additional theorems that show additional aspects of the problem.The results are certainly counter-intuitive, after all how is it possible for someone to gain by voting against themselves? However, it is possible and such issues have a great deal of relevance when social choices are made via some form of extended ballot. The mathematics is occasionally hard to follow, there were times when I really had to slow down and pick my way through the theorems. Nevertheless, most of the notation is that of set theory and predicate calculus, so if you understand that, you can wend your way through the book.It is well worth reading, voting theory is a fascinating topic to explore and Taylor has written the best book available that will blaze your trail."},{"Title":"Social Choice and the Mathematics of Manipulation (Outlooks)","review":"This book it an very useful survey of key results in social choice theory, which generally looks at voting systems. All practical voting systems are \\"manipulable\\", here meaning simply that a voter can sometimes get a better result by voting \\"insincerely\\" or \\"strategically\\", which is to say differently than they would if they were the only voter.There are simple and obvious examples of this. In 2000, many voters who preferred Nader to Gore voted for Gore instead of Nader, trying (unsuccessfully, in the event) to improve the result (according to their preferences) from Bush to Gore. This is a trivial example; the mathematics gets more interesting with election methods that are more expressive than a simple plurality-winner election, for example IRV, STV, and other methods in which a voter ranks candidates instead of choosing just one.Readers needn't be a mathematician to appreciate the book, but it helps to be sympathetic to the subject, and perhaps somewhat conversant with basic notation.If you think you might be interested, go ahead; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Children","review":"Uncle Tom's Children is probably one of the most brutal books ever written on the topic of racism and racial oppression.

Personally, I don't recall ever having seen the ugliness of racism so brilliantly treated in any other work of literature, bar none.

It is an easy read because the stories are so gripping, and the dialogue is written in the southern vernacular of the time.

Wright had a remarkable talent for description, and he makes the reader feel as if alongside the main characters as the stories play out. These stories detail racial discrimination and oppression in the Deep South during the 1930's. I particularly liked his story about a flood that led to blacks being conscripted at gunpoint to work on the levee (and a tragic shooting that followed), plus his story about a planned hunger march that went against the wishes of the local (racist) government. Each story attacks southern racial injustice in a concise and powerful manner.Two years after this book was published, Wright burst into fame with NATIVE SON, and he followed a few years later with BLACK BOY and THE OUTSIDER. This collection of short stories isn't Wright's best work, but it demonstrates the author's budding talent."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Children","review":"The Library of America consistently produces wonderful volumes, and Richard Wright's \\"Early Works\\" is a strong member of the set. As I worked my way through this volume, I found myself re-thinking questions I have put aside for a while, challenging attitudes that I have acquired as part of our zeitgeist. I did not find that much of interest in \\"Lawd Today!\\" and \\"Uncle Tom's Children,\\" the first two selections in the volume. Perhaps I will take another look at them in the future. However, \\"Native Son\\" was a revelation to me, and I found it amazing.As a student of Mississippi literature, as well as a native Mississippian, I am surprised that I had not read \\"Native Son\\" before. I wonder what response Wright might expect me (a white Mississippian) to have to his work. The answer is not as simple as one might think. Growing up in Mississippi, I worked as a dishwasher. I ran errands for people who looked down on me and wanted me to act stupid and grateful. I felt the harsh sting of minor capitalists zealously defending their tiny empires. Like Wright, I grew up in a single-parent household with extremely limited resources. Like Wright, I never had a feeling that \\"the system\\" wanted to do anything but keep me in my place. Like Wright, I looked around to see that my people were limited by their ignorance and fear. For all of our differences, white and black Mississippians have far more in common than most people want to admit. It is part of what makes us such a fertile field for literature.The easy response for a white person, Mississippian or not, is simply to be reactionary, to allow \\"Native Son\\" to confirm easy stereotypes. In \\"How \`Bigger' Was Born,\\" Wright acknowledges that one of the dangers he faced in writing \\"Native Son\\" was that those who are pre-disposed to see Bigger as typical of \\"those people\\" in general and of blacks in particular would find unequivocal confirmation of their prejudices. Wright must have been constantly tempted to avoid writing with such brutal honesty.However, it is this honesty that forms the core of Wright's artistic achievement and makes his work enduring, almost prophetic. Bigger Thomas represents a type that still exists in plentitude. In \\"How \`Bigger' Was Born,\\" Wright explicitly makes the point that Bigger represents a type that is both black and white, a person growing up in the land of plenty without prospects or hope, without enough education to replace instinct with rational calculation. Unable to participate and without a place, our Biggers simply want to blot out everything and everyone from the face of the earth. Some of them unknowingly follow Bigger's example and kill what they think is killing them.I think I see Bigger every day on the black streets of Atlanta. A close relative of Bigger lives in the white trailer parks in our suburbs. Bigger acts every time a teenager commits a senseless murder, every time a child shoots up a school. I hear an analysis of Bigger when a demagogue politician says that we should just lock them up and throw away the key.The Biggers of the world are irretrievably lost. As Wright clearly shows, there is no way to cure or save or even rehabilitate such people. Even at the hour of their death, they will not understand context, never know why they act as they do, always returning to the basest of emotions for self-justification. They continue to kill out of fear, and we continue to fear them.People used to think that they knew how to prevent more Biggers from appearing, how we might save those not yet lost. There was hope that we could change things so that there would be no more Biggers. It turns out that we have Biggers aplenty and more arising every day. Perhaps we always will. No one seems to care any more.This volume affected me greatly, and I think that it will repay several close readings. It is a definite keeper, well worth the price."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Children","review":"Perhaps nothing was more appropriate about this restored text than placing \\"The Ethics of Jim Crow\\" in its rightful place at the front of this short story collection. Richard Wright used the brief autobiographical essay as a device to state that the short stories included in this set are not far from the truth. The racism during his time period was brutal. These short stories are meant to be emblematic of the brutality of the period.The set begins with the short story \\"Big Boy Leaves Home\\". To many readers, this may seem to resemble \\"Native Son\\" and could be thought of as an early draft. The story finds an African-American adolescent forced to leave home in order to save his life after a local white man is killed at the river. \\"Down by the Riverside\\" takes place during a flood. To save his pregnant wife, who has taken ill, the main character steals a boat. This story may be the most compelling in the set because of a choice the main character is forced to make. To honestly decide what he/she might do under the circumstances, the reader must look deep into his/her soul.\\"Long Black Song\\" explores the sexual exploitation that African-American endured during this period. Like so many other characters in Wright's stories, one senses that the main character is trapped in a situation in which she is destined to fail. As the story progresses, the greed of exploiters puts even more people in \\"no win\\" situations.\\"Fire and Cloud\\" and \\"Bright Morning Star\\" show Wright to be far from timid in his leftist leanings. The first story involves a community choice, while the second is more of an individual choice. Because the plots of these short stories follow a similar path to failure, Wright hardly seems to be endorsing communism.Each of these stories is raw in its unfliching ability to tell an honest story. Wright does not shy away from uncomfortable details. With a general sense of hopelessness that extends to a point where the reader must know the main character will fail, the reader may find himself/herself too engrossed in the details to flinch."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Children","review":"loved this pre-loved book, form an author I'd never heard of till I read an obituary of his most recent biographer, ( Hazel Rowley) Wright is a powerful writer, its a shame he's not remembered well .

I found so much reality in what Wright wrote back then, that I discovered, during this second read, that Charles Wright and I come from the same neck of the woods: and perhaps the train whistle he heard in Mississippi, was the one I heard when I was laboring there, as a three year old, on the Gaines Plantation in the deep Delta.With America's first African American president finally settling in,to his own chilling realities; if you haven't read Native Son, read it and see if Charles Wright would expect any significant changes, for those left behind on the various plantations throughout America., under the new regime. Wright painted a dark picture of Chicago that yet lives today; the politics during his Native Son years are little different today. Slavery seems to have left Mississippi and followed us to Chicago. Nevertheless, one must have courage to confront the truth, whether its your own, or that of Richard Wrights'as depicted in this brilliant collection. If President Obama sends me another stimulus...like he keeps giving to the bankers and major corporate industry cheats, I'll buy copies of Wright's Early Works and send them to every US Senator, and Congressional Rep....in addition to the duly elected officials of the State of Illinois.

I don't mean a little bit of vague reference to a lynching, but gruesome, uncomfortable, detailed descriptions of the most horrible things you can imagine happened to southern black people. There were moments where the language alone made me want to throw up, so be warned.That being said, he's one of the MOST important black writers of the 20th century. He doesn't pander to a white audience, he doesn't pander to the black middle-class. His work is 100% honest, if not a little over the top at times. Though he's been criticized for the form of dialect he uses, I think it's smart how he uses it. Each story in this book is beautifully crafted, even with its disturbing nature.I'm in a class about Richard Wright at the moment, which is why there will be so many of his works. But I can honestly say I'm glad I'm taking it, because he's an author I think gets overlooked a lot because of the brutal nature of his work.

It was written when Edison was 63 (he lived to 84, dying in 1931). Although the book could rightfully be called a panegyric, with little criticism of Edison, that is not to say that it is without value. Although a biography, it is not an introspective work, and at its conclusion, one is unlikely to feel that he \\"knows\\" Edison as a person. Although capably written, the writing isn't likely to blow you away. Also, since it was written relatively early in the \\"electrification\\" phase of history, it is not able to put Edison's work and achievements in historical context, as a more modern work would. Finally, there is no mention made of the AC vs. DC controversy, and only the briefest of mentions is made of his significant rivals, such as Westinghouse and Tesla. However, to be fair, this book is subtitled \\"His Life and Inventions\\", and that's basically what is is about. One advantage of being written \\"in the moment\\" so to speak, is that the book conveys scenes from Edison's life with a vividness and immediateness that a later book could not. There are a lot of stories in the book that are quoted directly to the authors from Edison himself. Given the nature of the authors, I would have expected a little more technical explanation in the book. There is some, and there is a lengthy appendix (about 140 pages) which goes into more detail on each of his major inventions. All in all, I liked this book. It tells you what Edison thought was important about his work, and his life. It is part propaganda, to be sure, but it is also factual, at least to the extent I could verify. I have read some of his patents (you can actually get copies), I have even read some of his patent litigation (court opinions). I personally believe that this book was simply part and parcel of the man's life work - a search for truth. Although he became quite wealthy as a result of his productivity, he wasn't nearly as wealthy as he could have been. For example, any inventions he created in the medical field, he simply gave to the public domain. And for some of his major inventions - for example, the incandescent lightbulb - the cost and time it took to fight off patent infringers severely limited his ability to make any money from it. And he usually plowed back into his laboratory most of any profit he made. He simply wasn't that concerned with money, he was concerned with solving problems."},{"Title":"Edison,: His life and inventions,","review":"This book is fine for what it is, but it consists merely of a reprint of the original text.

However, this good-natured and heroworshipful work should probably be read with a certain amount of skepticism. The authors, Dyer, one of Edison's lawyers and confidants, and Martin, an ex-President of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, use many of the inventor's writings and his own words to them as the foundation for the book. Edison was not a modest or self-effacing man.The story begins with an excellent overview of the state of American industry and invention at the time of Edison's birth in 1847. Edison's \\"pedigree\\" is then discussed. His ancestors came to this country from Holland in about 1730. Several generations worked very hard and prospered. Some family members supported the British in the War for Independence and at its conclusion moved to Canada. From there, the family moved to New Jersey and some to Ohio, where Thomas Alva was born.Things proceed along calmly, told about in some detail, until they get to Tom's young boyhood. From there, the story becomes somewhat frenetic, reading rather like the \\"boys' books\\" adventure fiction of the period. Young Tom becomes a telegrapher and begins riding the local railroads all day and night, working with telegraphy and busily inventing and perfecting at a pace which would be impossible for any normal or even any super-normal human being. He makes friends and admirers everywhere he goes and is allowed by them to set up small laboratories all over the place. Even when they explode, no one is very concerned. This is great fun to read if you take it tongue-in-cheek.Tom becomes fairly successful and moves to New Jersey, where he sets up a lab not far from where his ancestors had settled, and to lower Manhattan where he begins his work with electric light. The book is filled with stories of Edison inventing new processes and establishing new businesses at a great rate. He stays up all night in his lab, working and talking jovially with his assistants, all of whom obviously idolize him. Everyone who knew him, it seems, liked and admired him - except, of course, the many contemporaries with whom he had disputes in court over patents. More interesting to me than the details of Edison's life are the details of American history told from the viewpoint of the industrialist rather than a professional biographer or a historian.While the authors describe this book as a \\"biography,\\" nothing at all is said about the inventor's marriages and children. But his friendships and business alliances are described in detail.The Kindle edition of this book does not contain any patent drawings and I would have liked to have seen some of these, as many of them are quite easy for even the layperson to follow. The transcription of the book isn't bad, although there are some wide blank spaces between words. I didn't find this bothersome. There is a list of Edison's patents at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Edison,: His life and inventions,","review":"Although I had hoped to get a little more out of this book, it still was interesting enough to keep my attention.

But at one time, not so long ago, she was one of the richest, and also infamous woman in the world.\\"Blue Blood\\" tells the story of Rebekah Semple West, the rebellious socialite daughter of a wealthy businessman who went on to marry William Hale Harkness, one of the richest men of his days. After his untimely death, Rebekah inherited his fortune, and it seems where money goes, trouble follows.To the public at large, Rebekah Harkness was a rich, generous (in truth, too generous) woman who backed the arts, including the Harkness Ballet. But what they don't know was that as generous as she can be, Rebekah's favor is also a fickle, and all too often, a fleeting thing. People who displeased her are quickly written out of the picture....but all too often, Rebekah, in an ever vicious cycle, replaced them with similar, if not worse, opportunists and syncophants.While she may appear regal in public, her private life was a shambles. Even with all the money in the world, Rebekah failed miserably as a mother, sharing strained relationships with her children. Her attempts to buy approval and affection with her money only ended in ruined lives and a squandered fortune.All that aside, Blue Blood did its research and constructed a complex and fascinating view of Rebekah Harkness. While it might paint Rebekah as a villain at times, it also remind us that for all her faults, Rebekah is still a human being and not a saint; and she's not supposed to be.Chock full of interesting tidbits and gossip (and photos in the middle of the book), Blue Blood provides a rare look into the world where the rich mingled....And reminds us that the only people who can truly appreciate wealth are those who didn't have it before and earned it themselves."},{"Title":"Blue Blood","review":"When I was 17 Mrs. Harkness saw me in an audition class and, out of hundreds of others, I was one of only three chosen to apprentice with the Harkness Ballet. For the next few years we had an educational and professional experience second to none. I was too young, and stupid, to understand all that was going on behind the scenes; all I knew was that, not only was I receiving the finest training anyone could ever hope to have, I was in an environment that will never, ever again be duplicated. Her vast wealth was directed towards her dancers being provided with literally everything anyone could ever want. That said, Mr. Unger's book fills in the blanks with the information about the people and events that dictated how Mrs. Harkness would react. Now, looking back, it's so obvious that she was surrounded by sycophants who only wanted to bleed her dry. Her great tragedy was that she could not accept honest criticism or concern - it was her way or no way. Whatever, I will always be grateful for all she did for me."},{"Title":"Blue Blood","review":"It's not the greatest book in the world but Rebekah Harkness was my great aunt and I loved her in spite of herself.

Most of them have lived in Uptown New Orleans at least some of their lives.All are spirited, overindulged, bright, lonely, and infinitely memorable. Gilchrist writes of them with compassion and verve, and absolute pinpoint accuracy, right down to the stuffed crab they buy at Langenstein's deli. Most fall prey to substance abuse for part of their lives, and all are have big powerful men in their lives who just don't listen or pay attention.But Gilchrist's characters are not whining closeted feminists. They do claim their own power and space. And they make the reader love them.Whenever I read Gilchrist's books, I find myself wondering if she ever gets invited to lunch in New Orleans anymore. She is just too too acurate and skewers too well the pretentions and aspirations of Uptown matrons too accurately for her to have any friends left in the Crescent City.If you're an outsider and plan to visit deep Delta Dixie, read this book first unless you only want to see the superficial.The unexpected and sharply tragic ending of this book's final short story will grab you by the throat, and never let go."},{"Title":"In the Land of Dreamy Dreams","review":"This is a must for any Gilchrist fan.

Apparently, he's found one. Here are some of his more relevant conclusions:-The overwhelming majority of the 30 philosophers were for the most part diffident in and unsuited for a professional life-The majority of philosophers were either unwilling to earn money or incapable of doing so.-15 of the 30 did not marry at all, 6 married very late, 4 were unhappy, 2 separated, and 7 were normal. Most of the philosophers surveyed were therefore either diffident about or unsuited for marriage.-The philosophers are for the most part either diffident in, or unsuited for, social intercourse.-The great philosophers were nearly all diffident in politics or unsuited for them.-The great thinkers are men with more than normally intense inhibitions, and the intensity of the inhibitions may change in the course of life. (162) Nearly half of the great philosophers show definite neuroses of more or less severe intensity, a few cases terminating in mental derangement.On Herzberg's view, all this diffidence and unsuitability for social life is the result of a mental barrier that inhibits philosophers from participating in normal activities the way others do. He claims that a cause of this barrier is emotional hypersensitivity, which Herzberg characterizes as the tendency to experience exceptionally vivid sensations of displeasure, which in turn leads to general dissatisfaction with practical life as a whole. He also states that in many of the great philosophers this was accompanied by weak constitution or liability to sickness.With regard to philosophy in particular, these mental barriers prevent one's interests from finding an outlet in action and thus force them to express themselves in thought, thereby bringing about practical inaptitude with its consequent preponderance of philosophic thought (122).So, there's the bad news. Is there any good news to be had? Fortunately, yes. According to Herzberg, philosophizing is the satisfaction of an impulse by means of an alternative to action; specifically, philosophizing is the satisfaction of impulses through thinking. In this respect, philosophic activity is a safety-valve for pent-up impulses and is therefore of biological utility in the preservation of the individual's mental health. In short, \\"Refuge in philosophy saves the person to whom it is possible from refuge in mental illness-the penultimate-and from refuge in nothingness-the ultimate-escape from the disillusionments of life.\\" (219) (For some philosophers, reading this quote may conjure up either thoughts of Boethius's, The Consolation of Philosophy, or else a hearty \\"amen!\\" but I digress...)The book shows its age in some ways, as history has not borne out Herzberg's inclusion of Schelling, Fechner, and Stirner as among the thirty greatest philosophers of all time. Aquinas, on the other hand, probably should have made the list. Also, although perhaps he does not consider any of them to be among the top thirty, I would have liked to see Herzberg discuss the lives of a few Asian philosophers as well, especially since Asian philosophers have historically tended to be more practically-minded than their Western counterparts. As Koller notes, \\"The saying, 'Good in theory, but not in practice' makes no sense when applied to Indian philosophies. Good in theory necessarily means good in practice.\\" (Asian Philosophies, 4th edition, p. 9) Nonetheless, given that certain Asian philosophers, for example, Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), were dissatisfied with \\"normal\\" life, I suspect that even many Asian philosophers might exhibit the same psychological traits as their Western counterparts. One may also be reminded of the Hebrew king Solomon's declaration that, \\"in much wisdom there is much grief, and increasing knowledge results in increasing pain\\" (Ecclesiastes 1:18).Since the book has been out of print for some time, it may be difficulty to acquire a copy. However, I suspect that many academic libraries will have a copy or two available for loan, and as of the writing of this review, there are a few copies available from Amazon Marketplace sellers. I recommend it for those interested in either philosophy or psychology, or both, but perhaps not for undergraduates who are new to philosophy and wondering whether to pursue it as a major or career path.Finally, given that Herzberg was a psychologist I am a bit surprised that he only provided a diagnosis of this \\"problem.\\" I would have expected at least a chapter or two on how philosophers can overcome their neuroses and thereby be cured of their need to philosophize. But maybe it's for the best that he didn't, because this neurotic philosopher certainly enjoys doing philosophy and would hate to have to find a different line of work."},{"Title":"Flight to Canada","review":"Ah poor Ishmael Reed!

Lyn Harris/Harry Potter set, but Flight to Canada does what great art should - challenge the beholder.Reed tackles everything from the Civil War, Lincoln, Harriet Beecher Stowe, the grand ol' south, the nature of slavery and slaves and demands the reader to push aside common held beliefs and take a fresh look at this much-studied (and much-rehashed) juncture of American History.Bottom line - a hip and funny read that'll make you think. What more d'ya need?"},{"Title":"Flight to Canada","review":"It seems this book is quite the rage for modern American literature classes in universities today. I actually read it for American Literature to 1865 (it was assigned in tandem with Uncle Tom's Cabin), and it is currently on the reading list for the modern course. And I really can't understand why. The previous reviewer wrote that Mr. Reed was \\"doubly overlooked because he's a truly literate African-American writer AND more so because he's a postmodernist.\\" I would disagree. He's overlooked (I hadn't heard of him before my English class) because, quite simply, he cannot write. Was this supposed to be humorous? I don't think I cracked a smile. Moreover--and here the other reviewer was close--his postmodernism just doesn't fly, because contrary to their opinions, there IS objective truth, as recent events have clearly demonstrated. Mr. Reed is fond of blurring the lines, quite explicitly, between fact and fiction. If all that's the case, who's to say the neo-Marxism of which Mr. Reed seems to be so fond is not merely fiction? Not an enjoyable read at all, especially not VERY poorly written scenes dealing with sexuality. This is certainly not a book I would have read unless assigned (and writing the paper for it was most assuredly like pulling teeth), and I don't feel it has a place on university reading lists, for it is representative of neither American literature nor of good writing. We need to go back to the basics when authors questioned the order of things without denying Truth itself."},{"Title":"Grin and Giggle Book (Big Golden)","review":"I had this book twenty-five years ago.

Except that her publicist should be out trying to book her on every day time talk show in America. She's turned something difficult into something that seamlessly draws kids and parents closer together, and make them smarter in the process.

Buy this if you don't just want to work with your kids on math but want quality time together."},{"Title":"How to Help Your Child Excel in Math","review":"I thought that this book would give strategies on how to help my child excel in math. It definitely is not what I'd imagined.In actuality, it is a math dictionary. It is written simply and concisely and is pretty easy to understand. The book even includes some practice exercises. It's a wonderful book to review forgotten math terms and simple concepts. However, it was missing two definitions that I needed help with: array (what on earth is it and what is it for?) and canceling (in fraction multiplication or division). A little coverage on Roman numerals would have been very nice, too.It definitely wasn't what I expected from the title. Most of all, I really wanted some help on showing my child how to multiply numbers with multiple digits..I thought that this book would take a linear math explanation approach with handy hints and tips to make basic math basics easier. I was quite disappointed in that regard."},{"Title":"How to Help Your Child Excel in Math","review":"If you're like most parents in their late thirties and forties and its been more than 20 years since you've done any math, this book is an invaluable resource when you child asks you for help with his or her homework.

As an impressionable teenager in that era, she learns to deal with many circumstances which are thrust upon her - the differences she faces at school with other students who don't understand her passion for archaeology, the issue of her best friend being a Black American boy and the slow and confusing disintegration of her parents marriage, particularly her mothers resentment toward Tessa's father. All this while learning to juggle her emotions and feelings with common sense. A beautiful book which is inspirational and captivating."},{"Title":"Taming Texas: Captain William T. Sadler's Lone Star Service","review":"Taming Texas: Captain William T. Sadler's Lone Star Service is a fascinating history of Texas as revealed through the biography of William Turner Sadler (1797-1884). Sadler was one of the leading pioneers of 19th century Texas and participated in most of the major events of the period. He migrated to Texas from Georgia in 1835 to become a farmer. He soon found himself in command of the ranger company that built Fort Houston, served as a private in the battle of San Jacinto, was active in quelling the Cordova Rebellion, and became a leader in the campaign against Chief Bowles and the Cherokees. Eventually Sadler served as a representative in both the Republic Congress and the Texas state legislature. During the Civil War, at the age of 66, he served in Terrell's Texas Cavalry. Highly recommended reading, Taming Texas is informative, engaging, offers a unique perspective on Texas history, and is enhanced with photographs, roster lists, and line-drawn illustrations."},{"Title":"Taming Texas: Captain William T. Sadler's Lone Star Service","review":"I have enjoyed this book. It is primarily about Mr. Sadler, We purchased land in Texas about 5 years ago andhave a cemetary on the land for Mr. Sadler.

I found out about the book and wanted a copyand could not find it locally. I ordered from Amazon and got the book in 3 days.

The late Mr Mphahlele writes with humour even in situations which some readers might feel tempted to shed a tear for the hardships he had to endure. But the writer is not out to get sympathy but instead tell it like it is. If you want to cry, laugh and laugh again this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Down Second Avenue: Growing Up in a South African Ghetto","review":"Down Second Avenue by Ezekiel Mphahlele, published by faber and faberThis book is an autobiography about the life of a young black man who grew up in apartheid ridden South Africa. Ezekiel Mphahlele paints a vivid picture of the struggles and tribulations of black people in the old South Africa.It's a well written book about the life of a young man, Eseki, growing up in rural South Africa who then moves to the city. It's about how people moved from the countryside and relocated to townships made just for black and coloured people in the early 1940's.We are taken from Eseki's youth, his schooling, until he succeeds and becomes a teacher. But like many youths at the time gets involved in politics and ultimately bared from practising his skill in the country by the ruling party. He goes to Nigeria were he finds peace and can finally teach.This literature is a view from a different perspective of how people are treated differently, even though they might have the same qualifications. It takes us from a poverty stricken beginning to a political young life and then to finding solace in teaching in a foreign country.Down Second Avenue can be related to works by other writers who lived through the struggle years. It won't appeal to everyone, but can satisfy any person looking for a good read. It clearly illustrates how life was at the time and Mphahlele was a brave man to survive the apartheid government and work in Nigeria."},{"Title":"Down Second Avenue: Growing Up in a South African Ghetto","review":"I found this book in a discount bin in our campus bookstore. I am interested in memoirs, Africa life and racial issues, so I picked it up. This is the author's account of growing up in poverty and fear in South Africa. This book gives some insight into the racial and economic struggles of black families, but it is more of his own life experiences, which certainly give insight into the racial tensions and present a clear picture of poverty in South Africa, but were somewhat disappointing as I was hoping to find a historical and sociological study of racial tensions in South Africa. The language is beautiful, however, and Mphahlele is a very distiguished and talented writer. I was remined of Naguib Mahfouz's Midaq Alley in Mphahlele's funny descriptions and antecdotes about his neighbors. As far as the content, however, I was disappointed by the lack of insight I gained into South African society and politics."},{"Title":"Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures: A Dependence-based Approach","review":"Randy Allen and Ken Kennedy are famous for their contributionsto compiler design theory. This book is a clearly writtendiscussion of the issues involving loop optimization anddependence analysis. While this book also covers scalaroptimization issues, it is naturally complemented by StevenS. Muchnick's excellent book &quot;Advanced Compiler Design andImplementation&quot;.Randy Allen has spent many years implementing a variety ofcompilers for supercomputers and hardware design languages.While Ken Kennedy has published seminal theoretical work oncompiler optimization, he has also been involved in hands onimplementation as well. The experience of these two authorsresults in a book which covers the huge body of knowledge incompiler optimization and provides this knowledge in apractical form that can be used by software engineers workingon compiler design.For anyone working on modern compilers that require sophisticatedoptimization features, this is an important reference work.As with Muchnick's book, I have owned this since it was firstpublished. Rereading it reminds me of what a gem this work is."},{"Title":"Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures: A Dependence-based Approach","review":"As a researcher in the field, this book was immediately useful to me. Nearly every source code transformation and optimization technique that I'm aware of is present in this book, which often saves sifting through stacks of papers or looking for an elusive reference. If you're looking for a book to teach you the basics of how compilers work, it certainly is not the appropriate place to begin, but if you already have one good book on that then this book will make an excellent companion to it. It was slightly annoying that the book comes with two loose pages, one errata list and another to tape over a page early in the book, but that's what you get with 1st editions. Overall it's very good and the errors are very minor typos as opposed to factual goofs."},{"Title":"Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures: A Dependence-based Approach","review":"This book is a very thorough look through all the ways you can extract and use parallelism and data dependencies advantageously in an optimized compiler, depending on your target architecture. As one example, this book contains every imaginable way to deal with arrays and loops and the maddeningly complex data dependancies that can result from their various interminglings. The book is refreshingly easy to read and contains pseudo-code and step-by-step examples everywhere you'd want to see them."},{"Title":"Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures: A Dependence-based Approach","review":"Allen and Kennedy (A&K;) haven't written your first compiler book. There's nothing about syntax analysis, code generation, instruction scheduling, or intermediate representations. You already know all that part, or you won't get very far in this book. Once you have the basics down, A&K; is an irreplaceable reference.It centers heavily on Fortran - even today, a mainstay of scientific computing and an active area of language development. Today, just as 50 years ago, the language's straightforward structure makes detailed behavioral analysis relatively easy. That's especially true in handling the array computations that soak up so many dozens (as of this writing) of CPU-hours per second on todays largest machines. There's far too much to summarize here, but A&K; cover a huge range of processor features, including caches, multiple ALUs, vector units, chaining, and more. C code gets some attention as well, much needed because of the cultural weirdness around array handling in C. In every case, the focus is on the real-world kernels that need the help and on explicit ways of identifying and manipulating those code structures. As a result, the authors disregard the unreal situations that sometimes arise, e.g. in\\"while (--n) *a++ = *b++ * *c++;\\"Yes, the arrays pointed to by a, b, and c can overlap. But the pointer a can also point to a, b, c, or n, somewhere in its range - and likewise for pointers b and c, or all three. There is essentially no limit to how bad this can get, e.g when n is an alias for a, b, or c. Yes these are rare situations and generally errors - but I've seen on-the-fly code generation in production environments, so even the A&K; example isn't as bad as it gets. I admit these to be pathological cases, though, better suited to an 'Obfuscated C' contest than to a compiler textbook.The real disappointment comes from the section on compilation for Verilog and VHDL, and that disappointment may be a matter of emphasis only. The authors focus heavily on the strangeness of four-valued bits, which exist in Verilog and VHDL simulation, but not in synthesis. I.e., not in what really matters to a deployed application. The real challenge lies in compilation of C or Fortran into gates, a topic that the authors barely skim. That, however, is still a field of research exotica. It should be mentioned in a general book on compilation, as it is here, but awaits a text of its own.All you processor designers out there should read the title a little differently. You should read this as \\"Modern Architectures for Optimizing Compilers,\\" but you probably worked that out for yourself. If you have the luxury to define your own memory structure, all that analysis of memory access will give you plenty of ideas for your next ASIP. It will certainly give you lots of ways to quantify the behavior of your target applications, so you'll know just how to get the most MIPS per Mgate, including hard limits on how much hardware paralellism can actually do you any good.All architects of performance computing systems, hardware or software, need this book. Even application developers can learn better ways to cooperate with the compilers and tools that run their codes. It has my very highest recommendation.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures: A Dependence-based Approach","review":"This is the only compiler book i know that performs a comprehensive study on dependences and their applications.

It covers ancient, medieval and Renaissance history. It's very biased toward European and western history and specifically toward English history. It also has all the sort of biases one would expect of a book from this time period.

A good book to integrate parts of for an ancient or medieval history curricula for elementary school."},{"Title":"Builders of the Old World (History on the march)","review":"I taught fourth grade for nine years and taught ancient history for social studies -- Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, China. While it didn't have anything on China, I always used the sections on the other civilizations.

The book is well written in an appropriate language for upper elementary and covers a broad picture of the civilization. I would read parts aloud to the class as well as copy parts for them to read on their own. I like this book much, much better than The Story of Mankind by van Loon or A Child's History or the World by Hillyer. The book was not meant to be a curriculum, but a book that is very readable like a story. It is perfect for narration/retelling.

I also recommend his &quot;The Stone Circle.&quot; Both books are a must read for New Enlgand horror lovers!"},{"Title":"Rough Beast","review":"I made the mistake of reading the first chapter of Gary Goshgarian's Rough Beast at work. This is NOT a book one puts down lightly. The Hazzards, the family caught up in an environmental tragedy, are sympathetic and believeable. Matty, the son who goes through horrific changes as the result of the pollution, is drawn with compassion, but also a clear-eyed look at the torture of his condition. And Jerry Mars, the consummate assassin, is a wonderfully shivery bad guy. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Rough Beast","review":"One major element in Goshgarian's writing that surfaces time and again is his amazing capacity to create real charcters that real people can identify with. Instead of letting action determine characters, in Rough Beast and others by Goshgarian, he creates tense situations one can't wait to see the characters react to. Another thing: few male authors write convincingly from the female point of view, but Rough Beast's main female character exemplifies the female perspective when confronted with the calamity circumstance brings upon her family. His scientific explanations also further the book's frightening edge by avoiding a plummet into psuedo-science. Goshgarian's eventual scientific explanations suggest real possibilities for a very real dilemma. Rough beast IS a cautionary tale. And this book keeps you guessing -- none of the predictablity typical of suspense thrillers.

The evil character Jerry Mars was quite twisted, and so fearless that he would introduce himself, not even making up an alias but using his real name, to his victims before killing them... The Boston background was pretty convincing. Either Gary Goshgarian lives here in Boston, or at least he did his homework. I wondered if this book was in any way inspired by the true story behind \\"A Civil Action\\", because they both take place in precisely the same region, with the same theme, etc. Being half of Italian descent myself, I was slightly taken aback at the portrayal of the Italian-American \\"goombahs\\" who gathered every weekend to sick their dogs on each other in an arena. Maybe that is an authentic subculture of the Italian-American experience, but I've lived around Boston for most of my life and I've never run into it.But that is a pretty minor point. Primarily this book deals intelligently with some of the issues raised by biological warfare, and really makes you feel the pain and confusion of some of the characters. It is remarkable well-written, considering the genre. Gary Goshgarian must have some kind of serious background in professional writing, it doesn't seem as though this level of skill is likely to be a one-shot deal.

This first entry in the series is frankly excellent, and a great deal more than I was led to believe.Maisie Dobbs is an unusualy main character. The daughter of a costermonger (he sells vegetables out of a cart) and a now-dead mother, she goes into service in the first decade of the 20th century, and is caught reading in the library of the rich people whose maid she is. Instead of throwing her out, the lady of the house arranges for her to be educated, eventually sending her to Cambridge. World War I intrudes, and Maisie eventually becomes a nurse on the Western Front. When the war ends, Maisie returns, scarred somewhat but able to resume her studies, and eventually is apprenticed to Maurice Blanche, a doctor and sometime \\"detective\\" who takes on problems and solves them. When he retires, Maisie takes on his practice, and goes to work.This first book is mostly an introduction to the series. The actual mystery itself takes up about 150 pages or so, with the middle of the book consisting of a large flashback that takes Maisie back to her entering Lady Rowan's service. It's interesting, but it's not really a mystery. It is, however, very interesting, and frankly the whole things is very well-constructed. I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Despite the author's suspiciously Harlequin-esque name, \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" was an enjoyable historical mystery (set in just post-WWI). Not bad for a first novel, though a bit slow moving at times. The sequel ('Birds of a Feather') was much better in terms of plot believability, villian, action, and emotional impact. Overall, a series to keep an eye on. Because of the time period and geographic location (London mostly), I kept expecting Lord Peter Wimsey to pop in for a cameo, but not even a mention of monocled noblemen graced the pages.This series uses history very much to its advantage. Many of the characters that Maisie encounters have been in some way altered by the Great War and their outlook on life is never the same."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"As several reviewers have noted, this book is a slow read, particularly for a mystery.But Winspear seems more interested in people and social developments than in mysteries.The book is punctuated by a LONG central section, a flashback, to Maisie's years as a nurse in WWI. The section is harrowing, and rightly so, because the book is about the horrifying effects on everyone of the war.As usual, her period details (1897-1929) are perfect, and her prose is notably crisper and less affected than in \\"The Messenger of Truth.\\"Her eye on emotions is profound, and her choreography and plotting are stunning.A warm and involving book, to which the mystery is really a footnote.There really are no \\"bad guys,\\" only people more and less shattered by war."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Delightful world war I story with several twists and compelling characters. I've already ordered the next book in the series. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first novel by Jacqueline Winspear. I couldn't put it down and read it over the New Year's weekend. The characters each have a distinct voice and Maisie won my heart. I also learned a lot about World War I. I heartily recommend this book.Alexis Powers, author"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"A friend recommended this book so I approached it with greater anticipation than it deserved. Like many other reviewers, I found the mystery to be obvious, Maisie to be annoyingly one-dimensional, Maurice's philosophical insights to be pretty inane and the denoument to be silly and derivative (calling to mind other stories with a similar set-up, but much better plot).The book had the feel of a Masterpiece Theatre program and I could almost hear the theme music and see the wonderful period costumes/cars/homes. However, the lack of depth in the writing, the minimal characterizations and skeletal plot would not have provided the substance that Masterpiece Theatre's best shows [such as UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS, which was the basis for several key elements of the plot here] have had.I agree with the reviewer who commented that the author had to get Enid off-stage because she would have upstaged the heroine. I felt that Billy was another excellent supporting character. When secondary characters are more interesting than the main character, the author needs to do some more work."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I bought this book for two reasons: one, I love this genre, and two, I love anything set during WWI. Here's the problem with Maisie Dobbs, though -- the story/mystery isn't interesting. Maisie herself is an interesting and fun character, especially set during this time, when women weren't allowed the freedoms she enjoys. The &quot;mystery&quot; itself, however, isn't really a mystery at all. We don't really see Maisie figure out what's going on at The Retreat; we learn how she figured it out once it's all over, through a conversation she has with two other characters. I guess this author never heard the adage &quot;show, don't tell.&quot; The reader doesn't really have the pleasure of sleuthing with Maisie, because before you know it, she's solved the mystery. Maybe the answer fell from heaven for all I know, because I didn't see how and when she figured it out. This, to me, is laziness on the part of the author. If you're going to write a mystery, go through the trouble of actually writing a mystery, where the reader gets to see and experience how the sleuth leanrs what's going on. On top of this, I found the author's writing below par. The dialogue is pat and simple, with Maisie's father saying things like &quot;I could never be disappointed in you&quot; or &quot;You be careful, now.&quot; Terrible. I found myself literally skipping paragraphs, especially toward the end, hoping something interesting would happen. No such luck. If you want a good mystery set in the U.K., read PD James, a true master of her craft. Sorry, Maisie!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"If you did - well into your teens - you'll love Maisie Dobbs. If you started to get a little bored by smug perfect Nancy and the lack of characterization by, say, third or fourth grade, you might want to skip this.After reading a couple of great reviews from sources I trust, I bought this book with great excitement. The author had been compared to Vera Brittain and Dorothy Sayers; in my world, there is no higher compliment.Unfortunately, the only thing the author has in common with Brittain and Sayers is that she employs the same setting - England between the wars. Honestly, I can't think what the complimentary bookpress reviewers were thinking - did they read the same book? Does the author's husband employ them? I'd love to know.Anyway, into this wonder setting, the author plops a Nancy Drew-mannequin of a heroine (many pages devoted to special, special Maisie, who may be slightly intimidated by those of a higher class, but who inspires only love, admiration, devotion, and support from both the toffs and the working class heroes she encounters), new-age philosophy (special, sensitive Maisie intuits answers from the atmosphere), and a crazy mess of Brit-slang from every decade of the previous and current centuries. All this rendered in awkward, sophomoric language, topped by a cringe-inducing ending. (If only all sociopathic killers could be disarmed and reduced to sobbing bundles by a detective singing a war song!)The annoying part is the plot, the setting, the subtext of the post-war malaise are fascinating. I wish the author had employed a real writer to realize them. What a waste."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"As others have noted, I thought there would be more excitement and more discovery. And the very end -- not to give it away, but I would have just expected more effort on behalf of her one true love."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"After reading reviews, I purchased the first four books of the Maisie Dobbs series and am forcing myself to finish the third and fourth. Maisie is a private investigator, solving cases with her mind powers and her very calming manner, which is pretty much the way the books seem to be--too calm and boring! I found my mind wandering away from the reading, as the plots are too slow. The book starts out with Maisie being a servant with a lot of personal attention from her employers, her service in WW1, and her starting her own private investigating service. I feel more could have been written about these parts of her life, instead of sitting down constantly for a cup of tea. A good part of the book is Maisie taking trains or \\"motoring\\" around to interview different people, and to solve a case by singing a song? So disappointing! I liked some of the characters, such as Billy Beale and Enid, and enough wasn't written about them to make the Maisie Dobbs book more interesting. Even though it is supposed to have researched into World War I, I didn't learn much except that a lot of lives were lost and just about every family Maisie encountered had lost sons or were left with injuries, and while she served as a nurse, all that evolved was that she was cold in her tent and was injured, but nothing was written about the explosion that injured her or incapacitated her love interest. Perhaps this is a \\"young adult\\" book? Just too simple for me."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"My husband and I actually raced home to see who could get to the book first. Why, why would we start reading the same book at nearly the same time? He loved it. I loved it. True this first book spends more time aquainting you with Maisie than it does unravelling a mystery but that was just fine with us. Very entertaining and we are both looking forward to tagging along on our dear Maisie's adventures. FYI - a man-friend enthusiastically suggested this series to me :)"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This book is the first of a series. It starts slowing drawing the reader into the world of Maise Dobbs. The writer creates a world and background for other Maise Dobbs stories.

FOUND IT VERY INFORMATIVE AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE CANT WAIT FOR HER NEXT BOOK.I HAVE NOW READ THEM ALL BUT THE NEW ONE."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is the first of the 'Maisie Dobbs' series of period mystery novels. As the story opens it is 1929 and Maisie is setting up her private detective office in a quiet middle class neighborhood in London. Her first client is a man who is convinced that his wife is having an affair and wants Maisie to find the evidence. Although she has reservations about the case Maisie agrees and soon discovers that the case brings back memories from her own troubled past. The story then flashes back to 1910 when Maisie's father places her, a motherless 13 year old, into service as a kitchen maid. We learn how Maisie managed to bridge the almost insurmountable distance between upstairs and downstairs through the generosity of her employer, Lady Rowan. Maisie is given opportunities far beyond her wildest dreams, opportunities that she fully intended to use to the fullest when, like many other young people around her, her plans were put on hold by WWI. She trained as a nurse and was sent to the front where she saw the horrors of war first hand. The story then returns to 1929 where Maisie discovers that for some the scars left by war are hidden inside.This is a very promising series. Maisie is a charming character, sweet and caring to her extended family but tough enough to carve out a space uniquely her own in a changing world. The author has taken characters that easily could be mere cardboard figures and has begun to make them come to life. She has taken the necessary business of establishing her series back story and presented in an usual and interesting manner.This is a great beginning to what looks to be a charming series of period cozies."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Fell in love with Maisie and am looking forward to many more novels to come. Extremely well researched, and a great intro into a time period much us forget about with all that came after in the second world war. I have sought to learn more about this time period because this book sparked my interest. Mystery and historical fiction all in one."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Combine the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, and other genres like this and you've got Masie Dobbs."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I love Ms. Winspear's characters, she really takes you back in time and makes you feel like you are there. Great mystery with that little something extra!!!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Thoroughly researched, delightfully written, and drawn from the author's family history, I found Maisie Dobbs to be a lovely read. The author presents a beautifully-rendered portrait of a very special time in modern history, seen through the eyes of a believable, brilliant-yet-very-human young woman. Ms. Winspear defines her characters clearly, yet with compassion. I'm happily awaiting the arrival of the next in the series in my mailbox!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is a wonderful book. While there is a mystery at hand, the rich historical details make this a must read. (You can see the synopsis in other reviews.) I will say the way the human consequences of class division, the first world war and it's aftermath are handled makes this not only a mystery but a first rate historical novel. The characters are richly drawn and people we become invested in- I can't wait to read the rest of this series!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Read many of the one, two, three starred reviews and couldn't argue with them. It was easy to see their points. But I enjoyed my time with Maisie and her fellow travelers. All the characters, even the bad guy are sympathetic. The real villan is WWI and its horrors. It was enough evil for the book. Winspear didn't have add much more. What comes through in the novel is the author's passion for the time and her admiration for those who lived through it. I'm not the type to cry while reading but there were a few times I got an ache in my chest, especially the scenes with Maisie and her Dad."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs is an absorbing book featuring a complex and admirable character. The author creates a darkly believable post-WW1 world, where nurse Maisie becomes a combination PI and psychologist. I recommend the whole Maisie Dobbs series, and look forward to the next installment."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In fairness to readers of mysteries, while Maisie Dobbs has several strong points, the mystery is obvious and requires little detecting. Winspear has created an interesting heroine and she writes dialogue fairly well. Her characters are believable though unchanging, and love runs strongly throughout the story.But mystery plots are notoriously difficult to create and Winspear lacks this talent. So I found the story charming and the historical setting enlightening, but not worth reading as a mystery. I believe the same can be said of several other recent \\"mystery\\" authors: Janet Evanovich et al. They write amusing and/or charming novels but cannot construct a good mystery."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I liked this book. Really, I did. The writing is wonderful. But I was a little confused about what kind of book it wanted to be. Was it a mystery? Or the story of Maisie's experiences as a nurse in WWI? Either one would have been great, but to start the mystery and then have an extended flashback to her childhood and experiences leading up to where the book started was, for me, too big a break in the narrative. But I liked each part, so I read on. It was kind of like having two good books in one. And both parts finished in an unexpected way, which I couldn't help but like."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"What an interesting, intricate character is Maisie Dobbs! I read the second book of this series first, then went back to read this one. The flashback, revealing Maisie as a poor but brilliant girl, being granted (in a somewhat fairy-godmother style) education and opportunity, and then seeing what she does with it, is a charming backstory that makes Maisie so endearing! The period tension of England during WWI and before WWII is very well done. The element of the science of Psychology, in its infancy, being applied to detective work adds yet another layer to this series.Loved it! Read all the books! I'm waiting for more!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"When I see a book on so many favorite lists all over the internet and all over Amazon.com I figure this many people can't be wrong. So I read the book in question and nine times out of ten I love the book. And that is definitely what happened with Maisie Dobbs. Loved it! Already recommended it to friends and family and they loved it too. And it's the start of a series! At this point I am part way throught the third book in the series and I love it, love it, love it. If you're considering reading this book, you definitely should read it."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I have become an instant Maisie Dobbs fan, to the extent that I ordered copies of older titles through Amazon.com. It combines mystery and suspense with humane sensitivity and a touch of the supernatural. The research appears to be excellent and the writing style is marvelous. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This book introduces us to Maisie Dobbs and it is where you begin to fall in love with her. The period of pre WWI comes alive in a very personal way. The other 2 books that follow this one continue to bring that period alive and you see Maisie Dobbs grow as a detective. Oh yes, the twist and turns in this mystery will keep you reading!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I wouldn't classify myself as a mystery reader. However, I stumbled onto the Mary Russell books three years ago as a result of a book club recommendations, and have found myself very carefully choosing mysteries in the same genre - strong female characters, different time period. I picked up two series at the recommendation of Amazon reader reviews - the Fremont Jones books and this series. I have not been disappointed with either Fremont or Maisy. But would have to say Maisy Dobbs is a much stronger series - and less frilly than Fremont. Once I started this - I couldn't put it down. Loaned it to my mother - and she quickly read it and told all her friends, declaring it her favorite for the year. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"As told through the eyes of a female detective, this story unfolds with a sort of Upstairs-Downstairs, rags to respectability subplot, and provides in graphic history of WW I from a perspective 10 years after the war. It shows how lives were destroyed or altered by this cataclysm. The main character is engaging, the writing is crisp, and the insights into the human condition are profound, and delivered with a light touch."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"While Maisie Dobbs is certainly less &quot;literary&quot; than &quot;The English Patient,&quot; in the course of an entertaining, mystery-driven read, it gives us new perspectives on the impact of the Great War and the suffering it caused. Who knew that when maimed young men returned from the front, they were made uncomfortable by &quot;normal&quot; society and sought refuge in camps where they could be among their own? The book also introduces a character like no other. Maisie is a woman of her time in that she is riding the crest of change (the work women performed during the war changed things for her gender). But as a sleuth, she relies on her highly trained powers of intuition much like Sherlock Holmes relies on his ability to observe and deduce. Oh yeah, if you liked Gosford Park and Upstairs Downstairs, you'll eat up the back story in this book, which tells of Maisie's early life below stairs and occupies a large portion of the story in flashback. In all, Maisie Dobbs is a charmer and a page turner that leaves one wishing it was a hundred pages longer."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I started reading Maisie Dobbs and ended reading all three book in the series in one week-end. I am now sad that I don't have another one of Winspear's books to read. I have recommended this series to everyone I know who likes to read. Although the books do have some mystery elements, the mystery is not the focus. The third in the series--Pardonable Lies--was the least satisfying, but it was still good."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Jacqueline Winspear's historical mystery Maisie Dobbs begins in 1929, just over ten years after the end of the Great War, when its eponymous protagonist takes on her first case as an independent \\"cerebral investigator.\\" Maisie's client comes to her with an ostensibly straightforward domestic problem, but the case leads Maisie into a greater mystery involving a home for disfigured veterans--a path that leads Maisie also to reexamine her own war-time experiences.In a lengthy digression from her \\"modern\\" mystery in the book's midsection, Maisie's past is fleshed out. The daughter of a costermonger, Maisie went into service in 1910, at the age of thirteen, in the home of a woman who would become her benefactress. Maisie was tutored by a friend of her employer's, a Yoda-like character who spouted Eastern wisdom and taught his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e a sort of holistic approach to detection. Later, after a brief stint at Cambridge, Maisie served as a nurse in the blood and muck of France and was courted by a charming doctor with whom she had danced once in England prior to shipping out. When the book's narrative returns to Maisie's present what we now know of her past renders her experiences in 1929 more poignant.Maisie Dobbs is a nicely written book and a gentle read, despite its subject matter. In large part the book is successful, though Maisie's apparent ability to understand the emotions of others by adopting their posture strains credibility. The character of Maisie's tutor too, the seemingly omniscient Maurice Blanche, does not quite come to life. More literary than genre fiction--if one is to categorize the book by those unspecific terms--Maisie Dobbs does not in fact offer a compelling mystery. Its focus is rather on the characters Winspear is introducing and on recreating the feel of the period between the wars, in showing, in particular, the effect the First World War had on those who lived through it. But with this back story established in this first book, it will be interesting to see how the Maisie Dobbs mystery series proceeds, whether our heroine's powers of detection will be tested in subsequent installments by mysteries sufficiently gripping to carry a book themselves.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I wanted to love this book. I love the era, I love mysteries and I'm a WW1 buff; this should have been the start of a long friendship. There were three big problems though. First, the unusual nature of Maisie's work - psychologist and investigator - gives an ample opening to lots of new age (anachronism alert!) babble. If one more character talked about \\"feeling something here\\" with their hand somewhere on their own torso I was going to give them something to really feel. Maurice spouts the most pyscho-swill but Maisie muses about giving people \\"space\\" and giving the past \\"a voice\\" too.Second, Winspear relies on coincidence too often. The mystery genre is guilty of this in general but where having yet another murder take place as soon as Miss Marple hits town is forgivable, having nearly every key development rely on coincidence is too much.Third, the ending. I was willing to forgive all of this until the last 20 or so pages when the story went right off the rails.*****SPOILER ALERT****Our heroine is hiding in the brush, watching as her helper is about to hanged by a madman while watched by a potentially violent crowd of mutilated war vets. Maisie has nothing but her wits, her training and her Victorinox penknife to save the man. What does she do?She sings.Out loud.She sings an old war song about battlefield nurses and marches toward the madman.At first I thought Maisie had a brilliant plan to disarm the lot by throwing them into fits of hysterical laughter but, no. The war vets join in. Within seconds a fine old campfire sing-a-long is in progress and Maisie saves the day.Unbelievable. With all her education and experience Maisie can't think of anything better to do? And, with obvious talent, neither can Winspear? Tack on an ending in which all loose ends are quickly tied up and you have a major disappointment.That said I'm still rooting for Maisie and Winspear. I've bought the second book in the series and I'm hoping that the author will relax, rein in the new age silliness, stop the singing, and let Maisie be the interesting resourceful heroine she could be."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Over the years, I've read a number of excellent \`first' novels followed by mediocre second, third, etc. novels. Hopefully, Jacqueline Winspear will be able to match her excellent first novel MAISIE DOBBS with the future series of stories she promises. Winspear has created an extremely likeable and interesting heroine and complemented her with a unique supporting cast of characters as well as an intriguing plot or two. With the exception of one relatively implausible scene and an exactitude of description that at times makes her tale somewhat formulaic and distracting (do I really care about the color of the little bows on the client's wife's shoes?), I found this book a good and interesting read.Maisie Dobbs \`exists' in the late 1920s, but the book contains a good deal of material describing life in the Belle Epoch and the period during and immediately after WWI. The horrendous loss of millions of men in WWI left women like Maisie facing an uncertain life without the prospect of a mate and children. What could one do but become a strong single woman who earned her own keep. .Winspear deftly explains though her somewhat deconstructed tale how Maisie's young life shaped her latter life-where we find her at the start and ending of the tale. Maisie came to have an understanding of psychology and the occult, and she turned to medicine as a career choice she abandoned after the war. Maisie uses forensics in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes, an understanding of human nature in the Miss Marple sense, and has a penchant for getting into tight situations ala Harriet Vane. She also drives a \`motor' Capt. Hastings would have adored. I like Maisie Dobbs and I hope to see her in print again very soon."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs is the type of character who comes alive during a book and lives on in the imagination of the reader. I regretted reaching the last page and having to close the book, I so enjoyed the company of this independent woman of such essential goodness, insight and compassion. Strangely, this novel captured my imagination just as THE LITTLE PRINCESS did when I was very young. I was dismayed to read some of the negative reviews and felt compelled to cast my own vote in favor of this intelligent and unique novel. The author does a superb job of capturing pre-World War I England, and what it must have felt like to have been an intellectually ravenous young girl with limited prospects due to the rigid class structure. Maisie creates a brighter future for herself just as the class system in England was undergoing tectonic shifts due to the War. In a subtle but effective manner, the author conveys the enormity of the War's impact on every man, woman and child."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Winspear's Maisie Dobbs is a rather predictable and perhaps a bit juvenile. But it is well written and if the reader does not come to the book with great expectations, they will likely find themselves pleasantly entertained. Maisie faces great odds but overcomes them, owning up that she gets very tired sometimes and even once or twice, a bit cranky. A bit too Horatio Alger with a dash of Dudley Do-Right, but still entertaining particularly for the distaff audience.An excellent but less charitable earlier review mentioned that the construction of the plot involves a large section of exposition that is simply background and does not advance the mystery in any way. While this is quite true, I have come to like the author's audacity in using a non-forumalic construction. While it might not pass muster at a writers workshop, the author constructs the story as she sees fit, and does so in a way that keeps you reading. It is not perfect, but it is perfectly readable. The price of this is the pacing of the mystery portion of the story. But it is not so great a mystery after all.The procedural aspects are pleasant, with a very feminine viewpoint, and some eye for the little details. While I may not purchase another of the Dobbs series novels, I think many people will."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In England, 1929, Maisie Dobbs sets herself up as a private investigator in London. Previously she has worked as a housemaid, as well as a nurse during the Great War in France. The country is still reeling from the shock of the catastrophic loss of almost a whole generation of young men. Her first case involves a man who suspects his wife of infidelity. Investigation of the case leads Maisie to The Retreat, a convalescent home for severely wounded soldiers. However, things at The Retreat are not all that they seem to be.Jacqueline Winspear manages to lend a strong sense of reality to the historical setting of her debut novel. Interestingly, the construction of the novel is in three parts. The first part introduces us to the heroine and her first investigation. The second part of the book takes us back ten years before the war and Maisie's upward mobility from the position of a housemaid to student to nurse. While part three concerns the matter related to The Retreat. Without a doubt the strength of the book is the vivid realism of the descriptions of the people and places of England between the wars. Not since Charles Todd created his wonderful Rutledge series have we been treated to such an auspicious and original new historical series of this time period. The book's major weakness is the tepid and predictable mystery of The Retreat.This is a book that will receive much accolades and should be on the short list of all the major awards. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Right from the start, I must confess to enjoying a good mystery. I will read almost any type as long as it is not uber-violent and/or sadistic (the news provides enough of these types). If an author throws in an interesting time period (Medieval England, pre-Revolution Russia) or historical characters, well then I am hooked! So reading the reviews for Maisie Dobbs, the beginning of a new mystery series, it seemed perfect. Set in the years after World War I in England, I was looking forward to a satisfying read. And at first, I must admit, I enjoyed the book but within fifty pages, I became seriously annoyed. After one hundred pages, the annoyance grew and by the last twenty pages annoyance turned to disbelief. I finished the book and re-read the glowing reviews and tried to find out what soured me on a book which so many others seemed to enjoy.In one word, it was Maisie Dobbs herself. When I was younger, the idea of an \\"ideal\\" character was somewhat appealing. However, as I grew older and realized that even Gandhi must have had some flaws, I can no longer abide a perfect character in a novel. And Maisie is perfect. Absolutely, 100% perfect. And everybody loves her. Every single character she interacts with is willing to do almost anything for Maisie. No one tells her no, no one impedes her objectives in any way. As a matter of fact, every character exists solely to help Maisie achieve her goals. Does she help some along the way? Perhaps, but Maisie's smug satisfaction of doing so brings Maisie the most happiness.As an introductory book to a new series, I expected a lot of character development and perhaps a little less on the mystery at hand. But this was ridiculous...there didn't seem to be a mystery. There was so little to solve and the reveal at the end of the book is one of the most annoying I have read in a long time. Because when Maisie explains how she knew what was going on, you learn all this work she did that was never revealed to the reader. And the only character developed was Maisie. The villain of the story? If he appeared on five pages of the book, I would be surprised. The denouncement? Ludicrous. The final chapter? If I had not been reading the e-book version, I would thrown it across the room."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs has so much potential. With the intelligence for bigger and greater things, she rises from a house maid to a university student. After getting caught in the private library of her employers, the eccentric Maurice Blanche teaches Maisie his worldly philosophy. Then World War I starts and she enlists as a nurse to the injured and dying English boys in France. After the war, she becomes an investigator and her first case unearths the hidden wounds of those who have experienced loss during the war. She also must face her own demons about the war. The prose was quite choppy at times with short chapters that provided the reader with felt more like a short glimpse, rather than a developed storyline. Also the way Maisie disarms the villain is quite unrealistic, if not hokey. Finally, the ending seems a bit forced. I would bet it was added only in retrospect to allow Maisie to feel personally connected to the subject of her investigation."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I got this book after hearing a reasonably good review of it on NPR. Not many pages into it I wondered how in the world it found its way into print. The dust jacket mentions the author's long career in publishing so I suppose it was through her connections that this garbage got published.Rarely will you read such wooden, amateurish, mono-dimensional prose. Want a sample? Midway through p.18: (Here Maisie is apparently staking out a house): \\"....a man emerged from a neighboring house and walked in her direction. She quickly feigned interest in a window box filled with crocus buds peeking through moist soil. Their purple shoots seem to test the air to see if it was conducive to a full-fledged flowering. The man passed. Maisie still had ....\\"Is that hysterical?!Another embarassingly funny piece of dialogue: (on p. 34, where Maisie is answering a question from the building handyman about one of Maisie's clients): \\"Billy, yes, Mrs. Scott is a client. But you know better than to expect a comment from me, don't you?\\" (Keep in mind, Billy is a grown man, not a 6 year old.) Next in this conversation Maisie asks Billy if he knows anything about a certain person, and then tells him he must keep it confidential (which is itself an odd statement for Maisie to make since she's the one asking for information). Winspear's response from Billy is: \\"'Nod's as good as a wink.' Billy tapped the side of his nose to emphasize the integrity of any information he might receive - he could keep a secret.\\"Good grief, this book is pathetic.This whole story stinks, period. I'm not sure what audience Winspear is targeting (Barbara Cartland-style detective stories???), but let's hope this \\"series\\" goes no further."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"IT SHOWS WHAT WOMEN WENT THROUGH DURING THE FIRST WW AND IT IS AMAZING THAT THEY STILL WERE DIGNIFIED BUT IT ALSO SHOWED WHERE WOMEN COULD ATTEND COLLEGE AND BECOME SOMETHING MORE, AND I MEAN MUCH MORE.

If people who bought Elizabeth George novels as well as this they must have been sorely disappointed. I won't make the mistake of selecting a book on this basis again."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I've been meaning to read this book for a long time. MAISIE DOBBS made quite a sensation when it first came out in 2003, eventually winning the prestigious Agatha award for best first novel. It was also nominated for the Edgar award for best novel (the main category), one of only two debut novels in the history of the Edgar awards to be so nominated. Needless to say, my expectations were quite high for this book.My expectations were easily met. This book is remarkably well written debut and features an extaordinary likable protagonist. I normally don't like historical mysteries, but Winspear did a great job of making early 20th century England come alive for me. This novel features a cast of fascinating characters that I can't wait to meet again in future installments. All of the characters in the book were three-dimensional human beings that you could imagine existing in real life.This book admittedly does not have a very strong mystery story; the main purpose of the novel is to introduce the main character and her life history. If you're looking for a strong mystery instead, you may want to try one of the later novels in this series (like BIRDS OF A FEATHER)."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Winspear does an outstading job in three areas. First, the accuracy of her historical account. Second, her characterizations are excellent. She describes each of her characters, both main and secondary, with such force, you feel you know them personally. And saving the best for last, her writing skill is superb. The ebb and flow of her ability to paint a picture with words is unsurpassed. It was a joy to read Masie Dobbs as well as Birds of a Feather. The only downside to Winspears books are the length. She takes too long in some areas to accomplish her goal. But you get through it without much pain because the writing style is such a pleasure."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The author has created an interesting character in an interesting time - as seen from this time and place. The book is totally engaging and leaves me wanting to know more about the character. I eagerly await the next one."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I read the most recent book in this series first, loved it, and went back to the beginning with this one. Well written and a bit different. Will look forward to the fourth in the series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is the first of 3 in the series, altho' the 3rd is not yet out. If you like Anne Perry and Charles Todd, you will love Maisie Dobbs. The setting is post WWI England, with a strong female detective. There are wonderful side-plots, other great supporting characters, and generally very good story line. Very, very enjoyable, and I hope the author can continue the series for many books!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Set in 1929 and the first in a projected series featuring World War I nurse turned London private-eye Maisie Dobbs, Winspear's novel explores the lingering trauma suffered by mutilated war veterans. Initially taking on what seems to be an infidelity case, Maisie is lead to a home for convalescent veterans run by a man whose charisma seems mesmerizing. Beset by her own demons, Maisie is drawn to the place, curious about the men - most with devastating facial damage - who give up the world to live in this closed-off compound.While cult tactics are familiar to modern readers, Winspear does a good job of presenting Maisie's investigation as a tentative, but dogged foray into the unknown. Maisie is a careful, driven character with plenty of inner scarring from her own war experience. Winspear artfully presents the psychological effect the war had on its generation and the changes being wrought on society. Its flaws are a long middle section detailing Maisie's rise from lower-orders poverty, thanks to a titled benefactor and a wise mentor, and a jarring ending. But these are first-novel flaws, which won't stand in the way of a beguiling heroine and great series premise."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"While reading \\"Maisie Dobbs,\\" I was impressed by the author's careful research of her story's milieu. The environment and attitudes of the characters seemed to fit their time period rather than ours, with no jarring instances of late twentieth century stereotypes, as is all too often the case in period stories.However, I still found myself dissatisfied by the book. There were some instances of clunky prose that could have been taken care of by a bit of judicious editing, but they weren't the problem. The real problem was that the author told us what was happening to Maisie, but couldn't seem to find a way to do so with any kind of dramatic tension. The operative word was \\"soothing.\\" Even the descriptions of the soldiers' injuries during the war were written in such a way that they lost any dramatic impact they might have added to the story. Plus all the characters seemed too good to be true, and I never felt that there was any possibility of failure on the heroine's part.Perhaps the author was trying to give us too much background information in her first story. \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" reminds me of Anne Perry's new book, \\"No Graves As Yet,\\" because it is the start of a new series and the author's main purpose seems to be setting the stage for future stories. If that is the case, I will withhold my final judgment on Maisie until her next adventure."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Full disclosure: I didn't finish the book. I just couldn't. I have to have some connection with a complex hero, but Maisie was not that hero. I kept waiting for some character development, some inner conflict. No. Maisie is a two-bit psychoanalyst, and a very boring one at that. Before reading this book, I read Bonfire of the Vanities. it was a beautifully-wrought, complex masterpiece with fully realized characters. I couldn't fathom wasting my time on Maisie when there are so many amazing books out there to be read.Adieu, Maisie!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I fell in love with Maisie Dobbs' character right away. The author does an incredible job showing what Maisie's like by starting with a stranger's initial impression of her. She immediately comes across as capable, confident but down-to-earth, and very striking. As we go on and get more of her history, she began to remind me of Francie from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn with her constant desire to read and learn, no matter the hardships of her circumstance. And really, what bookworm can resist a protagonist who shares their love of reading?Maisie's crime solving style also appealed to me. She depends very much on an understanding of human nature, a method I've loved in my mystery solvers ever since my first Agatha Christie books. Particularly interesting to me was the way she mimicked people's body language to try to figure out what they might be feeling. She also paid great attention to detail, a trait the author shared. The many details felt distracting at first, but that feeling disappeared quickly once I got drawn into the story.There were a few problems that didn't go away as well, particularly where the book clashed with my expectations of a mystery. First, there was a large section in the middle devoted to Maisie's stint as a nurse during the war. By the time we got there, I was very curious about what happened and excited to read that part of the book. Sadly, it dragged on too long and made the book only half mystery with the other half a war story that distracted me from the main plot line.Another problem was the feel of the novel. Solving the mystery never felt very urgent to me. I was a little curious, but never on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened next. And there wasn't a clear cut crime and suspect list as in Agatha Christie's novels, so I never in found myself trying to solve the mystery. Instead of a straightforward whodunit, the questions here was whether there was a crime at all. Additionally, the ending, where all the action took place was very short and rushed. The ending didn't feel very conclusively, happily solved either. Overall, it was a sadder, more pensive feel than I like in my mysteries. Give me a clear cut crime and a feel-good identification of the bad guy over this any day. Of course, that's not to say I won't be reading more of the series - the writing and the main character are too good for me to give up hope that future books will have more defined crimes and conclusively happy endings."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The book, Maisie Dobbs, was suggested by a litblogger, Alyce of \\"At Home With Books\\" and her suggestion proved to be an excellent recommendation.The author, Jacqueline Winspear was born in the UK and moved to the USA in 1990. Maisie Dobbs is her first novel and her book received several awards and many positive reviews. It is the first of a series, nine books have been written so far.The story is set in the UK at the time just before, during and after the First World War and follows the journey of a young woman who is discovered, nurtured and mentored by a couple of influential people because she has shown a high degree of intelligence and diligence. She has been plucked from her lowly beginnings by her wealthy employer and mentored by an elderly philosopher detective type character named Maurice Blanche.Very early in the story we are introduced to Maisie and soon we can see she is going to be an interesting character and we can also see the writing is clear, enjoyable and leads us forward in such a way that we want to know more. The backdrop of the story gives us an insight into how life was for British society prior to World War One and how it was a social leveller. The war, as wars do, disrupted society to such a point whereby people of the lower classes and women, not necessarily in that order, were able to reach their potential if they were prepared to work very very hard, if they had a lot of intelligence and most importantly, if they had luck on their side.Maisie Dobbs character reminds me of Hester Latterly of the William Monk series by Anne Perry, another cosy mystery. This story is told by an outside observer who is everywhere and knows what's going on, it is written as a third person narrative and it is sprinkled throughout with quotes of wisdom similar to Wilkie Collin's The Moonstone and Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Here is an example of a quote that particularly drew my attention: \\"only when we have a respect for time will we have learned something of the art of living\\". I found myself highlighting several passages as I moved forward in the story.A smile remained with me for the whole book because I really like the character, a caring, honourable intelligent woman who loved learning and books. The back-story appealed very much to me because it seemed to be very well researched and real. For me, learning something while I'm being entertained by good story telling is the very best of reading experiences.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good well written cosy mystery set in the UK. One that has been written in recent times which results in language that is easily accessible and a plot that is not dated.So all you lovers of comfortable interesting mysteries with good characters. Try this one. I think you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"after reading the effusions here on amazon, I was frankly expecting more. The writing and plot construction as well as the idealization of the protagonist betray amateur-level writing. Good theme. I'm sorry I couldn't like it more."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This first Maisie Dobbs book was obviously just a warm up. You should skip it and go right on to the second book in the series, BIRDS OF A FEATHER. It has a much better mystery.This book contains barely any mystery at all. Once Maisie goes after the sinister man running the Retreat, the pieces come together with laughable ease. And you will not believe the big musical \\"finale\\" where the power of song converts the villain into a big, blubbering baby. I mean, really! Charlie Manson was a big Beatles fan, but if his victims had burst into a chorus of \\"Yellow Submarine\\" he probably just would have rolled his eyes and kept right on stabbing away.What saves Winspear as a writer is just that her characters are so wonderful and kind. I wanted to hear so much more about Priscilla, Maisie's sexy and fun-loving girl friend from Oxford. She should have a novel of her own, or at least be reunited with Maisie for a big mystery! And I think it was a mistake to keep mentioning Lady Rowan's son James, and all his \\"problems\\" and never allow the man to speak for himself. Bring him back too!BIRDS OF A FEATHER tells you everything you need to know about Maisie Dobbs. Begin there!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected. Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and read Kant at night. i find it nearly impossible to believe. Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time. She has powerful friends. In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew. There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good. Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book. Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults. At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach. Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me. Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie. I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series. If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King. if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series. And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"For some reason I thought that this book was going to be more mystery then it actually turned out to be. What started out interesting quickly lost its spark for me when it turned out to be more about Maisie's early life and less about the investigation that she was hired for.Instead of heading off to college as Maisie had planned, this rather inquisitive fourteen year old enters service of Lady. The Lady of the house is rather taken with Maisie's intelligence and arranges for her to be tutored, and with good fortune, Maisie qualifies for Cambridge. Unfortunately, the college cannot keep her interest and within a year, Maisie enters the World War I as a nurse.Somehow, this is where the story jumps, actually the whole book jumps, but the war is over and Maisie is opening up her own private investigation business. She is asked to look into a rather discreet affair that quickly turns into her investigating the goings on at the Retreat, a remote convalescent home has some rather underhanded business dealings that take advantage of the injured returning soldiers.Overall, the story is not bad, just not what I was expecting and with so much back story, the whole thing just lost its initial charm."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I've enjoyed all four books to date in the Maisie Dobbs series. Winspear is meticulous about doing her homework about the period in question (World War I and its aftermath), and the heroine, Maisie is smart and engaging.That said, not all four books are of equal quality. For my taste, this one (#1) is the best of the bunch, with #4 (Messenger of Truth) close on its heels. The plot to #2 (Birds of a Feather) was a bit too predictable, while #3 (Pardonable Lies) suffered from the opposite flaw - too many convoluted subplots, with a little too much reliance on deus ex machina to help resolve them.However, these are minor quibbles about a series which is overall very enjoyable.But, Ms Winspear, here we are at the end of 4 books already, and the ongoing celibacy of the heroine is starting to bother me. How should I put this delicately? It's time to allow Maisie some chance at fulfillment in a consummated romantic relationship, and not keep her consigned to the emotional limbo where she appears to have been trapped in for several books now."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I absolutely loved Maisie Dobbs. The sense of time and place were very well done. I only caught one problem, when she dialed a phone number. Other than that everything seemed authentic and true to the times. The characterizations were fully rounded and the storyline was compelling, especially in the background flashbacks. As this is the first in a series, I am really anxious to read the next installment. I think British detectives are the best!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"While this novel has numerous flaws, what saves it (at least for me) is the way it is constructed. The writer works back and forth in time and place without losing sight of a satisfying finale.We see Maisie first in 1929, setting up a detective agency that seems sure to fail. Her first case is uninteresting on the outside, following a woman thought to be having an affair.Then we go back to before the War to End All Wars, when Maisie is poor and age 13, entering \\"service\\" with a wealthy London family. The author continues on that timeline through Maisie's education and entering college, volunteering for nursing duties, and through much of the war--but leaving out one crucial scene.Finally, we return to 1929, the result of Maisie's looking into a home for severely wounded soldiers--and her parallel experience in the war.All this works quite well. The war seems real enough, and London feels right, both in the 1920s and before. Where the novel trips over itself is in the one dimensional characters. For example, Maisie's father is Joe Gargery reincarnated, a costermonger with a heart of gold. In Dickens, as Pip becomes more educated he is ashamed of Joe and then comes to realize that Joe is superior to all the snooty Herbert Pockets of the world. But Maisie maintains a straight line dedication to her Dad, to the point that he is simply a faceless horsecart driver.Other characters are equally flat: Maisie's cockney assistant, Lady Rowan, Maisie's tutor, etc. etc. If only the writer had worked more on the characters, given them some contradictions, perhaps, this would have been a much better work.Some of the writing is annoying, the \\"tendrils\\" of hair that keep escaping from beneath Maisie's cloche. I personally got tired of those tendrils and wanted to snip them. Then there is the anachronistic phrase \\"too much on her plate.\\" What next? Will Maisie become \\"tasked\\" and even \\"pulsed\\"?Nonetheless, the novel is worth reading for the plotting only and always with the hope that future Maisie books will correct the flaws."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Recommended by my favorite bookshopkeeper, the book is a period piece, set in post WWI. Reluctant to read what would surely be a dull and boring novel, I soon found myself intrigued and ensconced. So much so that I have even begun researching the Great War at the library (in my spare time!). The heroine, Maisie Dobbs, is a believable character, both wonderfully smart and also flawed. The author's descriptions of the time and place are so vivid and interesting, even the dialects and costumes are real and true to life. What a fabulous book. I'm recommending it to everyone I know...man, woman and child."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This book was nominated by the Edgar and Agatha Committees for the simple reason that it's worthy of a nomination. Very well-written and plotted, with a reminder of Anne Perry's Thomas Pitt novels where a member of London's high society is quite helpful to some in the lower classes.As a backdrop, it furnishes the devastating effect of World War I on England, before, during, and especially after the 'Great War'. The characters, especially Maisie, are well-delineated, the surprise being that so much can be written and accomplished in but a relatively short book. And yes, there is a mystery, not in the gory bang-you're-dead manner, but in a civilized manner, one relevant to the horror of the War and its lasting effect on individuals, families, and society itself."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs was a pretty good vacation read for me. But, on reflection, I feel a bit let down by it.Foremost, the central mystery is no mystery. If you've read detective fiction before, you'll spot it a mile off.The novel tells the tale of a predictibly plucky heroine who pulls herself up by the bootstraps aided by a loving father (who is the perfect manifestation of Electra complex wish fulfillment), an intellectual mentor, and a benevolent suffragette patroness. She conquers the rigors of philosophy and qualifies for Cambridge's Girton College in her spare time as a char-woman. She becomes a war nurse and (you guessed it) has a tragic love-affair...The book feels like it was written by a focus group of 18-49 year old female mystery readers. It fails not in giving them everything they might want in a mystery: period detail, flawless heroine, romantic complication, fantasy father, etc.My chief complaint is all this neatness; of the characters and the conflicts. Maisie is completely laudable and seems not to have a flaw. Her relationship with her father is pat; as are the relationships between Lady Rowan and Lord Julian, Maisie and Billy, and most of the other characters. A little conflict and some ambiguity would have made the characters and their relationships more believable and more compelling. (The final plot surprise which does present some complexity seems, if anything, underwritten... a bit tacked-on.)While perhaps not failing a focus group's directives, the novel does fail to give readers who appreciate more ambiguity and creativity (even in their crime fiction) what they might appreciate. (NB: If you're interested in the time period and want heartier fare, try Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.)All that aside, I visited Amazon today to read the reviews of the 2nd Maisie Dobbs novel Birds of a Feather. The reviewers say it's better than Maisie Dobbs, so I'll likely give it a try; but by borrowing it from the library. Ms. Winspear hasn't proven worth the investment yet."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In this first installment in the series, Jacqueline Winspear gives notice that Maisie Dobbs will not be a typical detective series. The reader first meets detective Maisie Dobbs in 1929 working on a case of a wandering wife (she was actually visiting the grave of a dead vet of the Great War), pretty standard fare so far, but Winspear then spends the middle chunk of the book giving us Maisie's full background from 1910. A Downstairs girl whose intelligence and curiosity brings her to the notice of her progressive employer, Lady Rowan, Maisie's education is interrupted by service as a nurse in WWI.The story then runs back to a mystery that stemmed from the original inquiry: several WWI veterans buried in graves marked only by their first name. Why did they drop their last name? Why were they all at a place called the Retreat when they died?The book explores the horrific psychological and physical consequences of traumatic war injuries that occurred on the battlefield and off. The book also explores the relationship of an only daughter with her loving widower father, the relationships in the Downstairs and between the Upstairs and Downstairs. A gem in the field of genre detective fiction."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs by Jacqueline Winspear is a delightful, new book book.

Having studied psychology under Dr. Maurice Blanche (a friend of lady Rowans who works with Scotland Yard) she sets up a business as a private detective. Her first case seems relatively straightforward, and she uses her intuition and her excellent interpersonal skills to solve the mystery and help the people involved to understand their situation. During the investigation, however, she stumbles onto something far more sinister and dangerous and this is where the real mystery begins.As the story progresses we discover that Maisie Dobbs has seen the horrors of war first-hand. Her investigations lead her to a retreat for injured soldiers and we see her empathy for those who have been damaged by the Great War and eventually, the extent of her personal tragedy.I really enjoyed the atmosphere of London in the post war era, and the plot moves along at a comfortable pace, interspersing Maisies investigation with flashbacks from her life. Jaqueline Winspear captures her characters - both major and minor- beautifully, especially Maisie who is a complex individual. She is courageous and sensitive, but not without flaws and by the end of the book I had run the gamut of emotions from frustration and annoyance to admiration and compassion for Maisie Dobbs."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Click on bookcover to orderat [...]I wasn't sure I was ready for a new female sleuth when I picked up Jacqueline Winspear's novel, Maisie Dobbs. But as Maisie's story unfolded, I was drawn in deeper and deeper, and now I think I may have to run to my local indie bookstore to buy the follow-ups!Maisie Dobbs has just moved to London to start a private investigation business. Maisie is not merely a private investigator that follows the physical evidence, she has been taught by her mentor, Maurice Blanche, to explore the psychological and circumstantial evidence. Three things that make Maisie different from other female sleuths is her methodology. First, she keeps copious notes of everything she learns about a person and a case, no matter how trivial. Second, she has learned to imitate a person's stance and to focus on how that stance makes her feel, which helps her learn what the person may be excluding from the conversation. Third, is the personal accounting that she does at the end of every case.Set in 1929, Maurice has retired, leaving Maisie to give it a go alone. Her first client is Christopher Davenham, who wants to know if his wife Celia is cheating. As Maisie begins her investigation, she stumbles on a much more serious problem. World War I veterans with horrible facial disfigurements are finding solace and comfort in a place called The Retreat, which is not exactly what it lives up to. Now the son of her friends and patrons, Lord and Lady Compton, son is about to sign over his assets to The Retreat and take comfort there.The World War I backdrop is refreshing. I do question why Winspear put Maisie's wartime experiences in a long flashback rather than as part of the linear plot line. Perhaps it would have made the novel too long. However, the writing and storylines are both so compelling that it really doesn't matter.The surprise twist at the end of the novel makes Maisie Dobbs is a breath of fresh air in an already overly crowded field.Armchair Interviews says: For a super mystery, read Maisie Dobbs"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I came across this title due to the fact that it was one of five finalists for the Edgar award a couple of years back. The Edgar is a prestigious award for the best 'mystery' of the year. However, more than half of Maisie Dobbs is not a mystery but a fictional memoir of a young Brittish lass who over comes hardships to find a position of status despite the long odds against her. I could have done without any of this. Its a long tedious flash back and I have read it all before. In summation, the 60% middle of the book is written without panache and little inspiration.However, the saving grace of this book, is the beginning and end, where a slight mystery unfolds. In this part of the book, Maisie is a mature woman with a gift of insight into others that is breath taking. I would love to read a book that has this character delving into the minds of her contemporaries. Maisie uses psychology to both solve problems and heal wounds of people who dont quite understand one another. I would give the start and end of this book five stars. Its well worth reading this as a novella or long short story. I would suggest that you read the start, and if you grow tired of Maisies life story like I did, flip through the pages until you are once again in the midst of events unfolding in the stories present tense.I look forwards to reading more Winspear books.

Her first case on her own involves a woman whose husband believes she might be unfaithful. When she discovers that the woman is visiting the grave site of her first love, a war veteran who died after returning and who was part of a retreat/refuge.

One's heart goes out to Maisie and to the other characters coming to terms with a world that has changed forever; we think we are fluid and adaptible.

I thought the writing style was choppy and none of the characters were properly developed. At the end of the book I felt like I really didn't know much about the characters. And the story did not flow smoothly. I liked the idea of 'The Retreat' but it wasn't exactly thrilling. It was completely obvious something was going on. I will not be reading another Maisie Dobbs novel."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"My husband and I belong to a book club. He just could not get into this book, but I promised myself that I was going to give it a try, even though I thought that it was not my kind of story. I could not have been more wrong. This book takes place during the war. I really thought that would be a turn off for me, but Winspear writes in such interesting details, that I could not put the book down. I loved the idea that Maisie was such an independent woman..someone that women would strive to be. The book has characters that are unforgetable. I was so glad to hear that Winspear was writing even more books about Maisie Dobbs after this one. It is worth a try!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The eponymous character is an anomaly of the time (housemaid made good so to speak) who, with the help of the kindly bourgeoisie, transcends her humble birth to become a psychologist-detective with experience as a nurse in WWI, a tragic lost love, schooling at Cambridge/Girton (before women were able to attain degrees) and so on. There's a mystery here, too, but mostly the story is Maisie's and she's terrific.The prose is redolent of its place and time and, even though Maisie may be a revisionist, she's most refreshingly wonderful if too pure and serious.

It has the flavor of Alexander Smith's Ladies #1 Detective Agency. I wonder if he read this and got the idea to begin his series.

Maisie is intuitive, smart and resourceful.I think you will know if you like this book by the end of the first chapter. It's first in a series and I already have the next one."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"If you like mysteries and but want a light read, this is a very good book. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Thirteen-year-old Maisie Dobbs wants only to make life easier for her father, costermonger Frankie Dobbs, in pre-World War I London. Her mother's recent death came after an expensive illness, and Frankie has to do something to provide a decent life for his only child while he tries to pay the mound of accumulated bills and figure out whether or not he can even keep their rented home. So, dearly though he hates to interrupt this very bright girl's schooling, he arranges for her to enter domestic service at the home of a wealthy customer on his route. He has confidence that Lady Rowan Compton and her husband, Julian, will treat Maisie fairly, and he knows he will at least be able to see her on Sundays. Maisie's heartbreak soon turns to determination to make her father proud, by making the best of her new situation. Then she discovers her employers' library...and that leads to Lady Rowan and Rowan's good friend, detective (and doctor, lawyer, and who knows what else?) Maurice Blanche, deciding that Maisie deserves an education. Not just an education, in fact, but the best and most challenging one they can arrange.We learn all this about Maisie in the middle third of this book, which begins with an adult Maisie opening her own detective agency and taking on her much desired first case: that of a wealthy man who fears his much younger wife's unexplained absences mean that she is being unfaithful. Maisie learns the woman's secret, and it leads her to a mysterious farm that serves as a refuge for horribly scarred World War I veterans. This intrigues Maisie, who served as a nurse and who saw such injuries when they were newly inflicted. She feels driven to find out more about that farm...for her intuition, a powerful talent that Maurice has helped her to hone over the years, tells her that something about it just isn't right.First third of the book - mystery presented. Second third, Maisie's backstory. Third and closing segment, the mystery's investigation and solution. That is done quite well, but the book's real theme is what war does to the human beings whose lives it touches. Not just those who fight, and come home with wounds (some visible, some invisible) that may or may not heal; but those who love them, too. Sweethearts, family members, and nurses like Maisie. An odd mystery, but a highly readable one.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

I loved this book and was so disappointed to finish the story. I particularly enjoyed the historical aspect and learning more about life during the period covered by the book (1913-1929). This may not be the best book for mystery lovers... I think it is stronger as a historical fiction with a touch of romance. I can't stop thinking about the sweet, sad ending... I was crying my eyes out while reading the last few pages!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"By chance, I picked up this debut novel by Jacqueline Winspear, introducing her character Maisie Dobbs, a young woman running a detective agency between the two World Wars in England and still coping with the repercussions from the first war. I was pleasantly surprised and charmed! Since I love Golden Age mysteries and novels, I usually find the attempts to emulate them lacking, but Winspear did her homework and used many resources to faithfully recreate the aura, attitudes and period, and it pays off nicely. Unlike the standard mystery, this novel is more focused on characters and a gentle compassion towards the suffering that went on in World War I. She creates a landscape still reeling from emotional and physical devastation and individuals only able to cope with their losses and scars in doses. Maisie Dobbs is a healer of sorts, and through her, one sees the wider picture. She also has to come to terms with her own shattering experiences and she is a woman who rose above class, another nice touch.I loved this novel. It's very warm, caring and beautiful with a leisurely pace and simplicity that is touching. It is a novel of grace and gentility. I look forward to the next installments in the series. Recommended."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"A new sleuth is on the scene. Jacqueline Winspear's character, Maisie Dobbs, is a girl to watch. Set in the post-WWI era (with flashbacks to Maisie's pre-war childhood, housemaid, and Cambridge years), MD is a good piece of social commentary as the times, they are a-changin'. As the first of a proposed series, it's a good setup for what is sure to follow: more crime solving based on psychology and delicate sleuth work. The primary case in this book deals with The Retreat, a refuge for deformed and otherwise damaged war veterans that may or may not be a cult. While the story line is good, the outcome is predictable, and the main character is marred by an excess of goodness. Everyone loves her, she is loyal to those who helped here climb the class/social ladder along the way, she has no known enemies, and she has no visible weaknesses or faults. We could use a little depth of character here."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Pluses: Great setting, nice detailed descriptions, insightful exploration of the psychological damage done to both soldiers and civilians by the Great War. Some humorous dialogue. A heroine that I couldn't help liking (because what's not to like)?Minuses: Totally unrealistic characters -- everyone is entirely perfect except the bad guy. Even Maisie, who is supposedly made \\"vulnerable\\" by her sensitivity to others' emotions and her memories of the war, channels that vulnerability into an irritating ability to know exactly what people are thinking and what the best response to any given situation will be. And she's brilliant and good-looking (if not precisely beautiful) too, of course.There isn't much of a mystery here either, though it reads fine as a novel. I will probably read at least one more book in the series, to see whether Maisie develops a few other sides to her character. (Maybe she has a secret shoplifting habit!) I hate to give up on such a promising premise, but the execution (forgive the expression) leaves a lot to be desired."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Although this book had many engaging points, I have to agree with those who said that the plot is predictable, the characters are wooden, and the huge flashback taking up the middle of the book was a mistake.I had many problems with Maisie herself. Her empathy feels more like manipulation most of the time, and although the author tries to remind us that Maisie is really feeling for the people she's managing, it feels more like she is just playing God with their lives.I kept hoping for real conflict, but everyone tolerates Maisie amazingly-- even when people call her on her baloney, they back down as soon as Maisie asks them to. The ending scene is particularly annoying, as Maisie talks nonstop about her own feelings to someone who is suffering much more than she is.I was surprised that the writer seems to be British, because the dialogue sometimes sounds like an American trying to imitate British speech. Especially with Billy, a sort of Sam Gamgee character with nothing to do but whatever the protagonist wants. He has a wife and children and, presumably, a job, but none of these things interfere with his ability to get up and jaunt off to Kent for as long as Maisie needs him.Also, what's with Master James, the son? Why is he ill enough that he's considering checking into the Refuge for life, and then suddenly he's all fixed up and headed off to Canada just because Maisie solved the mystery?I really do not understand why this book received so many good reviews."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs, by Jacqueline Winspear is a sharp, unconventional approach to the detective novel. I don't read them often and I won't pretend to be an expert. I especially enjoyed the intelligent and thoughtful way that Maisie Dobbs investigates. As a psychologist and investigator, Maisie is as concerned with the people she helps as she is with solving the case. Skilled at understanding and even manipulating the human mind, Maisie takes a sometimes subtle and careful way in getting to the truth.Maisie Dobbs, opening her own detective agency a decade after the first World War, is hired by a man to find out if his wife is having an affair. This seemingly simple case will lead Maisie into a more dangerous investigation.The novel did lag a bit during Maisie's back story. However, it was interesting to see where she came from and how she became a detective and what has shaped her own life. I understand that since this is the first novel in a series of Maisie Dobbs mysteries that there would probably be more of Maisie's story in this first novel. It definitely gets moving again, once Maisie gets back on the probing quest for the truth regarding The Retreat, a home for wounded veterans.Maisie is also portrayed as squeaky, clean and sometimes dull. She loves everyone. Everyone loves her. While this is refreshing, the very ending is at a sharp contradiction with her character.The case wasn't terribly mysterious and I had guessed at the truth early in the novel. It was fun to see how Maisie figured it out and employed her knowledge of human nature to save those in the harrowing situation.Maisie Dobbs was an enjoyable read and I will probably be picking up more books from the series in the future."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In the opener to the Maisie Dobbs series, the audience is introduced to an intelligent young female detective. The novel begins with her accepting a case, but is interspersed with flashbacks of her past. We see Maisie as a young housemaid sneaking into the house's library to read philosophy and history, being introduced to the man who will be her mentor, and working as a nurse in World War 1. It's not your average mystery series, and Maisie isn't your average detective.Maisie Dobbs has mystery, a great historical setting (Britain and France in the early twentieth century), class differences, and romance. This would be a great mystery series for people who want to avoid graphic violence or sex, however, I would add that the mystery is secondary to the larger historical setting and character development."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"One of the things I've come to love best about reviewing genre books on Amazon--mysteries, especially--is discovering readers with tastes similar to mine who, through reviews and review comments that sometimes morph into interesting chats, introduce me to authors and series unfamiliar to me that I quickly come to love and admire. Such is the case for me with Maisie Dobbs, a subject that came up recently on one of the review pages for the Charles Todd series starring \\"Bess Crawford,\\" the WWI battlefield nurse.Intrigued by reviewer Julia Walker's comparisons of the two WWI era heroine-sleuths in her review of \\"A Bitter Truth,\\" I bought this first in the Dobbs series from Amazon in June and, by the time I was halfway through it, had ordered three more, and then the three after that. I'm now a huge fan of Maisie--the humble housemaid who went to Cambridge, nursed the wounded in France and went on to set up her own business as a psychologist and investigator. The supporting characters are all well developed and interesting in their own right and I love author Jacqueline Winspear's gift for making me feel very much at home in that time and place between the wars.I'm now pausing midway through book four to give fellow and future Winspear newbies a list of Maisie books in chronological order (updated January 2013). There's a page on this website that is labeled as listing the Maisie books in order, but it doesn't.) By checking the individual publication dates, I was able to come up with the following: 1. Maisie Dobbs, 2. Birds of a Feather, 3. Pardonable Lies, 4. Messenger of Truth, 5. An Incomplete Revenge, 6. Among the Mad, 7. The Mapping of Love and Death, 8. A Lesson in Secrets, 9. Elegy for Eddie. 10 Leaving Everything Most Loved.I have some recommendations for other WWI era fiction which I'm adding here to the comment section below. Please feel free to weigh in with yours."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Wow. What a great beginning of a series. This book is part mystery and part World War 1 historical fiction.Maisie Dobbs is a very perceptive woman in her 30s who opens her own detective agency. She takes on her first case, and although it seems simple, the case takes her back to her past. The reader finds out about Maisie's youth, her time spent as a nurse in the war, and the wounds it left her inside and outside.It's hard for me to put this book in a category. The book is \\"cozy\\" in the sense that there isn't swearing or sex, but it is not cozy due to the subject matter. People suffered and died in horrible ways during and after the war, and even though Maisie Dobbs is fictional, the reader knows that this really happened. This was much more than a \\"fluff\\" read to me.Recommended for mystery and historical fiction fans..."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I found this book on the floor, in the corner of a room...and I'm almost tempted to put it back. It's not HORRIBLE, but it wasn't great either. I liked the story line overall, but I was bored by Maisie. I felt that the interruption of the introduction to her current life and mystery with her entire backstory was off-putting. It threw me off guard, and when the story came back to Maisie's present, I'd forgotten what was going on. I did enjoy her view of the war and her experiences, but overall I didn't care about Maisie. I did a lot of skimming and felt that the book didn't really pick up until the last couple chapters. It's definitely an easy, light read, and probably a good book to read between some of the more heavy reading."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"i liked the heroine and enjoyed all the historical details. i thought that the story moved a little slow in the beginning but picked up in the second half. i was very disappointed in the quality of the kindle edition. it seems the publisher doesn't bother with proofreading or correctly formatting the e-book version of many of the books. however, they don't seem to mind charging high prices for an inferior product. for this reason alone, i will probably not go further in the series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I also read good reviews of this novel and bought it on that basis. I have to agree with those reviewers who felt that it was incredibly over-rated. The title character could be a \\"Mary Sue\\", she's so badly written. Breaking a novel's narrative flow with a very long flashback is generally a mistake, but in this case was probably done in an attempt to conceal the thinness of the plot. It didn't work. I give it 2 stars because it was \\"readable\\", just not good."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I will not provide a synopsis since that's already been done, ad nauseum.The writer has potential, but there's too much &quot;Harlequin Romance&quot; in this story/dialogue for my taste. Anne Perry fans will probably enjoy this book. PD James fans will not.The major characters:Lady Rowan (indulged and rebellious rich woman) - &quot;Born in 1863 and growing up in the middle years of Victoria's reign, Lady Rowan had delighted her father, the fourth Earl of Westavon, but had been the source of much frustration for her mother, Lady Westavon, who was known to comment that her daughter was 'a lady in name only!' &quot;Maisie - poor but incredibly brilliant protege who teaches herself Latin, etc. using Lady Rowan's extensive book collectionwhile working as a housemaid. Much of her emotions involve &quot;tingling&quot; and &quot;thrilling.&quot; Some hints at clairvoyance.Billy Beale (faithful Cockney sidekick) - &quot;I just knew it the minute I saw those eyes. That's all I remember, after they brought me in. Them eyes of yours... You and 'im saved my leg...I never forgot you, Miss. Never. Saved my life you did...Anything you ever want doing, you just 'oller...Wait till I tell the Missus.&quot;Maurice - the wise, well traveled and mysterious teacher who guides Maisie's studies. He's into yoga, psychology and forensic pathology; there are hints that he's done cloak and dagger work for the Allies during WWI.The underlying plot is interesting, but the narrative is choppy, as though it had been trimmed down from a longer story. There is an assumption that the reader is uneducated and is not familiar with such basics as the English mispronounciation of Ypres. These bits don't flow well with the narrative. You can easily spot the places where the editor probably insisted on the inclusion of background information.This is an Edgar nominee for best first novel, hopefully in recognition of potential, not actuality."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Hokey, cliched, loaded with predictable plot twists (see Enid's fate and the final chapter), and a lot of stomach churning psycho babble from Maisie's teacher Maurice Blanche. There is even an utterly pointless character named, of all things, Khan. He's a blind Ceylonese mystic (OH BROTHER!) He's supposed to be a mysterious guru, but his main purpose seems to be to teach Maisie how to breathe properly. The final scene where Maisie solves the mystery is absolutely ridiculous.Still I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is \\"unreadable.\\" A \\"nice\\" book, but not compelling enough to recommend it."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I bought this based on the rave reviews it received.

There is little to nothing to hold the attention of an adult, but young girls may be captivated by Maisie's strong spirit, love of education, a desire to prove she is just as good (if not better) as any man, and her budding (though safely sexless) romances. All very pleasant stuff and may hold the attention of especially younger adolescents.UPDATE:A friend who is an adult and not a \\"younger adolescent\\" owns all the Maisie Dobbs books and tells me I am full of beans. She could be right. If you buy books through Kindle (as I do) you can just download a sample and decide for yourself for free."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The author has English characters in 1929 behave as they might toward the opposite end of the 20th century. And I do mean MIGHT. Well-bred English women did not unburden themselves of their deepest grief to an utter stranger, in public -- in a restaurant, no less -- and do so so fervently that other women in the restaurant would remember the occasion. I said \\"well-bred,\\" but I'm hard pressed to think of any woman of any class who'd have behaved so. Even now, even in egalitarian America, most people wouldn't disgorge their deepest secrets to a stranger at a lunch table.Worse, the author evidently believes that letting soldiers shirk fighting is okay if they're \\"scared boys.\\" The Western world would speak German today if non-German armies had let scared youths hang back. Worst of all, condoning their fear belittles every scared boy who did come up out of a WWI trench, every scared boy fighting in Afghanistan today, and all the scared boys in between who fight alongside other scared boys and scared men.Anyone in mortal danger who isn't afraid is insane. Armies aren't composed of the insane. They're made up of people who do their jobs despite the hazard. Excusing cowardice belittles the bravery of those who do fight.Luckily, I bought the Kindle version of Maisie Dobbs and could return it for a refund. My advice is not to buy it in the first place."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Book a little delayed in arriving (mail may have been delayed). Book cover appearance a bit scruffy, but OK. Generally satisfactory."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"While \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" has been categorized as a novel/mystery, the book actually reads more like a novel (even though there is a mystery at hand, and our heroine is a detective) than it does a 'straight' mystery novel. But this did not stop me from enjoying the book at all.Once Maisie Dobbs was a domestic servant with little expectation of anything else aside from rising within the ranks. However, thanks to the sponsorship of her employer, Lady Rowan Compton, who quickly realised that there was something really special about the thirteen year old, Maisie was given an education. Now, Maisie is a young woman and eager to make her mark; and thanks to the tutorship of Lady Rowan's good friend, Maurice Blanche (a renowned detective himself), Maisie is ready to embark on her first case. Unfortunately, it looks as if her first case is going to be a case of marital infidelity: Mr. Davenham suspects that his much younger wife, Celia, is having an affair; and he wants Maisie to either confirm his worst fears or else refute them. Little does Mr. Davenham realise, however, that Maisie is no ordinary detective. A highly intuitive and empathic young woman, Maisie senses Mr. Davenham's anguish over his wife's alleged infidelity and is resolved to help the Davenhams repair their strained marital bond. Her investigation however leads her to a graveyard, and to a grave marked only with a simple tombstone and a name -- Vincent. A casual search turns up other graves -- all memorialized with tombstones and first names only. Something about the whole thing awakens Maisie's misgivings, and trusting her instincts she decides to widen her investigation, never dreaming just how much this investigation will affect her...\\"Maisie Dobbs\\" is divided into three sections: the first section deals with Maisie's initial investigation of Celia and what she's up to, and this section does read very much like a mystery novel; the second section deals with how Maisie came to be noticed by Lady Rowan, her education, and her war experiences -- this third of the book however reads more like a novel; the last section of the book again deals with the mystery of the mysterious tombstones, and the resolution of this mystery. While \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" proved to be a good and easy read, complete with an intriguing storyline and an intelligent and likable heroine, I must admit that the book was not that much of a suspenseful read. Because the novel does rely a little heavily on Maisie's intuitive powers, there are practically no unexpected plot twists or red herring suspects. (And truly, \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" was more about how, even almost an entire decade after the war, people were still coming to terms with the horror and grief that war entails). So that while I'm not exactly sure just how successful this plot device of having an empathic detecting heroine will be, I will admit that \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" proved to be a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Never much of a mystery reader, in the last number of years I have been introduced to two wonderful female detectives of sorts. One was Fremont Jones, a private detective based in San Francisco at the turn of the century and the heroine of a series written by Dianne Day. The other was Mma Ramotswe from the Alexander McCall Smith mystery series set in Botswana, Africa. While I enjoyed the mystery angles of both series, it was the women and their personalities, the geographical areas where they lived and the historical times which intrigued me so greatly. And as much as I loved these books, I remember thinking that I most likely would never find another female character from this genre who would appeal to me in quite the same way. But then I didn't know that very shortly I would meet up with the most intriguing character of all, one Maisie Dobbs from the book with the same title by Jacqueline Winspear. And as I said in the title of this review, I just know this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.We first meet Maisie Dobbs in 1929 when she is moving into her first office in London. A private detective, Maisie has been tutored and apprenticed by a Dr. Maurice Blanche who is highly regarded in London's social circles.Her first case seems rather ordinary when a man suspects his wife of cheating on him. Following the woman in question, Maisie finds a lady mourning a childhood friend killed during W.W.I. But more than that Maisie also uncovers a rather sinister plot involving a farmhouse used as a retreat for men unable to rejoin society. Called the Retreat it holds the answer to why certain war heroes met untimely deaths while living at the Retreat.While this book is considered a misery it almost takes a back seat to the main character for as we turn the pages we learn more and more about Maisie and her circumstances. In a series of flashbacks we first meet Maisie at 13 when her mother has died and her father, a costermonger, has no money left for Maisie's education due to the medical expenses for his wife. Maisie's father then finds a job for her as a scullery maid in the home of Lady Compton, a wealthy woman and suffragette. While working in this large London home, Maisie soon finds a wonderful library which appeals to her sense of learning. When she is found there one night by her employer while poring over a book, Lady Compton arranges for Maisie to be tutored over a period of years, then paying for her to attend Girton, the women's school from Cambridge. But then war intervenes and the book takes a different turn as Maisie faces World War I working as a field nurse and learns about both the joys and sorrows of a first love.I so enjoyed this book that I literally gulped it down. I found that Ms. Winspear offered her readers a wonderful glimpse into the world of London before, during and after W.W.I. From the drawing rooms of the wealthy homes to the life of a young nurse, I felt as though I was in London during these times, not reading in the year 2005. But more than anything I love learning about Maisie's life which was also laid out as a misery till the final pages revealed an important piece of the puzzle.I must say that I might never have read this book had it not been for the recommendation of a dear online friend. So not only do I thank Ms, Winspear for writing this book, I also thank my friend for reading this and passing along the recommendation. And now that I've finished Maisie Dobbs I can't wait to read the second book in this series, Birds of a Feather. I only hope that the next book will be as good as the first one. Something tells me it will be. And then I will anxiously wait for the next book by this talented and gifted author."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"By rights, I'm just the right reader for this book: I love mysteries (especially British ones), I find WWI fascinating, I find the interwar era and the whole \\"upstairs-downstairs\\" British class stuff interesting. And yet...while mildly diverting and obviously well-researched, this first book in a series about a plucky young female investigator/psychologist really didn't work for me. It's written as if the intended readership were 10-14 year-old girls, which is fine, but as an adult, it's hard to find Nancy Drewish escapades of a flawless heroine all that fulfilling.The framework is a little unconventional (though not the disaster some reviewers make it out to be): the first part of the book introduces us to 20something Maisie Dobbs, just opening her business in London. Her first case is a classic assignment: a man who is worried his wife is cheating on him wants Maisie to check into it. As her investigation unfolds there are allusions to Maisie's past and a mysterious mentor, but nothing is spelled out. Suddenly, the story drifts back in time to 1910 or so, and we are reintroduced to a younger Maisie as she enters service as a housemaid for an aristocratic family. We follow dutifully along as her employers discover her reading Latin in the library and extend their patronage, allowing her to be tutored by their strange friend (and apparent spy) Maurice, and eventually supporting her bid to go to Cambridge (Girton College). Despite success at school, when World War I starts, she decides to join the Red Cross, and eventually serves as a nurse in France, where she witnesses the horror of war.The final third of the book then shifts back the the postwar era, and Maisie's patron asks her help in a family matter. This all dovetails with her earlier case, as well as the war and the scars (psychic and physical) left by the war. The mystery isn't substantial enough to satisfy most fans of the genre, and anyone with any discernment is going to find the climax painfully bad. (All I'll say is that involves singing...) As a detective, Maisie isn't particularly compelling -- her technique is a mix of keen observation and psychology. However, she's even less compelling as a character. Maisie's one of those plucky underdogs designed to provoke maximum reader projection: born into semi-poverty, raised by single father, highly intelligent, uncommonly perceptive, always composed, humble, beloved by all, and possessing big violet eyes. She's the kind of character everyone likes to imagine they would be, had they lived in that time and been born into those circumstances. The supporting cast is fairly pat: vegetable-seller father (with a heart of gold), feisty upper-class patroness (with a heart of gold), prim butler (with a heart of gold), plump cook (with a heart of gold), Cockney handyman/sidekick (with a heart of gold), etc...The book isn't bad (except for the climax, which is terrible), it's just not very satisfying for adult readers looking for complex characters and a meaty plot. It suffers from feeling very much like a book designed to establish setting and characters for a series. I may read onward in the series (the next two are Birds of a Feather and Pardonable Lies), but may wait for the inevitable BBC TV series this will spawn."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This book is really a mixture of a novel and mystery. Masie Dobbs is a bright girl born to a low station in pre-World War One London who is given the opportunity of to educate herself and eventually becomes a private investigator. The story of Masie's life takes up as much of the book as the case she is working on. Masie's love of books and learning and her determination to fulfill her dreams are captivating. Equally touching is the profound change that occurs in her priorites once the war breaks out. The book is permeated with the Great War and its aftermath, and the author writes very movingly about the staggering loss that seems to have left no family untouched. It's not a traditional suspense yarn, but a truly rewarding read."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This won an Alex (young people's library award) NOT an Agatha. It was also nominated for an Edgar. This is hardly suprising given the author's lenghthy experience in the publishing industry, and the numerous contacts which she has as a result.As one prior reviewer noted, the dialogue and characters do owe much to Barbara Cartland. However, let's remember that Barbara Cartland made millions on her predictable stories and is now a Dame of the British Empire.I think your opinion of this story will depend on your ability/willingness to suspend credulity and believe in the numerous coincidences which are the backbone of the plot. Personally, I thought the charcters were cliched, albeit well-researched.Is it worth reading? Sure, borrow it from the library and take it to the beach. Then you can decide for yourself if you should plunk down money to buy it, and even more importantly, give it precious shelf space. (I wouldn't.)"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Brash statement, huh?I am an inveterate reader of mysteries (wrote a few myself) and I am greatly disappointed in most writers, except Colin Dexter (not writing any more) Reginald Hill (still the Master) and Dennis Lehane (too changeable, suddenly but with the sharpest typewriter among American Mystery authors).It is great to pick up a book and from the first sentence get an a prickly feeling, this is it!Yes, it is fantasy (no, not SF)with a very short list of characters-the entire book is half what the usual overwriters produce today- with great punch and depth. One does not have to write pages to convey what a character feels. Maisie is 14 when her mother dies and her father, another fairy tale character, takes loving care of her. And Lady Rowan, and Maurice Blanche. The midnight reading of the great books in the library, and still get up early morning to do the chores, the feeling of inevitable success are all conveyed in short incidents.There are three parts to the story: a short beginning with a whimsical mystery about a suspicious husband, and Maisie establishes her pro-feminine character in no uncertain way (shades of Cordelia Gray). The second and the most moving part, exqusitely written, is an Upstairs Downstairs story that culminates in the Great War, and unlike Bulldog Drummond, portrays an honest and perhaps the best short poignant description of the sufferings put between covers. The third part is another investigation, this time directly the result of the war.You finish the book with a great sigh of satisfaction. Writing like this has not been in print since Ms. Dorothy L Sayers.Good luck, Ms. Winspear! I am holding on to the next book for a nice Indian Summer weekend, to enjoy."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"MAISIE DOBBS is written in three parts. In the first part, Maisie is setting up shop as a private investigator. A man hires Maisie Dobbs to follow his wife, who he thinks is cheating on him. She follows this woman to a graveyard where she stands over the grave of a man named Victor, just Victor. Maisie finds out from the caretaker that this man was a war veteran whose face had been hideously defiled. There are other graves in the graveyard without a surname and Maisie is suspicious.The second part is flashback. We see Maisie rise from a maid, to a student at Cambridge, then a WWI nurse. We see her getting up at three in the morning to read the books in her employer's library. When she is discovered, rather than fire her, her employer takes her under her wing to assure her an education.In the third section we return to Maisie's investigation of a suspicious farm called The Refuge which had been formed as a haven for WWI veterans who had been deformed in battle.Although sometimes over-earnest with a plot line that's a bit too convenient, Maisie Dobbs is a worthwhile read. The likeable lead, the setting, and the theme of soldiers with little to live for kept me turning the pages with relish. Jacqueline Winspear is also smart enough to keep you guessing about what happened to Maisie's doctor lover right up until the end. The book is also peppered with enjoyable minor characters that help round out the personality of our Maisie."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This sensitively written first novel is being marketed as a mystery, but that's only part of it -- and the lesser part, in my opinion. It's 1929 and 33-year-old Maisie Dobbs, daughter of a London costermonger, is hanging out our shingle as what amounts to a \\"consulting detective\\" somewhat in the Holmesian style. She's certainly not a gumshoe. Though she started out as a maid-of-all-work in a big townhouse, her natural intelligence and intuitive talents, combined with her mistress's desire to do some good in the Edwardian era, result in her private education by Maurice Blanche, an old friend of Lady Rowan who becomes her mentor. Then she goes off to a women's college at Cambridge, until the Great War interferes. And that, in fact, is the center of this novel: The War. What it did to an entire generation of young English men and women and to their families, and the effects it had on English society even a dozen years later. Both Winspear's own grandfathers served and she has a strong feeling for the subject, but that may actually prove to be a problem for later books in the series of which this is the first. If you remove all the backstory about Maisie's upbringing and experiences as a nurse at the front, the actual \\"mystery\\" -- which involves skullduggery at a Kentish retreat for wounded and disfigured soldiers -- is a little thin. And Maisie is sometimes a bit *too* good, as are her friends and the love of her life, Capt. Simon Lynch of the Royal Army Medical Corps. But it's a compelling piece of work, and I'll be very interested to see if the author can keep it up."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"One wants so much to applaud Maisie Dobbs -- both the book and its eponymous heroine. There's no question that the author's heart is in the right place; it's equally clear that she's done exhaustive research. Still, innumerable details of Edwardian costume and 1920's technology are no substitute for real atmosphere, and here Maisie Dobbs, the book, badly lets down Maisie Dobbs, the plucky investigator.Whether describing the drawing room of the novel's admirable Lady Rowan or the traumatic history that has taken a housemaid through the trenches of World War I France and on to her own, indubitably genteel, offices in London, the novel rarely moves beyond the surface, while the vague underpinnings of Maisie's investigative philosophy, provided by her mentor, the mysterious Maurice Blanche, are sadly equally inert.One ends up idly paging through Maisie Dobbs, wishing, perhaps, that instead of leading her own novel she had turned up as a subsidiary character in some other setting, say as a visitor to the Bellamys on Eaton Place in \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" or a guest at Louisa Trotter's louche hotel on \\"The Duchess of Duke Street.\\" The air of Masterpiece Theatre is faint but ever-present, and one feels the character would have been better served by giving in to it!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs by Jacqueline Winspear is a delightful first novel, but it is not without some flaws. Winspear provides us with a new niche in the mystery genre, and I bet the Dobbs series will get better with each book.Maisie Dobbs opens in 1929, when Dobbs opens her own private investigative office. One of her first cases is a gentleman who believes his wife is having an affair. Instead, Dobbs discovers that the wife has been traveling twice a week to a cemetery. There, she mourns over the grave of a World War I soldier. He was terribly disfigured in the war and died on a \\"farm\\" called The Retreat, which is run by a former soldier for other men who were maimed in the war. His headstone contains only a surname, which seems strange to Dobbs.Winspear then flashes back to 1910-1917. Frankie Dobbs, Maisie's dad, is a costermonger--selling fresh vegetables from a cart. When his wife dies, Maisie is just thirteen. Frankie convinces his daughter to go to work as a domestic for one of his customers, Lady Rowan. Dobbs is a very bright girl, and soon steals into the library at night to read. When she is discovered, Lady Rowan realizes her potential. She has Dobbs privately tutored and then sends her to Cambridge. When World War I begins, she takes a leave from college to serve as an army nurse.Winspear then returns to the present, where Dobbs believes that something sinister is going on at The Retreat. She enlists the help of a number of characters including Lady Rowan, Maurice Blanche (her tutor and mentor) and Billy Beale (a former soldier and caretaker of her building).I enjoy British mysteries and Maisie Dobbs gives us a peak at the old-time English class structure. It's also interesting to read about how people dealt with World War I and its aftermath. This was also a time of great change as both the war and the suffrage movement empowered women. It was also becoming possible for servants to better themselves and move into more meaningful jobs. But Maisie Dobbs suffers from a number of problems. First, the story is very slow to develop. There are also big gaps in Maisie's history, although maybe it was intentional and Winspear is saving material for later books. And without spoiling the story, the ending was totally hokey.Still, the Maisie Dobbs series has great potential and I already have book number two, Birds of a Feather, up on deck."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"My book group which consists mainly of women 35 and over, really enjoyed this book and plan to read others in this series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"When I picked this Agatha Award Winner for First Novel to read I was expecting a great cozy mystery, but I was dead wrong. I got much, much more! This is a book that is part mystery, part saga, part historical novel and part romance, and all the different pieces are blended masterfully, yielding a compelling read.As a result of the characteristics of this book the \\"pure mystery reader\\" may be disappointed. However, those not in this category have much to gain by reading this novel. One of the most impressive accomplishments of the author in this work is that the main character, Maisie Dobbs, comes to life and we feel like we understand her motivations and actions in a very short time. This is hard to do in a mystery series, and the unusual tenor of this book makes it possible.The way in which the author portrays World War I and the effect it had on the citizens of England is engrossing and enlightening. Winspear uses the right amount of detailed information to convey her point without going overboard. Then, there is also the aspect that has to do with the social classes in England during that time and the way in which they interacted. This provided an almost \\"high-end soap opera\\" aspect to parts of the story, but without falling into trite terrain.Overall, this was a surprisingly wonderful read and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"\\"Maisie Dobbs\\" is simply of a higher caliber than most mysteries. The writing is great, Maisie the character is likable at once, & the mystery is first rate. I loved how the author used WWI as part of the mystery. The London setting post WWI was another plus, as I have had trouble finding books set during this time period. I intend to continue with this series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I have read all of the Maisie Dobbs books. I love the way that Ms. Winspear can write stories that take me out of my life and transport me into Maisie's world. I am very hopeful that Ms. Winspear will continue to write many more Maisie Dobbs books!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"MAISIE DOBBS was recommended in a book blog that I had read; I do not recall which one, which is a pity because I owe the author thanks. I was not forty pages into the book when I decided I must have all three sequels, and by the time I was halfway through the fourth I was sad that I would soon be finished with this portion of Maisie's life. I have rarely been so attracted to a character so quickly. The stories are complex narratives with surprising insights; for some reason they remind me of Dorothy Sayers (probably the World War I connection existent in each story). The descriptions of the battlefields bring the horror of that war alive, and Maisie's 1930s world is beautifully brought to life. Full of memorable characters such as Maisie's assistant Billy, but none of them is as memorable as Maisie herself. I can't wait for the fifth book and will buy the next one in hardcover."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I could echo the sentiments of everyone else here... I \\"shant.\\"I loved Maisie... One little thing, tho. I am a sucker for a terrific story with lots of history woven in... I would have liked to have seen more World War I, real-life London in this era... Sort of like The Alienist...But, I already bought the second book, Birds of a Feather, and I was hooked immediately.Maisie, I'm with you!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"And you may as well order the next three now, because no way will you not want to read them! My husband and I have all four (so far published; we eagerly await the next one), and have shared them with numerous friends. Maisie is a wonderful heroine, and the books are so evocative of the time and place, and the characters so well drawn, that the mystery story itself is almost secondary. However, the stories are good, too. Maisie is a great find, and we hope she goes on for a very long time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In many ways, this book was a delightful blend of \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" and an Agatha Christie mystery. Maisie Dobbs is a terrific character. She is complex without ever being pompous and Winspear throws her into a difficult social conundrum that she may never escape from. The book's moments of levity are balanced by some bleak truths about war, and I admire the depth that these darker passages brought to the narrative as a whole. I plan to read the rest of the books in this series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This book was excellent. I don't normally read \\"mysteries\\", but this was a great book. The Maisie Dobbs' books take place in England, and cover the early part of the 20th century--WWI and after. I loved it so much, I read the rest in the series and eagerly await more."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs has a knack for understanding the tensions and pains that affect her clients and friends. She is a survivor of the great war. She uses her knowledge of that war and the mostly men who fought it to discover the solve crimes. Her own personal story is woven throughout the plot and the mystery of her great love is revealed. She is a woman just ahead of her time. Winspear weaves a story of love, suspense, and triumph."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"A charming, light story that is pleasant and an easy read. The book is relatively short but worthwhile. The character developement is well done and gives clear pictures of the dementional parts of each of the players in the book."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I'm always looking to get emotionally invested in a new series and this one hasn't disappointed. I recently finished book one of Maisie Dobbs, the story of a post-WWI detective, her current case, and some lengthy flashbacks to the war. I find the backstory of World War I to really enrich the storytelling and add context to the period novel.This first installment was somewhat lacking in mystery and is definitely more of a foundation novel, but the subsequent books are much more centered around her cases. I think this is a good mix and am excited to see what happens next!If you like Maisie Dobbs, you may also enjoy the Dandy Gilver mystery series (or vice versa). As much as I am enjoying Maisie Dobbs, I find Dandy Gilver just a bit more engaging. Both are well worth the read and I look forward to more!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Such an interesting character and premise! I love Maisie's psychologist/detective style. Some of the writing felt a tad dry and I never quite felt glued to it. But this is a solidly well written book and I will definately be reading more in the series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I am happy to have discovered this series, and plan to read more in it. Maisie Dobbs is a charming and feisty heroine who needs to make her own way in the world, in England in the World War I years. Her dad delivers vegetables with his horse and cart, and when Maisie's mom dies, Maisie is sent in service as a maid to Lord Compton and Lady Rowan. Lady Rowan takes an interest in Maisie, and eventually she sets up her own detective agency. Maisie's mentor as a detective is a brilliant man, Maurice Blanche, who does secretive work for the government. The background of the WWI setting is rich with detail and seems very authentic."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I highly recommend the Maisie Dobbs series.She is just charming and has an unusual method for solving her cases.The historical back stories are so interesting and the entire series is absolutely well-written.You won't be disappointed in Maisie !"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"There's a reason this novel won so many awards (The Agatha, the Alex and McCavity Awards for best first novel and nominated for the Edgar)....it is unbelievably fabulous. I love historical fiction, but don't normally love historical mysteries, the exception being The Lady Julia Grey mystery series which are really kind of cute-sy and light on the historical part.But Maisie Dobbs is an exceptional story. Set in the years following WWI, Maisie Dobbs is a private detective in London. At first glance, you'd think this would fall into the cute-sy category since this is a highly unusual occupation for a woman in this time period. But author Jacqueline Winspear makes it all plausible. Much of the story is taken up with Maisie's history and how she fell into this unusual occupation....her upbringing, her unusual (at the time) education, her nursing career during the Great War.In a way, it's also a love story without the happily ever after ending. The war is brought to us in detail, but more importantly the ways in which this war changed everyone's life forever is inescapable. Laced into this amazing story is, indeed, a mystery that Maisie will solve. But the mystery is quite secondary to the story...it's simply the thread that holds it all together.This falls into the category of a can't-put-it-down book. I'd recommend it to just about anyone I know....the way the author reveals the human condition through Maisie is extraordinary. And the historical re-creation of a pivotal time in history is unforgettable.As it turns out, this is a series of books of which Maisie Dobbs is the first. I am thrilled to be able to read more of Maisie's story, but confess that I don't see how the author can out-do this book. Maisie's history in the Great War is what made this novel so good and now that the story has been told I'm curious to see if the subsequent books simply fall back into cute-sy mysteries....we shall see."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I began reading this series a few months ago and am now finishing up \\"the Mapping of Love and Death\\". These books, besides being good mysteries, provide a fascinating look back to the Interwar Era, as people were dealing with the aftereffects of the Great War and the onset of the Great Depression. The first book flashes back and forth between the end of the \`20s and the war itself (to give the backstory for the protagonist), the latter books stick closely to the 1929-1932 period.You should read them in order of publication, as the main characters develop over over the course of the books.I highly recommend the books."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Very interesting book!! Maisie Dobbs, JUST a greengrocer's daughter. This first book of the series relates the story of how her life progressed to that of a private nvestigator and psychologist.

I expected a traditional mystery. Boy, was I wrong. Where do I start? First of all, Maisie is not your traditional heroine nor is she your traditional sleuth. She is between classes, she is common enough to get by and get along with the common element but she is ladylike and educated at Cambridge. She is an intellectual sleuth. This novel is written during the time of the first World War and 1929. So don't expect forensics and fingerprints and DNA. No CSI here. This will not be what you expect but you will devour it whole and race to read the next one. This started out as an investigation of an unfaithful wife and ended up in the trenches of the French countryside and more. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is a fast read. Enjoyed it and will go on to read the next book in the series. I also gave this book as a gift at Christmas."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I was so thrilled to find Masie Dobbs! I am hooked on her books. I love this era of history, just when women are starting to come into their own and the upper class , that had so long dominated England, is beginning to lose its grip.

She is refreshing because she is different from many of the other characters that have been offered up. She is a smart woman, who has an emotional side, but is able to maintain both for her own benefit. She is also someone who was able to span two different classes in her world, and is able relies upon hard work and training to get results. This book is the first installment in the Maise franchise, and is a winner as it offers an interesting story and a well written book. It is never boring, never convoluted, and never at a waste being interesting. All in all, it is a very good read that will call to you to read more. Guess what? You'll answer because you will be caught up in fast moving story containing a compelling main character. Get it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Outstanding! Good, clean reading. It does start off slow, but hang in, you will be so glad you did. Very different, the second book, Birds of A Feather is even better."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I read this novel when it was first published and became a fan of the series, even though the first book is less of a mystery than an intuition-of-evil story. Still, there's enough of a mystery to intrigue me, and Maisie Dobbs, the hero, has just set up her own detective business and functions as the detective. The story is set in 1929 Britain, and the painful residue of World War I is everywhere, particularly in lives lost, lovers lost, and situations lost. Maisie, who as a girl was a servant in the home of aristocrats, was able to gain an education thanks to the help of her patron, Lady Rowan. Maisie's father still works on the Rowan estate, where he is in charge of the horses.When we meet Maisie at the beginning of this novel, a lot has happened to her (as it has to countless of her generation). She volunteered as a nurse for the War, saw horror, found love with a doctor named Simon, and lost him. Maisie still carries this past and these pains with her, but she is determined to do that which most interests her: help other people solve crimes, mysteries, puzzles -- whatever it is they feel they need help with.The details of setting and of middle- and working-class poverty are particularly well done. With just a few descriptions of Maisie's hat and coat, her new office, and her living quarters, we're able to enter the post-war world and empathize with its characters."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I've read all of the books in the series so far and find them uniformly outstanding depictions of historical England, the state of the State during the years between World Wars. I had no idea about the conditions in England during that period, though I did know much about the conditions in Germany. Ms. Winspear's meticulous research and outstanding prose are absolutely wonderful as well as historically accurate. The language of the time takes some getting used to but that does not detract from the outstanding plotting and character development through the series. I can't wait for the next one. I bought the first in the series, read it, then purchased the entire remaining list including the newest which was still in hardcover. I enjoy her work so much that she is one of a very few authors whom I won't wait for the paperback version to arrive but will spend the extra money to buy hardcover just to get it that much sooner."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This was a new direction for me. I have read very few historical mysteries, but I really do enjoy this time period.Maisie Dobbs is one of those stories that I really enjoyed. I listened to the unabridged audio and was enchanted by the narrator and the story. But the odd thing is, I can't quite tell you why I enjoyed it so much. The mystery aspect was not quite as apparent as with most contemporary mysteries and this story had a lot more personal stuff than what I usually like.However, I could not stop listening and when the audio ended, I was very sad to not have more. But wait...there is a whole series of Maisie Dobbs books and I can read them all.Maisie's supporting characters are quite colorful and really do help enhance the story. The time period and the author's descriptions make the story even more enjoyable. I have already purchased book 2, but am trying to pace myself."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is a rags-to-riches and detective story wrapped into one. Maisie Dobbs is a plucky but poor young woman. When she enters servitude her employers become her benefactors, leading her to a career as a detective. Wen Maisie sets up her own agency an infidelity case leads her to something far more curious- a commune for former soldiers where residents seem to die under mysterious circumstances.The specter of the First World War looms large in this book. Though set in 1929 memories and experiences of war infuse everyone and everything. Maisie is shaped by her experiences as a battlefield nurse, and we learn that wartime experiences have shaped her personal life as much as her professional life. Ten years after Versailles the wounds of war, both physical and emotional, have far from healed. As Maisie investigates the soldiers' commune, the war is at the center of the experience.This is a well-done historical mystery, both engaging and well-written."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This was my most recent book club read. I went into it thinking it was a mystery, but there is very little mystery in it. However, I really liked this book. I didn't love it, but I really liked it.The story takes place in the early 1900's and it is about a young girl who is very smart and gifted and how she is given a chance at an education. It is her story of overcoming the lower class and making something of herself. She becomes a private investigator and the mystery is in her current case and ties back into her time serving as a red cross nurse in the war and her true love. Nice story. Nicely written."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Set in the 1920s, Maisie Dobbs is a very different mystery story. The methods used by Maisie to solve mysteries involve much inner dialogue and psychological techniques. This first in the series also contains Maisie's own back story. I found the writing excellent - descriptive and clear. The people are complex and so is the plot. The impact of World War I on the characters and society is intertwined with the story. When there is action, and there certainly is action, it is realistic and chilling. Excellent and thoughtful reading!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I intend to read ALL of the books in this series. I love the character of Maisie Dobbs! And the stories are very good.

Creates the era and interactions so convincingly. A must read for those who enjoy historical fiction and mystery combined..."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs is a pretty remarkable woman, the kind I can imagine people in her world would want to be. She's a little outrageous for her time, the kind of lady who dares to challenge the expectations of her class and gender, which is just the kind of character I like.We're introduced to Maisie as she's setting up shop to be her own business, in the aftermath of WWI after everyone should be \\"recovered\\" from the war. It's one of those things that's felt but never said, that everyone who was involved in the war should be over it. At one point in the book one character mentions that we like our soldiers to parade around victorious in their uniforms after the war, but we don't want to see them as they convalesce, and that rings true to me about most tragedies. To an extent, it's the theme of this book - have the horror swept under the rug. Out of sight, out of mind.We watch as Maisie goes through the investigation of her first case, and learn of her interesting methods that admittedly seem a bit unorthodox, yet effective. She's amazingly intuitive and that clearly helps her not only solve her cases, but emotionally aid the people affected by them as well. Maisie somewhat easily unravels the mystery behind the first case, and at the same time it becomes clear that something else is going on with The Retreat.After the resolution of this case, we have a series of chapters set in the past, where we learn about Maisie's background and how she came to become the woman we meet at the beginning of the novel. Her story starts out simple enough, and as time progresses we are taken into the horrors of the Great War from her nurse point of view.As someone who has grown up in the United States, I honestly haven't had a lot of exposure to the events surrounding WWI. We learn a bit about it growing up in school, but more focus seems to be placed on WWII, probably because the US was more directly affected by that war. I haven't ever heard first hand stories about WWI, so this was definitely my first major exposure during my adult life. This section of the book in particular really got to me, reading about the soldiers and their fates had me crying on numerous occasions. I've grown up in a time where going off to war is more of something you see on TV, not live every day, and while I'm grateful for that, I'm also a little disappointed that these horrors aren't made real to us unless we read about them in some way. Despite all that, I really enjoyed this section and loved learning Maisie's personal history.Although this is the first book in a series, it doesn't leave you with a cliffhanger, wondering what's going to happen next and forcing you to wait for the next installment. It's really a standalone novel that leaves you *hoping* there's something more to come, and obviously delighted that there truly is."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I finished this book while sitting in the laundromat, totally sobbing into my clean towels and not caring who saw me. Jacqueline Winspear has created a heroine I love, and I've come back for all of the subsequent Masie Dobbs books. But this first one is my absolute favorite.If you love Agatha Christie, Downton Abbey, Brideshead Revisited, or any other tale of England during and after WWI, you'll gobble up this nuanced and beautifully drawn series. Read it."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I really liked the characters in this book. Maisie Dobbs seems to be such a gentle, sweet, genuinely good person. I love Maurice, and how he helps Maisie. And cute Billy, love him, too. He's adorable. The overall plot was predictable, yet, I found myself wanting to read the ins and outs of it anyways and it did not disappoint. It had a few twists and turns I didn't expect. I also love the time period this is in and that it's in England (and France some of the time), it's a time period that fascinates me. It looks like it's a long series, I plan to read it all, prolly not all at once, although I did just start book # 2.... I enjoy this author's style of writing and love these characters, and who doesn't love a good mystery? :)I have one spoiler, please scroll below:What is up with Maisie NOT going to see Simon ::right:: after they were injured? Seriously, TEN years later to go see the love of her life? I can only imagine how war damages people, but still, not to go see the love of your life for THAT long? Seems wrong... I'm hoping in a ::small:: way that maybe Simon will somehow, miraculously come out of his injuries in the name of love, now that Maisie has come along... we'll see if that happens in future books. I LOVE that Maisie makes Billy her assistant, SO cool! :)(less)"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This has touched my soul unlike any book I have read in years! If you are looking for your dare I say \\"basic murder mystery\\" this is NOT the book for you! Maisie Dobbs is anything but basic. From the language, the incredible and gripping account of WWI and those that fought in it.The story is set up in three sections. The first section gets the ball rolling on what is thought to be an open and shut infidelity case starting in 1929. The second part goes back between the years 1910-1917 and shows Maisie growing up in service, her remarkable education and those that changed her life for the better and the war. The last part takes up where it ended in 1929 at the beginning. While it may seem a bit confusing, I can understand why the author chose to do it this way.This is so much more than just a historical mystery. It also involves Eastern Philosophy, Ptsd(post traumatic stress disorder), the women's suffrage, class status...I loved this book so much, I bought the others in the series before I had finished the book. Jacqueline Winspear has put a fresh face on the mystery genre. Highly, highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is the first book in a series about Maisie Dobbs, a private investigator working in London in 1929. It's a gentle read that reminded me of the books I read when I was a teenager. Indeed in many ways it feels like a young adult novel. The characters and their motivations are spelled out for us and there are few surprises along the way. It's easy to compare it with the No 1 Ladies Detective series, but it lacks the whimsical charm of those books. Nevertheless it's an atmospheric and enjoyable story that's reminiscent of Kate Morton crossed with Agatha Christie.The plot is partially about Maisie's life story and how she evolved from a domestic maid to a private investigator. It's also the story of her first case, which involves investigating a retreat for WW1 soldiers who are struggling to fit back into society after the war. There's an intriguing mystery but it really only comes to the fore in the final third of the book, once we've dealt with all the back story. The changes in English society and the impact of the first World War are central to the story and make the book very interesting. Maisie also carries psychological scars from the War and over the course of the book she will need to acknowledge those.Maisie uses psychological techniques to solve her cases. For example she frequently mimics people's body language to get an insight into how they are feeling. She also has a \\"sixth sense\\" about how things will work out. To be honest, I found this less than convincing. However by the end of the book I was really enjoying the story and I'll definitely pick up more in the series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs takes place following World War I in London. It's an era that I didn't know much about, and so soaking in all of the atmosphere that Winspear so painstakingly researched was a revelation. Although I'm not much of a clotheshorse, I really enjoyed how the author described Maisie's clothes. My mother-in-law designs and makes antique clothes, and as I read this book, I thought of how much she would love this.I like how Maisie is so intelligent, yet she doesn't have all the answers. The way she mimics the posture of the person with whom she is talking to make them more comfortable with her fascinated me. Her mentor Dr. Maurice Blanche's psychological insights to Maisie, such as\\"Never follow a story with a question, Maisie, not immediately. And remember to acknowledge the storyteller, for in some way even the messenger is affected by the story he brings,\\"are illuminating, and useful to the reader.Maisie's straddling of two different classes of society- her father's working class and her benefactor's aristocratic one- makes for interesting conflict for her. Her father, a groom on the estate where Maisie is a maid, wants a better life for Maisie, yet fears losing her completely to her new life. Lady Rowan, her employer and benefactor, is an interesting character and I hope we get to see more of her in future books.And in the end, it was Enid, Maisie's fellow maid, who was the greatest influence on Maisie. Her words to Maisie about her duty to help the boys in the war effort may have had the deepest effect on Maisie's life.Maisie Dobbs starts in 1930, after Maisie has become a private investigator, and establishes the adult Maisie before taking us back to her childhood and the story of how Maisie got to where she is. It is a good technique because we are so invested in Maisie's adult life before we see how she got there.I felt that the author's take on the horrors of war resonated deeply. So much of what happened to the men and women who fought in war is universal and timeless. While techniques of war have changed greatly since World War I, the awful effects of it have not. I liked seeing war from a female point of view.But my favorite quote from the book has to do with reading, of course.\\"The feeling inside that she experienced when she saw the books was akin to the hunger she felt as food was put on the table at the end of the working day. And she knew she needed this sustenance as surely as her body needed fuel.\\"That just might be my new Facebook quote.Since Maisie is a private investigator, there is a mystery to be solved, and mystery fans will be satisfied with this part of the story. But for me, the story of Maisie's life is what I felt most deeply about and I look forward to finding out more about her in the books to come."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie is a gal who defies the odds--she has advanced socially yet remained grounded. Bright, precocious and always thinking, Maisie is not just a detective but a window of the world of WWI and after.Like Nancy Drew, Maisy has a doting father. However Nancy had Ned and her girlfriends while Maisy is a bit of a loner.Maisy has a speedster car and dresses fashionably yet practically like Nancy. They both are incredible sleuths and strong driven women.This book is a fun romp into the past and a great way to solve a mystery with a charming character."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Being a great fan of Isabel Dalhousie, Alexander McCall Smith's lady sleuth in Edinburgh--but having finished her series to date--I was casting about for another heroine. I found her in the eponymous Maisie Dobbs. A bright girl born in London before the Great War, she loses her mother at age 13. Her father, a simple costermonger who sells fruit and vegetables from a barrow, cannot afford her education and upkeep due to the medical bills of his late wife so he places her as a scullery maid in the home of Lady Compton, a wealthy and enlightened woman. Maisie discovers joy in the family's library, and is caught there late one night devouring books and taking notes on some of the great thinkers and teaching herself Latin. Stuck by Maisie's keen intellect and ardent desire to learn, her employer starts her being tutored and eventually sends her off to Girton College, the women's arm of Cambridge. But after just one year there, she is drawn away by the war and the desperate need for nurses in France. There she meets her first love, a dashing doctor, but she sees firsthand the horrific casualties of combat and experiences the hardships of life on the battlefield. Her nursing career ends when a shell explodes near her hospital tent.After her return to England, Maisie apprentices as a private investigator under the incomparable Maurice Blanche, a good friend of Lady Compton's. He helps her to cultivate her intuition about cases and people and teaches her the art of mapping out clues. Finally, in 1929, she is ready to hang out her own shingle. In her new office building she reconnects with the handyman Billy Beale whom she had nursed for shrapnel wounds years earlier, and in gratitude he eventually becomes her assistant. Her first case is when a husband approaches her concerned about his much-younger wife's forays from home, suspecting her of infidelity. Maisie trails her to a cemetery and later befriends her. As Celia Davenham shares her story, it becomes apparent that she is not cheating on her husband--but that the cemetery has a dark story of its own which Maisie then pursues. Her inquiries lead her through a maze of cult-like figures to explore the deaths of several men buried there who had lived in a retreat nearby, set up for those unable to rejoin society after the war. The book becomes a real page-turner at this point, leading up to a satisfactory resolution.Why should you read this book? The author's character portrayals ring true (accents, slang, and all), and she brings in period details that vividly paint the picture of World War II and its aftermath. Her new career brings up the past that Maisie thought she had put behind her, leading the reader through an era of staggering loss and heartbreak. And the back story is that Maisie herself is caught between the lower class that she was born into and the educated class that she adopted, finding it hard to know exactly where she belongs. Her tale of being an independent woman, without a man, pursuing a nontraditional line of work and cultivating her talents is an interesting one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The primary character in this story is Maisie, a private investigator whose rise from the servant class is due to careful mentoring by her upper class employers. The second character is World War I, seen over time from the horrors of the battlefield to the devastating legacy it left on the minds and bodies of the survivors. Maisie too served in the war as s nurse, and her empathy for the ex-soldiers leads her to investigate an establishment where their lingering traumas are in danger of being exploited. Maisie's complete life is told via a series of long, rather maudlin flashbacks. There is considerably more depth in Winspear's details about \\"upstairs and downstairs\\" life, her accounts of the war and its aftermath, and in Maisie's physiological approach to her new found trade."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I feel rich, like I always do whenever I discover a new series of mysteries to devour. Having read everything every written by Deborah Crombie, Sue Grafton, Elizabeth George, P.D. James, Alexander McCall Smith and a few others, the Maisie Dobbs series is one of the best I've found in years. Dobbs is part sleuth, part mystic, part philosopher and part psychologist - truly an unusual and intriguing combination. The book is full of insights that I pondered long after finishing the story."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Over ten years after the Armistice that ended the Great War, Maisie Dobbs strikes out on her own as a detective following the retirement of her mentor, Maurice Blanche. Her first case appears to be relatively straightforward -- Christopher Davenham suspects that his wife may be unfaithful, and hires Maisie to discover the reason behind his wife's mysterious weekly (and unexplained) disappearances.Maisie discovers that the wife, Celia, is deeply grieving the death of her unrequited first love. Vincent Weathershaw survived the war but was horribly disfigured. Deeply disillusioned, before his death he withdrew from society to a farm called The Retreat, where he joined other maimed and wounded veterans seeking escape and respite. In order to join the community, each member gives up their last name and signs over control of all their material assests to the organization and its mysterious founder, Adam Jenkins, a charismatic former soldier. When Maisie discovers that Vincent is only one of many soldiers who died shortly after entering The Retreat, she resolves to discover the truth behind Jenkins' seemingly altruistic motives.I think classifying Maisie Dobbs as a straight mystery is something of a misnomer. There is the mystery of the retreat, but the primary focus of the novel is the exploration of the pyschological wounds the Great War inflicted on society in general, and particuarly those who survived the battlefield horrors. One of the reasons this story is set apart from more run of the mill mysteries is that Maisie is a detective who is deeply affected by her cases. She doesn't remain set apart and untouchable, and this quality makes her relatable and vulnerable. The mystery of The Retreat forces Maisie to face her own long-suppressed memories of her wartime experiences, while at the same time she is attempting to aid other wounded souls in facing their own inner demons. A full third of the novel revisits Maisie's youth, exploring her service as a nurse and her tragic, doomed romance with the brilliant doctor Simon Lynch.Maisie Dobbs is a beautifully plotted, well-constructed novel that introduces a heroine of extraordinary depth. Through Maisie, Winspear explores the far-reach and shattering effects of conflict, and how the first world war defined a generation. She skillfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the axiom \\"less is more\\" -- the novel covers violent events and horrific injuries, but Winspear never assaults the reader with graphic descriptions. Instead, it is often what is left unsaid that makes her writing so effective and memorable. This novel is one of the most restrained, but at the same time emotional, books that I have read in quite some time. I'll definitely be reading the sequels!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"This is primarily a background novel about Maisie who is, by the way, precognitive. She is also very taken with herself and, to me, cruel to one she says she loves. The far more interesting character is Billy, who plays a secondary role. The story of the men who fought in WWI is, by far, the strongest and most poignant part of the story. The actual mystery is almost incidental to the story and relies on information you are unaware she obtained, Billy's willingness to be the legman, and Maisie's intuitive powers. Although there were part of the book by which I was moved, I was disappointed overall. I've ordered the next book but It will need to be significantly stronger for me to continue with this series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Set in 1929, in England, Maisie Dobbs is the first book in a series about a former housemaid/World War I nurse who sets up in the post-war years as a psychologist and private detective. The author obviously did a great deal of research as her attention to period detail is careful and quite good. Regretfully, she seems to have put the bulk of her efforts into her research, leaving little else for writing and story.The story is rather awkwardly divided into three chunks: in the first chunk, the reader is introduced to Maisie and a few of the people that make up her world. Her client arrives, provides her with the problem that will become the book's mystery and then...We come to a screeching halt as the second chunk is introduced: Maisie's backstory, her rise from the bright daughter of a humble costermonger to her time in service to an aristocratic family, to her education and subsequent attendance at Oxford and finally her time in France, tending the wounded during WWI.Then, once all this exposition is out of the way, it's back to the present (1929) and our mystery, which, if the author is lucky, her readers have not forgotten about. Once the mystery is resolved, a few loose ends from Maisie's backstory are tied up and everyone is happy.The problem with the way this book is constructed is that the introduction of what is basically a huge chunk of exposition brings the engine of this story to a complete stop. For more than 100 pages. This is never a good idea. It's okay to weave backstory into the plot a few pages at a time, over the course of the book, in fact, that method offers a lot of advantages. But to just completely drop the narrative thread for 100 pages and cram your main character's biography into the middle of an ongoing puzzle is to risk having your readers walk away in boredom. I know I almost did.The mystery itself is thin and its resolution left a lot to be desired. Most people will see it coming from a long way off. And like the mystery, I also found many of Maisie's interactions with the other characters to be pat and unsatisfying. Many scenes that should have had more depth and feeling to them seemed rushed. I had the feeling that I was reading a book that hadn't been written so much as it had been outlined. Those criticisms aside, I will say that the minor characters are, for the most part, very well rendered. I particularly liked Enid, Maisie's room-mate during her time in service. I can understand what the author did with Enid, because if the saucy red-headed maid had stuck around much longer, she'd have taken over completely. She was a much more interesting character than Maisie herself.Finally, I simply cannot see how Maisie Dobbs merited Edgar and Agatha nominations. While it has its interesting points, Maisie Dobbs is simply not of that caliber."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs is just plain superb literature. The murder mystery is almost a secondary element in what is really a very introspective and sensitive portrayal of the effects and aftereffects of war on individuals. Even the murderer is treated compassionately by the author. Jacqueline Winspear.The characters are very carefully crafted personalities; even those who are actually first encountered as names on graves, are vested with a history that matters to the reader and to the other characters. The various interactions among these people is engaging and carries the reader from mere spectator to thoroughly invested in the outcomes of these people's lives.The time frame chosen by the author for the action is a very eventful one. English society is on the cusp of change, and nearly everyone senses it in some way. Some are confused about what these changes mean for their futures, while others are eager to plunge forward to a \\"better world.\\" The old society, the aristocratic and privileged age of the 19th Century, is poised for transition to what the reader knows is a technologically advanced, sometimes very violent, but also a more egalitarian world.The narrative is very tightly crafted. Although there are abrupt transitions between present and past, hardly an episode is included anywhere that does not forward the reader's understanding of the meaning of the tale, and the author leaves no lose ends.As the story emerges, both the personal histories of the characters and the murder mystery, it will not leave the reader untouched.Excellent."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Its 1929, and Maisie Dobbs, thirty-something, opens her own detective agency. One of her first cases seems like an open-and shut case of infidelity, but after following the man's wife to a cemetery, Maisie isn't so sure.Maisie, a former scullery maid, Cambridge graduate (though without the degree), and a nurse in France during the Great War, finds herself reliving old memories (not all of them good), as she pursues the case to The Retreat, a home for wounded and shell-shocked former soldiers. Immediately, Maisie has her suspicions about the place, and she sends in her friend, Billy Beale, to investigate.The flashback scenes seem like something out of Upstairs, Downstairs, right down to the description of Ebury Place (Eaton Place in the BBC TV show). Even some of the characters are dead ringers for their TV counterparts. As far as the mystery is concerned, there's really very little \\"mystery\\" to speak of--it's pretty clear what's going on from the beginning. The resolution of the case is pretty flimsy, and the bad guy crumbles under no pressure from Maisie. Also, Winspear makes a mistake in making the whole middle of the book one giant flashback. She would have been better off putting in bits and pieces of flashback here and there instead of all at once.But I really did like the setting, of England between the wars. Some of the characters are delightful, especially Maisie's friends (in fact, they threaten to steal the show at times). Hopefully, Winspear's detective will continue to grow in the other books in the series, and will encounter actual crimes."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie Dobbs is a delicious book, if for nothing other than the way it evokes the between-the-wars era in England. You really feel the damage WWI had caused England's spirit. Maisie's young life is well drawn along with her time in the VAD in France. The only part that really didn't go down well with me was the way Maisie's use of psychology is wrapped in a coating of psychic/supernatural/mystical ability. I found it hokey. I'm also not so sure that class barriers were quite as easy to bridge as Maisie appears to have found it. Overall I found \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" a charming read, the mystery pulls the story along, but the atmosphere and flavor make it stand out."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The book is in three parts, the early part is Maisie beginning to work on her own as an investigator, and one of her first jobs leads her on to the third part of the story. In between we learn of Maisie's history and how she came to be in her situation in 1929, at 32 years of age.With the death of her mother, Maisie becomes responsible for her family home and her dad. Her dad (who is a costermonger- vegetable seller) worries that should something happen to him, she will be out on the street. So he finds her a place \\"in service\\", as the house firelighter and all around gopher. But she is well taken care of by the butler (Carter) and the Cook. Maisie begins to sneak into the families library each morning to read works on psychology and philosophy.One morning she is surprised by Lady Rowan (her employer) who is astonished to find one of her maids reading Jung. Once she determines that Maisie has an untapped ability, she brings Maisie to a friend of hers to prepare her for college exams. This is the early 1900s and few girls, much less maids are able to go to college. But Maisie is bright and perserveres.When the war breaks out she enrolls in nursing school, and ends up working in a preMASH type unit on the battlefield. There she meets a doctor and you can guess the rest...but your wrong, sort of. This third part of the story is related tangentially to what happens to her in France and during the war. We actually learn very little of what happened at the end of the war and from 1918 to 1929 (probably in the next book).Needless to say the story and the characters are well thought out and presented. Her knowledge of the mores and sociology of the times is 'spot on'. All in all a very comfortable and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"1st in the series featuring Maisie Dobbs, a psychologist and private investigator in the post-World War 1 era of the early 1900's in London.

I love the historical setting with characters I actually care for. It's so nice to have complete respect and admiration for the main character of a story and Maisie fits the bill. I'm looking forward to reading more from Jacqueline Winspear"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I am not a fan of historical mysteries; perhaps because the few I have read have not been that well written and/or researched. This novel is a welcome exception.Winspear writes with a talent for bringing her characters and in particular, Maisie Dobbs to life. She also invokes the reality, the pain and the savagery of the First World War. It was indeed a savage, wrenching experience for those that lived through it and it never hurts to be reminded of the dreadful results of war. The recognition of the awful wounds resulting from it is a bitter reminder of the price paid by so many soldiers that were \\"lucky\\" enough to survive the war.Maisie is bright, ambitious and almost too good. There is just a tad too much of the angel brushed over her. But this remains a good read. The ending is easily predicted by the expert mystery fan but, that being said, this is an engrossing, entertaining read.I found the writing around the war particularly compelling so I am curious to see her next book and whether she is able to sustain the same interest without the historical addition of the war"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Jacqueline Winspear writes with great style. MAISIE DOBBS is the first in this series. It is romantic like CASABLANCA with the same mysterious air. The book is set in wartime England. Both the setting and the characters are very well drawn...you can't help but to care for them as you get to know them. The other two books in this series are BIRDS OF A FEATHER and PARDONABLE LIES. The story continues through these books although they can be read seperate. Each title is strong enough to stand on its own merits. Winspear's book should be added to your permanent shelf whether you like mysteries or not."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Although Jacqueline Winspear is British, \\"Maisie Dobbs\\" often sounds as if it had been written by an American, so thick with English slang is it. It also has the flaw often found in books set in Britain, but written by Americans, that titles of nobility are entirely inaccurately bestowed.The concept of the book is interesting, but Maisie is a comic-book superwoman. If the characters had been better developed, and the plot less rickety and ridden with coincidence, perhaps the author's impressive research might have been put to a more meaningful use."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"In Masie Dobbs, Jacqueline Winspear has created an unforgettable character and painted a vivid picture of The Great War and it's legacy of horrific effects on the survivors. As much historical novel as mystery, Masie Dobbs is a vehicle for a personal reflection on war and its aftermath. With a female hero who derives her power from her classical education and applied psychology there's a powerful role-model in this protaganist. I can't wait for the next in the series. Now that we have come to know Masie's roots, we can't wait to see where her brains, intuition, and her Swiss Army knife will take us."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Because I could get my hands initially on a Maisie Dobbs book further in the series (Birds of a Feather), I came back to read the first book, simply titled Maisie Dobbs, second. Two did it. I am now a dyed-in-the-wool Maisie fan, and vow not to miss any more in this series of, so far, six, with the most recent out just this past February 2009. Jacqueline Winspear, you have made a convert out of me! If I was borderline with my introductory Birds, I have officially crossed that line now.I couldn't be more surprised.See, I was (am) anything but a mystery and detective novel fan. Anything but. Well, almost anything. Only thing worse in my mind than a detective novel is a romance novel. All that gushing, stereotypical female at her weakest worst. All that machismo and bravado male at his weakest worst (it takes courage to have and express real emotion). And the writing in these genres tends to be some of the most formulaic and predictable, cheap and easy stuff found on a bookshelf. And so, I was a tad surprised when my book club literati suggested we read at least a couple Maisie Dobbs books. Heck, I wasn't even sure where the mystery section in my public library is located. But I have always vowed to try to be open minded about such things, and I do respect the literary minds in this book club, so ...So, I am now this fervent fan. I'll tell you why. It is interesting to me that in this day and age of women supposedly having all kinds of opportunity open to us, we have sunk to the lowest levels of objectification ever seen. Not only do we allow it, too many of us even greet it, readily playing along, eager to please. Never mind that we may well be snickering behind the backs of the opposite gender, salivating over this objectified woman-type. No one ends up looking good in that scenario. Fools, all.And so it would seem logical that Maisie Dobbs would be a character in modern day, this time for women to excel, nothing holding us back but ourselves. Instead, Maisie lives in the early to mid 1900s, in post World War I London. She is the strong and liberated, financially and otherwise independent woman we should all strive to be--today. You might even say ... a true heroine.Yet if yesterday the hero figure was popular, this is the day of the anti-hero. Whatever that means. I puzzle over the term. \\"Anti\\" means not, or against, or opposing, right? How did we come to elevate the not-hero, in short, the villain, the dark and shady and cowardly type, over the good guy, or, in this case, the good gal? I don't get it. I don't want to get it. I, for one, long for the hero to rise again, or perhaps even for the first time, because the hero of yesterday, wearing his white hat, was always male, and was anything but real. The classic old movies made him a figure of impossibility, equating perfection with goodness and courage. Yesterday's hero was nothing more than fantasy, and clearly unattainable by mortal man or woman. It is knowing one's imperfection, and not giving into it, however, that makes the hero--and heroine. Not being fearless, but being indeed afraid (only fools know no fear), fully aware of one's weakness, and doing the right thing just the same.Maisie Dobbs is one terrific heroine. She is strong, yet soft. Wise, yet willing to learn at every opportunity given her. Great hearted, but with discrimination. She uses her clever mind rather than trickery. She takes no shortcuts. She never has any need for any weapon other than her keen mind. She always keeps her promises. Most importantly, she is realistic and attainable. There is no reason whatsoever that a girl or a woman today couldn't emulate this character and hold her up as role model. And oh, we could use a few...Rather reminded me of the books I read as a girl. I read eagerly, learned something, saw the world expand, felt inspired. But the Maisie Dobbs series is not Nancy Drew; these are sophisticated novels, very well written, complex and intelligent. They contain the best of this age--one in which I firmly believe we are seeing the best written fiction we have ever seen (and the worst, but that's to be expected as the flip side of the same coin). That is, we witness a strong, leading female character in a book, even if it perhaps requires a background setting spanning 1912 to 1929 to encompass her. One wonders... would she find it possible to be so strong and true today? One hopes.There, then, you have the character. The storyline of Maisie Dobbs in this introductory novel is a masterly balance of the young detective-psychologist solving her first cases while dealing also with a traumatic and war-torn past. The current mysteries unfold around chapters that look into her past. We see her formative years, her family roots, the difficulties of a hardworking childhood when her mother died young and her father struggled against poverty. Young Maisie learns a work ethic that will suit her lifelong. She expects no favors, but earns them. She lives by the Golden Rule, treating others as she would be treated, even when she is not.Breaking class lines, young Maisie earns her way into university in a time when women were allowed to attend but were not allowed to receive diplomas, even when completing all the same class requirements as their male counterparts. Outside of the classroom, her education is enriched by tutors who work with her to sharpen not just her intellectual abilities, but her intuition, her understanding of the psychology of the human mind and nature. This is the most fascinating aspect of the Maisie Dobbs character, and so refreshing from the gun-toting tough guys in the genre--she does not fight, but indeed embraces, her feminine strengths, and develops a woman's intuition based on keenest observation. She learns to use and read body language to detect the false. She emulates and mirrors movement and expression, not only to put another at ease, but also to fully feel what the other is feeling. As she questions her suspect, she eases into his posture, tries on his expression, matches his stride and breathing pattern ... until she herself can feel what the other feels. When she does this--these quickly became my favorite sections of the book. I know of no other female character, in literature or cinema, that doesn't try to outdo being a man in feminine guise. Maisie Dobbs remains fully feminine, and uses her feminine wisdom and strengths to her advantage, and without ever taking advantage. Her strength is in her mind, in her heart, in her ability to fully feel compassion for another. She does not beat her enemy as much as she brings him over to her side, earning respect, trust, and opening even the toughest and iciest hearts. Because even a bully has one.In this first book, we also come to understand Maisie's great love, Simon. Her background was as a war nurse, his, as a doctor. A shell hits the Red Cross tent where the two work, and while Maisie survives with scars, inside and out, Simon survives, but only in a vegetative state. We see this struggle in Maisie, too, as she continues her work--her own recovery, while grieving for the dream lost. In the mystery case she solves in this book, we read of veterans forgotten by society, or who are repellent to society because of their great physical wounds. It is an opportunity for us all to look in the mirror, to contemplate all wars. It is an exploration of the many kinds of wounds a human being can take, and not take, and what healing requires.All great stuff. A character that is memorable and inspiring; a storyline that is evocative and thoughtful; writing that is highly skilled and moving. I am clearing a bookshelf at home for mysteries, at least those solved by one remarkable woman detective-psychologist."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"The story opens in 1929 London, with thirty-two year old Maisie Dobbs hanging out her shingle as a private investigator.Winspear slowly unfurls the facts of Maisie's first cases, taking more 200 pages to build suspense. The back story of Maisie's life is more compelling.When Maisie was still a teenager, her street vendor father persuaded her to work as a servant to Lord and Lady Compton. The Comptons took notice of her sharply inquisitive mind, and arranged for bon vivant investigator Maurice Blanche to tutor her at their home. Maisie went on to study at Girton College at Cambridge but cut short her education to volunteer as a battlefield nurse in France during the Great War. Maurice Blanche taught Maisie about the elusiveness of truth and to payclose attention to coincidences, but the parallels between herself and the cases she is investigating do not ring true at the story's end. It is unfathomable that someone as bright and caring as Maisie would take twelve years to face her demons.Winspear's debut novel is the first in a series of Maisie Dobbs mysteries. Perhaps future installments will detail the apprenticeship that led to her unusual career choice. Anglophiles will appreciate this period piece but fans of classic British mysteries will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"After all the hype this proved a major let-down. Whatever the merits of its subjects, the novel managed to make them all utterly banal. The mis-shapen plot piles up narrative cliche upon cliche, with all the unpredictability of a digital clock. And the prose style makes Mickey Spillane look like Marcel Proust. To top things off, Penguin has added a pretentious apparatus complete with a vapid interview and grade school discussion group questions. I haven't encountered such insipid pseudo-literary nonsense since a brief encounter with the Da Vinci Code. Shame on Penguin!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"To all those nay-sayers who dumped on the author, the character and the story, I say, \\"BAH, HUMBUG!\\" I bought this book because of all the positive reasons stated by others; I enjoyed it thoroughly.I read this type of book because I want to be entertained, not enlightened. If the latter occurs then its a big plus. If not, on to the next novel. In this case I've already obtained four of the follow on books and look forward to reading them all with great pleasure. Why? Because Maisie Dobbs is a nice person and the story, except for the bad guy(s?) is filled with nice people, even a nice horse. Its a warmish sort of tale, brought occasional smiles to my face, and the good feeling of a simpler time gone by. I'm not a critic, just an average reader who enjoys a good tale well told; this was one of them.Please take your anger and frustration out on our politicians, not an author who's trying to entertain you."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"Maisie was a story about a young woman living during WWI, and the plotline focused on that period. Folks are not too familiar w/that war, and this book did not encourage me to become any more so. It had a subplot of a mystery that was related to the main story, but a long way from Agatha ! I don't know ... I would not buy Book Two in the series."},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"I found my first Maisie Dobbs: PARDONABLE LIES, in a Friends of the Library sale, & the stories of the means by which she earns her keep - as a Psychologist & Investigator in London of the late 1920s - fascinates, as do those of her assistant, Veteran Billy Beale & her friends & family.They are all about a young woman who thrived through a deprived childhood at the turn of the 20th century with her considerable faculties intact; the heavy hand of a wealthy dowager eager to do her bit for the downtrodden; years as a servant & a brief bright moment at Girton College, Cambridge before following her best friend to the World War battlefields in France & hospitals to nurse the mangled masses of British soldiers... to survive a near-miss with a head wound, & eventual return to her education.Priscilla Evernden, Maisie's best friend at college, speaks directly to my heart & own experience on p.146: \\"...When you grow up with three brothers you forget your cuts, scrapes, and bruises, and concentrate on your bowling arm, on coming back in one piece from the hunting field, and on not being run over by the lugworms when they come to the table. And unless you show that you are as good at everything as they are, you find that you spend virtually all your time running behind them screaming like a banshee, 'Me too, me too!'\\"That's why Pris joined the Fannies (First Aid Nursing Yeomanry) to drive ambulances all over France, chasing after her brothers, & that's why Maisie volunteered too.Each book is rich with the stories of Maisie's life & times, of her clients & their needs, of her skills & intentions; full of flashbacks from a war that's never really over for her & everyone else; insights into how to look at life & what makes people tick; of love & despair, fear & deceit, wealth & poverty.Entering Maisie Dobbs' world you will come upon a time & a place that though no longer exists, it nurtured our grandparents & their children, on the English side of The Pond, where I was born & raised a decade later. So I imagine my Veteran Daddy & my indomitable Mum, there in Maisie's world.The language takes a bit of getting used to: that inane who/whom thing seems to rear its head at least once in each book, & the author's attempt at reproducing Billy Beale's East End dialect gets tedious although the fact that Maisie can give as good as she gets from those who think she's a toff, well, I never!Jacqueline Winspear always brings her tales to a satisfying close, leaving just enough of a \\"come hither\\" for us to follow.Very well done!"},{"Title":"Maisie Dobbs","review":"If you haven't read the Maggie Dobbs series, give it a try. Jacqueline Winspear has recreated post WWI London (and surrounding areas) marvelously and has written a warm, human \\"mystery\\" series to boot. The writing is literate, the research into the era seems accurate and the characters really come to life and make you care. Probably more interesting to a woman reader than a male - but with enough war detail to interest a WWI buff of either sex. This is the first book in the series and introduces the main characters who will populate the rest of the series. I am hooked!"},{"Title":"Saxophone Method with CD (Audio)","review":"This looks to be an excellent book as I am just learning the sax. It's well written and the CD cleverly has the sax on one channel and other instruments on the other so you can listen to the sax alone or play yourself with accompaniment. Be careful, though. Only one title appears to be listed with amazon.com but the book is published two ways: one for alto and baritone sax and the other for tenor and soprano. If you want the tenor version, as I did, you may need to investigate further or order the tenor/soprano sax CD, which is available separately. Excellent book, overall!"},{"Title":"Saxophone Method with CD (Audio)","review":"I am teaching myself to play Sax. Before I started I didn't even remember how to read music. This book has been excellant. It goes step by step, one note at a time and includes fingering chart and breathing techniques. I'm about 1/2 way through it now and am ordering book 2 for when I'm done. I highly recommend it for anyone serious about not just learning how to play, but learning how to play well."},{"Title":"Saxophone Method with CD (Audio)","review":"This saxophone book is excellent for the beginner saxophone player who is unfamiliar with reading music. It reviews and reinforces technique in simple text. I especially liked the easy-to-understand fingering chart, which is probably the best feature of the book."},{"Title":"Saxophone Method with CD (Audio)","review":"I purchased this book with the hopes of beginning my journey into playing the tenor sax. All you can see online when you purchase this book is the front cover which reads &quot;suitable for all types of saxophone&quot;. I chose to purchase this particular tutorial because it included a CD so I would know if I was playing correctly. When the book arrived, I was very disappointed to find out that the CD is designed for alto and baritone saxophone. There is a seperate order code in the book for the tenor variation, which I do not believe amazon.com carries. Just a word to the wise. If you are looking to play alto or bari, this is a good learning tool."},{"Title":"Saxophone Method with CD (Audio)","review":"When i bought this book, i payed quite a lot for it. I found it a little unchallenging, an overall good buy, but not one for the ambitious. The pieces are all a bit easy and when it says beginner to intermediate, &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; wasnt that difficult."},{"Title":"Host, The","review":"This is one twisted story and probably the most unique novel I've ever read. In recalling the plot, I almost remember The Host as a movie I'd seen. The characters and scenes are all so striking and memorable. I believe this novel would translate brilliantly to the big screen. The style of writing is somewhat reminiscent of Stephen King, but this disturbing, piquant, and at times, sexy piece of writing belongs solely to Mr. Emshwiller. Kudos!"},{"Title":"Host, The","review":"If the title of this review is not enough to make you want to read this fantastic (and fantastical) book, you're getting your entertainment in the wrong place. And if you haven't heard of author Peter Emshwiller yet, you must be living underground. Much like the protagonist. In the distant and not-so-pretty future. Somebody needs to make a movie out of this!!!"},{"Title":"Host, The","review":"This is a wonderful book, one that unfortunately is pretty hard to find now, so get one here if you can. I've read it a few times and must read it again. It's a page turner with some really cool ideas, basically a broad metaphor for the way we live now (as is all good sci fi). In the future, Watley Caiper is a young man with an odd wish--he wants to be a mom. But the corporate/oppressive government in future Manhattan puts contraceptives in the water (in this future, by the way, the rich live on a level built exactly five stories above the poor, in a city above a city--a real estate idea that no one should mention to Donald Trump). In order to get money enough to buy drugs to get fertile, Watley decides to rent his body as a Host. Basically, a host is a human virtual reality game: through a chip in the host's head, rich people inhabit the bodies of hosts and use them to do things they'd never do in their own skins, and the host can do nothing about it. The hosting chores go from banal to deeply sexual (and be warned, Emshwiller is a naughty boy--his future is a horny place)--but murder is strictly prohibited. Guess what happens when Watley hosts! And it goes from there, with Watley trying to figure out who killed someone with his body! Similar things have been explored in other big bidget sci fi flicks, so why it hasn't been made into a movie yet I don't know! That might be a blessing. They'll probably mangle it, add a ton of explosions, and rewrite Watley Caiper for Will Smith! Bye bye, the mother angle that makes Watley so unique. In any case, this would make a great sci-fi miniseries, and they could include the book's kinetic, hypersexy sequel, Short Blade."},{"Title":"Host, The","review":"The main premise of this book is that people (mostly the wealthy) can pay a human \\"Host\\" to temporarily occupy their body (the Host's body) and use it for whatever purpose floats their boat. Wanna go hang gliding but you are afraid that you might get hurt? Get yourself a Host. Wanna see what it's like to be the opposite sex? Get yourself a Host.Where has this author gone? Update: Peter is writing again! Yay!This is one of my all-time favorite books. I'd love to see this turned into a movie. Update - the book has been optioned by a big time fancy schmancy Hollywood producer. So fingers crossed, maybe we will see it made into a movie sometime soon."},{"Title":"Host, The","review":"Whoever wrote this crap is probably the kind of pathetic novelist who would give himself five stars on Amazon."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"This is an excellent step by step book how to draw animals with colored pencils. Anne Flood is an wonderful artist I never get tired looking at her work. I am a beginner artist and I have brought other art books online and I was greatly disappointed none of them were step by step as they had claim. After emailing the author about her book I decided to get her book at the library; I was not disappointed. I am glad I ordered her book. If you love animals and want to draw them; this is the book. I hope she does other art books."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"Animal portraiture - especially of beloved pets - can be a very satisfying artistic endeavor, both emotionally as well as financially. This book provides a great overview of methods, materials, and examples of drawing full color pet portraiture that should be tremendously helpful for beginners, as well as more experienced artists looking for some tips and helpful tricks.The author covers more than just cats and dogs, going into details and examples specific to horses, rabbits, exotic birds, and even hamsters! Her instructions for layering color to achieve depth and effects such as shine and reflections are clear and easy to follow. Colored pencil can be a tricky medium to work with yet it is also one of the best, in my experience, for capturing the intricacies of animal fur and feathers, and this book does a lot to make a difficult medium less intimidating.The only thing I could possibly have seen added to this book to make it even more useful is just some simple anatomical drawings of the animals included, at least muscle groups and/or skull structre. While this might be more useful for advanced artists, there is truth to the fact that \\"the camera lies\\" and an artist working from photo references, as is the focus here, can make his or her work even more realistic by knowing how to fill in the details that the camera can miss or distort. But this is a minor issue. In every other way I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"Outstanding book. Excellent results obtained immediately after just briefly reviewing the first few chapters. Wonderfully effective techniques. Easy to learn. Excellent format! I've been an Illustrator/ Artist for over twenty-seven years. I highly recommend this book.JF Willis"},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"Like so many colored pencil how to books, this book names specific colors to use. This is probably the only sure method to achieve the same look as the artist writing the book. I find this is often frustrating because I don't ever have the EXACT colors mentioned. I forge ahead using colors \\"somethng like\\" as close as possible to the recipe. Yes, this is like painting from recipes. I don't really approve of it all together, but I have to admit, if you do follow the directions to the letter, you most likely will find it easier to create your own mixtures. The examples are very well done. I particularly like the method of drawing the eyes in such a way as to achieve that moist and reflective quality. I would not have been able to get that look without following the pattern as prescribed"},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"This is the best colored pencil book for learning to master pet portraits on the market. Hands down!!! I own allot of art books and am a self-taught artist in colored pencil and believe me, Anne deMille Flood has done for pet portraits when Ann Kullberg has done for people portraits. I cannot possibly say enough about this book, but it's worth every penny and then some. You won't be dissappointed, except perhaps wishing she had a full series of these books."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"I'm 41 and am renewing the love of drawing and sketching that I lost when I graduated from high school. I just didn't have time for art in my life, but when I finally picked up a pencil and paper a few months ago, I immediately fell in love with drawing again. A friend gave me a beautiful set of coloured pencils as a gift, which is one reason I purchased this book, and I'd be thrilled if I could ever produce a picture as nice as anything done by this author. Her drawings are just gorgeous, and the book is worth buying just to look at the pictures.One thing I noticed is that the artist doesn't solely work with coloured pencils. In some images she uses gouache paints to draw whiskers, for example. It's a small thing, but worth noting if you hope to produce these images."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"I love this book. As an avid colored pencil artist, I refer to it frequently. I love to draw animals, and Anne gives great suggestions on how to achieve the realistic textures in fur, feathers, horse eyes, dog noses, cat whiskers....YOU NAME IT... Her basic exercises can be applied to drawing anything in colored pencil. It is very structured, some may even say too structured, but I think it is a great way to teach techniques. If you want to draw animals, this is a good addition to your library."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"While I am not currently interested in painting pets in colored pencil, I wanting to see how the author taught about values, proportions and light. I also like to compare author/artists in what tools and materials they choose. This book met all of my expectations."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"I bought this book with several others, and I just can't put it down. While it is true that some of the pictures are not photo-realistic, they are truly amazing. The author helps you with technique, and breaks down several aspects about animals that make drawing them difficult. I would have liked to know more about the whole body of the animal, but this isnt a drawing book, rather it is a technique book that covers the eyes, fur, feathers and to a lesser extent the expressions. She gives excellent advice on cat eyes to make them look liquid and translucent, and she breaks down some common mistakes. Overall an excellent book to own."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"Although this book had several good technique tips, I found that I had two problems with the instruction. First, it appeared as though there were 'missing steps' from some of the portraits. Attempting to follow along, the artist had noted that 'moderate pressure' was needed to achive an over-all blue. The blue appearing in the book was smooth, an almost painted appearance that I could not replicate, even pressing very hard with the pencil. My work retained the granular 'pencil' look. I know that there are mediums that can help to smooth out colored pencil, such as fast drying odorless paint thinner, but this was not mentioned in the instructions. Secondly, the colours she uses almost exclusively belong to the 132 Prismacolor Set, which is upwards of 200$. I do not think this book was written with beginners in mind."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"My daughter has used this book since she was 10 years old and really benefited greatly from it. Learning level is from beginner to intermediate. The step by step instructions include techniques and how to apply them in a drawing. Instructions will be clearer if you read the beginning that tells you how to use this book. Also helps the beginner if they do the \\"demos\\". Includes material list to use, although we found some of the items difficult to find and some could be substituted."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"Wonderful book. The Pet portraits are beautiful to look at. The instructions are detailed and easy to understand. I have purchased several colored pencil instructional books and this one promises to be one of my favorites. The techniques used to produce realistic animal fur and feathers are amazingly clear and easy to understand. Animals have different eye characteristics to humans. The instructions for creating realistic eyes is sensational. I look forward to putting the new techniques I've learned into practice. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all color pencil enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"I bought a used version of the book. It was satisfactory, minimally worn. I hoped to learn colored pencil techniques for fur and feathers. The instructions are very full and detailed, It will take me a long time to absorb all the information in this book. I look forward to it. I would recommend this book for someone who has already experimented with breaking down the colored pencil strokes with low odor solvent, turpentine or 91% rubbing alcohol..I just can't believe large background areas were tediously burnished with the tip of a colorless blender pencil, but I can be wrong. This talented artist probably did burnish with the colorless blender. I was grateful for the unexpected advice on animal eyes,noses and expressions. I'm going to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Realistic Pet Portraits in Colored Pencil","review":"This book would be less misleading if the \\"realistic\\" were left off of the title. The drawings are good illustrations, say for a children's book or the like. There's actually a couple included drawings that I had to wonder why they were included because they looked like good drawing for someone in highschool. Anyway, it may help if you really are just beginning to draw, but it was not what I had hoped for at all.

What a treasure! The author weaves together mathematical and scientific principles into a delightful story format. My kids had no trouble understanding the well-illustrated concepts.We used this book in our unit study on Ancient Greece. It just so happened, that during the reading, our Science lesson was on the six simple machines, a few of which Archimedes was the founder! As if all this isn't enough, my children took away with them an interesting outlook. We take the principles such as the center of gravity, buoyancy, pi, exponents, all that we know about geometry, etc. for granted. It's so much a part of our lives. This book helped us to imagine a time when these concepts were yet to be uncovered, an exciting time in the development of applied science and technology. It also helped us see Archimedes as a real man, and not just another boring scientist to learn about.Even though my kids are homeschooled, they moan and groan about their work just like any other kids. This book was still able to capture them. It was a great selection that complemented our studies very well, and was a good investment of time and money."},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"As a blind buy, but still needing an upper-elementary level book on Archimedes, I was more than happily surprised to see what an absolute gem this book was! Well written, easily understood, yet not too basic, the author weaves and explains scientific and mathematical principles in a story-like form that entranced my homeschooled fifth-grader. This is one he'll want to read over and over--not a book he felt he &quot;had&quot; to read. I highly recommend its purchase."},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"I have had an interest in buying this book for many years. It is recommended in virtually every reputable catalog. It just always seemed like when essential schoolbooks were purchased, it didn't make sense to purchase a book about just ONE person. Well, that was a gigantic mistake on my part. The accomplishments of Archimedes made him one of the most important founders of science. This captivating book tells the story of Archimedes life AND gives vivid imagery to his accomplishments through simple, effective text and delightful illustrations. From my 3rd grader to my 10th grader, they all eagerly finished the book with enthusiastic comprehension. Of course, the \\"Eureka\\" story stood out to all, but other concepts such as levers and water displacement were covered in a way that brought clarity to those scientific principles. So this book is not about one man, but a plethora of important scientific observations."},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"Not only is this book an educational and interesting read, it also inspires investigation into Archimedian principles and inventions.

Our favorite part is when Archimedes finally makes a break through with displacement and density and runs through the streets stark naked shouting, &quot;Eureka!&quot;"},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"Placing scientific theory in historical context is a concept that sounds dreadful. My children loved it. They adore the comic stories of Archimedes. My eight year-old son couldn't put it down.

What was even more thrilling, was listening to him apply the knowledge to everything from playing with Knex to a catapult."},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"Like others, I read this to my homeschooled children. After reading this book, I probably appreciated Archimedes more than they did. For adults and children alike, this is a great introduction to one of the world's (not just the ancient world's) analytical thinkers. This book presents a good mix of scientific education and humanizing biography. We learn that Archimedes died too soon as the result of a stupid misunderstanding, and the world was denied the other scientific advances that he could have given us."},{"Title":"Archimedes and the door of science","review":"This book is about Archimedes' life.

It may be the best book I have read this year, because even though written for young readers, it is packed with information.Ancient Sicily becomes accessible as a culture and lifestyle through this book. And Archimedes' discoveries are made clear through written descriptions and illustrations that are perfect for the text. The information about the way children were instructed in Syracuse, and then about how Archimedes furthered his education, was compelling. The love of learning shines in this book.The geometry chapters are advanced, but not too difficult. And the section about the war machines he invented was downright fun!There are immediate applications for learning at home -- creating mobiles to learn about centers of gravity, using levers and screws and pulleys, studying eclipses and the solar system.

I am reading through this with my 8 year old. My son loves biographies, especially older ones like the Discovery and Piper books. He dreads reading this book, probably because it is a bit more dry. Even though it has many interesting stories from Archimedes's life, it spends an equal amount of time explaining the scientific principles of what he discovered. We are learning a lot as we slowly plod through the book. It does include Greek religion and does not include a Christian worldview.

As a straight reader, I found myself engrossed in what is essentially a high-brow murder-mystery.Timothy Hasler, a brilliant Korean-American philosopher and linguist, has been knifed to death at the Pit, a seedy gay bar. Years later, John Marr, a Ph.D. candidate whose dissertation is based on Hasler's work, becomes obsessed with uncovering the circumstances surrounding Hasler's death. A gay man himself, Marr is outraged at \\"the self-righteous drivel\\" that one academician uses to excuse himself from completing a biography of Hasler---that is, he was horrified by Hasler's sexual tastes. In search of answers, Marr retraces Hasler's footsteps, even taking an apartment in the building where Hasler once lived. More and more, Marr turns up in quarters of the city generally avoided by the bourgeoisie.\\"In these doorways, bars, porn-magazine and peep-show shops, the movie theaters where sight itself is so dimmed, in such theatrical darkness true vision is ... largely absent. In one sense, all the encounters ... here take place on some dreary Audenesque plain where a thousand people mill, where no one knows anyone else, and there is nowhere to sit down. [...] Any exchange resembling real conversation takes place quietly and ceases when someone else walks by.\\"Hyper-educated, for the most part middle class, Marr unexpectedly finds himself involved in a series of intimate encounters with the homeless men in his neighborhood. His sexual exploits gradually drift further and further from the mainstream until a passage in one of Hasler's journal's makes perfect sense both to him and to the reader.\\" ...To live within the tethers of desire is-again and again-to be shocked at how far they have come loose from reason ...\\"Delany, however, is not merely interested in sexual liberation, in adults pursuing their desires no matter how bizarre (so long as everyone consents and violence is not involved), he meticulously presents an assertion that, like an image in a hall of mirrors, repeat itself, evolving into analogy and gaining in magnitude as it does. Take for example, the so-called \\"Hasler grammars\\", described as \\"the realization that large-scale, messy, informal systems are necessary in order to develop, on top of them, precise, hard-edged, tractable systems ...\\" In other words, clear and observable order is built upon a foundation rather nebulously composed of what would be considered chaotic. Apply this linguistic construct to recent Manhattan history and it is, in a sense, a message to Rudy Giuliani that without the city's underworld and its denizens, the law and order---the Disneyland---he so wants New York to be, simply could not be; one exists only in relation to the other.From the rarefied and esoteric to the instinctive and purely carnal, from the grand analogy to the concrete detail minutely observed, \`The Mad Man' is a dense weave that rivals Delany's most richly layered narratives. Recently re-released in an exceptionally handsome edition, I recommend it to any reader who wants an author to engage him, or her, in a multi-level game of chess."},{"Title":"The Mad Man","review":"The more I read of Delany, including his theoretical, non-fiction and autobiographical work, the more I recognise the incredibly skilful way in which he TRANSFORMS his experiences and desires into fiction. This book is a love story. Those who finish the book may agree with me; those who baulk at the sexual practices vividly (and, to non-enthusiasts, overwhelmingly) described may be baffled by this comment. Yet description of the central character's excitement in the gradual merging of his two interests (philosophical investigations and sexual investigations) is an extraordinary ride through emotion, thought and language. Times Square Red/Blue has hints of where some of the ideas came from. Bread and Wine probably more. This is Anti-Pornography - see The Scorpion Garden in Straits of Messina - a Queer affirmation and celebration. Read it for the superb writing as much as for the story, the politics, the sex."},{"Title":"The Mad Man","review":"While few will personally identify with the events inThe Mad Man, it's a book which is thought-provoking andchallenging in a very fundamental way. Delaney explores parts of the human psyche and sexual appetite which seem nearly impossible to understand, yet carries the willing reader to a point of insight and self-identification which seems surprising at the start. At times revolting,titillating, and bizarre, it's an always-fascinating walk down a path which few will travel in real life. At the same time, it's a mental &quot;gedankexperiment&quot; which will broaden the reader's idea of normal, and ultimately will change their worldview."},{"Title":"The Mad Man","review":"Some of the most breathtakingly beautiful prose I have ever read.Some of the vilest subject matter I have ever encountered.I have never before read work written by an author with a greater degree of self-loathing, loneliness, obsession, impotence and alienation, all expressed with little conscience, or self-consciousness, and so strangely lacking in sadness or regret. And I mean that to seem ambiguous as I don't know who demonstrates a greater capacity for the above, the characters or the author? Mr. Delany's characters often seem oblivious to anything but their own current needs.That said, seldom have I read any string of precisely chosen and arranged words which have as much beauty, grace, intelligence and power as revealed by this same work. Many of his passages are truly brilliant and striking in their ability to inspire awe.And how do I, as a reader, fit into the matrix? I could fling it away as something decayed and disgusting, but I don't. I become a willing, if reluctant, accomplice in the process.I have to wonder if the author is, partly, just shoving this type of work into the face of his reader as a demonstration of what he is capable of doing with subject matter that most of the reading audience would never touch with a ten foot pole. It's hard to fathom.Personally, I find myself repulsed and withheld all at once. I'm repulsed by these characters and their actions. I am deeply disturbed by their motives. I can find little common ground upon which I can even relate to them. I understand that these characters are supposed to be human beings and yet they are not human beings that I recognize. And still I cannot abandon a book as undeniably powerful as \\"The Mad Man\\". This I can only credit, I suppose, to Mr. Delany's talent. His mastery of the written word simply astounds me. He somehow allows me to participate in his creation against my better judgment, almost against my will. We walk a razor sharp line with this book and I have the scars to prove it. He succeeds here where I think he fails with \\"Hogg\\".I used to wonder why Mr. Delany would use (waste?) his considerable talent on subject matter such as that interlaced within this book and, especially so, in \\"Hogg\\". I don't wonder any longer. Honestly, I don't really care. He is the creator of his worlds. It's our choice to explore or not.What's this book about? It's a murder mystery. Who is murdered? A soul. Why? To be resurrected.Is this book worth reading? Yes. Whether or not it is readable is a matter for the reader to decide.This is how I can best describe my experience reading this book: Take a truly brilliantly and beautifully written and constructed book and then splatter it liberally with human excrement. Enjoy your read.Find some latex gloves and at least make the attempt. Wear a bunny-suit if you must. Perhaps even Mr. Delany would advise that you clean up well after."},{"Title":"Mosaics Inside and Out","review":"I'm just a beginner and have already picked up a few books, but by far this is the easiest to understand, I like how the book is laid out, the projects are wonderful, and after reading it from cover to cover I have a much better understanding of the art of mosaic tiling.I highly recommend this book, no matter what level your at."},{"Title":"Mosaics Inside and Out","review":"I met Doreen today and without knowing she wrote a book to inspire those interested in mosaics, we got to talking about what she and I both do.

I bought this book in April 2005 when my knowledge on thermodynamics was sketchy but my fasination on this machine was quite immense. As the book's title implies, this little piece of work is an introduction. Hence, please do not expect in-depth details or sophisticated technical treatments as these can be found in other texts on Stirling engines. However, for those who want to build a solid foundation in thermodynamics and the theory of heat engines in general including the mechanics of Stirling engines, this monograph is a great introduction.I was impressed by way Dr. Senft struck a balance between essential thermodynamic theory and its relevence to the fundamental design of Stirling machine. For example, a brief introduction and some technical treatments of Carnot Theory is introduced as early as possible in the book as this is essential for a proper exposition of heat engines, especially those operate with Stirling cycle. Without this, non-technical readers can only grasp a mere mechanical movements and their description rather than a clear understanding of the basic theory that underpins Stirling machine.Another point that worths mentioning is its comprehensiveness at an introductory level. How Stirling engines are classified according to their basic physical configurations and pros and cons of these configulations, an exemplified illustration, and the history of their development are organized in a cogent and highly readable manner.I personally have to admit that this little monograph is a great help to develop my solid understanding on both Stirling machine and heat engines in general.

It had recently been acquired from the Sioux Indians by the Federal Government, and was ripe for the taking by persons willing to abide by the rules of claim, which required living on the land for eight months. Eight months in South Dakota, in the dead of winter, in a wooden box called a house, about eight feet by ten feet in size. The only insulation was torn tar paper on the outside of a house which had no stove. When the snow didn't come through the cracks, the blowing sand did. Frozen water had to be melted for drinking, and there was no well on the land.This is the story of how they lived, endured, and survived, during their time on the land they claimed. Living through almost the same hardships of the Pioneers from 100 years earlier, they were miles from any neighbors, were terrified of the Indians, and for a while, had no horse. And no income.As I laid in my comfy, warm bed, reading this book a few years ago, I continually felt guilty, for my part, for what they endured to achieve what they wanted. We take so much for granted today, in our country, and never give pause to what those before us went through, suffered through, and the prices they paid. This is a fascinating look into a short period in the lives of these two sisters, and a reminder, that few things of value in life are easily obtained."},{"Title":"Land of the burnt thigh,","review":"This was a such a good book to read!

The British Colonel Nicholson is the exemplary solider; he is the epitome of courage, leadership, hard work and determination. These ideals become tangible when the construction for a bridge begins and Nicholson and his troops are required to build it in a Japanese labor camp.The novel is truly constructed from two different points of view: the labor camp with the construction of the bridge and the covert operation lead to destroy it. The narrative flips between Nicholson commanding his soldiers to work feverishly to finish the bridge to utmost perfection and a covert operation that is trying to blow it up. This leads to a beautiful narration technique as one side is putting their heart in soul to destroy the very thing the other group is building with the same fervent passion - even though they are both on the same side. This leads to an enticing climax that gripped me until the end.The books ending, which probably won't be that satisfying for most, does create a conflict between the ideals that everyone tries to be, things like determined, having integrity or prideful, and how they can actually make people lose sight of the main goal. A delightful read that I would suggest."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"Note: Your helpful votes are appreciated.

But there's an different atmosphere whenc ompared to the movie.As a book, it's fascinating. It's a fast read, with enough characterization but, at heart, you'll sometimes feel this is almost pulp novel. Don't get me wrong: it is not.Most of the changes made for the movie worked, all of them. Japanese Colonel Saito is less cliched. Joyce's character is much more important and well developed in the book thanin the movie, but it works. The greatest change was the Shears character. The movie only used the same name for a completely different character. But the essence was completely kept. Of course, the most obvious change was the ending itself. In the book, the mission fails.

He joined the French forces in 1939 Indo-China, then joined the Free French forces in Singapore. His book \\"My Own River Kwai\\" tells of his adventures, which parallel the story in his famous novel. It won the French Prix Ste Beuve and later was adapted into a famous film. It is fast-paced as some mystery novels.Boulle begins by stating \\"saving face\\" (refusing to acknowledge mistakes) was as important to the British as the Japanese. This is human nature, not part of any national culture. British prisoners were to build a railway to link the Bay of Bengal to Bangkok and Singapore. Could Colonel Nicholson's personality be defined as 'snobbery'? After being ordered to surrender Nicholson rigorously enforced the rules to provide irreproachable conduct. Anyone who left to continue the resistance was posted as a deserter. He insisted on following international law after being physically assaulted; he wanted to show the British officers were still in command. The prisoners were moved from Singapore to a prison camp in the jungle. They were overworked and underfed. No medical supplies were available for their malaria, dysentery, beri-beri, and jungle sores.General Yamashita told the prisoners they would mend the error of their ways by building a railway. Work keeps a man physically fit. \\"Be happy in your work\\" else they would be punished severely. The film softened the harsh treatment of the British prisoners. Colonel Nicholson objected to his officers doing manual labor and went on strike; he was punished. The British officers worked on its design and implementation to build a better bridge. Nicholson sought the advice of those who had been experts in civilian life. The purpose of the bridge over the River Kwai was to allow Japan to invade India and win the war. Those who did not perform their work would be shot. The British prisoners succeeded in building the bridge. The book's ending was modified for the film.[The bridge in the film was styled after the railway bridge over the Firth of Forth, a unique and over-engineered cantilever bridge. Colonel Nicholson got \\"maximum effort\\" out of his men by challenging them to be the best they can be. General \\"Frank Savage\\" used this same technique in \\"Twelve O' Clock High\\".]"},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"I thought this book was great. It's clearly one of the best books I've read. After reading a few chapters of the book, I got really into it. It's ending is awsome and unexpected. though it could have used a little bit more dialouge and more explanation in some parts of the book."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"This novel is very &quot;cut-and-dry&quot;, meaning, the pacing is very rushed, and the characters lack depth. Upon finishing it, I felt as if I'd just read a news article. Of course, it's based on a true story, but I would have expected the novel to contain more characterization and explanation of motives. Unfortunately, this was a novel about a fascinating EVENT; the characters were obviously secondary. The ending twist is very good, but it's just a shame there wasn't any real build-up to it. You will be more pleased with the movie, a true classic."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"Come on guys....The book is written in a matter of fact style that is neither terrible nor inspiring and the story is OK, although predictable from the very beginning. The worst part though is the author's continuous praise of the British - both how great the British officers are and how exceptional the common enlisted man is. Give me a break. The style is similar to other books written at the time so I can't ding it too hard for that but for the propaganda alone this book should be two stars. I give it three because of its status as a classic. Something maybe you should read so you can form your own opinion."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"A wonderful book filled with great symboliztion and irony, not to mention tragedy."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"OK. I don't normally (actually I never have) review a movie. I feel more comfortable with books. However, I reviewed Pierre Boulle's book last May and still see it as a Top 10 novel with great juxtapositioning of truly dicey moral issues.But a couple of weeks ago, I was at my local library and someone was returning the &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; DVD. I had seen the movie as a youngster and recalled that it deviated from the book to some extent, but nevertheless I wanted to see it again.Well, barring the fact that it was made in 1957 and it had some of those odd exchanges of dialogue that marked scripts of 50 years ago, it was a magnificent movie.Alec Guiness as Colonel Nicholsen was credible, understated, courageous, and faced with decisions alien to the world of a British Army Officer. All of which he played to Academy Award standards. Jack Hawkins as the head of Force 316, the demolitions group sent to blow up the bridge . . . 'bloody good idea, take a walk in the woods, lay some plastic explosive, and blow it up. Good show!' . . . . is excellent.But the biggest surprise was William Holden, absolutely brilliant as the American Officer in a role written for him which did not exist in the book, a man who escapes from the prison camp and is then hospitalized in Med Cruise splendor, who is then asked to go back and assist Force 316 in the destruction of the bridge. Holden, clearly an excellent &quot;big&quot; actor in the 50's and the 60's, only wants to stay in the hospital where he is recuperating and drink fine scotch and play with the nurses (it's 1957 so it's all very up and up). How he is lured into the mission and to see his physical demeanor and style change is very well done.Highly recommended. Larry Scantlebury. One time movie critic."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"It wasn't what I expected after the movie and I would like to see a different author take on this task of writing it."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"This is not one of those cover-all-the-details-of-a-battle or expose-the-brutality-of-war books. Instead of focusing on battles between men, this book focuses on battles within men. My brain joined the characters as they grappled with believable and conflicting issues like:- honor vs. survival- useful work that preserves dignity but helps the enemy vs. sabotage that undermines the enemy's plans and as well as personal dignity- pride of workmanship vs. the best interests of one's country- mission/orders vs. the value of human lifeThese and other issues get attention at varied intensity levels. They're all seen from the eyes of soldiers in a war zone, and it's not easy to determine the right thing to do. I got a window into the minds of the soldiers and enough detail to enable me to fully understand their dilemmas.This book is well-written, and the action is spread out such that I wanted to keep turning the pages. I'm glad read it, but I'm also glad I didn't have to live it."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"The charges are set against the pilings. The British commandoes lay hidden in the bush. The train is coming 'round the bend. Just then, a British colonel, a POW, takes a final walk over the bridge he helped build for his enemy and looks over the parapet. His blue eyes narrow. Something is wrong...Those of you who think you know what will happen next, from seeing the Oscar-winning film adaptation of this novel, may be in for a surprise or two. Author Pierre Boulle's point seems less about the folly of war and of racialism (as was the case in the movie) and more about how a blind work ethic can make one betray the very things one holds dear, without knowing it.It's tempting to look at this book and think of it as a literary dig at the proper, orderly Brits by a typically relativistic French author. But Boulle, a World War II French resistance fighter who was captured by the Vichy in the Far East, apparently wanted to use the real-life building of the bridge (in reality, there were two) by British POWs as an examination of how warfare tilts moral scales and turns lawfully-minded leaders into traitors.It's an interesting position, presented here more in the form of a quasi-fable, or more to the point, two short stories joined together. In the first, we see British Col. Nicholson face off against Japanese Col. Saito, who expects the British to resign themselves to servitude, officers included. In the second, we watch a trio of British green berets prepare their attack on the bridge.One of the movie's main characters, the one played by William Holden, is not in the novel, which is fine with me. I found the guy annoying. But the other characters don't come into greater focus for his absence.Instead, they are rather colorless, especially Saito, presented here as a brutal drunkard with none of the panache that director David Lean and actor Sessue Hayakawa bestow on the character in the movie. It's especially hard to like Nicholson when Alec Guinness isn't giving us a spoonful of sugar with all that thematic medicine. He's more of a martinet here, dense to the point of ridiculousness, like when a subordinate suggests they paint the bridge after building it.\\"The most we could do would be to give it a coating of lime - and a fine target that would make for the planes, wouldn't it,\\" Nicholson counters. \\"You seem to forget there's a war on!\\"That's about as close as the book comes to humor. It is tense at times, but slow-moving, and like other reviewers here I found the book lacking in narrative detail that would have made it feel more alive. It's a quick read, worth reading especially if you enjoyed the movie. But I missed the Nicholson Guinness played in the movie, and if you were a fan of the film, so will you."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"Very different in many ways from the Academy Award winning film, the short book is well worth reading in its own right. It's somehow bleaker and more disheartening, sort of a war noir. Interestingly enough Boulle also wrote &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"A great classic, in the tradition of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. This book could have been much longer, the author could have written hundreds of paragraphs of descriptive imagery, explored the relationships between the principal characters in greater detail, but didn't, thus adding to the fable quality of this narrative.The story presents us with a concise portrait of one of the most basic motives of the human animal - the desire to do something great. Whether it is more noble to build or destroy is a question the reader will have to decide for himself."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"Pierre Boulle equates the ritual of the Japanese with the ritual of the British. Lots of room for disagreement here. Few people would disagree with the more American view that being a captive of the Japanese in WWII could well be a sentence of death. But of course, Boulle is French so that explains some of his xenophobia regarding either country.The fact is, the moral issues are carefully presented. The soothsayer, Major Clipton, goes back and forth with the concept that imprisoned men with nothing to do often die of despair.The time is 1942 in a Japanese prison camp. Conditions are atrocious. The Japanese are building a train route between Burma into points north. The route will carry men and machines to further the Imperial Japanese aims. It is early in WWII and the Americans (there are none in the book) and the British have pretty much been spanked by the advancing Japanese. Read retreat. Reat surrender. Read a long time in a jungle prison camp. Read dysentery, diphtheria and malaria.So Colonel Nicholson's, he's the British ranking officer,isn't stupid. He knows that without some form of discipline many of his men will give up. The evil alcoholic prison warden, Colonel Saito, is his counterpart.With concessions, Nicholson agrees to build the bridge crossing the 600 foot wide Kwai River. But should he do an acceptable job? An above average job? Or should he do the best possible job imaginable, a credit to the British Army, lasting into and beyond the next century?Major Shears and his demolition team from Force 316 rendezvous in Siam (that's how old the book is) to blow up the bridge. And all three forces meet, Nicholson, Saito and Shears.Certainly up there in the top ten books about the war. Read in conjuction with Katzanbach's \\"Hart's War\\" (For God's sake, skip THAT movie)or Jmaes Clavell's \\"King Rat,\\" all about the morality of prisoners of war.5 stars. Could have been 6 or 7."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"Bridge Over the River Kwai is a very interesting novel depicting the true story of POW's from a Japanese Labor Camp who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese war effort. Although the novel can be dry at times, the descriptions of camp life and the grueling work conditions come alive, putting you right there in the thick jungle next to some sweaty G.I.s. Plus the underlying issue of personal desires getting in the way of the big picture (the Allied war effort) is undeniably strong and is a lesson in life that everyone should be exposed to. Bridge Over the River Kwai is a definite &quot;must read&quot; in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"True story of WW II Japanese prisoner of war camp in which Allied POWs are forced to build a railroad bridge to benefit the Japanese war effort.

Overall the novel makes for relatively quick reading and doesn't bog down in complexity as some books do for better or worse. The plot essentially follows two parallel stories heading towards an intersection at the climax. One story is a satirical tale of a British POW colonel who's pride lead him to help the Japanese build a railway bridge at the expense of his suffering men. The other plot line follows a trio of British commandos planning on destroying the bridge. Parts of the book are quite close to the film although major differences exist as well (e.g. no William Holden character, somewhat different ending). Like the film, the novel is highly fictionalized. For a more accurate depiction of the Thai Burma railway I would recommend Ernest Gordon's memoir \\"To End all Wars\\" or the somewhat fictionalized film adaptation of the same name. Overall \\"The Bridge over the River Kwai\\" is a readable book but one that doesn't in my opinion equal the film. It held my interest but was certainly not exceptional."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"I just unearthed this novel from the dusty basement of the local used bookstore. Having seen the movie years ago, I began to read with certain preconceived notions of inspiring scenes filled with British pluck and whistling good camaraderie. Indeed the book delivers that, but there's so much more here than the cinematic version or at least that film as viewed by a decades-younger me.The story unfolds as a war of bloody-minded officers, Japanese vs. British, and, ironically, British vs. British. Insofar as the British colonel triumphs nobly over his Japanese counterpart, the conflict driven by honor, courage, and ideals, this reader felt a sort of jingoistic pride in Allied heroism. But the final definitive battle of wits, oddly, occurs between British officer and British officer. The Force 316 operative, working feverishly to destroy the bridge, spurs himself on with a mental image of huge shining letter that spell DESTRUCTION. Meanwhile, our would-be hero of a colonel back at POW camp completely forgets his duty to country so blinded is he by his own inner shining word: CONSTRUCTION.The movie provided a last minute, feel-good meeting of British minds. The ironic conclusion as originally conceived by author Pierre Boulle, however, changes the entire bridge-building enterprise into an intensely personal quest for self-aggrandizement. No saving last minute grace here. Boulle's story, turns out, is more satirical than inspiring.I'll be turning this book over in my mind for weeks to come."},{"Title":"The Bridge Over the River Kwai","review":"I first knew about the book and the movie, \\"The Bridge Over The River Kwai\\" through a French daily newspaper back in 1952, when I was in Hanoi, North Vietnam.It took me 6 years before I could watch the movie in 1958, when I was in Saigon, South Vietnam. But in this lapse of time - 1952-1958 - I'd had a chance to read the book in French, English and Vietnamese. I have enjoyed it so much that so far I have read that book about 30 times. Pierre Boulle really made a profound and detailed study of each of his main characters, and each has his own reasons to behave the way he does, to talk the way he should, and to act the way most suitable to his culture, to his concept of courage, discipline, obedience and honour.In July 2009 I met a young American missionary couple at a friendly dinner in Clermont, Florida. We accidentally talked about \\"The Bridge Over the River Kwai\\", which they had heard about, but not read. But in return, they introduced me to the book \\"To End All Wars\\", a true story written by Ernest Gordon, a survivor of a Japanese camp among many others along the River Kwai whose POWs had been forced to build the Burma-Thailand \\"Railroad of Death\\" which would permit the Japanese to control the Southeast Asia. Both books dealt with the same period, the same situation, the same locality, but most of all the same extreme suffering brought by war -- and both became Academy Award-winning motion pictures.I ordered \\"The Bridge Over The River Kwai\\" from Amazon.com in August to give to the new friends I met in Florida, as I believe this is one of the best novels I have ever read.An 81-year-old Vietnamese-American lady reader."},{"Title":"The Best of Taste (Williams-Sonoma)","review":"Beautiful photographs, well laid out lists of ingredients, not a book for someone just starting out as cooking instructions are pretty terse."},{"Title":"The Best of Taste (Williams-Sonoma)","review":"\\"Good taste is one of those elusive qualities that most people find hard to define, even though they know it when they see it.

This book fails to meet my expectations because it's all theory; written by academicians for academicians. For example, in the sections on spectral analyses and wavelets the authors briefly describe what each is, provide equations for generating the curves, but do not explain under what circumstances one would select this analytical approach over others, show how to apply it to real data (all data are contrived to better illustrate concepts), and -- most importantly -- how to interpret the results.

Heavy losses from 1941-1943 threatened to starve Britain out of the war. It was only in late 1943, early 1944, when Allied tactics and technology finally adapted, that the tables were turned and the U-Boats were the ones sent to the bottom.But what makes this book a stand out is the first person descriptions of the fear, drudgery, exhilaration, camaraderie, and tragedy of war at sea during those days.

The genre of wartime experience is a very big one, as of late, most people have been re-discovering memoirs of the Pacific War due to the new HBO Series, \\"The Pacific.\\" Having read many works in this area as well as some non-fiction histories by popular historians like the late Stephen Ambrose or the late Canadian historian, Pierre Berton, I'd have to say that this novel is one of the best. It has well-drawn characters and the intimacy of a very realistically depicted war at sea. There is none of the false bravado and theatrics of the movies. Instead, the war described on this pages is frequently monotonous, and frustrating in the extreme as the corvette attempts to destroy the submarine packs attacking the convoys. There are moments of great intensity and even horror as they fail to stop the enemy or are required by their orders to abandon, or even harm shipwrecked sailors who are in between them and enemy subs that they must try to destroy. It is a wonderful story and very well-rendered in this audio-book, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first read this book nearly 40 years ago and remember then finishing it in a single day - well perhaps two. It has to be the consummate novel of war. It oozes truthfulness, at least by my perception, and therefore stands as a history of a desperate, desperate time. By the second year of the Battle of the Atlantic things looked truly grim and it is a testament to Churchill, I suppose, and to the extraordinary courage of these men, so vividly portrayed, that Great Britain prevailed. I cannot imagine living through such experiences which just seemed to go on and on. The novel's style remains strangely undated. It could have been written yesterday.I recommend Cruel Sea without reservation."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A brilliant book later made into an outstanding film by, I think, Ealing.

Both take place in small warships which is conducive to revealing personalities and dynamic group psychology. The reader sees the action primarily from the standpoint of Keith Lockhart, a former journalist who begins as a freshly minted volunteer reserve officer. His character resembles the author, Nicholas Monsarrat, who was RNVR himself, served in and eventually rose to command both a corvette and frigate during the war. Nearly uncontrollable bureaucratic forces at play as the war drags on leads to a greater impersonality as humanity seemingly loses out to weapons and toughness as they move from the 90 person crew of the corvette to the 170 of the larger, more capable frigate.In comparing \\"The Cruel Sea\\" to his other war book, \\"Three Corvettes\\": the former, a bestseller, is a better structured story, while the latter, a rivetting first hand account actually written during wartime is better journalism."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is excellent literature, a wrenching novel, a superb sea story, and entirely faithful to the history of World War II in the North Atlantic. Monsarrat's personal experience combined with his eye for detail make him an extraordinary writer. His prose will transport you to the very moment that he describes. This is an authentic classic and a must-read for everyone who would go to sea, as well as for every student of WWII. I've re-read my well-worn copy several times over thirty years."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I first learned of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" from the U.S. Navy's recently revamped reading list. After reading the book, I can see why it was included on the list. It provides a first-rate, historically-accurate account of the Battle of the Atlantic, in which Great Britain endured a systematic commerce destruction campaign by the German U-Boat fleet.Nicholas Monsarrat allowed the reader to join the crews of the ill-fated corvette \\"Compass Rose\\" and the luckier frigate \\"Saltash,\\" by individually describing the lives of various members of the crew. Primary attention is paid to the Captain, Cmdr Ericson, and the Exec, Lt Cmdr Lockhart. On the pitching decks of \\"Compass Rose\\" during a winter transit of the North Atlantic, Monsarrat investigates what is necessary to forge a crew from conscript civilians, and to meld them into a fighting unit. From experience, I can say that he captured the way that the \\"personality\\" of a ship develops, based upon the varying personalities in the crew.Monsarrat is a good writer, and he definitely draws the reader into his story. I almost felt physically cold when he described the trials that a sailor undergoes in a winter storm. It definitely brought back some memories of my own North Atlantic experiences.I did not like everything about this book, however. Monsarrat went to a lot of trouble to develop the personalities aboard \\"Compass Rose,\\" but paid curiously little attention to the crew of \\"Saltash.\\" Perhaps he was running out of time or interest in writing, or maybe he wanted to indicate that a larger ship is more impersonal. In any case, I felt that the reader missed out due to his decision. Also, the love interest of Lockhart appeared to be out of place in the book. It was unnecessary, and took up space that could have been devoted to the story line.Do not let the above detractions prevent you from reading this book. This book is a must-read for World War II history buffs, as well as for leaders wanting to learn from challenges that Monsarrat placed before Cmdr Ericson.

Gripping, acurate and well recommended.PS Also read Alistair MacLeans \\"HMS Ulysess\\" for a similar read."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This book literally changed my life.In the eleventh grade in Greenville, South Carolina, i had an English teacher who designated Thursday as &quot;Free Reading Day&quot; and encouraged the entire class to read anything they wanted to (well, within limits -- &quot;Playboy&quot; would have been Right Out, i'm sure.) -- and, in case you had nothing of your own, she laid out an assortment of magazines and books on a table at the front of the room.On that table, one Thursday, was a copy of &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. Since i've always been at least a bit interested in sea stories, and it looked interesting, i picked it up. From the first i was hooked solidly.In the next three or so years, i reread it twice at least, possibly more than that.And then i joined the Navy -- and i am sure that it was because of what i read in this book, and what i sensed behind it, in what Monsarrat -- who, like his viewpoint character, Lockhart, was there from the beginning, working his way up to command his own ship before the end of the war -- didn't so much say as assume about the sea and the Navy -- *any* Navy.Monsarrat presents us here with a brotherhood of the sea, corny as that idea may sound. Sailors, more than the other Armed Forces, tend to regard other sailors -- even enemy sailors -- as brothers in arms, and, as Monsarrat says, the only true enemy is the cruel sea itself.As he shows us here, the sailor who was your enemy five minutes ago, who was trying to kill you as you tried to kill him, is merely another survivor to be rescued from the cruel sea once you've sunk his ship.And, even more so, as Monsarrat portrays it, there is a kind of brotherhood that binds sailors in the same Navy together in very mcuh a family manner -- you may not like your cousin, but you want to know what's happening to him and, when all is said and done, he IS your relative.The best summation of this sort of attitude (which i felt to some extent myself during my time in the US Navy) comes when Ericson, the Captain, is touring his new ship as she stands under construction in a Glasgow shipyard; he meets one of his future officers, and mentions the name of his previous ship, which was lost with over three-quarters of her crew, and realises that&quot;He's heard about 'Compass Rose', he probably remembers the exact details--that she went down in seven minutes, that we lost eighty men out of ninety-one. He knows all about it, like everyone else in the Navy, whether they're in destroyers in the Mediterranean or attached to the base at Scapa Flow: it's part of the linked feeling, part of the fact of family bereavement. Thousands of sailors felt personally sad when they read about her loss; Johnson was one of them, though he'd never been within a thousand miles of 'Compass Rose' and had never heard her name before.&quot;To be part of a band of brothers like that is a proud thing, and Monsarrat captures it perfectly.He also captures the terrified boredom of being in enemy territory with nothing happening as you wait for the enemy to make the first move, and the shock, confusion and horror of combat (particularly sea combat, in which the battlefield itself is the deadly, patient enemy of both sides).And he captures the glories and rewards of life at sea, the beauty of a glorious clear dawn at sea, the stars and the moon and the wake at night and so much more.This is the book that made a sailor out of me.It will tell you what it is to be a sailor."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"\\"The Cruel Sea\\" focuses on the British naval experience during World War II--more specifically, on the crew of a corvette during the first half of the war and, to a lesser extent, of a frigate during its waning years. Like most war stories, the plotting is at times necessarily predictable (yet still thrilling), but Monsarrat's epic is a cut above in both its human element (even in its occasional depiction of Germans) and in its presentation of the morally gray aspects of war. This is no ode to blind patriotism. Instead, the novel is an elegy on the selfless bravery and selfish survival instincts of a group of sailors whose reasons for being in the war are as varied as the men themselves: the stern but fair-minded Lieutenant-Commander Ericson, the indolent and tyrannical (and somewhat comical) First Lieutenant Bennett, the nervous and self-doubting Sub-Lieutenant Ferraby, the level-headed and thoughtful Sub-Lieutenant Lockhart (who, I would guess, is Monsarrat's alter ego), and a supporting cast of dozens. There are some spine-chilling and devastating battle scenes, but the book never once loses its focus: the men (and women) who fought and endured the war.Another surprising aspect of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is its intense lyricism. There are many sentences and descriptions that linger in the mind long after one has finished the novel. The death a crew member: \\"He did not exactly surrender to the sea, but he stopped caring much whether he lived or died; and on this night, an ambiguous will was not enough.\\" An officer finding out his girlfriend is pregnant: \\"The child would be the occasion of their marriage, not the cause for it.\\" Equally impressive is the novel's unusual wit--humor far beyond the stereotypical bawdiness of sailors: the friendly banter between crew members, the scrapes between men on leave and family members or other civilians, the hilarious clash of cultures when the frigate is docked for repairs in New York City.Generally, I am averse to \\"war novels\\" (with the exceptions of the usual famous classics); I'd rather read the real thing--journalism or history--and forego the shallow characterizations and poor writing so common to the genre of military fiction. So I can't explain what caused me to pick up this 500-page book, but I am certainly glad I did. This novel is a neglected classic and should be read by an audience far beyond the aficionados of war novels."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is an exciting and yet very poignant novel of naval warfare which took place in the North Atlantic during World War II. It focuses primarily on two English naval officers whose job it was to escort--with first an inadequate corvette and then a frigate--the numerous convoys that went back and forth across the Atlantic throughout the course of the war.It was a difficult job to begin with and got worse: by 1941 Allied shipping was being destroyed by German U-Boats at an alarming rate. During one memorable journey, eleven of the 21 ships they were sent to escort were sunk. This was an enormous toll, both in supplies and in lives lost.What this great book does is give us a first hand view of the action, and also the effect that it had on these men, and the lives of those around them. To be sure there is blood and gore here, but it is not sensationalized or glorified. It is simply recorded in a straightforward manner, and is all the more chilling because of it. What is really emphasized is the psychological effect. We get a clear picture of their exhaustion, their fear, their terror, and their frustration in their inability to deal effectively (at least early on), with an unseen and deadly enemy.They are at sea for months at a time and incapable of dealing with family problems on shore: philandering wives, sick mothers, far-away sons and loved ones. Their homes and villages are being bombed. They begin to feel hatred--not only of the enemy, but of the ship itself, and all that it represents: exhaustion, terror, helplessness, and death.The captain must make terrible decisions at a moment's notice. After one attack, he steams towards where he believes a U-boat to be, an area which also happens to be occupied by English survivors of an earlier wreck. He decides he must drop his depth charges, knowing for certain that these sailors will die. Later, he agonizes over whether there was a U-boat there to begin with.We get a sense of the dangerous nature of the sea itself. There is no place to go during wild Atlantic storms, and sometimes they last for days. Everything in the ship is tossed around. There is no hot food. Sleep is impossible when you are routinely thrown out of your bunk. Everybody is banged and bruised and sometimes severely injured by suddenly being heaved against a bulkhead. Of course there is also the terror of being swept overboard entirely. The only saving grace was that, during a storm, the U-boats didn't attack.The book covers this aspect of the war, and covers it thoroughly, from 1939, which is chapter one, to 1945, which is chapter seven. It is written from the perspective of adult men and women we learn to know well and come to care about deeply. We are saddened when they are wounded, or killed. And the termination of the love affair between the first mate and his \\"Wren\\" was nothing less than heart-wrenching. This is a great novel, and belongs on the shelf with perhaps the half-dozen or so of the greatest novels of World War II."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is perhaps the finest novel written out of World War II. It is drawn on the actual service in the Royal Navy of the author. It is the story of two ships, maybe 200 men, German submarines and the constant relentless ocean. Even when there is no combat action, the sea is always there in all its forms - just waiting for a small defect to occurr and then it will claim another victim - be it man or ship.The sailors of the Compass Rose are a dramatic cross section. The captain is a reservist from the merchant navy while his officers are all volunteers from the civilian sector. One officer's only sea going experience is crossing the channel in a small yacht with a one woman crew. Not the best of material.The crew is even more diverse. The senior ratings, coxswain, signalman, engineer and several others, are all professional Royal Navy and it is one these men the captain will lean the most. The remainder of the crew is drawn from all walks of life from clerks to vet assistants. Together they are all molded into a working crew.The contacts with the German submarines are numerous but the end result is disappointing to some in that only two submarines are sunk between the two ships. Lots of survivors are pulled from the sea though as the submarines whittle away at the convoys chugging across the sea.One gets a sense of the unending grind that the men endure as the ships make thier rounds from Liverpool to New York with a side trip to Russia for variety. Even shore time is not enjoyed as the local Liverpool area is pounded by German bombers and wives and girlfriends are not willing to endure the constant seperation.Compass Rose is sunk and the crew, once more, is held together by the captain. Some men are heros and die a heros death and others are simply freightened men trying to stay alive which few do. It is a sobering time for the survivors as they look back at their life in Compass Rose.The captain and one officer move on to another ship and finish the war in her. Again, it is a return to the grind of fighting the sea and occassionally fighting the Germans. One submarine is sunk by the new ship and the war ends.There is little glory to be earned in this story, rather it is a tale of survival, hanging on to make it through the day or night. Everyone is a hero in this story from the junior sailor to the captain. It is a story that is being remembered less and less as the survivors of World War II diminish in numbers. It is a story to be read and remembered - when there was no array of electronic weapons and nuclear energy to draw upon to destroy an enemy; rather it was skill, patience, persistance and a willingness to endure that saw a successful outcome from a combat between corvette and submarine. Sometimes the corvette won and sometimes the submarine won. Many times it was a draw.I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the war at sea during World War II. It should be in every naval officer's personal library regardless of nationality. Once read, it should never be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is absolutely one of my favourite books, and I'm reading it for the 5th or 6th time right now.Based on his real wartime experinces, the author creates a fascinating story of &quot;one ocean, two ships, and some 150 men&quot;. Living from day to day through the horrors of naval war in the North Atlantic with the wonderfully-crafted characters, one is only beginning to imagine just how terrible it must have been. You breathe with them, you fight with them, you sleep with them and you live through their good and bad times - finding yourself unwilling to put this book aside.Read this book, and Buchheim's &quot;The Boat&quot;, and you can truly say: &quot;Now I know what it was like!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"37 years ago in high school English class we were challenged to read The Cruel Sea. I have never forgotten the flaming seas, the U-boats hiding under floating survivors, the cruel consequences of war, the noble Captain, the obnoxious crewman with his mouth of insults I had to ask my mother what they meant. A young girl, age 16, never read a war story, loved this book and never forgot it."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I found this book purely by accident, thanks to a recommendation by another book review. I think this is perhaps one of the finest novels about combat, certainly about naval combat, that I have ever read. Every word rings with a sense of authenticity and drama that is all too often missing from modern literature.I'm loathe to give away any plot detail; the story builds slowly like a fine meal. In short, the book concerns itself with two warships during escort duty during the whole of British involvement in WWII. The first ship, a Corvette, is small and perhaps a bit amateurish to begin with. Its history, and the relations of its crew are treated in intricate detail. The second ship, a Frigate, is larger, less personal and much like the war more mechanized and colder; its is more effective, to be true, and a step closer to victory but also represents a loss of humanity.Monsarrat weaves these two stories into a seamless whole - the bood deserves to be called an epic, and at times I almost felt like I was watching an old British war film, like Sink the Bismarck: every word rang true. I had one small complaint, and that involves either a misplaced death near the end of the novel. Again, I don't want to give anything away but it just felt unnecessary.Please, read the book. If you are at interested in Naval history, or just want a good read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Take it from a retired naval officer, this is one of the best novels ever written about war at sea. Monsarrat explores the savage and relentless nature of the struggle against the U-boat menace in the North Atlantic. The sailors' enemies were not just the lethal German submarines, but miserable weather, bad food, wretched accommodations, physical and mental exhaustion, and emotional havoc. I wonder -- could I have stood the test?"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"&quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; was recommended to me by my mom who read it as a young woman when it was first published. I was skeptical about reading this epic of WW2 battle at sea -- thought I wouldn't want to read about war in great detail -- but I found that the pages turn themselves. It is a GREAT book -- expertly constructed and beautifully written. It is an insight into the human spirit in a time of war, but it also works so well because it does an amazing job of making the ship itself a living, breathing character, in whose destiny one becomes intimately wrapped up. The copy I have is from the 50's and I'm thrilled to see it is still in print, though not surprised. The book is a true testament to the fact that GOOD WRITING, on any subject, is fascinating and stands the test of time."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Nicholas Monsarrat's superbly written \\"The Cruel Sea\\" captures in fiction the essence of the Battle of the North Atlantic in a way that a history could not. It describes, at a very human level, the desperate struggle to safely escort convoys across the North Atlantic in the face in incessant Nazi submarine and aircraft attacks. On the success of the these convoys hung the outcome of war; without them, the Allied war effort would have ground to a halt and Britain would have starved.The narrative of \\"The Cruel Sea\\" centers on two men and two ships. George Ericson, a middle-aged commercial sea captain and Royal Navy Reserve officer, is recalled to the fleet in 1939 to lead the newly commissioned corvette HMS Compass Rose. Also central to the narrative is young Lockhart, a very green and newly commissioned Sub-Lieutenant who will grow into a fine naval officer and Ericson's \\"Number One\\" on both the Compass Rose and a follow-on command, the frigate HMS Saltash. \\"The Cruel Sea\\" is populated by an astonishingly rich cast of supporting characters, including ship's company at sea and wives and girlfriends ashore.The story itself, richly informed by the author's own experiences at sea in the Second World War, is that of the convoys. The Compass Rose and the Saltash will spend weeks at sea, sheparding merchant vessels under wartime conditions, enduring the harsh weather of the North Atlantic, and fighting the Nazi onslaught. It is a fight that calls for patience, endurance, skill, and cunning, much of it learned the hard way, on the job. The fight will demand the utmost from the men of the Compass Rose and the Saltash, making heroes of some and breaking others. Monsarrat captures it all in superbly readable, often lyrical prose: the mundane routine, the terror of combat, and the heartbreak of loss.\\"The Cruel Sea\\" does not attempt to glorify war. Monsarrat faithfully describes the huge human cost of war, in the strains on tired and frightened men, the struggle to acquire and keep the hard edge necessary to kill in combat, and in the sometimes unsuccessful effort to have a normal life ashore.This book is very highly recommended to the reader interested in the Battle of the North Atlantic and to the reader looking for a superb novel of the sea."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I enjoyed it.

As a former naval officer, I can attest to the authenticity of the descriptions of the sea, the consequences for the crew of heavy weather and the anxiety of going into battle. But what makes this particularly compelling is the way Monsarrat develops his characters, both underway and ashore. Even bit players in this drama are fully revealed as real people with genuine strengths and weaknesses, all sharing the experience of life on a small ship while leaving their wives, families and girlfriends at home. Not everyone is a hero in this story, either. It's easily among the most important works of naval fiction written about World War II.

I wonder if it is still recommended in school-I consider it one of the great ones."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The more I read this book,(having read it on six previous occasions),the more I want to read it. The best book ever written about war at sea. Nothing else come close."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Not for those who fear the stormy seas, this authentic novel will have you grasping for steady lines as you live the life of a convoy patrol in the North Atlantic during the early years of World War II. Like life itself, in heroic situations, all who serve do not live as heroes. Nicholas Monsarrat brings this classic tale of adventure to life as only one who really knew the Cruel Sea could do. This book is best read on Kindle as references to obscure nautical terms such as asdic, (Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee) are used and the Kindle dictionary and Wikipedia are invaluable resources to better enjoy this fine book. A mistaken notion of war at sea is thinking the story is about ships in conflict. This story rings with reality because it portrays war at sea as one of men in conflict. Under pressure of such conflict judgement is questioned and enemy and ally alike are strained to find correct answers.In the final court of judgement, it is the sea that holds supreme, the sea, the Cruel Sea."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea is a grab you by the throat hard and gritty story of two small RN ships and their crews in WW II. It's not a happy story as it's filled with misery and suffering which makes it all the more compelling. While the movie based upon this book was good the book is far more realistic and true to the events of the day. I've read this book at least four times over many years and each reading was every bit as good as the first. If you have seen the movie than you should purchase and read this book. If you like WWII Naval fiction than this book is a must."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is an absolutely thrilling, gripping, involving story of war at sea. I have no disagreement with those who say this is one of the best novels to come out of WWII. I've had a copy with me through the years, ever since I first read it in high school. Monsarrat has a beautiful feel of the language, made more so by his own familiarity with the subject at hand. Every time I pick up the book and reread passages, I am still enthralled by the fine writing. There is even a lovely, poignant love story in the middle of it. Here is a passage describing nothing in particular, merely the ship &quot;Compass Rose&quot; when the convoy was a quiet one and the men aboard her could relax a bit:&quot;They found that some nights, especially, had a peaceful loveliness that repaid a hundred hours of strain. Sometimes in sheltered water, when the moon was full, they moved with the convoy past hills outlined against the pricking stars: slipping under the very shadow of these cliffs, their keel divided the phosphorescent water into a gleaming wake that curled away till it was caught and held in the track of the moon....Compass Rose, afloat on a calm sea, seemed to shed every attribute save a gentle assurance of refuge.&quot; (p 105, 1951 Knopf edition)There was a movie made by the British earlier on, with Jack Hawkins as Ericson, the captain. The plot obviously had to be shortened, and I think the love story was changed a bit. The novel is better, still, and I do hope that they do NOT try to make another movie of it, for surely the Hollywood treatment will only cheapen this superb piece of work."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Finding an original hard cover version of this novel was quite a chore but well worth the wait. Monsarrat follows the exploits of the crew of a British corvette and later a destroyer as it escorts trans oceanic convoys during the battle of the Atlantic. The officers and crew are continually pitted against an always lurking pack of determined German U boats. The tension created as a result of the staggering losses of ships and human life and the battle of nerve and wits between the opposing commanders is gripping. Monsarrat does some wonderful character development of the crew members, showing how the strain of war creates serious personality changes. Its seems as if Monsarrat has served in the Navy as the authenticity of his story seems beyond question."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read about men at war, with each other yes because they have to be, but mainly with that cruel mistress the SEA. The characters are dynamic, and you find yourself, cursing their enemy as if it were your own. I would recommed this book to anyone who enjoys either the sea or stories about men at war. The only comparable book is Jan de Hartog's The Captain, However this book is far better."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is no ordinary blood-and-glory sea story, with a ship full of heroes who can do no wrong. Here is real life - the misery of North Atlantic weather, in a small ship rolling constantly in the tremendous swell. An untried and amateur crew aboard a newly built ship are pitted against an omnipresent and invisible enemy below the waves, who is able to mark ships and sailors for death seemingly at will. In perhaps the most bitter fight of WW II, the crew adapt and learn, making Compass Rose a highly effective weapon against the German U-Boats.Written in 1951, Monsarrat bases his story on his own experience as first officer of a corvette on convoy escort duty. He clearly identifies with his primary character, Lockhart, who joins HMS Compass Rose in 1939 as a very junior Sub Lieutenant. The people and ships are fictional, but this is nevertheless a true and moving story. A brilliant story, totally unforgettable!"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The cold gripping fear, frustration,and agony of the convoy escorts in the North Atlantic during WWII. The physical and emotional sacrafices of the men assigned to escort duty to protect the life blood of Great Britan. Monsarrat is a fantastic story teller, filling the reader with emotions in a way that very few writers will ever master. The realization that Command is really lonely,and the second guessing of descisions is a tough pill for Captain Ericson to swallow. These sailors are not Regular Navy from a Family lineage of Naval service, rather the average Joe brought together by the war. Yet they form a strong fighting unit. As as in every war, death is not picky about whom it takes. A great book that will be hard to put down till it is finished. Give it some time and you will read it again."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"SUPERB BOOK, a Classic I use this title because the story is written from the viewpoint of a RNVR Officer (a prewar voluntary reserve officer, background and qualifications yachtsman). I mention this because having a father that served on USN convoy duty before the war started (USS Jacob Jones), and having lived in the UK amongst many who also served in the war, I realize now that the book and the film provide an accurate and vividly emotional portrayal of what it was like. Also, add to list of why &quot;There will always be an England&quot;"},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I have read dozens of WW2 novels and histories, but this is the perfect melding of the two genres, having been written by a veteran of the Battle of the Atlantic. Realistic and empathetic, it is an acccurate reflection of the times as they were, and not an imagined scenario. Having myself toured a WW2 corvette which is moored in Halifax (NS) harbor, I so clearly imagine life on the first ship described, and the challenges these men faced."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I am a big fan of military history.

The personal stories of the captain and several crew members, while somewhat necessary, were overdone a bit."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Most enjoyable. Certainly a credible story and episode of the Royal Navy in World War II. Loved all the characters who were a most believable bunch, and not just a passing thought in Mr Monsarrat's thoughts, to fill up spaces."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"A must read if you love sea stories. Author gives you memorable characters. Unsung heroes in the war against German subs."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a story of men against the sea. It happens to be during WWII but it could just as easily been during the days of sail. It is about the sea and what it does to men and how men still attempt to conquer it and always faily. A draw it the best man ever accomplishes."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a five star book. It is dated to the extent that it is about WWII but still gripping and moving. I felt like I knew the very people described in the book and could empathize with them. Written by a Brit about British seamen, it is told from their point of view which just reflects that they carried most of the early parts of the war, especially at sea. I would recommend it to anyone interested in WWII particularly if they are interested in ships and seamen."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Cruel Sea. Great sea story brought to life. How little me knew of the Atlantic convoys during WW II, and the dangers they faced.

The Cruel Sea tells us how to behave during a conflict - be loyal, resilient, and have faith in ourselves and our comradesI re-read this book every few years and each time I am impressed with the characters, settings, and the lessons that Erickson and Lockhart teach us. And each time I feel better about people and their potentials. This book stays in the current section of my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The late Nicholas Monsarrat's The Cruel Sea (originally published in 1951) is a powerful and riveting novel of maritime endurance and daring set in the North Atlantic during World War II. Carefully scripted and written, the reader is drawn into this story of the British ships Compass Rose and Saltash, and their desperate cat-and-mouse game on the high seas with Nazi U-boats. This fine trade paperback edition from Burford Books will introduce a whole new generation of action/adventure enthusiasts to a truly skilled and engaging writer whose ability to involve the reader from first page to last is rarely equaled and never surpassed."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a wonderful book. I first read it twenty years ago and have re-read it twice since then. Nicholas Monsarrat is a superb writer and he gives an exciting account of what it must have been like to be aboard British corvettes in the North Atlantic during World War 2. The ships were small and the risks were great. Although a work of fiction, it comes out of Monsarrat's first-hand experience. I look forward to reading The Cruel Sea once again and strongly recommend this excellent book."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"It's a pity this book's out of print. I read it for the first time in a Dutch translation when I was 17 years old. It made a deep impression on me. When I read the English version, fifteen years on, this impression was even deepened. What the people on board of the cargo-vessels and warships that crossed the North-Atlantic during WW II had to endure is almost beyond description. Monserrat did a terrific job doing this. I was captured from the beginning to the end. I myself being a ship's captain was moved deeply by this story of the sea, the war and the movings of small human beings caught in between. Anything Alistair McLean might have written about this subject is put very much in the shadow by this terriffic book."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I read a lot of military fiction, ranging from \\"it's all glory\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but wish they had, by \\"it's all hell\\" stuff by people who've never heard a shot fired in anger but are trying to send a message. Somewhere in the middle, with a bit of both aspects and a lot of experience, are the relatively few novels written by guys who've been there, writing from experience about situations that closely paralleled what they went through - a bit of hell, a bit of glory, and a lot of detail.The Cruel Sea sits near the top of the latter category. Nicholas Monsarrat was a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and spent his war on small ships, fighting German submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic. The main character of The Cruel Sea, Keith Lockhart, is a journalist who was commissioned into the Navy at the start of World War 2 and...It's a first-rate book. Even without Monsarrat's biography, it's obvious that he knows what he's talking about; it shows in the details. Most military fiction has a certain amount of scenes away from the front, dealing with the main characters' personal lives; The Cruel Sea has the same, and does it excellently... by no means glamorously (there's one particular thread, about a lieutenant's unfaithful wife, that is the antithesis of glamor), but very realistically; the scenes don't seem at all tacked on \\"to give the fighting men a human side\\", but feel like - and are - an integral part of the book. The characters are the same people in a London bar or in the middle of the Atlantic; you get the feeling that most of the people, and most of the incidents, are based on real people and situations that Monsarrat either knew or knew of, during his time in the war.A certain, very small, percentage of military fiction transcends the \\"military\\" label - fiction about people, in a military situation. The combat isn't the focus of the story; it's simply a part of it. Life at sea and character development take precedence over fast-moving plots; there are, realistically, no individual bad guys (how many soldiers or sailors know the names of the men on the other side?), but the work is executed well enough that a plot would feel irrelevant.I've read hundreds of books of military fiction. A bare handful are as good as this one. Thoroughly and absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"Andrew Mendelson's review mentions a &quot;misplaced death&quot;. He misses the point it was as un-necessary and as useless as many in the war - and that is one of the points of this classic war novel. Monserrat writes well about the sea because he was at sea and this story is one of his strongest because he tells it from the point of view of someone who witnessed it for real.The Cruel Sea is an extensive fictionalising, reworking and fleshing out of his wartime short stories &quot;HM Corvette, East Coast Corvette, Corvette Command&quot;, published during the war when it was quite clear he did not expect to survive the Battle of the Atlantic on which the bulk of the Cruel Sea is based. The Cruel Sea is taughtly drawn, superbly observed and records the transition from amateur civilians into trained professional killers with all the physical, and emotional casualites that were incurred along the way.The 1953 movie (also available on Amazon) is also a good adaption of the tale."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"If a one-word review were acceptable, it would just be: &quot;Great!&quot;. You're living through the career of a moderately able submarine hunter in WWII. Like in real life, he was out there in a nutshell called a &quot;Flower class&quot; corvette, facing the stormy North Atlantic and loads of prowling German subs. Have you ever wondered how those heroes' lives really were like? You will live with the corvette's green crew through their hard training, through endless boring hours of seasickness, through personal problems like bad superiors or unfaithful wives, through mobbing and loneliness,... You will see ships around them explode and sink, till finally - oh, I shouldn't spoil the story, should I?A fascinating book, I couldn't stop reading day and night. Try to be part of WWII, let your imagination play, don't watch movies...If you're interested in more of it, try the other side of the coin, as described by Lothar Guenther Buchheim."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"The Battle of the Atlantic is often referred to as a crucial campaign in the history of World War II; in keeping the sea lanes open throughout the war, the Allies kept the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in the fight and began the build up for operations in the Mediterranean and in Europe. Popular and historical focus in the Battle of the Atlantic often falls on the German U-Boats as their captains' daring and their crews' boldness make for more dashing stories. In contrast, technologies such as radar, sonar and the cracking of ULTRA are often credited with winning the battle for the Allies, and little attention is paid, generally, to the ships and men who fought the Germans and prevailed in the Atlantic.The Cruel Sea is their story. It is the story of a British destroyer tasked to escort Allied convoys across the Atlantic. It relates the entire course of the war, and illustrates the challenges that the British Navy and the Allies faced at various points in the Atlantic: manning ships with draftees in volunteers in a time of war, the the fear and uncertainty of pre-radar/sonar escort operations in the early years of World War II, and the slow and gradual triumph over the U-Boats after 1943. The Cruel Sea also is a gripping story of human nature, providing insights into loyalty, leadership and courage through the actions of its characters.The Cruel Sea is not a book about war; it is a book about people, men mostly, in a time of war and how they react to adversity. As literature, it is beautifully written, a masterpiece. The author crafts his words so that the reader is gripped by prose as well as by the action and flow of the story. It was a joy to read. The Cruel Sea is a valuable bit of history as well, shedding light on a service and a battle that few know about beyond devoted students of World War II."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"I've read this one several times over several years (first as a college history class assignment), and it still amazes me how Monsarrat is able to capture the spirit and tribulations of men at sea during war time. If you're at all interested in WW II or naval operations, you must read this book, as Monsarrat penetratingly explores the psyches, motivations and character of the book's principal characters. As the war in the North Atlantic goes on, the reader grows with the characters - who are for the most part Royal Naval Reservists or newbie volunteers, rather than professional Royal Navy &quot;lifers&quot;. Together, the men and the ship go through their shared baptism of fire against the U-Boat scourge during the dark days of 1940-1942 convoy duty. This book, like Alistair MacLean's HMS Ulysses, is a true naval history classic. Don't skip it."},{"Title":"The Cruel Sea","review":"This is a naval story set during World War II. That should put off no one. Monserrat is a trul fine writer, who grips any reader so well with his detailed story about intelligent, able, men going about a horrific duty, taking every precaution available, grittily making plans to cope in the midst of danger, but knowing that their risks are great, and catastrophe frequent. It is truly a wonderful book - a wonderful mix of characters (and the author is as interested in character as plot). I would truly and strongly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE BOY IN THE GREEN SUIT","review":"With no money in his pocket and no visa in his passport, Hillman finds himself not in Ceylon, but in Athens.

But most of the time there is no work, and Robert is forced to hitch rides, beg and barter his possessions to survive. Finally he ends up in a prison on the border of Pakistan, where he finally begins to see and accept who he is and to find the acceptance he has long craved.Intertwined with the travel tale are tales of Hillman's childhood and of his family, particularly his father's tale of struggle and sorrow.

Had numerous pictures of early Baguio."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"EYE OF HEAVEN is, by no means, an ordinary Doctor Who novel. Instead of moving from beginning to end, Jim Mortimore chose to tell the story out of order, flashing backwards and forwards using multiple first person narratives.Does it work? Surprisingly so. EYE OF HEAVEN would have been a rather straight-forward story otherwise, involving a long sea voyage and Easter Island's statues. Instead, by shifting back and forth through the story, Mortimore is able to raise the suspsense level in an almost lyrical fashion.EYE OF HEAVEN was Leela's first major outing in the Who novels, and it worked surprisingly well. I wouldn't recommend this style for all books, or for even most stories. For this, though, it worked admirably. The resolution of the plot is a bit flimsy, but the rest is enjoyable enough that it's not as big a deal as it would have been. Lots of fun for the reader who's ready to be challenged."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I must admit that I felt a little disapointed after reading this book. The sea journey promised to be quite a rousing sea adventure, but I kept being sidetracked with ill-placed chapters of previous events. If Mr. Mortimore had decided to tell this tale in chronological order (no pun intended for you Dr. Who fans!) the book would have been so much better. Saving graces: I liked how he kept switching the narrators; giving the reader a chance to see how other major characters felt and thought. We even get to learn how the Doctor thinks. Using him as a narrator is an unusual plot device, one I'd like to see again. I also enjoyed Leela's importance in this novel. She was always one of my favorite Dr. companions, and I'd like to learn more about her in future novels!"},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The Doctor decides to respond to a call for sponsors for an expedition to Easter Island by Horace Stockwood, whose previous expedition thirty years previously ended disastrously, including the death of his partner. The Doctor and Leela accompany Stockwood's expedition.The book falls into two parts: the journey and Easter Island. There are a number of incidents on the journey there, making the first half of the book something of a sea-road trip. And then Easter Island, including the mystery of the well-known giant head statues.Probably the best aspect of the book is the concentration on Leela's character. She was popular on TV, but this book truly concentrates on the noble savage in less-than-noble civilisation that makes Leela unique amongst the Doctor's many companions. Many little details of her life as part of the Sevateem are revealed, so if you are a Leela fan, make sure you get this one.On top of this, the story is good. Some parts did press very hard against my suspension of disbelief, but it never got to the stage where I couldn't accept the book.Worth a read."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I think a lot of people have focused on the manner in which the book is written - with the story events told out of order. Some have seen this as an innovation, others have found it confusing.It would have been innovative if it wasn't for the fact that, with careful reading, the holes became apparent. It strikes me that the author probably jotted down a few ideas and then rather than try to work out the story that tied them all together, tied together what he could and then left the disparate sections as they were in the hope that no-one would notice the gaps.While the book does try to surprise the reader familiar with Leela by focusing on her as the central character it fails to explore fully her sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around her. It fails to balance her background with the new vistas each journey with the Doctor exposes her to. Quiet often there are contradictions in the character both within the book and set against the original TV series.If you want a book that ignores the TV series and tells part of a story in an interesting way then you might like this. If you want a book that uses the characters from the original series, takes what we know of them and tells a good story (regardless of whether the timeline is linear, in reverse or in disparate pockets) - then look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This one tends to get mixed reviews but I do have to give the author points for attempting something decidedly different. An adventure featuring the Fourth Doctor and Leela, it basically requires them to go on a long boat voyage, get menaced and/or attacked several times and finally get involved in the mysteries of the giant big head statues of Easter Island. The plot, when strung out in a linear fashion is really pretty straightforward, but what Mortimore does is complicate matters by having the chapters go out of order, so that different parts of the story are being told simultaneously. I'm not sure yet if this is good literary technique or just a way to beef the story up, it does add a certain level of suspense because you are constantly cutting to new situations without knowing what happened in the intervening time, forcing you to keep reading until all the plots catch up to one another. It does also force you to pay attention because even though the plots are decidedly nonlinear, there's no way to really tell what's happening when, so you have to really focus on background details and who knows what at what time. It's novel because I'm really not used to putting in that level of effort into a Doctor Who book, and while I'm not certain it's totally effective (toward the end I have no idea what's supposed to be occurring in what order) it does make the book stand out. The other sort of innovation, at least for the line, is telling the entire tale via first person narration. This makes things interesting, again, because all the experiences are subjective and you aren't sure who knows what when, or who's even lying about stuff. Leela comes off the best in this and the story really is a showcase for her . . . although newcomers to the character are going to be totally lost, as we're not given a whole lot of exposition on her background, so while she seems like savage jungle woman all the hints about being part of a readapted survey team from the far future are going to fly over everyone's heads. But the chapters narrated by her wind up being the best, as Mortimore seems to have a fairly good handle on the character, contrasting her natural instincts with her ignorance of most of the world. The chapters with the Doctor tend to fare the worst, as exciting as it is to get a peek into the Doctor's thoughts, a lot of it winds up being devoted to whatever special ability he uses to get out of a particular situation, so he doesn't seem alien as much as a guy with superpowers. As seen through other characters, you do get a good sense of Tom Baker's whimsical and commanding version of the Doctor, however. The book also gets high marks for not going with the typical alien threat, but in order to get to that stuff you have to deal with pages of people running around on boats, or discussing boats or being flung off boats. Reaching Easter Island almost feels like an anti-climax, and that's probably where the jumbled narrative does the most damage. But the author gets full credit for trying something decidedly different, and the nature of the island is a nice change of pace. Even if the experiment doesn't exactly succeed, I think we'd all think a little less of the BBC line if they didn't try something like this every so often."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This is a magnificent novel. So it doesn't quite resemble the Leela you know and love, eh? Well, this is who we all wanted her to be. Get your small minds out of the wastes of the ho-hum-ness of the TV-show-like tedium of so many of the Who novels that merely attempt to recreate the three sets and ten characters of the TV stories. This is one of the best Who novels by one of the best Who novelists, Jim Mortimore, whose every book I admire -- flawed or not.Eye of Heaven is challenging, but mind-blowing-ly huge. The Leela here is far more than what you've seen before. The opening on to another world through Easter Island and the whole passage to it in the first half of the book, tying the needle through the \\"eye of heaven\\" at the center of the novel, and then passing backwards back out into our world again at the end, it's all a fantastic ride. What an imagination Mortimore has!Don't avoid this one, folks! It's one of the very best Missing/Past Doctor Adventure novels. It's on the level of The Witch Hunters, The Plotters, The Dark Path, Last of the Gaderene, Tomb of Valdemar, Managra, and The Well-Mannered War. Treasure it."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Eye of Heaven is setup by the Doctor thinking that Leela needs to know more about her past. So he takes her to Victorian England and quickly finds an expadition he would like to fund. So the Doctor buys a ship (one of the rare examples of the Doctor using his wealth) and hires a crew to take him and Leela to Easter Island.The most interesting thing (and admittedly the thing which scared me the most at first) is the use of a first person anrrative throughout the book. My experience with first person narrative, for the most part, has been negative. Aside from Robinson Carusso (damnit, I KNOW I'm spelling that wrong), it's been tough to find a book that does it right. Suprisingly Eye of Heaven does just that. It pulls off a brilliant switching of narrative between Leela (giving us an excellent outlook into her life, past and amusing religious background), the Doctor (suitable vague) and the supporting charecters. Up until the very end this works well. There is a short chapter or two where this falls completly flat, but for the most part this is executed suprisingly well.The story itself is quite gripping. There is a genuine mystery about the origins of the Moai (the Easter Island monoliths) and the fate of the islanders. It only falls flat towards the end. The origin itself falls quite flat (why would an alien race use huge rocks to spread a virus) and the sense of wonder about them is obviously pulled directly from Contact (at least the author is honest about his infuences).One of the most refreshing things about Eye of Heaven is that there are no visits from &quot;guest stars&quot;. The BBC line was beginning to feel like the DWM strips in that a return villian had to show up in each story.Overall a great read which expands the boundaries for Past Doctor Adventures, but also another victim to the rushed resolution syndrome."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Overall the novel was a pleasure to read. Jim Mortimore is masterful at portraying Leela. The way Mortimore described the 4th Doctor's companion forced me to completely re-think of what I thought of her -- this aspect I found to be the most pleasant experience while reading the novel. There are many memorable moments in the book especially during the trip back to Easter Island. I did find, however, that some of the sequences were somewhat difficult to understand but near the end of the book it made sense. The novel had a well-balanced plot and the pace was consistent throughout."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"One star as we learn a bit more about Leela, yet her character is written as one step above a chimp in attitude and language. The first person narrative is very confusing as with over six major characters, you never know who is speaking until three lines into their speach, not to mention where they are in the story. Overall a minor sci-fi new concept but for me, the worst 4th Dr. book in my collection."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The narrative is told in an extremely disjointed fashion for no discernible purpose, other than to indulge in rather tedious foreshadowing, or perhaps to disguise the fact that, told in a straightforward narrative style, the plot is tedious int he extreme. Additionally, for purists of the series, the character of Leela bears almost no resemblance to the series character and is portrayed more as if she is Superman's sister than a real human being. There is a sequence when she is in the ocean--fighting off sharks and giant squids, and hitching rides on whales and surviving tornadoes, etc., etc. that is simply too ludicrous for words. As with most of the Doctor Who novels put out by BBC Books (and, for that matter, the earlier novels from Virgin), it would also benefit from tighter editing and a reduced page count."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The only reason I gave two stars to this book is because of the insight into Leela's character. Leela's first person narative is very interesting. Read the first half and skim or skip the rest."},{"Title":"Eye of Heaven (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The main detracting factor of this book is the fact that it is written &quot;out of order.&quot; That is, it keeps going back and forth, telling events that happened later before events that happened earlier, and then back again. Also, it is written entirely in the first person, though the person from whose perspective each chapter is written changes from chapter to chapter, and one is left to figure out who the narrator is by the context.For those who enjoy experimental types of reading, you might like this book.

Could not recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"More Bench-Tested Circuits: Innovative Designs for Surveillance and Countersurveillance Technicians","review":"On its own this book is not worth the money, but if it's regarded as the companion to the earlier volume it is just worth the money, especially if it they are both offered together for a reduced price.As before, the book is a random collection of circuits, most of which are old, well-known (but also reliable) technology.Despite the title there is nothing in this book that you could not find in any good text on electronics design or acoustic engineering; indeed that's what the professionals would be using. But for students who are bright but directionless \\"design a bug for the principal's office\\" is always a better motivator than \\"read chapter six and attempt the odd-numbered questions\\". For security professionals it defines the lower end of the threat spectrum - not what government agencies are using.Some, such as the intrusion alarms, present yet more variations on circuits provided in the first book. Some, such as the subcarrier decoder, should have been in the first book. Some, such as the component analayser used to sweep for hardwire or phone taps are interesting, but a lot of hard work. Others, such as the proximity detector, may not work at all in practice.The circuit designed to destroy hard-to-get-at bugs is almost guaranteed to kill you. The timers are nasty. If the stories you hear are true, people who want you to design timers are going to use them to commit arson - or worse. Avoid them!Many circuits make use of specific devices from Radio Shack that are unobtainable outside North America.Taken all together, a bit of a mixed bag.A word of caution here. Most governments have made illegal the construction, possession, distribution (by sale or otherwise), use or use of material obtained from eavesdropping devices except in special circumstances so you are advised to check your local laws if you want to do more than read this book.On the other hand, successful prosecutions are rare and similar devices are openly advertised for sale. Detection of these devices is difficult. Any competent hobbyist could produce this equipment from readily available components or by disassembly of consumer items.But before you go into business consider this advice. Whether your clients are cops, spies or gangsters, they are eavesdroppers and conspirators - they are inherently untrustworthy. They don't regard you as an electronic genius - you're just the hired help, some geek who is useful but expendable. Look after number one! The smartest player is often the one who does not join the game."},{"Title":"More Bench-Tested Circuits: Innovative Designs for Surveillance and Countersurveillance Technicians","review":"I would strongly suggest that the would be purchaser look else wear !

Janiskee, Ken Masugi (Rowman &amp; Littlefield) This collection has its origins in a scholarly conference and has been enhanced with more recent contributions. The Claremont Institute celebrated California's one hundred fiftieth anniversary of its birth by hosting &quot;Democracy in California: Sesquicentennial Reflections on Equality and Liberty in the Golden State,&quot; October 27-28, 2000. The editors of Nexus, the law and policy journal of the Chapman University School of Law, graciously offered an issue of their journal for the revised papers from the conference. Many of the articles in this volume first appeared in Nexus. We thank them for their generosity, especially editor-in-chief professor Hugh Hewitt, professor John Eastman, and managing editor Jeanette Lee.The essays presented a political and legal history of the development of a Progressive regime and its conditions of freedom. To this end, the conference sought to emphasize the themes of political philosophers such as Aristotle and Alexis de Tocqueville and the statesmanship of Abraham Lincoln and thus help foster a new generation of scholarship on California. We later obtained the participation of not only established scholars of California but also others whose expertise would profitably be directed to California issues. Obviously, the essays could not cover every important element of its culture or politics, yet we hope nonetheless this collection might guide serious students in the way they study this vital state.Often lauded as having the fifth (or sixth or seventh, depending on what measure one uses) largest economy in the world, California seems to lead the nation in other measures as well-particularly cultural and political trends. But were it an independent state, it would be one of the world's strangest democracies. Understanding this strangeness, this exoticism, was our task. Even before its national preeminence, and well before the staggering budget crisis, the need to understand California as a necessary part of understanding America was abundantly clear. In order to understand, to quote Abraham Lincoln, &quot;where we are and whither we are tending,&quot; we were forced to reexamine the political principles of the Compromise of 1850, of the early state constitutions, and of the American founding, just as we must keep in mind the mores and practices of American citizenship. The essays strive to make these connections and thus lead us to self-knowledge. They had been organized into four themes: the conditions of democratic statehood; Progressivism and its statesmen; mores, multiculturalism, and citizenship; and the future of Progressive democracy."},{"Title":"The California Republic: Institutions, Statesmanship, and Policies","review":"The California Republic Institutions, Statesmanship, & PoliciesBy Brian P. Janiskee and Ken MasugiReview by Courtney RosenbladtKarl Marx once said that \\"'the most important thing' to have occurred in America was 'the discovery of gold in California.'\\" While this may have been a bit of an exaggeration, the Gold Rush was certainly the impetus behind the creation of one of the most interesting, and at times the strangest, states in the Union.California undoubtedly has bizarre politics. In a year's time, it has re-elected Gray Davis, only to recall him and replace him with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. It has offered a haven for homosexual marriage on the steps of San Francisco's city hall. It is still attempting to offer drivers' licenses to illegal immigrants. While some look at California with admiration, others view the state with revulsion and are relieved that they have avoided or escaped the borders of the \\"Left Coast.\\"In The California Republic: Instiutions, Statesmanship, and Policies, Brian P. Janiskee of CSU-San Bernardino and Ken Masugi of the Claremont Institute explore how California has become what it is. Specifically, the aim of the book is to \\"explore the evolution of Progressivism in California and its contemporary policy consequences.\\" The book also explores how \\"the role of government became transformed-from the earlier one of protecting equal rights...to one guaranteeing minimum levels of security and comforts for all,\\" as a result of Progressivism.The California Republic is a collection of essays written mostly by university professors and historians, but it also includes journalists and notables such as Dan Walters, Ward Connerly, and Victor Davis Hanson. The book is arranged topically and is in relatively chronological order. It begins with the founding of the state and its first constitutional convention in 1849, and ends with modern policy issues such as affirmative action, gun rights, and the \\"water problem.\\" But the continuous theme throughout the book is Progressivism - its birth and the effects that are still felt today in California.The Progressivism discussed in this book is not the radical liberalism the term now denotes; in fact, the first Progressives were radical Republicans. California Progressivism would be impossible to understand without a discussion of Hiram Johnson, \\"the father of the modern state of California,\\" who was elected governor in 1910 and remained a California statesman until 1945.Johnson became a household name during the recall election since he was responsible for instituting the recall process in California, along with the initiative and referendum, which have become increasingly popular ways for the people to bypass the inept state legislature.While Johnson and other Progressives supported \\"dramatically increased government power,\\" they also believed in individualism. They essentially mixed the individualism of Thomas Jefferson and the statism of Alexander Hamilton to create Progressivism. According to contributor Scot Zentner,\\"Johnson...was neither a classical liberal nor an abject socialist, but one who thought of himself as holding on to some kind of individualism, albeit an individualism regulated by the tender and caring state.\\"Although Johnson supported a strong centralized government, he became dissatisfied with FDR's New Deal because it had become too regimented. The Progressives wanted a government with a greater moral and maternal responsibility, one that would be \\"personified as a feeling and compassionate being.\\" From Johnson's viewpoint, the state \\"now would provide 'care and tenderness' to those harmed by society or otherwise unable to find success within it.\\"Even though Johnson did not approve of FDR's cold administrative state, his ideology was the beginning of California's current mindset. According to Zentner,\\"[In] Johnson's theory of government, the primary task of the state was, in fact, to provide, through its expanded regulatory and redistributive powers, a much fuller reconciliation of private and public interests than had been thought possible before the Progressive era.\\" It is easy to see how Johnson's ideology has slowly become the socialism that now exists in California.While it would be impossible to cover all of the essays in this book with the attention they deserve, there is one in particular that stood out to this reader, and, ironically, it has the least to do with California politics directly.In John Marini's essay \\"Western Justice,\\" he explores the Hollywood Western. Westerns arrived on the scene in response to \\"the intellectual triumph of Progressivism.\\" Instead of approaching history from the perspective of right and wrong, these new historians talked about \\"socially acceptable behavior.\\" According to Marini, \\"The Western movie was intended to fill a gap created by the abandonment of the heroic understanding of the past.\\"While \\"Progressivism looked to a glorious future...the implicit premise of the Western was that our fathers were better than we are.\\" Hollywood filmmakers such as John Ford and Sam Pekinpah could approach topics such as law, justice, and heroes that had been abandoned by the \\"professionals\\" in academia and the culture. Ironically, the only place where one could find human greatness celebrated, virtue extolled, and vice condemned was in a fictional setting.One need not be from California to appreciate The California Republic, especially since the effects of Progressivism have been felt far beyond the borders of the state. This book is for anyone who appreciates history, politics, and public policy. The essays in this book may be read from cover to cover or independently. They are appropriate for personal enrichment, but are also sophisticated enough for the classroom.Courtney Rosenbladt is a fourth year Classics major at UC Irvine. She is also the managing editor of the Irvine Review, the sole conservative newspaper at UC Irvine."},{"Title":"The California Republic: Institutions, Statesmanship, and Policies","review":"This is a very interesting collection of essays on California politics, each revolving in some way around the influence of the Teddy Roosevelt-era Progressive movement (as distinct from the modern \\"Progressive\\" movement which is simply a euphemism for socialist) on the particular subject matter. Many of the essays are not in depth enough (film, Prop 209, gun control, Nixon, etc.) and leave the reader a bit unsatisfied but the others more than make up for it, and of course the reader may pursue all of these topics on his own. My only complaint is not with the book per se but with the fact that there needs to be a new edition as so much has happened in this state since this book was published (the book ends with Gray Davis' recall still up in the air). It would be very interesting to hear what the authors would have to say about recent events and whether their positions would change at all. There is an air of optimism ('hope' may be a better word) in the book that I suspect may be diminished to some extent. A very worthwhile purchase if you are interested in California politics in any way."},{"Title":"The California Republic: Institutions, Statesmanship, and Policies","review":"Professor Ken Masugi says it's good and that's sufficient for me!"},{"Title":"Madeline in London","review":"For this fifth book in the Madeline series, Ludwig Bemelmans decides to do several things a bit differently. As always we begin with the old house in Paris that was covered in vines, but this time the twelve little girls in two straight lines each do their own illustration to help set up this tale. As we know, next door in another old house that stood next door lives Pepito, the son of the Spanish Ambassador, who is sent to England. The little girls all cried: \\"Boo-hoo--We'd like to go to London too.\\" Given that the title of this book is \\"Madeline in London,\\" that seems likely to happen.In London, Pepito stops eating and grow fit, and his mama figures out it must be because her son misses Madeline and the girls. So the Spanish Ambassador invites them to the embassy and Miss Clavel and the girls pack and catch the next jet. There they find a birthday present for Pepito, and then take a tour of London town, from Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace to Drury Lane, London Bridge, and the White Tower. In London there is no need for Miss Clavel to wake up in the middle of the night or run fast and faster to some new disaster. That is because this time the disaster has to do with Pepito's present and Miss Clavel is not responsible for it (that is, until the end of the story).Young readers who liked \\"Madeline's Rescue\\" because of Miss Genevieve will be inclined to like \\"Madeline in London\\" because it also deals with pets. I was a bit disappointed that there are not as many wonderful full-color illustrations of the sights of London as we usually find in the Madeline stories set in Paris. Those illustrations are often the best part of Bemelmans' stories, as he goes beyond the simple yellow painted pages to more complex pictures. \\"Madeline in London\\" was originally published in 1961 and it turns out to be the last time Bemelmans did his signature yellow pages, as the sixth and final story, \\"Madeline's Christmas,\\" will be entirely in color."},{"Title":"Madeline in London","review":"As with all the Madeline books, this one is simply wonderful and an absolute joy to read!

Born in Austria, Bemelmans became an American citizen in 1918. He wrote many books for children and adults and was also an artist. But Bemelmans will always be best remembered for \\"Madeline\\", with her spunk, audacity, and mischief. I have been enjoying revisiting the Madeline stories with my four-year old granddaughter.This book moves from Madeline's accustomed surroundings in \\"the old house in Paris covered with vines\\" to London and back again. The book features Pepito, the son of the Spanish Ambassador who lives next to the \\"old house\\". Pepito is also a character in \\"Madeline and the Bad Hat\\" and in \\"Madeline and the Gypsies.\\" When the Spanish Ambassador is reassigned to London, Pepito becomes wan and lonely. Thus the Spanish Ambassador invites Miss Clavel and her twelve charges, particularly Madeline to hop across the English chanel for a visit to celebrate Pepito's birthday.Our thirteen wanderers arrive in London without a suitable birthday present, and they take it upon themselves to give Pepito a horse. The mischief begins. The horse takes off for a jaunt through London carrying Pepito and Madeline on his back. After a merry chase, the trio is recovered. The unfortunate horse does little to endear himself to the family as he enters the Ambassador's garden and devours the vegetables and flowers. Madame Ambassador has had enough. At the end of the visit, as Madeline, Miss Clavel and the eleven other girls return home to Paris, they take with them a 14th traveller.The illustrations are in Bemelmans's freestyle, yellow, black and white with some full-color drawings as well. Scenes of London and its palaces and Big Ben intermingle with drawings of the errant horse, the Spanish Ambassador's residence, Madeline and her comnpanions, and, of course\\" the old vine-covered house.This book doesn't seem to be quite as well-known as the other volumes in the Madeline series. But it will delight young, budding readers and the adults who care for them.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Madeline in London","review":"My 2.5 year old and 5 year old love Madeline. All stories.

Those books are now considered classics in children's literature, having collected many awards.In this Madeline adventure, Pepito's father, the Spanish Ambassador, is given a new post, in London. But, poor little Pepito misses the girls, so off they rush to visit him for his birthday. Madeline knows what Pepito really wants as a gift, and Miss Clavel procures a retired horse for him to ride. But when the horse runs off with Madeline and Pepito the girls set out to find them, and a grand day is had by all!This is another great Madeline story.

He was a high school dropout when no one dropped out of high school.No longer drifting down an endless highway, Gary's has changed his life and in rare fashion...shows everyone how they can make real changes in their own lives.Parent has written a remarkable book. I'm not going to replicate his story which is written in long hand in the book. (kind of cool)The first lesson is to not let people's opinions of you, get in your way of what you want in life. He has a nice triplet: \\"No Regret, No Retreat, No Surrender\\"The dedication of the book is most unusual. He dedicates the book in part to the people who *stole his dreams.* He comes right out and acknowledges that without those thieves he would never have been given the obstacles to overcome.The books layout is quirky looking. I didn't get it until near the end. I just thought it was poorly edited. Then it dawned on me...there was a subtle unconscious point to the odd font sizes and strange format. It's the author...who he was and is and how he evolves. Like the Davinci Code kind of thing.Parent warns of the Circle of Influence around each of us. Those people who limit us...or try to...or how they help create possibilities.He gives solid solutions to self doubt and the feelings of needing to conform.I have to disagree with Parent's take on feelings. He states that no one can make you laugh or cry, angry or happy, etc. without your permission. I think that the direction he heads here is useful but the statement in total is a bit overstated as many others have. Try yelling at your 8 year old and see if it requires permission to get them to cry....Gary's exposition on the three drivers of behavior (pain, fear and pleasure) simplifies some very complex terrain. It's really well done.He goes into great detail about dream stealers and dream builders. I found these chapters very helpful.And there is more about lifting limitations and really getting goals.All of this done in a very unusual and unique way.The book put me off at first with it's formatting but once I got that I really found that...and the rest.... valuable.Get this book.

You immediately sense that he has found his inner self and wants others to conquer the obstacles that may be holding them back.Larry and Theresa Ayotte"},{"Title":"Prisoners of Our Own Beliefs","review":"Prisoners of Our Own Beliefs was written to help those who are willing to explore new possibilities in their lives.The first part of Prisoners of Our Own Beliefs is about exposing just how Dream Stealers hold you prisoner,how they steal your dreams, your desires and your life.Being aware of the Dream Stealers in your life and their language will not only save your sanity it will change your life forever.

Unfortunately for me, Gary only had a few copies of \\"Prisoners of Our Own Beliefs\\" with him so I did not get an autographed copy. However, I now own a few copies of his excellent book.Gary's story of how he was spurned by the public school system (which happens to so many kinesthetic learning modality boys), being told he was worthless and stupid, and then his story of personal triumph of learning to read in his 40s and realizing his own real and personal intelligence is such a gritty story of inspiration and motivation.You will want to read Prisoners and be encouraged to achieve your greatness... beyond your beliefs."},{"Title":"Prisoners of Our Own Beliefs","review":"First off, I love this title because it contains a powerful message that applies to most people around the world. Why do so many people settle for being less and having less in their lives? Most of the time it's not obstacles outside themselves but rather the self-imposed limitations and beliefs they have about themselves.This book helps us to realize how much of a prisoner we are to our belief systems and gives us the awareness to notice where those beliefs might be false or holding us back. Once we identify the \\"false beliefs\\" that have been implanted in our heads we can go about the task of replacing them with most useful and positive beliefs. This is a simple book, easy to read, that has a important message every one should hear.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wicked Words 10: The Best of Wicked Words (v. 10)","review":"On the back cover it says these are \\"the editor's choice of the best stories published over the last five years.\\" I thought the book was well written and the writing overall was creative and imaginative. In my personal opinion I did not find the writing very wicked, still overall a good collection of stories. Stories I deemed a second read were Peaches, Playing with Fire, The Last Deduction and Outmanouvered. My personal favorites were One of the Boys and Saving Julie they were vividely written and well played. As a side note The Jewel was an incest story."},{"Title":"Wicked Words 10: The Best of Wicked Words (v. 10)","review":"Authors have done it again. This book was just as it should be--WICKED!"},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"This is one of my very favorite non-magical Vance works, and it is amazing. I want a Showboat so BAD after I read (and reread) this book...! I would call mine &quot;The Golden Conceit.&quot; LOL"},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"It reminded me of that for some reason. Possibly the costumes the showboat captains wear (\\"Lemuriel Boke wore striped garments of black, red, and brown and adorned his head with the tripled tiered bonnet of an Ultimate Pantologist\\").Big world is a post-tech world settled by misfits and malcontents that grew into communities each as individual as their founders. think old wild west or firefly but with idiocyncracies.showboats run up and down various rivers, docking and providing entertainment. Apollon Zamp commanding the Miraldra's Enchantment, accepts an invitation to contest by King Waldemar at the Mornune Festival...not my cup of tea, maybe its someone's though. I'd've voted 2 1/2 stars, btween not liking and OK if possible."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"I quite agree with the review by James Beerbower. This is a caleidoscope of hypothetical cultures, traversed by a group of people who get by on an almost animal cunning. However it escapes me why anyone would call this SF or even would want to read it."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"Tells the story of ship captain Apollon Gamp's journey upriver to play at a kings showboat competition - a rather simple framework for a compelling and gorgeous collage of thieves, artists and discordant cultures. The Showboat itself is a gorgeous hybrid of Mississippi boat and travelling opera; requiring stage magicians, dancing girls, catapults and a hereditary caste of engineers.Along the way Zamp has to deal with (for example) a town that are run by the 'Actuarialists' who require the removal of all references to death or birth from the theatre program. Or Port Whant where wearing yellow is a sexual invitation. Indeed all luxuriance of imagination that we have come to expect from Vance.Of course he must deal with equally rascally competitors - Lemuriel Boke who wore 'striped garments of black, red and brown, and adorned his head with the triple tiered bonnet of an Ultimate Pantologist; he blanched his skin stark white and spoke in a cellar deep voice.' Or Umber Stroon who, in contrast, 'used terms of grandiloquent vainglory in connection with himself and equally striking figures of disparagement in regard to his competitors.' And a dozen others. Naturally both the journey and winning the contest require every resource of artistry and connivery.Obviously the novel has a number of similarities with the better known 'Space Opera' but the episodes are probably a bit better because the show boat captains are mixing with human (albeit exotic) rather than alien cultures -- where Vance is a little weaker. The plot, meanwhile, is considerably stronger and just as witty."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"Showboat World is probably my favorite Vance story. Some of my other favorites include Trullion, Araminta Station, and The Moon Moth. Apollon Zamp has more character flaws than almost any other Vance &quot;hero&quot; besides Cugel. In my humble opinion, this story would adapt well to film. Brad Pitt would have to put on a few pounds but would be a natural for Zamp. I know there is a role for Patrick Stewart in there somewhere. Can you imagine the showboats? The opera singers and orchestras? The jugglers, clowns, contortionists, midgets, mimes, actors, and so much more! Where is Cecil B. DeMille?"},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"_Showboat World_ takes place on Big Planet, which was introduced in _Big Planet_ (duh). Here we follow the story of Apollon Zamp as he attempts to travel a great length to enter a showboat contest. The novel is a vastly entertaining picaresque, as he depicts how rival showboat owners attempt to sabotage each other's efforts; how the showboat owner must manage his performers, who do not shrink from stealing from him; how entertainments must be modified to avoid riling the inhabitants of the various towns and cities along the river, each with its own unique culture. The beguiling female lead, Damsel Blance-Aster, provides an element of mystery that is only resolved at the end of the novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"The adventures and misadventures of Apollon Zamp (riverboat captain, traveling showman and unscrupulous rascal) as he sails up and down the huge River Vissel, feuds with rival showboat captains, and has unpredictable encounters with the odd cultures of various isolated river communities.SHOWBOAT WORLD (1975) is an extremely amusing but hard-to-classify adventure novel. One could call it \\"science fiction\\", since it takes place in the far future on an extra-solar planet. However, the available technology is approximately equivalent to that of the Rennaissance. Riverboats lack steampower and radios, and people arm themselves with (non-metalic?) rapiers, axes and halberds. I would call it \\"fantasy\\" except that most associate that term with supernatural elements, and there are virtually none here.It is best thought of as an attempt to recreate the \\"traveler's tales\\" of the past, before technology made the world small, and there was always the possibility of finding strange and unexpected on the borders of maps. Except that Vance has taken the liberty of imagining a planet even vaster in size than our own.This is, incidentally, set on the same world as Vance's 1953 novel BIG PLANET. Calling it a sequel, however, is like calling TOM SAWYER a sequel to MOBY DICK. The only connection is that they are set on the same planet. And it is, after all, a BIG PLANET. Hence its name.BTW, the author's preferred title is THE MAGNIFICENT SHOWBOATS OF THE LOWER VISSEL RIVER, LUNE XIII SOUTH, BIG PLANET, and it was released under this title as Volume 19 of the \\"Vance Integral Edition\\". Kindle editions are now available under the new title (sometimes shortened to THE MAGNIFICENT SHOWBOATS), and this will presumably be the title used in future. However, the vast majority of paper copies floating around out there go by the title SHOWBOAT WORLD."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"This story takes place on Big Planet, which was the featured location for another Vance book of that name. It's a \\"last frontier\\" type of world, filled with people of endlessly varied backgrounds and tendencies. Rules and traditions depend on the town one is in, and all travel at their own risk. The rivers traversed by the Showboats are both fascinating and unpredictable, and entertainments provided by the boats may enrich a crew at one town and endanger them in another. Into this setting we follow Apollon Zamp and a host of other bright and colorful characters who make up the traveling entertainment industry. They are cautious, creative and shrewd survivors of an unusual existence.As entertaining as anything else in this story are the names. Names of people, of towns, and of boats provide plenty of color by themselves. They create an appropriate atmosphere of strangeness, but a strangeness that I found irresistible. These characters and this setting were so pleasantly unusual that I caught myself smiling or grinning at certain times, for no reason I could articulate. Some scenes were amusing, and others surprising. The one commonality, when I tried to pin it down, was Vance's writing. The sneaky and subtle ways he found to arrange a scene so that it unfolded with just the right pace and feeling was masterful. I found myself wanting much more of this, and kept hoping more pages were hidden somewhere inside. It reminded me a lot of the feeling I had when reading Vance's \\"The Moon Moth\\".I haven't yet read Big Planet, and I suspect it mattered little when I read this. I caught glimpses of a magical world here, but they were fleeting. Reading this was frustrating in an odd way. I wanted more of it, but I also recognized that the magic, while brief, was intense. Drawing it out could easily have caused a concentrated spectacle of creativity to become a dimmer, cooler and less noticeable point in the science fiction landscape. I prefer it the way it is, a small but potent reminder of the rewards that can be found when searching for needles in the haystack of science fiction literature. Over the years I have found just enough of these to keep me coming back, thanks to a relatively small number of authors, Vance now among them."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"Had to rate this just to help overcome the injustice of the one star review above. This is a book I've read time and again over the last 10 years and it never fails to amaze me. Vance's language alone takes you to another planet. The vistas and cultures he creates are savagely beautiful and ironic. His characters are loveable, laughable, inventive and twisted up in plots, sub-plots and intrigues that are mad works of clever comical genius.Jack Vance is wildly unlike any other author in the world. He can show you life in a light unlike any you have previously imagined...A true gift that only a great book like this can achieve."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"Big Planet is populated by Earth's misfits. The massive landmass and low human population of the planet results in small settlements populated by drastically different cults/beliefs/social structures isolated from each other. Showboat captains ply the rivers of the lower Vissel basin offering entertainment to the disparate communities -- carefully navigating local customs in order to extract maximum profit. Enter an assortment of rogues, reinterpreted bizarre renditions of Macbeth, glass legged water walkers, grotesques, museum ships, taverns, and shapely mime girls....Showboat World is solid adventure in a well-realized and vividly described world by one of the masters of science fiction and fantasy, Jack Vance. Although this novel takes place in the future on a colonized planet, the plot and society is solidly in the realm of fantasy. The tone throughout is light-hearted and witty and the ending highly contrived. Overall, the work lacks any forward plot movement (which is fine considering the general river meanderings these showboats perform) but is great, inventive, and peculiar fun.Plot Summary (limited spoilers)Apollon Zamp owns one of the top two showboats of the lower Vissel River, the Miraldra's Enchantment, replete with contortionists, mime girls, grotesques who perform entertainments \\"characterized by brisk pace, flair, sudden shocks and impacts\\" emphasizing \\"farce, mummery, prestidigitation, eccentric farces and reenactments of notorious atrocities.\\" His bitter rival and the owner of Fironzelle's Golden Conceit, Garth Ashgate, specializes in rather more elaborate dramas performed at a leisurely pace.The first half of the work follows Zamp's journeys up and down various rivers performing at unusual locals and competing (often nefariously) with Ashgate. At a competition, Zamp is declared to be the winner and the representative of the lower Vissel to a competition at the court of a distant king. Ashgate sabotages his vessel and Zamp is forced to find aid elsewhere. And of course, there's a blonde appropriately named Damsel Blanche-Aster who refuses the entreaties of the various showboat captains and pursues her own secret agenda.Zamp, with Damsel Blanche-Aster in tow, eventually meets up with Gassoon and his museum ship, the Universal Pancomium. In order to reach the court of the distant king, Zamp agrees to resurrect (with various ammendments) the ancient Earth drama, Macbeth.... but first they must brave the savages of the steppes and reach the Bottomless lake...Final ThoughtsAlthough never exactly entering the realm of outright comedy, the work maintains a lighthearted tone throughout. I feel that the great world Vance has constructed would be best served with a more serious plot.... However, that's my personal preference. All in all, the work is great fun, the world interesting and original, and anything with floating museum ships is worth reading. And the final descriptions in the last third of the novel of the reinterpreted Macbeth is worth the price alone..."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"25 years after his excellant second novel 'Big Planet', Jack Vance returns to that fantabulous world, but with a difference. The style is redolent of 'Cugels Saga' and later 'Dying Earth' books, rather than the science-fantasy of his earliest works. The similarity to James Branch Cabell (and in its ironic comedy, Ernest Bramah) is obvious, but there is nothing derivative here.Vance plunges us into a world within a world. Big Planet is so big that it serves as a symbol for creative fiction in general. Despite its sprawling style, the adventerous expanse of this book takes place in a small area of a vast, unknown world.The protagonist is a larger than life rogue; one of various captains of 'showboats' which tour the rivers and tributaries of some sector of Big Planet. People have little or no knowledge of other places. Hilariously Macbeth is obtruded into proceedings.This is a wonderfully funny and adventerous novel, and if I have a criticism it is just that the thing is too damn short. Vance knocked this off with effortless aplomb. I can imagine his maritime joy as he flirts with these characters and their ships. I wish it had been an epic rather than a vignette."},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"A masterpiece of mannerisms. How anyone could give this one star staggers me. Presumably the grounds were non sf? If so we might be rejecting thousands of other books with only loose relations to the genre. The comedy alone is worth ten extra stars, the carefully conceived main characters and the meticulously crafted bit part actors make this book one to be read over and over again. The small insular groups who are he audience of each show are tremendously conceived. Possibly one of Vance's best"},{"Title":"Showboat World","review":"This is an interesting Vance story. It is set on Big Planet, a planet so big he can do pretty much whatever he wants. Much of the story is a set of a dozen or more vignettes of varied societies along the riverbank. Re-read yesterday, VIE edition.Zamp, as noted elsewhere, is just a grade above Cugel in the Scoundrel department (actually I suspect they are equal, Zamp almost never had the chance to forcible coerce the main female protagonist). The broad underlying theme of the competition and the voyage it entails, the curious alterations to MacBeth to make it more generally appealling (is this historically accurate as well?), the ongoing stops in new villages, all add to the layered aspects of the story.The ending climax is somewhat surprising (I didn't catch it, on first or second reading), and the ending of magnaminity between the remaining protagonists is a theme that pops up many times in vance writings (in Lurulu to finish, IIRC).This is a very entertaining story. I suspect Vance wrote under a clear page limit, (no evidence for this but it seems to be common practice, both in the 70s and now), and it is a shame, because the book is too short."},{"Title":"The Adventure of Fender Bender: Bendable Wire Bow Wow with Other","review":"This is a great pet!

I wish I could say that this is a compelling, exciting, dramatic book with tons of heart, but I can't, because I was too busy counting the innumerable band and movie references to notice any kind of actual solid quality.Though it poses (loudly and irritatingly) as a daring, edgy expose on the censorship of comic books, this book is basically risk-free. The villains are cardboard, and the cause with which the reader is expected to sympathize is as thin as the pages it's printed on-- only a moron would disagree with \\"don't censor comics.\\" This, in an age where the edgiest, bloodiest, sexiest \\"adult-oriented\\" comics regularly receive rounds of praise from mainstream publications such as Entertainment Weekly.Yawn.As an avid comic book reader of almost fifteen years, I am astounded at the number of gushingly positive reviews this book has received.

The references became distracting when I found myself counting band and movie T-shirts in the painfully cool party crowd instead of reading the dialogue. The \\"bad guys\\" were hamfistedly potrayed as book burning Nazis taking the form of angry mobs and evil government leaders with hokey eye patches and hooks for hands. The baddies also include the soulless \\"MallMart\\" corporation, filling out the list of cliches. The cinematic, stylized artwork served it well, but the book would be greatly improved by eliminating 70% of the \\"cool references\\" and if instead more attention was paid to actual character and storyline development. Lots of potentially interesting ideas were touched on, but few were explored with any depth, and their sheer number ended up suffocating what might have otherwise been an engaging take on the lives of kids in a small town."},{"Title":"Teenagers from Mars","review":"This book was by far my favorite comic of the year last year.

I've never heard of the writer or artist before, but I will be looking for more by them. The book opens with a grave robbing by some young teens. How many books can be that provocative? The drawing and writing are very tight. The plot revolves around a joke, at first, perpetuated through an act of extreme vandalism and credited to the Comic Book Liberation Army. Thereafter, well...you're going to have to read the book to find out how crazy things get. Let's say it involves a one-legged police officer, a one-handed mayor, and a one-eyed female DA that together would make one good pirate.

For me, comic books are about escapism and TFM is escapist fiction at it's best: measured does of magical realism in a world where most any suburban adolescent can find something relatable, \\"Hey, that's MY life!\\" The art is aggressive and cinematic.

So armed with his imagination and his purple crayon, Harold sets off for the north woods to find the perfect tree. He follows the north star, encounters a blizzard, meets a snowman and continues to &quot;draw&quot; his way to the North Pole. There he finds Santa in trouble. He's snowed in and can't get his sleigh, reindeer and sack of toys out of his workshop, which is covered by drifts. Lucky for us, Harold comes to the rescue and lends Santa a hand, sending him on his way to deliver presents to boys and girls all over the world.....Crockett Johnson has created a simple, gentle and really ingenious story, showing the very clever Harold at his best. Those who love Harold and the Purple Crayon, will find this holiday adventure just as wonderful and inventive. Harold at the North Pole will delight and amuse all pre-schoolers, as he helps your youngster welcome in the holiday season."},{"Title":"Harold at the North Pole;: A Christmas journey with the purple crayon","review":"My three year old loves this book.

Unlike some of the subsequent titles, Harold at the North Pole was in fact written and illustrated by Crockett Johnson, and published just two years after the original.Harold is empowering to young children. He goes places most children don't. (Most adults, even!) We understand his \\"adventures\\" to be dreams. Remember that when the first Harold was written in 1955, many children lived in homes without television sets. Using imagination was how kids played. If only that were still true today.This adventure is the perfect one to pull off the shelf in December. Like the seasonally ubiquitous Rudolph, Harold saves the day for Santa. You might not notice after the first reading, but the story comes nicely full circle. (Look for the moon.) This particular edition (the 1998 hardcover from HarperCollins) is extra sturdy yet small enough for children to hold easily. Give this to your child in the weeks before Christmas and share some purple holiday magic together."},{"Title":"Smart Women Keep it Simple","review":"This is a great read for working moms & stay at home moms.

His stories are not simple retellings of the african experience within the forced caribbean enclave in Limon,Costa Rica but they are born out of his own experience.We feel the pain of suffering from a seemingly displaced identity, belonging neither here (Latin America) nor there (Caribbean). We share his the pride in the customs of his Caribbean grandparents and the bitterness of him not being accepted as a first generation Costa Rican. We suffer his grandmother's anxiety at poverty, when she sees that the only way for her boys to survive successfuly is to leave the familiar and venture into the drastically different and prejudiced Hispanic world. We understand the importance of the English language as a means of preserving that which is unique to and of deep value to his culture and the need for learning to communicate for survival in the Spanish language of the majority.Anyone who is interested in or ignorant of african descendants in democratic and progressive Hispanic countries such as Costa Rica should read this book."},{"Title":"Deborah Goes to Dover (Travelling Matchmaker)","review":"The scrapes which Miss Pym and Deborah get into are quite funny, and I even found myself chuckling quietly to myself on occasion. I loved the two stories going on at once during the book, the first being Deborah's romance, and the second, Miss Pym's love of her late employer's brother."},{"Title":"Deborah Goes to Dover (Travelling Matchmaker)","review":"There seems to be comparions made between Marion Chesney's writing and Georgette Heyer's. I am not sure that I can always agree on that because as much as I have enjoyed SOME of Heyer's novels, Chesney is easier to read and digest if this book is any indication. It can take me days or weeks to read a Heyer novel whereas once I started reading Deborah Goes to Dover, I could not put the book down. I finished this book in less than 24 hours. That's when I knew it was a keeper. That feeling of enchantment you get as you devour the words and absorb the story being told, and the excitement you feel when you're only half way through the book knowing that you've discovered another great author is an indescribeable euphoria that only another bibliophile can understand. Therefore, just because you do not like Heyer does not mean you will not like Chesney.The author must have had her tongue-in-cheek the entire time she was weaving this story. I grinned through each clever chapter and character. And the telling of the love matches are endearing.This Traveling Matchmaker series is about the adventures of Miss Pym and her ever loyal footman Benjamin. But we're not talking cookie cutter stories here. You'd think Miss Pym would be young and beautiful but she is a former housekeeper with a bent nose and in her forties. Yet you root for her all the same even while Miss Pym, with the help of her unusual footman somehow manages to end up matching Deborah with the man she was meant to be with.Miss Chesney is a gifted story teller because she does not need to take up an entire chapter when one well written paragraph will do.(As much as I love to read Regencies, I find too many Regency Authors very boring because of this very fact. I detest having to wade through pages and pages of historical facts or what the people back then were wearing when a nice short paragraph will do. Instead, I want action, adventure and some heated looks, dialogue, and kissing exchanged and more. Which I happily got in this novel)Miss Chesney ends the story leaving you wanting more, to leave the house immediately to buy the rest of the series so you can find out if Miss Pym ends up with the man she is ultimately meant for but just hasn't realized yet.Bravo Miss Chesney, your talented story telling has just gained another devoted fan."},{"Title":"Deborah Goes to Dover (Travelling Matchmaker)","review":"I just love to read about Mrs. Pym and her adventures.

Then the coach is involved in an accident and things get more interesting and more complicated.The stage coach passengers are given rooms at an inn at Rochester while the coach is repaired and they become friendly with Lady Deborah and Lord William - brother and sister - who live nearby. Deborah likes to dress up in men's clothes and hates everything to do with being a woman until she starts to realise there could be enjoyment in dressing in fine clothes and attracting men.Full of matchmaking and mercenary mamas and young ladies who think they will never achieve their hearts' desires this is a charming and fast paced story in which lives are changed for better and worse.

One cannot tell if the painting was done from the drawing or if the drawing was done from the painting. This is an excellent illustration of the long planning and consideration some artists go through before beginning a painting. It shows just one of the many steps Nerdrum goes through, capturing one of the pieces which go into a piece of art which usually would go into the trash. The drawings are usually overlooked, and most beginning painters believe a painting can be started without preperation. This shows how much consideration to EVERY detail is given.I would have liked to have seen more of the intermediate steps before the finalized drawing, and just more drawings in general. I thought the book was a bit on the short side, but otherwise, this is a fabulous book"},{"Title":"Odd Nerdrum: The Drawings","review":"This is an amazing book that gives insite to the painstaking process of painting in the classical manner. Nerdrum only completes about 7-8 painting a year, but his work is some of the most impressive art of this century. This book is a collection of drawings that were done as preliminary studies for paintings. It offers an incredible insight to the process of developing a brilliant work of art, from a modern master. The book was originally published as a catalog that accompanied a tour of these collected works. The museums that exhibited this collection were smaller(ie not nationally known)museums in the mid-west. The photo reproductions are so crisp that you can see every stroke and blend of the charcoal, as well as the lines where the pieces of paper were hinged together to complete these rather large scale drawings. This book is a must have reference for any serious art student who aspires to master the classical techniques of drawing/painting. It is an extremely rare find as according to the inside cover, only 2000 copies were printed. If you can find one, it is worth every penny. An amazing compilation of works from an amazing modern master artist."},{"Title":"Odd Nerdrum: The Drawings","review":"Odd Nerdrum is an incredible painter. You cannot possibly make ANY judgements about his work without seeing some of his originals!He has earned his place in the art history already, and books like this are useful in reminding you of the the original shock of seeing his work...The shock of recognition I would say!"},{"Title":"Odd Nerdrum: The Drawings","review":"Odd Nerdrum is genius. Stand before a drawing or painting and experience a new gravity and absense of breath. Never before has another body of work put me in such an altered state. His canvasses of sheer size, fluid execution, and dreamstate images are inspiring. The emotion is raw and visceral, quiet and compelling.The drawings book is an execellent and significant supplement to the paintings book by Richard Vine. Upon viewing the drawings you can really deepen your appreaciation for the artistic style and method. The drawings are strong and as detailed as the paintings, but with a different weight and feel. The intensity is haunting and deserving of a serious look from any Nerdrum admirer."},{"Title":"Odd Nerdrum: The Drawings","review":"I am a painting student, and I bought this book in 1999 when it was still widely available at a reasonable price. It didn't occur to me until years later -- after buying several other books about Nerdrum's art -- that the reproductions in this volume are incredibly valuable, especially to those who wish to fully understand the completed paintings that Nerdrum creates. The volumes featuring his art in recent years, beautiful as they are, usually do not emphasize his drawing skills as this book does. This is truly a fascinating look at the creative process of a modern master -- secure yourself a copy, if you see one available!"},{"Title":"Odd Nerdrum: The Drawings","review":"My god. Could that first review by Pablo be any more gushing?? Almostmakes one think that maybe his review was a plant. These nardowell painters like Odd Nerdrum, Anders Stone, John Curren, to name a few, are only a step higher on the evolutionary scale of art than Thomas Kinkade. If you actually LOOK at Nerdrum's work, you will see all manner of rudimentary mistakes with juxtaposition, perspective and scale. Now i am not trying to preach what is good art and what is bad. But if an artist is being held up as a contemporary master in the style of Caravaggio, Titian, Hals, etc. they will be judged accordingly. Never the less, should one view this book on its own merits and with out preconception, they quite possibly would find it enjoyable. In a gastronomical sence, consider it a nice light salad."},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","review":"I have had the wonderful opportunity to review the book, 'Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields and Equivalents' by Linda Resnik and Dee Brock, published by FAQs Press. One of the authors approached me in November 2002 and noticed how I had not reviewed their book yet at Amazon.com. Through my information, they found the articles I have written at Suite 101, and there, also, I had not indicated once about their book \\"Food FAQs\\". Confidently, Linda Resnik offered me a copy of their book in exchange for a review. I accepted.When the book first arrived, I noticed that it was small, and organized into 3 sections: Substitutions, Yields and Equivalents, and an Index, which fully cross-references. At a first glance of the book, I saw how functional this book was. Everything was alphabetized, with hard-to-find ingredients also included.After 25 years of cooking experience (16 of those on a regular basis), I was very curious if this book would really work. Of course, I had to put it to the test. My first test, conveniently showed up the day the book arrived. I was planning on making a yogurt pumpkin pie and had just discovered that I forgot to buy the yogurt. I used their easy-to-use reference guide, and found that the substitution for yogurt was buttermilk. This was great, but I was leery, as one of the major ingredients in the recipe for this pumpkin pie was the yogurt. Well, I continued on my way, and prepared the pie as the recipe recommended. Later, my husband and I taste tested the results. My husband said, \\"This is delicious!\\" Being a man with challenging palate, I found this very rewarding, and I agreed to make this pie again for Thanksgiving! My next mission was that of \\"lotus root\\". One of my friends has only been in the USA for barely a year. She is from Japan and made me this rice salad. Being pregnant, I was craving this wonderful concoction! But I could not find the lotus root in the grocery store. I looked up the ingredient in this handy reference book to discover that the authors feel like water chestnuts would be an adequate solution. I was also very pleased with the results here.When I ventured to the Equivalents and Yields section. I, again, was impressed at my first glance. Not only does it explain how much one onion makes when chopped, but also once it has been cooked. This makes shopping easier for the less experienced cook who has no idea what that might require!"},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","review":"From how much to buy to what to use when a cook runs low on an ingredient, this provides a key to substitutions, yields and equivalents which is a 'must' for any kitchen reference collection. Other cookbooks have covered substitutions, but Food FAQS includes yields and equivalents before and after preparation and makes for an excellent reference."},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","review":"What a life saver in providing food substitutions when cooking a dish and realizing...forgot to buy this! This book tells me exactly what other ingredients can be used and exactly how much while preserving the integrity of the recipe.

This book would make a great gift idea for newlyweds, college students, and anyone else just starting out on their own."},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","review":"No cook should be without this book. I just bought 4 copies to give to my friends because I use it almost daily. One person i gave it to is a gourmet cook and she was so pleased to have this information all in one book rather than having to look up a substitution or equivalent in any number of sources."},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","review":"This is a handy book for things such as how many egg yolks there are in a cup. I was not so happy with the substitutions sections, however, most of which was so obvious as to make the book somewhat redundant. Though for someone new to the kitchen it would be a handy tool.They suggest lemon zest as a substitute for lemongrass: the herb lemon balm (in equal weight) is actually much much closer in every way."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Highbridge Classics)","review":"Tongue tied when it comes to telling someone how much you care? Send this audio book to that special person. You'll not only be thought romantic but erudite as well.After all, even at your best you probably couldn't come up with\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate:Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,And summer's lease hath all too short a date.\\"These love poems have been extolled for over 400 years, quoted, misquoted, and copied. Written between 1593 - 1601, to a great degree the 154 sonnets reveal the Bard's thoughts on the perplexities of life - love, honor, rebirth. Perhaps most important to many we also find his attraction to the \\"Dark Lady.\\" Is there a reference in Sonnet 151 with \\"Love is too young to know what conscience is....\\"?All the world loves a mystery which may be why we're so fascinated by the Dark Lady. Her identity is unknown, it is not even known whether she was a real woman with whom Shakespeare had a relationship or a manifestation of his creativity. Some surmise that she was so called because her hair was black and her skin dusk colored, thus she was Spanish. Others posit that \\"dark\\" did not refer to her appearance but rather to the black or dark feelings of desire. This discussion may go on indefinitely.Unfortunately, British actor Simon Callow's brilliant reading of the sonnets only lasts two hours. However, the replay button is at the ready. \\"Shakespeare's Sonnets\\" is a keeper to be enjoyed over and over again.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Highbridge Classics)","review":"This guy read the Auden in Four Weddings and Funeral I think. Simon Callow treats his voice as an instrument. He can strum and roar and hiss and bellow. And he has taken some trouble with the notes and tones. This may seem a rather contrived sensibility at first, but he uses his velvet oboe of his voice to a fine effect, calling it to the issue of the meaning prehaps more than a concern for a natural tone. And I quickly got over this modern quibble. The sonnets are contrivances and they are also concerned with terrible truths. Callow has invented a style that fits. And to his credit, it is also startlingly passionate."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Sonnets (Highbridge Classics)","review":"Simon Callow's reading of the sonnets is excellent, as is the quality of the recording. The only defect I have found is that part of the last line of the thirteenth sonnet is missing.

Disappointingly, Mr. Callow's affected speech proves very difficult to follow, even after repeated hearings. He speaks far too quickly and musically, which distracts from the sonnets themselves.Additionally, the sonnets are not each clearly delineated from the other. Strained ears find the occasional familiar line, but such effort is ultimately better spent reading the sonnets aloud ourselves. Spend your money elsewhere, if you wish to keep the babies entertained."},{"Title":"Queen Bees and Wannabes","review":"This book is about the friendships and social circles of girls aged roughly 10-15, with most of the focus on the \\"cliques\\" they so famously form, describing the roles girls commonly play in the them (Queen Bee, etc). The author has extensive experience dealing with girls this age at her job and runs workshops for schools. It's a very hands on, practical account.She argues that while girl's cliques may seem trivial or unimportant to adults, girls are actually learning how to interact with others socially at this age, and for better or for worse, how they behave and respect themselves as adults will often mirror how they fit in with their peers at this sensitive age.This can be a touchy subject for some. I'm a teacher, and I love kids, and I like all of the ones I deal with, whether they fit as \\"Queen Bees\\", \\"Wannabes\\" \\"Floaters\\" or any other little label.But still, I think as adults we tend to idealize kids, see the cute and innocent qualities, and tend to turn a bit of a blind eye to the politics between friends, and sometimes even to the attitudes of our students toward class outcasts. As adults, the way they behave can seem quaint, but for the kids themselves, grades 6-8 can be a hard time socially, and it doesn't make it any easier if teachers just turn a blind eye to it and shrug it off thinking \\"they'll grow out of it\\".On the flipside, I think adults that had a hard time during these grades themselves tend to want to brush it aside as \\"that was then, now I'm all grown-up, and I realize how silly all that was, and one day my daughter/students will too\\". As nice as that feels to say as an adult, it might not be very helpful to a 12-year-old who'll have to deal with school as her reality for 6 more years.Finally, a complaint I've heard about this book is that while it presents a depressing reality at times, it doesn't give much advice on what parents and educators can do (Unless you want to get preachy and have private \\"talks\\" with them where you talk about their feelings. Most kids reaction: \\"EEEWWW!!\\")I can't speak as a parent of a girl this age yet, but speaking as a teacher, what I've come to realize since I read this is that while you can't always cram everything you know and think down your students throats, sometimes just knowing what's going on and having an objective view of it can help you build a healthy classroom where everyone is appreciated and respected- the popular kids as well as the loners.For example, the author describes how when the popular girl in a fifth grade class gets paired up with a fat unpopular girl and has to hold her hand during a game in gym class, she feins digust and how all the other kids laugh. A lot of teachers blow this off as kids being kids and ignore it, but if your read this book you'll have a clearer idea of whats going on, and the pecking order that makes it allowable.I can't claim my classes are little social utopias now, with every kid and group in perfect harmony, but I CAN say that in the time since I've read this book, those types of situations happen much less if at all. The popular kids are still popular, but while I don't come right out with it and try to preach, subtly through the first few months there are different expectations on them about what makes a good person and what kind of attitudes will make them accepted and respected. The kids get along better, aren't embarrassed about being in other groups for work (Even if they'd prefer being with their friends), and most importantly, the shyer and more awkward kids are more comfortable to speak and participate, and begin to get along with the others and become more accepted.In short, the world of girls at this age is complicated and not an easy thing to deal with for anyone. But learning about it and having a clear view of it WILL help."},{"Title":"Queen Bees and Wannabes","review":"Every mother and/or father of a preteen/teenage girl or boy should read this book.

It arrived quickly after I ordered it and in excellent condition.Queen Bees and Wannabees"},{"Title":"Queen Bees and Wannabes","review":"My first impressions of Queenbees & Wannabees by Rosalind Wiseman were, after seeing the 'Mean Girls' film. I thought it could be a fiction novel in the same witty vain as 'Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen' by Dyan Sheldon, and movie that is just as fabulous, which I both loved with Lindsay Lohan.However, what I found to my great relief was a non-fiction book about teenage life for both girls and boys. When I found the book I instantly had an invested interest in it. However it took me at least six months to finally sit down and read it. I didn't want to rush it.So I read 'Odd Girl Out' and it's sequel 'Odd Girl Speaks Out' by Rachel Simmons first before I got to one of my most special books I've ever read. In fact I'd really recommend these other two books as well along with this one. So it can be like a trilogy, and so very exciting to read. They are seperate books, so you don't have to do what I did and read them like a trilogy, but it helped make them all very exciting to read.While reading I found the subject matter of great interest to me. I was really interested in knowing about the female perspective on life and this really gave me some wonderful things to look for and consider, most of which I do already, but is still worth remembering. Both sexes should make an effort to live in harmony with one another.For years I haven't really been interested in teen films or TV shows, but all this has changed dramatically and I adore them now. Also since leaving school I can refect on the good and bad times. I've found I also have a deep interest and compassion for those in Collumbine High School and the shooting tragedy that occured April 20th 1999. Even though I wasn't there, I care about the American people and high schools. I also enjoy 'Boston Public'.As you can see Ms. Wiseman's book has really opened up a whole new world to me I love exploring. So much so I had to email her to tell her how much I adored her book. Some of her advice could seem repetitive or just common sense, but I urge you to still read on. What she has to say does matter. I read slowly and really hung on every word. Readers who read fiction can afford not to pay so much attention to what they are reading, but not here.I loved this book. I could write about my thoughts on it forever and never get tired. I am not a school teacher, I'm not a teacher of any sort, but I really love the subject matter in this book. I encourage anyone who has read this book to share their thoughts with me. For anyone who thinks school will never end, don't lose hope, it will. Then the rest of this wonderful world awaits. I really want to help in teenagers lives and with this book anything is possible. A book to be treasured like gold for anyone. A book worth revisiting again and again as we all live our lives the best way we know how. No one is exempt from reading this book. We are all special in our own unique way. If you've ever lost your way this book will give you hope at finding it again. Queen Bees and Wannabees is one book worth remembering. I know it is one book I'll never forget."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis writes very well, and so almost anything written by him would be a pleasant read. What is more, he knows and understands ancient mythology very well. Many people know about ancient mythology, but few understand it as well as Lewis.

I understand He is a great author and he shows his work in this great story. The book started slow but when you read on it unfolds into a marvellous story. Orual is a great fit for C.S. Lewis and I like the way he takes her and transforms her into a great character. I wasn't too familiar to mythology but I'm a fan now. Mr. Lewis made me a great fan of his with this work. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book by C.S. Lewis is perhaps one of the finest books of the twentieth century. Without even going into its ability to sum up one of the toughest questions of Chistianity, I would say Lewis wrote an imaginitive book that parrallells nothing I've read yet. His main character Orual, who is neither the protagonist nor antagonist, searches for the answer to why her god can allow evil into her world of ancient Rome. Lewis created such a realistic character in Orual that in the first section you sympathize with her adversities, but when you get to the second part you realize along with Orual that she and perhaps yourself have have been looking out an opaque glass at both yourself and the world around you. This in affect makes you question yourself and asks the supreme question of whether or not you truly have a face. Not only does this book so magically entertwine the subjects I have only touched the tip of the iceberg for, but C.S. Lewis also reaches out with all of his imaginative powers to grasp his readers in a lock they can't resist until they've finished his book. I strongly reccomend taking the time to read this book it will change your view of both Christianity, philosophy, and it will also raise your standards for literature."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Since having read CS lewis's &quot;Until we have Faces&quot; I find it difficult to image ever discovering another novel with quite the same power of imagination in its unfolding, with the same ability to move the reader deeply at a level beyond the conscious understanding. Lewis allows the reader to taste unconditionally the unfathomable riches of the grace and mercies of God. George MacDonald's &quot;Phantastes&quot; is the only other novel that I've read that has moved me as deeply. My wife has also read this book and it has been something of substance to discuss, to try and understand it's deeper meaning in our lives, as this unique work of clarity and wisdom inspires one to do. I recall reading somewhere that Joy Davidman, Lewis's wife considered this his best ever work. I can't recommend this book enough as a rejuvenating experience for the spiritually disillusioned."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is a phenomenal book. It explores the themes of how we delude ourselves into believing that we are acting for another's good, while in fact we are acting only for our own. The plot begins relatively fast paced and engaging but by 1/3 of the way through the book, it slows remarkably and themes begin to be explored through more mundane encounters between the characters. About 2/3 of the way through the book, part II starts, which is more mundane encounters and everyday activities but the themes begin to change. Love that was seen as self-sacrificing is revealed to be self-serving and the reader experiences Lewis' invitation to step into deeper relational love. Truly an amazing, convicting book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis has said that he never wrote anything that he did not refer to something that George MacDonald wrote, or quote from him. The title in this book is the reference. In MacDonald's Lilith, there was a couple who were skeletons, stripped of the flesh, to learn how to depend on each other. Later, there was a sanctuary which had crumbled, stripped of it's building material, and left as a shell of roses, (the spirit of the sanctuary), which had covered the building. Into this shell, came dancers who were fully clothed and also fully clothed in flesh, except for their heads, which were fleshless bone, a gibbeous cranium, a faceless skull. These were the people who were learning how to be who they were, in death, the couple who didn't yet have enough humanity to have flesh, and the dancers, who had learned to be human, but who did not yet know or have thier individual identities, their faces. Read this book while first understanding Lewis's reference."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis' novel from 1956 is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, that painful allegory about love and passion and control and all of those conflicting human strivings that plague us all. It is the story of a king and his three daughters, one ugly, one normal and the youngest quite beautiful. It is the story too of the struggle of pure beauty against crude ugliness in the soul, as manifested in the outward appearances.It is the allegory of bodily love versus spiritual love. Such is the beauty of the youngest daughter that she becomes a goddess, worshipped and adored, but yet cursed by the jealousies of others. She is sacrificed to the dark powers of an underworld mentality on the altars of vain ambitions. As with any fine myth, this one surrounds itself with all the furniture of the human condition as it gives us the palace of life in which the main character, Orual, is separated by the base instinct of consuming love and blinding obsession to do right. When a plague hits the kingdom, the jealous gods and priesthood demands the sacrifice of their best, and their best is beautiful Istra. This is the kingdom of Glome (gloom) where Greek wisdom is peppered nonetheless with rumors of beasts and superstitions, as in real life. Psyche (Istra) disappears into the fringe land of legend after her sacrifice, but possessive sister Orual (also called Maia) pursues her ghost to the Mountains. Psyche tells her she has another love, something unseen by Orual, in a land also unseen. This separation of two close sisters is like a divorce of the two characteristics of human nature, love and hate.Ascending her father's throne, Queen Orual straightens up her kingdom but cannot straighten up herself. Even with the teachings of Fox and the swordsmanship of Bardia, she is helpless against her own dark drives. She finally brings her life grievance against the gods themselves, only to discover that her question of the unfairness of their ways is in reality the blindness of her own passions.Lewis is a master of allegory. It is also uncanny how he has narrated this story from the perspective of a woman who has lived almost exclusively in the realm of men. Orual watches as male priests try to expiate sin by oblations to the vague images of the stone goddess Ungit; then, as Queen, she sees one priest try setting up a beautiful statue of a Greek goddess with human likeness in place of the faceless one. A face has been given to the faceless mystery of sin. Thinking it an improvement, Orual reasons \\"I think I felt that an image of this sort would be somehow a defeat for the old, hungry, faceless Ungit whose terror had been over me in childhood.\\" But putting a face on her fears does not cure them.Like other great mythologies, he has woven a tale of combative elements which twist and turn within our own lives. It is difficult if not impossible to avoid the comparison here of a Christian life against a secular world. The illusive image of Psyche is a type of Christ, drawing us from the darkness of humanity towards the need for the redemption of deity. The voice of the gods is the voice of the Christ, and until we have put on our real face we cannot hear it or approach it. What we are tempted to accuse deity of is what we are most guilty of ourselves."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I received this book within a week of placing my order. The book was new, as promised, and looked wonderful. My daughter was so thrilled to receive it - she has been looking for this book for a long time! Thanks so much for the smile and thrilled look on Christmas morning!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Greek mythology has always had a place in my heart. I love to read the stories of the gods and goddesses and their interactions with the humans. I knew the story of Cupid and Psyche well. Or.... at least I thought I did until I read C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces.I am a big fan of Lewis and have read many of his works. This one took me by surprise. In fact, this does not follow the tradition of most of his writing, or does it?This is not just a story of Cupid and Psyche that many of us know so well. It is barely a story about them. It is more a story of those around the lovers. It is a soul-searching book of Psyche's jealous sister, Orual. Through her eyes and through her heart, we see the struggles of a woman who tries to find her own place in this world while feeling that all is given to her sister on a silver platter and she received a few crumbs. Her actions are so reflective of those that any man, woman, or child might do in a similar situation.Orual loves her sister with all her heart while hating the blessings that fall upon her at every turn. She longs to taste a little of that blessed life but realizes that it might be easier for Psyche to taste a little of hers. Realizing that Cupid is madly in love with Psyche pushes Orual over the edge. She gives Psyche that taste of her life and watches as her perfect world falls apart.Surprisingly, Orual finds herself not satisfied as she thought she would feel. Instead she battles with a guilt that leads her down a life-journey of the soul. Only then does she discover the truth.A wonderful read. It's not a light read for a lazy summer day. This is a read that will have you hooked and looking into your own soul before you finish the first chapter."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Glorious CS Lewis. Gripping fable of the story of Psyche. The most powerful psychological/spiritual message. A must read for Lewis fans, lovers of fiction, those on a serious spiritual journey, admirers of exquisite writing and story telling."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is my favorite book written by C.S. Lewis by far. This is, by far, the finest literary piece of work as well as the most mature insight in spirituality."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"A neat twist looking at it from the older sister's point of view. She truly believes she loves her sister. Her love like many of our loves is conditional and fear based. It isn't until she is compelled to write her story that the process of self-awareness takes hold and she goes through the myth herself. As she does this her true love for Psyche and all the others including herself grow as well."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have read C.S.Lewis's many book but this is by far his best.Lewis weaves a tale of the Greek characters, Cupid and Psyche, through the eyes of Orual, Psyche's older half-sister.Orual is not attractive. Psyche is beautiful. Orual becomes Pysche's surrogate mother when Psyche's mother dies. Orual's love for Pyche, at first, seems beautiful and selfless. Slowly through the telling of her story, the reader begins to see that Orual's love for Psyche is ugly and selfish. Orual is obsessed with the need to love. She is obsessed with the need to be Pysche's all. It is this self-pitying, selfish love that C.S. Lewis carefully and fully extracts from Orual until we are finally face to face with her ugly reality.Til We Have Faces is Orual's bitter quest to get answers from the gods for unjustly taking Psyche from her and giving Psyche to the God of the Mountain. Orual comes face to face with the truth that Psyche is happy and content to be sacrificed to the God of the Mountain. Orual has to face the sad truth that she is not Psyche's all.The second part of this book is Orual's reckoning and reconciling.This book is good on so many levels."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Yet another classic book from THE classic Christian author. A beautifully told story with a beautiful, and eternally timely, moral."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"If the purpose of the author's pen is to immerse you into the experiences of the characters in a book, C.S. Lewis exceedingly succeeds. I for one love the way that Lewis uses the English language to twist, stretch, and connect unused and unthought of analogies. I quite often found myself repeating phrases that deserved more than a cursory scan. This is Lewis' most mature foray into allegorical literature and is an attestation to his humility and brilliance."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This has been called the best work of fiction by C.S. Lewis and I pretty agree with that assessment (my weakness for science fiction makes me rank his Space Trilogy higher than this work.) The characters are well-developed and memorable. What I think makes this work the best of Lewis' fiction is although he is writing to answer a spiritual question that he has, namely the problem of evil, he is more subtle in this work compared with the Narnia series (though that series' defense one must remember that they are children's books.) There is a lot of food for thought in this book, making it an excellent read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold is truly an inspired work. C.S. Lewis admits this himself, taking little credit for the masterpiece it is. It all began as he read Eros and Psyche, the original myth. While reading, he felt the inspiration that led to this work, the idea &quot;forced itself upon&quot; him. This idea worked its way into his mind allowing him to capture the beauty and power of the original myth, while intertwining the deeper theme of love.Till We Have Faces illustrates the contrast between a divine, unconditional love, and the frail thing we too often consider to be love. Three princesses live in the kingdom of Glome: Orual, Redival, and Pysche. C.S. Lewis stylistically portrays each daughter with varying degrees of love. Redival has a self-centered attitude that gives her the need to feel loved by others. Orual, is slightly less self-centered, needing others to feel her love and to be loved by them in return. Pysche has a true, divine love for others with little thought for herself. Throughout the piece, C.S. Lewis shows us the strengths and trials that each face, and their relative outcomes.Redival changes drastically through the work. As it begins, she is young and beautiful, but also self-centered. She seeks the attention and love of others, but doesn't receive it from her father or sisters, finding it only from young men. Throughout the play, there is a progression, until the end where she has lost her beautiful figure and become a respectable woman. She learns not to focus as much on herself; allow her love to develop towards others.Orual's love is a jealous love. She shows love to others for the purpose of feeling it in return. What she believes is love, in many instances is jealousy. The contrast between the jealous love of Orual and Pysche's pure love is obvious to the reader throughout the work, yet hidden to Orual. She even goes to the extreme of threatening to kill Pysche, all in the name of her supposed love. She doesn't realize that what she supposes to be love is mere jealousy. It isn't until she is able to see things from another point of view, as an observer of what she has done, that she begins to realize the frailty and weakness of her love.Pysche begins in the work as a beautiful young girl that takes little thought of herself. She struggles to be of service to others, desiring to help them out. But in return for her devotion and pure love for everyone, they turn against her. Their jealousy of her beauty and kindness, lead them to sacrifice her, rejoicing in her imminent death. This contrast and inconsistency in what we call love is beautifully displayed. It's difficult for us to recognize our weaknesses, especially when it comes to love. C.S. Lewis allows us to do just what Orual did, to look at life from an objective point of view, to take a step away from our narrow vision and see life from a new perspective. As we do so, it helps us understand how we can improve and develop a pure, true love the type of love that Psyche demonstrates.Few books have left me pondering so deeply; Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold is one of them. Just like Orual, I found how superficial my love for others truly is. Through his inspired piece, C.S. Lewis has given us objective means to measure our love, giving us an understanding of how we can improve the lives of others and our own through this pure love."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I must admit that the first time I read &quot;Till We Hae Faces,&quot; I could not comprehend it. It was only until I re-read it years later that I discovered the grandeur and the genius of Lewis' story. I guess it had to wait for me to read other books, including the friend of C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, whose hand is clearly seen in it.Orual sees herself as the victim in most of the book, until at the end she finds that she was the true opressor, not the gods that she accuses. &quot;You also are Psyche.&quot; says the god when she does her act of spite against her sister, thinking that she is only acting for her good.It reminds me of an epitaph Lewis once wrote:Erected by her sorrowing brothersIn memory of Martha Clay.Here lies one who lived for others;Now she has peace. And so have they. (Poems, p. 134)This has to be one of Lewis' best books, well worth reading. Orual does find her face in the end, in a stunning twist."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"&quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; lacks some of the traits which make us love Lewis' other works - it's un-English, un-donnish, it lacks his quirky sense of humour, it is not edifiying; yet there are a kind of coherence, a unity of tone and majestic pathos which make the novel impressive in a unique way. Above all, Lewis handles myth - the subtitle is &quot;A Myth retold&quot; - with a respect of which he alone among 20th century writers seems to be capable. There is no demythologizing, and yet the reader understands the implications, the power, and the tragedy of the myth of Psyche and Cupid in a completely new way.The story is told by Orual, Psyche's older sister; she is such an impressive and strong female character than one is surprised an utterly conservative man like Lewis could have created her. She rebels against the gods and the people who won't leave her beloved beautiful sister Psyche alone. - Telling more about what happens might spoil the reader's enjoyment of the book, so I won't do it. - Read this book and get to know a C.S. Lewis you have not met before; but above all you will enjoy a supremely crafted work of fiction."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The first time I read this novel, maybe twenty years ago, I was a bit disappointed. From Lewis, I expected Christian fantasy or philosophy. Who was this pagan god of the mountain who came to love Psyche? What was going on in the confusing dream-like sequences towards the end? Where is God in all of this?Now I love it. I've pushed it on other people, and found most &quot;got it&quot; faster than I. Some of my best Japanese students have read it in my first-year English reading class, and those who have, liked it. (I recommmend it to them partly because of the brilliant way Lewis depicts ancient Greek and tribal cultures and thought.) Some appreciate the insight and sensitivity with which Lewis depicted his female leading character. (Thanks, maybe, to his love at the time of writing for a woman of a similarly realistic and strong temperament.) One noted that &quot;This story will tell you how not just Orual but every mortal has an ugly soul.&quot; She told me that she'd been reading a bit about Greek philosophy, and the book was interesting for that reason, too. Another said she liked the single combat, admitting, &quot;I know it isn't the most important scene, but I just like it.&quot; A relative, to whom I gave a copy of the book, told me she read the whole thing (it's not that short) in one sitting.So I think there's a good chance you'll like the book, too. As for God, while He is hidden in this story, (as He often is in life) that hiddenness is another layer within the depth within depths that is this novel. I now tend to think Lewis deserved a Nobel Prize for writing it.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Be careful of the somewhat slow beginning because I almost didn't get into this book... and I am so glad I did.The story of Orual, the ugly sister and Psyche, the beautiful sister sneaks up on you. As the reader, you become more and more drawn into identification with Orual. Then CSLewis artfully reveals Orual's limits, slowly but surely, as Orual forces Psyche to go against everything Psyche understands. It takes an excellent story teller AND theologian to show the error of Orual's thinking and actions as inexorably as he does, and it is poignant to experience it as the reader, since you can't help but urge Orual to re-evaluate her position.Are Aslan and Chronicles of Narnia CSLewis' best representation of his theology? After reading Til We Have Faces, I'm no longer sure.One review I read before I decided to buy this book said that there were Christian overtones in a pagan setting. I would say that the Christian message is delivered loud and clear through Orual's life of struggle with her sister, father, and queenship.A great book, and you do not have to know the story of Psyche to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is a genius; I cannot say this emphatically enough.Till We Have Faces retells the traditional story of Cupid and Psyche. It does not mess with the storyline, but builds on it and makes it real and true, with live characters and so much detail. I would suggest being familiar with the original myth before reading it (it is written in the very back of the book) because I didn't understand just what was happening the first time I read the book through.The story is...beautiful. Amazing. It draws you heavily into the atmosphere of the time, into Orural's obsessive love of her sister, Istra (Psyche), hatred of her father the king, learning of philosophy through Fox, the Greek prisoner, and the fear of Ungit (Venus).Till We Have Faces offers so much insight - into holiness and love, among other subjects. It is interesting to see Lewis's work not directly relating to Christianity but through pagan mythology instead. I do not think I could compare the book to C.S. Lewis's other fiction; they are so entirely different in spirit. I will say that it is worth the read - worth many, many reads, for I notice new truths in Lewis's writing every time."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"that I have read Till We Have Faces. What an amazing book. Lewis had an uncanny knack for reaching in and grabbing hold. I must admit I started reading this book and couldn't stop. It made me feel a little bit like I was drowning, but I think it was wonderful excercise for my mind. I have so long been reading what is passing for Christian fiction that my brain had become numb. What a wonderful way to brush away the cobwebs and really dig in to something substantial. It made me uncomfortable to a degree, like something that hits just a little to close to home. Greedy, all-consuming, self-centered love at the expense of others, or worse at the expense of those you are supposed to love best. Ouch. I am a Lewis fan now and ever more."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"CS Lewis has created a wonderful unique view of the Eros and Psyche myth and transported his ideas into an awesome creative story just for all of us! The original plot of the myth has always appeared very didactic to me, especially for women who need to find the strength inside themselves to conquer the seemingly undaunting tasks which are necessary for a joyous reunion with their heart's truest desires. I believe this story takes this one step further and makes the focus of the myth about the unveiling of one's soul into a new light. The story's three main women (Ungit included) all hold some piece of the vieled soul (i.e. the ugly and shameful elements) inside and the unconscious quest that Lewis puts them on in this story is to have these women uncover these shadows within themselves and bring them to light. That's what I got out of this book anyway. It's all there on the higher plane. I was very impressed with this intricate, subtle, beautifully crafted &quot;double myth&quot;. That's what I'm calling it. You get the Eros and Psyche amazing story plus this wonderful new myth about wanting to find your true face. It's under there hidden with the dark and musty viel of fear-based thinking and belief systems. This book knocked my socks off...It's one of my favorites! Like the Fox says &quot;How can they (the gods) meet us face to face till we have faces?&quot; This means we need to uncover all our dusty negative agreements that sit in our soul and bring them out in the open. We need a cleansed face (soul) one that embraces clarity and balance, calmness and beauty. No zits, hopefully! CS Lewis has said this is his favorite piece he ever wrote...I totally agree. This book will give the reader a lot to think about if you really want it to, one needs to be patient and let it speak to the parts of you that are hidden. Open your dusty souls and READ IT!!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is definitely a book I would recommend reading. One of the reasons it captured me was because C.S. Lewis, who is a man, was able to portray the life of a woman so perfectly. In this novel, we are pulled through the thoughts and events of a woman who is raised to believe that she is ugly--ugly enough to hide her face behind a veil for nearly all of her life. Through everything she endures; her father being a deadbeat king, her youngest sister adored and worshipped as a godess by many, and her own ugliness, she finds strength through her love for the people around her. She is a heroine. She is smart, she is powerful, and she can fight with a sword. She takes over her father's kingdom and makes it ten times better than he could have made it. If she had been gorgeous, we would find ourselves drowning in yet another boring novel where the beautiful maiden is swept into la-la land by a handsome god. Of course she is not perfect. It is her love that drives her to make a decision that will send her sister, who she has raised like her own child, on a painful journey. But she is sent on a journey of her own. She must find what truly lies beneath her veil and overcome the painful belief that she is the horrible person she makes herself out to be.I think this novel is making a comment on faith, as well as showing how beauty is found within, not without. If you look into the story carefully, you can find subtle hints of C.S. Lewis's view on faith and Christianity through the characters of the Fox who is always questioning the gods, and the the house of Ungit, which is wrapped up in mystery and &quot;holiness&quot; to the people around it.Another thing that is remarkable about this story is that it has unexpected turns. C.S. Lewis has taken an ordinary myth and transformed it into a fascinating story. You will be absorbed by the emotions that it brings out in you."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Without one mention of Christ in this book, C. S. Lewis was able to open my eyes to Christianity. In the way that Orual bears Psyche's pain because she loves her and by then equating Orual with Ungit, I was able to realize that one of the major points in Christianity is that love is greater than justice. And furthermore, as Orual bore Psyche's pain, Christ suffered to bear our pain. This book's message is an analogy for Christianity."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. It is everything a novel should be: compelling characters, beautiful writing, well plotted. Lewis has written his novel from the point of view of a minor character (the jealous step-sister) in the well known myth of Cupid and Psyche. In this, Lewis prefigured an approach to novel writing that later writers have adopted (e.g., Wicked, Wide Sargasso Sea, etc.)\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is not, as some reviewers have suggested, \\"just a fairy tale,\\" although it is hard to imagine that Lewis would have rejected that appellation, given that other great writer of fairy tales, George MacDonald. Also, it is very much a work with a Christian viewpoint and themes. The fact that so many reviewers have said otherwise should indicate that it not didactic or entirely unsubtle. The characters are pagans, but the theme is undeniably Christian. It is almost an allegory, but that would imply that the meaning is buried beneath a layer of representation, which it is not. In any event, the Christian theme is easy to understand if one recrognizes that Cupid is the God of love, and there is only one true God."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I first read this book when I was in my early teens, and I just reread it for the fourth time, now that I'm in my early fifties. It still has the power to move me, to engage my mind, to make me stop and think about myself. I was choking back a sob as I read the last words.I think it is C.S. Lewis's fiction that gets his messages across (although his non-fiction is incredible as well). Not to sound trite, but this has always been one of my favorite books. I could analyze/compare/critique, but that has all been done. All I can say is, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is the most amazing book that I have ever read. It illuminates ultimate truths and truth in a way that I though impossible. Through a life of pain and the process of redemption outlined within we see our own sufferings and the possibility of our own redemption and healing."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is so good at mixing faith with stories. Maybe that's why his stories are the most gripping. This retelling of Psyche and Eros is unpredictable and very moving. If Narnia is for children then &quot;Faces&quot; is a teaching fable for all adults."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a great novel. Lewis' character Orual is one that I hope will stay with me throughout my lifetime. I can relate to her more than any other character I've been introduced to. The discoveries she makes have opened my eyes so that I see myself, my life, and my relationship to God in a new light."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till we have faces by C.S. Lewis not only retold a myth from another point of view, but also gave an insightful look into to a battered life. He cleverly took the story of Cupid and Psyche, originally told from Psyche's view point, and flipped it to a different dimension. The whole basis of his story is the struggle that Orual, the oldest sister, faces because of her love for Psyche. King of Glome has three daughters. The oldest, Orual, is extremely ugly. The second daughter is beautiful, but is surpassed when Psyche is born. Psyche's mother dies at birth. This is important because Orual becomes her surrogate mother. Orual, who also lacks a mother and attention from her father, channels all her love and attention onto Psyche. Her somewhat happy life is shattered when the townspeople turn on Psyche and demand she be sacrificed to the Gods. Here C.S. Lewis pulls the reader into the novel. I sat on the edge of my seat as I watched the events unfold. Although the events were nerve wrecking, the pain the Orual faces caught my interest. Lewis brings the reader alive as he unfolds her emotions. At first the reaction is to dismiss her duty of love and believe that it is exaggerated, but after a moment I realized that such love does exist. Our parents are living examples. We know that they would willing give their lives for us and would do all in their power to protect us. Christ is the ultimate example because he did give his life for us. Orual seems to act irrational but her intent is to only protect Psyche. I enjoyed watching the thought process of Orual as she struggles to accept the divine qualities in herself. That paralleled my emotions. Since I strive for perfection, I always look for fault. I fail to see that beneath my mistakes there is also good. Orual strives to purge herself from ungodliness and doesn't see her attainment until someone tells her. Later when I was discussing the book, someone brought up the question if having a man write the book effected the portrayal of the woman. I reflected that it had, because I could relate more with Orual than with her others sisters. Orual was more mannish then her younger sisters. She also seemed more realistic because of that. The other sisters were distant from me because they floated in aa world of beauty where everyone worshiped them. Orual had plenty of rejection. Her own father for one rejected her. This made her seem as if life had a grasp on her. This book explored the faithful love of Orual. This love was blinding at times even causing her to bring more pain onto her sister. It also blinded her so she could not see the beauty within herself. All the other character achieve the purpose of helping to expand and test Orual's character. This was successfully done so at the end we feel that we know who she truly is."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is nothing short of a true work of art. Lewis captures human struggle with a depth of insight unmatched in anything I've ever read, with the exception of the Bible. He does this through the most unorthodox of vehicles one would expect a devout Christian to employ; a woman protagonist, and overt pagan mysticism. His use of these elements, in the analysis of his message and final product, is nothing short of genius. Lewis entraps you with his smooth flowing story line, and then grabs you suddenly by sculpting it into something entirely different than what one was expecting. While this story does retain some allegorical elements, they wrap inside of each other like entraping vines, beckoning the reader to discern their path. If the path is discovered (it took me 3 days of contemplation to discover what Lewis had done to my consciousness with his words, and ultimately what the meaning of this story was) one not only has a serene sense of accomplishment but is left with an awe for this writer's incredible mystic wisdom"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have never read a book with such power to haunt, to inspire. Till We Have Faces held me spellbound the first time I read it, and it's power has done nothing but increase with each re-reading. There are thoughts expressed here, thoughts that perhaps each of us have known on the flickering edge of our consciousness, but have never known to put into words. This book is incredible in the way that it matches gritty realism with a soaring myth, and make the myth so much more powerful because it becomes real. Reading this powerful book will change you."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It was less important that it was well written, and what was written about, than the character behind it. Orual's character is explained in great detail through her actions and how she analyzes herself for the first part of the book. She tells a fascinating story of a woman who has lost everything and blames the gods. She is ugly and will never be loved; her sister she adores she destroys out of love; the kindest treatment she receives is from those who look at her as a man. The results are a hardened and bitter woman. She has reigned as a great queen but lost her humanity. She has no life or love to look back upon, and all is a cruel joke. She has been wronged horribly. She finishes with a denunciation of the gods. But as Orual starts in with the second part of the book, her entire manner has changed. Other people have become more open to her, offered her new perspectives. Her younger sister she thought despised her was lonely. The man she loved she worked to death because she was blind to his own needs. Although it is not pleasant, she begins to see how selfish and blind she has been. As she sees things differently, her feelings soften. It's amazing to see, mostly because we have all had similar experiences. We see what happens, assume we understand it, and paint for ourselves a story. It is only later that someone or something else opens our eyes (almost literally, when Orual is on top of the mountain) and we feel remorse, shame, or compassion. We are seldom honest with ourselves. She admits at the start of the second book that to leave the story as she first saw it would be to lie. As she re-examines the evidence, she is forced to admit her conclusions were wrong. Fortunately, there is redemption for her, even after all of her shortcomings. The wrongs she has committed against loved ones are righted by the very gods she denounced. We, too, so often discover how narrow and clouded and short our own vision is. C. S. Lewis has managed to explore some of the emotions we all feel and assumptions we all make. In Till We Have Faces, he has revealed clearly part of what makes us human."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I found Til We Have Faces to be extremely thought-provoking and it made me drown in a pool of emotions. When I began this book, I wasn't sure where it was going. I wasn't even sure I liked it. Eventually, the story got deeper and deeper. Characters intertwined and morphed in and out of eachother. That is the key element of the story; the psychological feel that it has. You suspect certain things may happen, but at least in my case, most did not. I enjoy books that are not readily predictable. What I enjoyed most, however, was all the emotion the book made me feel. C.S. Lewis brings the characters to life in your mind, it made me actually feel pain, happiness, and confusion for/towards them. Everything related to eachother, and even when the book ended, I still felt like the story was continuing without me. It was very real, and made you think. True, I lost interest in some chapters, but on the whole, the book had a very unique overall point, that if discovered, is one of the most amazing and fascinating points to discover. All the emotion the characters felt, the things they saw.. the work was beautiful. I suggest this reading, but only if one is willing to read closely and grasp underlying ideas. The book is one that should be closely read, I don't really think it is a pleasure book, though it was extremely enjoyable. Everyone should give the book a try, the message of the book is too unique not to."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I received this book in late December, months after I ordered it and long after I needed it.

With a background in both Classics and Religion (to some degree) I very much looked forward to reading this book & liking it. There is just something about CSL's writing(s)that does not resonate with me, and I cannot say exactly what. I've read other works by him & felt much the same way afterwards.

At first, it seemed like a brief respite from the dense and monotonous novels we had read earlier. However, upon further reading, I found that this book was the worst one that I have read throughout the course. My primary complaint on this book is that the story of Cupid and Psyche was almost left out. Instead, the protagonist, the cliche, jealous ugly duckling that never becomes a beautiful swan, narrates her trials and tribulations against the gods that have plagued her. In fact, most of the Cupid and Psyche myth is removed until the end of the book, where it is told with no descriptive language or immagery. The rest of the book is the protagonist whining about her life with an overly symbolic, pretensous and confusing resolution and an absent climax. If you don't aprreciate literature and entertainment at all, this book is for you. But if you love to read entertaining and thought provoking works of literature, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Sadly , and with great disapointment.

I dont think i have ever read such a boring and moronic text."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Amazing story that touches on the raw experience of love, how it can go wrong, perception, the pain of recognition and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I love love love C. S. Lewis. And not just for the Narnia Chronicles, I love almost all his books, especially The Great Divorce and Mere Christianity. So when I first heard of this book on IntoTheBook, I knew that I had to read it. And when I saw this at the Christian Bookstore at Ochanomizu, the price tag wasn't even a consideration (but for the record, it's the most expensive book I've bought, and the only one I paid full price for, since coming to Japan).Till We Have Faces is a retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth. In the original story, the two sisters of Psyche are evil and jealous. But like Wicked, C. S. Lewis shines a different light on one of the oldest sisters - Orual (or so he calls her).Orual grew up ugly and unloved. But when Psyche is born (and her mother dies as a result), Orual transfers all her love to the beautiful Psyche. Eventually, this love is twisted into hate after Psyche's \\"sacrifice\\" to the Shadowbrute.Bred on a mixture of Glom (the country where Till We Have Faces is set) superstition and Greek logic (courtesy of the Greek Slave The Fox/Grandfather), Orual is conflicted inside. Indeed, after she becomes Queen of Glom (a very capable queen I might add), she's still tormented by what she did to Psyche by convincing her to betray her husband. So what she does is to push Orual inside her and let the Queen take her place. In this way, she becomes numb.It is only after she hears the twisted version of Cupid and Psyche (or to the reader, the conventional version), is she inspired to pen her version (or the 'true' version) of the story as a complaint to the gods. But when she is truly heard, she sees that her complaint was very different from the tale she told. Her complaint is one of bitterness, that she could not wholly possess the love of her sister.The writing in this book is marvellous. I really do wonder why it's not more popular. C. S. Lewis has spun a marvellous story and got me to look at the original myth in a whole new light. It felt as though it was an ancient myth, but it also felt modern at the same time. The language is easy to understand and very absorbing.In short, this is an excellent book (I love how I've been finding a lot of excellent books since coming to Japan). It's not only an entertaining tale, it's also a story about love, what it is, and what it is not.First posted at [...]"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have for several years said that TILL WE HAVE FACES is the best novel in the English language. While I am sure there are many books that might also make that claim, and I have read many of the books that have been considered great. However, after all these years of reading I still retain that opinion.I was young when I first read it (between the age of 12 and 15) and it was really beyond my reading level. I pressed on and finished it, though it took me several weeks. What compelled me was a sense of beauty and wonder, of wonderful things hiding just out of sight behind ordinary things. Out of all C.S. Lewis's fantasies, this is the most wild and most romantic. It was only when I was older during many subsequent re-readings that I realized the philosophy C.S. Lewis was expressing in this novel.Yes it is dark, there are human sacrifices, beheadings, wars and lonliness, but through it all a joy hanging within reach if one would just believe in it. The ideas are reminiscent of other Lewis books, one can imagine Oural, the protagonist of the story as grown-up Susan Pevensie cynical of Narnia as a child's fantasy or as one of the ghosts in THE GREAT DIVORCE refusing to see how she was responsible for the hurts she caused others in her life. Perhaps the Shadow Brute is how the Calormen thought of Aslan.

In short, this is a must read. This is a great book to help you look deeper into the Love of Christ, and reflect on how you accept that love. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I've just finished reading this and must say I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't expect the story to be such a clear picture of a woman's psychological maturation. The story's protagonist moves from self-pity through a life of concealed pain, and ends with her final triumph. It holds up a mirror to the way we live our lives, firmly stuck in ourselves - and when all of those prejudices and ego-tricks fall away, we get to see reality from a wider perspective.

The characters stand out, and will stick in your mind, with Lewis's keen description of their passion and pain. If only more myths were retold and remade this well.However, for all of its strengths Till We Have Faces suffers from the common weakness of Lewis . . . his tendency to be preachy, and to damage his story by being heavy handed with the point he wants to make. The story would have been more startling, thought provoking, and well written if Lewis had ended the tale after the first part. Nonetheless, the central strengths of this story bears it up and in the end it remains a well worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"To call this merely a book, is like calling Niagra Falls, merely a water fountain. CS Lewis takes you on a tour of your soul, showing how the dragons and demons within, are ten times more frightening than the demons without. I tremble at how clearly Lewis can hold up a mirror and force us to look in it, and yet have us walk away with MORE compassion on ourselves and others. CS Lewis' lifetime of work, suffering and joy, is boiled down into this one book. Reading it is a life-changing event. But it will mean more to you if you read certain CS Lewis books first, especially Mere Christianity, Surprised by Joy, The Weight of Glory, Miracles and The Great Divorce. This is truly CS Lewis &quot;dessert&quot;. Don't miss it, but save it for last."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Right now this is my favorite book, even after reading it 8 times. The book is divided into two parts: the first half is a &quot;complaint against the Gods&quot;, where Queen Oural tells her life story and how &quot;the Gods&quot; have ill-used her and lied about her; and it seems that she is indeed ill-used. The second half of the book is an addendum, where she realizes that she's been a horrible person all her life; she's sucked the blood out of everyone that loved her and discarded them when she's finished; and about her redemption. Full of powerful symbolism and the terrible truth of God's love."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis is a literary genius - that much is certain. But this book is extraordinary as no other I have known. With each reading, one is pulled into the depths of one's self, and forced to come face to face with new levels of truth. Each time you will take away with you a new revelation. If you have ever been angry at God, or wondered why things were so unfair, this is definitely the book for you. (Although I would recommend it to anyone.) Truly a magnificent piece of literature."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I purchased this book reluctantly. It started out methodically(as THAT HIDIOUS STRENGTH) but had an ending that literally knocks your socks off.

Definitely one of Lewis's top five."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Dear reader, I agree with you wholeheartedly that Till We Have Faces is an interesting book, but I do not think that the dear departed would appreciate being reffered to in the feminine. I know many great writers have suffered persecution both during and after their lives, and I realize you may not have known any better (which makes me wonder how you could have really enjoyed TWHF) but so as not to confuse any other readers or potential readers, CS Lewis was a man. Clive Staples may not have been the best name and he may have gotten beat up once or twice for it in elementary school, but please don't confuse him with a girl."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is often misunderstood due to the posibility that Lewis intended to be aligorical.

Is there only one way - one religion?&quot; this is one of three books that have influenced my private theology and my personal relationship with God. The others two: &quot;Kim&quot; by Rudyard Kipling and &quot;Sidhartha&quot; by H. Hesse. I highly recommend that this beautiful fable be read by searchers and doubters and firm believers. Mr. Lewis certainly does not hit you over the head with his point of view. As with all messages of faith, each reader may find a different and personal meaning."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I loved Greek mythology when I was growing up. Unfortunately, the stories were were so single faceted. It was like reading Greek myths as told by Aesop. However, in Till We Have Faces, you run into a story that's a true work of literary art. For those of you who don't know the story of Psyche and Cupid, read the last segment of the book first for reference, because Lewis tells you the myth and then tells you how he altered the storyline. Don't worry, it won't really give anything away, and even if it does, it doesn't detract from the reading. One of the most interesting things I found about the book was that when Lewis altered the myth, I found an incredible amount of Christian themes running in it. Maybe I read to deeply into the story, but knowing that Lewis was a devout Christian by this time, it seems that the religious element was not merely coincidental. Orual and Psyche seemed to represent the humanity and deity of Christ respectively, especially because he makes the human appearance so unattractive as stated in Isaiah 53 which talks about the Messiah, &quot;He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.&quot; The divine aspect (represented in Psyche) on the otherhand is as beautiful as the gods. In fact Psyche eventually becomes a goddess (again representative of Christ's deity). Again, maybe I'm reading way too much into this story. Nonetheless, it was a great read and I highly recommend this book not as a \\"Christian book\\" but as a wonderful work of literature."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"If you've read the reviews, wondered why everyone raves about TILL WE HAVE FACES, stick with the book till Chapter Ten. It's a little sluggish till you reach Chapter Ten, but make no plans once you turn that page. You won't put it down after that point.I am amused, I think, by the rigid assertions of some reviewers, as to what Lewis was trying to say with this tale. If you are put off by any of those assertions, ignore them. Plain and simple, don't listen to what a single person on here says the book means.Because the first time you read it, you'll understand it one way. The next time, after you yourself have grown, changed, aged, oh sigh, yes even matured, you will understand it another way. You will identify with one character more than another depending on who you are and are becoming, you will read the philosophy/theology differently depending on what you believe at that moment.But -- once read, it's likely you will read it again."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"You'd think this was just another myth. But not if it's written by CS Lewis!Somewhat of a cross between the story of Cupid and Psyche and a science fiction novel, you travel through the mind and heart of a woman who begins as the ugliest woman in the world, and becomes one of the most beautiful.

His style is a bit different then I am used to... scattered at times but very realistic.This story is the re-telling of the myth of Psyche and Cupid, only the author adds his own twist to it.The reading was a bit slow at first but by about page 80 I could not put this book down. It is hard to describe just what this story is about, there are many elements. Essentially it is written as one woman's account against the gods, claiming they have wronged her and ruined her life. Just read it and see.I look forward to reading more of CS Lewis."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"On the most superficial level, C.S. Lewis' novel, Till We Have Faces, is somewhat of a fairy tale. It involves three sisters-Orual, Redival, and Istra (or Psyche)-who are daughters of a king. The eldest, Orual, is the plainest and most abused, while the youngest, Istra, is revered as a goddess. It is a story full of double meanings, sacrifices, valor, and hidden identities. However, many of these hidden \`identities' can be found in the underlying themes of the story. I believe this story to be primarily a commentary on the meaning of true worth. Throughout the story, Orual is completely disregarded because she does not meet society's standards. Her father rails at her and beats her every time something in life displeases him. Even she understands that the world will despise her and make her their scapegoat because she is different or \\"ugly.\\" From an early age, she knows that the would \\"would be cureller to [her] than to Redival because of [her] ugliness\\" (Lewis, 12). Her only value to this jaded society is in her knowledge. When her father hires a tutor for his family, he tells the Greek slave who fills the position to educate Orual well: \\"See if you can make her wiser; it's about all she'll ever be good for\\" (Lewis, 7). In contrast, the youngest princess, called both Istra and Psyche, is the most extravagantly revered person in the story, save Ungit, their equivalent of the Greek Aphrodite or the Roman Venus. Solely on the basis of her beauty, she is equivocated with a goddess. Her subjects even go so far as to make offerings of sorts to her. As if appeasing her would bring prosperity, they lay \\"down a branch of myrtle at [her] feet and bowed and put dust on [their heads].\\" In the time of a plague, they nearly tear down the castle walls, insisting that the only one who can save them is Istra: \\"Send out the Princess with her healing hands...She has beauty enough, that's one thing. And spirit\\" (Lewis, 31). And when things do not improve, they typically call her the Accursed one. The society does not have faith in her intellectual skills or her practical knowledge. If this were so, they would have turned to Orual in the first place. Instead, they first and foremost look to the tangibly worthy. This draws a strong parallel to our own society, a point that must have been intentionally made by Lewis in his construction of the story. I was amazed by the society's superficial devotion to such a weak force as beauty, then was struck by the poignancy of Lewis' message on the false gods we worship. The most powerful blow came near the end of the book. Orual discovers that she, herself, is Ungit. Throughout the book, Ungit has been the most highly respected force of the society. She is the goddess of love, lust, and prosperity and is unrivaled in her beauty. The point of revelation of Orual as the true force behind this power, though she is despised as the antithesis of everything society worships in this goddess, is the most powerful moment in the entire story. It reveals that it is not material beauty that mankind should worship, but the true beauty that comes from within the human spirit. In the end, C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces is a testament to the noble beauty that can be found within every person and a condemnation of the materialistic hovel we exist in."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I admit, I was not completely \\"blown away\\" by this book. Maybe it's because I'm not an avid book-reader, I possess limited English vocabulary and Greek mythology interests me as much as cowboy music (shudder). A friend introduced me to this novel and I borrowed it from the library, wondering what this raved book contained and which made people write, \\"you must read this!\\"It's a very captivating book and C.S. Lewis does wonders. To someone like me, he managed to get me to continue reading, even though I didn't understand everything. Yes - I'm guilty of reading Cliff Notes and I would say I would purchase one for \\"Till We Have Faces\\" if there's one out there. This novel (to me) contains symbols and many philosophical ideas and it's not like I hang out with people who discuss them. I don't think like this, I don't carouse with people who do - so sue me! There's my vent...My favorite parts are the dialogues and especially love how Orual comes across as someone you know in real life, perhaps even a reflection of yourself and your own thoughts. I love how C.S. Lewis describes the beauty of Psyche and the love/hate relationship Orual has with her. Lewis has a way of expressing what I want to express, except he has a better way of articulating it! Part II is also another favorite section of mine, even though I found myself asking, \\"What's up with this dream sequence?\\"I decided to read Amazon reviews to shed some light after completing the book. I honestly did not see God in this, as reviewers said, and believe I will have to read this book again in the future. I really hope it will be as good the next time as others say it is."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"In order to understand what a truly amazing book this is you have to realize three things: (1) The author was an INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT man, (2) he was an INCREDIBLY BRILLIANT scholar of medieval and ancient literature and (3) he is one of the most brilliant fiction writers of all time.How Brilliant is Lewis? So Brilliant that I can't imagine him writing this story at all and let alone so beautifully. After all what does a staid, middle age typically British male have in common with a young girl from a far less repressed culture?Lewis is known as a scholar and lecturer on Christian theology, but I can just about bet that future generations are not going to remember him for that. What they will remember is the powerful ability that Lewis had to tell a tale. Besides, if there is anything of Christian Dogma in this work it is the aspects of it that are universal to all societies and religions.The story is described as the retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth, but it is in actuallity a story about a young woman who grows up to discover that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but the elements of ones personality are what make a person &quot;beautiful&quot;. In the end, individuals are respected for their character and the actions that they display.What kept me involved in this story (I too read it in one sitting)was Lewis' masterful prose. While Lewis wanted us to believe in the vibrancy and color of the sights and sounds of Narnia, here he wants us to believe in the workings of the main characters mind. Lewis' use of language also draws the reader in and keeps one riveted to each page. One other highlight here is all the research that Lewis did on Hellenic (Ancient Greek style) cultures to bring authentisity to the story.My recommendation is to read this book more than once. There is so much there to experience."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Up until now, I have never been disappointed in a book by C.S. Lewis: fiction, fantasy, non-fiction-all top-notch, gripping and beautifully told. I found the first person narrative of &#34;Till We Have Faces&#34; to be thoroughly unconvincing-it never rang true to me as a story told by a female protagonist. The language seemed unnecessarily stiff, even allowing for the style being imitative of epic prose. I would discourage anyone from reading this book as a first contact with C.S. Lewis (it's probably interesting as an anomaly for readers who are well-acquainted with his work.)"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The book arrived before I expected and it made me happy because I would have more time to read it, before my book club meeting.I am half way thru the book but so far I enjoyed the book very much because being a C.S. Lewis book I thought it will be hard reading. Surprise! It Is Very Easy reading!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis' writing has always mesmerized me. His fiction in particular is engaging and tells superb stories that unlock spiritual truths. \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is his unforgettable reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. Unlike Lewis' Narnia books, in which the symbolism is overtly Christian, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is cloaked in a world that is rooted in paganism. However, the truths found within this book will amaze and thrill you.Princess Orowell is unloved, unattractive, and appreciated only for her shrewdness in politics and military ability. She finds solace in her younger half-sister, Psyche, whose beauty and joyous spirit make others love her ferociously. When plagues and pestilence invade the land of Gloam, Psyche is sent to be a sacrifice for the \\"Shadow Brute,\\" or \\"God of the Mountain.\\" What follows is a journey upon which the princess Orowel embarks; a journey fraught with startling revelations and self-discovery.\\"Till We Have Faces\\" addresses the themes of obsessive love, our heartrending struggles between our feeble flesh and our souls, faith, and the infinite mysteries surrounding God; mysteries that will never fully be explained in this life.Lewis' characterization in this book is extremely vivid. Orowel's brusque mannerisms are in startling contrast with Psyche's joyous and innocent nature. I found myself relating strongly with Orowel's struggles. She is a character not easily forgotten.Nadia May reads this audio version superbly well. The pain of Princess Orowel is evident, and the British accent is easy on the ears. The words flow, making a story that might appear difficult to understand at first very comprehensible. Please give this riveting story a chance. God bless you all.(Please look for my allegorical novel, Crimilia, which is available on this web site. Thank you)."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Perhaps the most unearnedly ignored piece of 20th century literature: the Christian market ignored it since it was about gods and goddesses and the secular market ignored it because it was by that &quot;Christian guy who wrote children's books&quot;.

I wanted to know which was the &quot;right&quot; side, and I couldn't decide. I wanted a black and white answer, and life simply doesn't have that many of them. I totally identified with the main character exploring logic vs blind faith in my Christian life. Each time I think of it I am more and more focused on living by the grace of God rather than the logical laws of His. I urge all to read it as if they were one of the characters, depending on the character I choose there is always a new lesson."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have read 'Till We Have Faces' many times and it has something new and important to say to me each time we encounter one another. This retelling of the Eros and Psyche Myth from the point of view of Psyche's sisters is still fresh and powerful even after so many years. Because it is a myth in itself its power to move and change the reader will never die.

He abandoned the poetry in favor of a prose story, and I think TILL WE HAVE FACES the best of his novels. It is one of those works that fits the cliche &quot;I couldn't put the book down.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I first read this in elemenatary school, and every once in a while I would remeber this book set in Egypt or Greece about a girl who was really ugly so wore a veil (mind you this was 20 years ago) I remembered exactly where in the library it was but never the title or author, recently one of my friends and I was discussing Lewis, and she mentioned it!! I had to go reread it and it made much more sense now that I have had more Greek mytholigy under my belt. Irecomend this for EVERYONE who loves diffrent views of classic stories"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Well, to say the least, C.S. Lewis's work is awesome. I am a huge fan of the 'Chronicles of Narnia', which is what pushed me to buy this book. 'Till We Have Faces' is a great story, the tale of Cupid and Psyche. I visited a website the other day that was Anti-C.S. Lewis or something; the authors were crazy and called him a tool of the devil! Obviously they had not read his work; although it is wrong of a Christian such as Mr. Lewis to believe in Greek gods and goddesses, he uses these beings as a mere reference to his Christian theme. The book tells the story of a princess of the \\"savage\\" lands near Greece, and how the beautiful Psyche comes into her family and teaches her a life lesson. The book is about love, and faith, and selfishness. It is a great addition to anyone's bookshelf, even if the reader is an Athiest. In addition to great literature and a furthur explanation of God's ways, this book gave me inspiration to some of my own writing. I recommend it!!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"From begining to end a perfect example of the art and skill of Mr. Lewis. Unlike any other of his books. Yet just as wonderful."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I don't think there's much to say about this book. It's a solid retelling of the Eros and Psyche myth, but if you already know that story, then you already know what's going to happen (for the most part). It was a quick read and the ending was different.My only problems with it were the names and some underlying ideas. I know that he's trying to portray a barbaric society, but, seriously, renaming Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty, UNGIT, of all things? Almost all the women's names sounded masculine to me, and vice versa. Also, CS Lewis seems to be trying to tell us that women aren't as good as men, though I guess that can be blamed on the time period in which he wrote."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I bought this book on recommendation from a friend and I could not agree with her positive opinions more. The story was engaging and exciting. I found myself identifying with the characters while at the same time wondering at their actions and words. Also, I found that while most books have unsatisfactory endings, this book has one of the best last paragraphs I've ever read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book was a fast read, and coupled with the fact that I really couldn't put it down, it was a really fast read.CS Lewis is one of my favorite authors, I have many of his books, and currently have a few more on my \\"to be read\\" shelf. I love the way that he can be a cogent and articulate theologian in such works as Mere Christianity, but then he can switch hats and write wonderful works of fantasy, which have strong undertones of Christianity such as the Chronicles of Narnia (I really need to go back to those, because the more I read snippets of them, the more I realize just how Christian they are), or the Space Trilogy, or this book.What CS Lewis has done here is to take the classical Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, and rework it. Now one might say, well that myth is a classic, why mess with a classic? Well, read the book and find out. In a way he reworked it, but in another way he wrote an entirely new story unto its own."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I think I got confused while reading this book I hope that I am not the only one. When you are done reading it you think you see what Lewis is trying to say and then it disappears like last nights dream. But all in all Lewis put words together and spins the tale better than a spider spins a web you get caught up in it and cant put it down.Great Awsome and as I said I need to read it again."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Myths are often a distillation of human experience and knowledge, pared down to an easily digestible story that is both memorable and instructive. No less so here, as Lewis takes the tale of Cupid and Psyche and adds a small change to the basic tale - but that change reverberates and focuses the message that Lewis is imposing on the tale, a message about what love is versus what many normally think it is.Lewis sets the tale in the \`barbarian' country of Glom, with a King obsessed with getting a son, and thereby cursed with three daughters. Orual is the supremely ugly one, Psyche just as beautiful as Orual is ugly, and the third sister is the personification of greed and petty jealousy. But it is Orual that the book follows, down deep into her basic outlook about herself, her relationship with the Gods, and most especially how her feelings for Psyche and her sense of propriety cause her to commit blackmail in the name of love. Lewis clearly shows that love that does not place the desires of the loved one above any personal sense of right/wrong/duty/honor is not a true love, but rather the product of selfishness, of the \`I know what's best for my love' syndrome.But this is merely the beginning to the layers of philosophy present in this book, as it calls into question not only if there are gods, but just how mortals can or must perceive them if they exist, and how much \`God' is present in everyone. Masks are a symbol here, from the veil that Orual takes to wearing, to those masks used by the priesthood when performing their embassies for their god, to the masks that everyone presents to the outside world. Also covered is the value of good deeds versus an irredeemable sin, what vital tasks man is burdened with during his short lifetime, and even the value of philosophy as a field of study. All this and more is hidden underneath this apparently simple story, with little direct exposition of these ideas until this last portion of the book, which is written as a dream allegory.The characterization of Orual is excellent - she is person you can recognize and feel with, and her dilemmas are ones we all have faced, though perhaps not in such grandiose terms. Psyche, the King, and Fox, the sister's Greek slave teacher, are drawn with enough depth to understand their motivations, and provide the proper environment so that each person's actions are understandable and the plot action inevitable.I did feel that the last section of book went a little too far in the way of symbolism and philosophy, that perhaps a more action-oriented explication of the points Lewis was trying to present in this section would have been better. But this is certainly a book that is good for more than one reading, with a timelessness to its messages, and told with skill and great thought.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"NOT!!! I'm 14 years old and I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is so creative and it has a lot of dialog- which means it never got boring- and it was so interesting! I loved it and rate it 5 stars!!*****"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I was given this book as a gift several years ago for Christmas from my sister and brother-in-law, and promptly wrinkled my nose and put it on my bookshelf without really bothering to see what it was about after I saw C.S. Lewis as the author. However, while taking my collegiate Latin class, my instructor mentioned it while we were reading the story of Psyche and Cupid in our text. With his recommendation and now knowing its subject, I decided it would be something I'd like to read.The book doesn't take long--it's 300 pages, but they go by quickly and it's interesting, so it keeps you turning the pages. Some of the ends of the chapters have that device of young adult literature, the cliffhanger, so even when you vow you're going to stop and go to bed you end up reading further than you intended.This book is in the grand tradition of &quot;Grendel&quot; or &quot;Wicked&quot;--that is, telling the myth or story from the point of view of the &quot;evil&quot; person in the story (although, as this book was published in the late fifties, it seems it started the tradition rather than continuing it). This makes it incredibly interesting. It is written from the viewpoint of Princess and then Queen Orual, older half sister of Istra, known as Psyche to Orual and their beloved slave, the Fox, a Greek who teaches Orual his native language and looks after her. Psyche's mother dies in childbirth, and Orual and the Fox become her caregivers. However, Psyche is sacrificed to the local goddess, Ungit, and Orual receives an enormous shock when she goes up to the mountain on which Psyche was sacrificed to bury her remains.I won't say more, as I don't want to give away anything in the book. Every now and then, it seems like something is included and really does not have much to do with the larger story, but this does not take away from the book's entertainment value. While I would not number it in my top ten favorite books or anything like that, I am not regretful of having read it. It raises interesting questions for all of us as we witness Orual's struggle over whether her intentions were as pure as she originally believed, as well as the ever-enduring issuing of questioning God or, in this book, the gods.This is prime beach reading or rainy day reading. Not only that, but it tricks you into thinking about certain issues by embedding them into a heartbreaking, beautiful story."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C. S. Lewis again weaves personal philosophy into a magical story. Much more than a children's fable, Till We Have Faces is a retold myth about three princesses: one beautiful, one ugly, one perfect. Spell-binding and thought-provoking, this novel delves into Orual's intense struggle to discover herself. What she ultimately finds is a pure inner love that equals all beauty. Orual's teacher and mentor, The Fox, exemplifies wisdom and rational thinking. Schooled in logic, he teaches Orual to shun the blind following of common thought and to test truth for herself. Because of the young princess's admiration of The Fox, she comes to question many of the traditional customs and beliefs of her people. Orual's acquisition of knowledge is of itself unusual in her kingdom as she is a woman. On the other hand, Psyche represents the metaphysical realm of imagination. Her ability to heal her diseased subjects by her touch is one evidence of her divinity. Unparalleled beauty and goodness are qualities she alone possesses. Too perfect for her mortality, she is wedded to a god and taken to live in a golden palace. Caught between her love for The Fox and Psyche, Orual is an embodiment of the struggle between the rational and supernatural. When she stabs herself in the arm, Orual convinces Psyche of her seriousness and concern. But more importantly, this action symbolizes Orual's grasping for reality; in a physical sense, she attempts to convince herself that her world is not one of mystical gods and imaginary palaces. As she persuades Psyche to steal a glance at her husband's face, her realism speaks out and is the source of torment to Psyche as well as to herself. Yet when she herself views the palace of the gods, her reason submits itself to wonder and belief. Even the supernatural must be subject to reason and be proven with Orual's own eyes. As time distances her from Psyche and she takes over the affairs of her kingdom, the Orual of fantasy is lost to a Queen of reason. The veil that Orual dons to disguise her frightful appearance is symbolic of her disillusionment; no one, not even Orual herself, truly knows who she is. Some villagers eventually come to believe that she hides her face because it is unbearably beautiful. They do not even consider the fact that her face might be hideous because of her valiant and majestic actions as Queen. Her engagement in a fencing match and her courageous defense of her country and allies forever solidifies Orual's noble reputation. Her nobility of character paints a face, at least in her subjects' eyes, that is exquisite. The veil hides her face, but symbolically it hides the past. Orual thinks less and less of Psyche as the years go by. But just as her face is still present behind the veil, so is her memory and love of Psyche. Orual begins to experience unusual dreams that are so real she feels like she's living them. They prove to be manifestations of her commitment to Psyche and the devotion she never stopped giving her. The new priest of Ungit is a representation of Orual's realization of truth. The old priest had frightened her because of his supposedly awesome powers, but Arnom's powers are not at all mysterious to her. Orual finally understands that the bird-like masks, holy rituals, and bloody sacrifices were created by her ancestors and became traditions of her people; she relates these traditions with The Fox's Greek beliefs in the gods and goddesses whose actions explain the natural phenomena of nature, such as rain and harvest. Just as Orual is finally able to define her beliefs, she ultimately is capable of defining herself. However, she first sees herself in the wrong light when she compares herself to Ungit. Like Ungit, she is ugly, and no one can fully comprehend her character. Like Ungit, she is revered. Like Ungit, she is not perfect. Orual's love for Bardia is tainted with selfishness. She fails to see his ever-weakening state as he faithfully serves her. Orual's confrontation with Bardia's wife opens her eyes to her own cruelty. But for a brief moment when she admits her deep love, she literally and symbolically takes off her veil and catches a glimpse of the person she is. That person is Psyche, not Ungit. When the veil is forever stripped from her face and her understanding is complete, Orual sees herself in true light. She is Psyche; her love for her allowed Orual to live for Psyche. Her beauty is perfect. C. S. Lewis forces his reader to ask himself, \\"What veil do I wear, and what do I hide in wearing it? Do I know who I really am under such a facade?\\" As we contemplate these questions, we are forced to see ourselves in a new, untainted light. The final question we must ask ourselves is this: \\"Can we, like Orual, discover a balance between our fantasies and realities that ultimately reveals our inner beauty?\\""},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is by far one of the best I have ever read. It is an exploration of feelings of love and hate, and it channels deep within the human heart to display openly feelings we all have, yet very rarely express. Its beauty is in its honesty. I also was particuarly taken with the character of Psyche. Her vunerablity and her forgiving/trusting nature so a softer side to the harsh reality of her life in the book. This book is a treasure, an excellent find...I myself am only 17 and I feel in love with it instantly. CS Lewis has created a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I give this book 5 stars only because there is no 6 star option. From the very beginning, the book grabbed me and pulled me into a deep, but extremely followable plot. C.S. Lewis uses his skillful word choice and masterful story telling to put the reader directly in every situation, action, and thought. The situations presented to you all throughout the book are explored in full detail until it almost feels as if the decisions made were your own and not the character's. Besides being a joy to read, this book also makes you think. Lewis does a good job of putting just enough spin on the old fable until it seems as if the fable really should have been written his way to start off with. You'll find yourself second-guessing old assumptions you have, and re-addressing your thoughts, fears, feelings, and judgments. If you're looking for a book to put you to sleep at night, this is not the book for you. But if you're looking for a book that's fun to read, interesting, and deeply engaging--a book you can treasure forever--Till We Have Faces is what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The first time I read this book years and years ago I didn't understand much of it. I was young and I think lacked the emotional klout to be able to grasp what Lewis was writing about.Because I had heard many people saying it was his finest work I decided to read it again. I mean, it's Lewis, right? The first part of the book recounts the story of Psyche and Cupid as told by Psyche's sister, Orual. It's mainly tragic, and describes the events from Orual's point of view. And if it ended there it would be utterly depressing and awful. However, what makes the book is the second part. The realization that slowly comes to Orual in her latter years regarding all that has happened before is nothing short of amazing.Having gone through a similar journey myself now I completely understand what he was writing about, or at least, much more than at first read. And it's awesome! It's Lewis indeed at his best! A shame he died shortly after or else he would have written other masterpieces like this one. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I didn't really look at what cover my purchase would have; I was only concerned with buying this book.

This story was no exception. Orual's journey from innocence to confrontation with the gods has a familiar ring. A beautiful myth remade, the story is told with depth and compassion, yet with no sacrifice to the harsh realities of living and loving under the gaze of what feels like the capriciousness of the gods. Reading it again..."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis writes his most eloquent book here as he takes the reader into an ancient myth retold. His ability to describe setting, emotion, and thought processes of the main characters enable the reader to understand and intimately identify with the characters and the scenarios in the plot. This book is certainly recommended for those C.S. Lewis fans who have yet to add this book to their collection."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This review is for the audiobook version narrated by Nadia May. I will start out with the audiobook. I was very impressed with the narrator. I've heard her on several other classics and she always does a good job. This book is no exception. Her characterizations were done well and made it easy for me to determine which person was speaking. She has a very agreeable voice, and this book made for a very pleasant commute the last week or so.I am a CS Lewis fan and this is my first time through this novel. Most of his books have a clear Christian slant, but I was surprised when this one didn't. This wasn't a problem, just unexpected. It did do an excellent job pointing out certain universal truths, but did seem to stick with the pagan mythical religious theme that this story was derived from.I thought that his rewriting the story of Psyche and Cupid from the perspective of the ugly sister was very well done. One of the things I enjoy with great literature is looking at things in life from a different viewpoint and learning from it. This book shows how people sometime do bad things with the best of intentions. It also reinforced to me that I need to look at situations from many angles before making a decision or judgment.I highly recommend this book and the audiobook was an excellent way to go through this book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis knows how to tell an excellent story and make a few important points at the same time. He brought the story to life; Lewis's version is much more believable and interesting than the original myth. The book is mainly about the main character's development, so as a reader I felt like I was even maturing along with the main character. I connected to many of the hard lessons learned in this book because they point to inherently human issues.The main difference between the original myth and Lewis's version is that sisters were not able to see castle that the god created for the princess. This was a great twist, because it caused the characters to doubt instead of believe in the gods."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I had not been familiar with the myth of Psyche nor with the writing of C.S. Lewis prior to picking this book up, so I walked into this story with no preconceived notions at all. I really enjoyed the plot and characters, especially for the first half or so. Then, the book became quite bizarre and abstract, and I personally became less engaged. It wasn't until the last 20 pages or so that I once again was pulled back in. Lewis helps the reader gain perspective and insight into what we have read, and this is what helped make the story worthwhile. I am not sure I would read other Lewis novels -- not being a fan of fantasy or a particularly religious person -- but I am glad that I read this one."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is the most insightful work of fiction I have ever read. Lewis is not only a genius in his capacity as the author, but as an observer of humanity, the self, and the deep truths that lie beneath the convenient names we often use to simplify them.As other reviewers noted, the full power of this work is only apparent upon multiple readings. Astoundingly, Lewis' symbolic framework can effortlessly support at least two different mappings:Orual, the middle sister, bears a strong resemblance to that part of our being where our reason, will, and emotion reside. Redival could represent the body, concerned only with base interests, and Psyche is the radiant center of our being, which seeks union with the divine.On another reading, Psyche represents the spiritual side of human nature, and Orual represents religion, who through subtle missteps often contrives to rob us of our enjoyment of God as a person, a friend, a lover. (If you don't buy this reading, check out the scene where Orual realizes \\"I am Ungit.\\")Under either reading, the really remarkable part of the book is that the narrative keeps building momentum and delivers a chain of aftershocks after the supposed climax of Orual's crime of blackmailing Psyche -- aftershocks that represent the stages of Orual's becoming undeceived about herself, her nature, and the truth about her good intentions... and finally there's her repentance and her labors to undo the damage she has wrought!And besides all of that, you get the annals of Orual's reign as a wise and industrious queen and her rise as a swordswoman, which are great fun.And there's so much more I haven't even touched on! Just go on and read or re-read it!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Up until this point, my favourite C.S. Lewis books were \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". This book hasn't taken away from the appeal of those books, but this book is on a level all its own.This is a \\"reworking\\" of the tale of Psyche and Cupid, though the book has less to do with \\"Psyche and Cupid\\" per se, as it has to do with focusing on one of the historically \\"evil\\" sisters of Psyche.The tale is fascinating, and once I got into it, I couldn't put the book down. It's a tale of a woman with a grudge against the gods. It's a tale of disappointment and suffering. But it's also a tale about love, and what love really is as opposed to what we think it is and what we try to make it.This book is a masterpiece, and a recommendation for anybody who wants to read something substantial without being overly \\"heavy\\". I wish there were more books out there like this."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Wonderful. Couldn't put it down. Very easy to read and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have read many of Lewis' books and this one outdoes the power of Perelandra. other reviews will give you some of that flavor. The content is five stars; the Kindle edition is so sloppily done that it goes past a mere annoyance to sometimes interfering with what CSL was communicating. Needs a proofreader and a re-release available free to previous purchasers (like me)."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is best out of all C.S. Lewis' adult works. I am generally in love with how he has told and written this novel. &quot;A Myth Retold&quot; is the perfect subtitle for this book. Lewis is never cliche in this book, he has taken something and molded it into a psychological and profound masterpiece.Orual is a daughter of a King and sister to Psyche. Cupid/Eros and Psyche's story is recongnizable. This only skims the surface of the book. Lewis makes a Orual into a character with jealous love for her sister Psyche. In Lewis' version, Orual is never jealous of Psyche. She is rather selfish and wants to have Psyche for herself. She is a deep and compex character plagued by many things. Her situations, her feelings, her jealous love are all told beautifully by Lewis.It is rare that I read such brilliant character developpement. Orual seems real when you read the words Lewis has told, you feel her almost. Even through this descriptive and deepened world, Lewis' writings are easy to comprehend and this book is flowing. His storytelling is aesthetic and undoubtly talented.The book makes you feel for Orual at times. I did give immense pathos and empathy to Orual at times. Lewis did a wonderful job wrapping you into this book. If you doubt the beginning of the book, at least give it more of a try and read through the WHOLE book because it gets more better as it goes on.By the end of this book, you'll have appreciated Lewis' talents in writing, storytelling, and characterization. This is one of his best books. A must for his fans. If you like great literature, this is something you should read right away. Rarely have I felt so flung into the character's life and feelings. As many have said, C.S. Lewis will always be a great author. This is truly one of his best works ever."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I read this book at a time when I was starting to really dislike C.S.

And oh my dear Lord in heaven, the ending!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! I was just in ecstasy over the end, which was by far the finest and most well-developed conclusion EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Till We Have Faces is a book of such psychological profoundness and depth you could sink into it and never find an end to it's meaning. I'm still not out of it yet and I don't to be."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book captured my attention quite unlike anything else that I have read. The building up of each character was a work of art, the story fantastically woven between the threads of an ancient tale of tragedy and love. everything about this book made me reconsider what I truly believed to be true literature."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is my favorite novel by C. S. Lewis. He wrote that it was his favorite as well, though when the book came out, it was not well received by the public, and never gained much notoriety. Even today, few people even know that he wrote the book.I think that part of the problem is that even among those who have read the book, few understand what it is about. I am by no means a C. S. Lewis expert, but as I try to read through other things that C. S. Lewis has written, I have stumbled across some statement by him about this book, which I think sheds some light on its meaning.Let me attempt to share this meaning with you, without destroying the plot of the book too much.The book tells the story of three princesses, Orual, Redival, and Psyche. As their father the King had no sons, Orual was destined to become Queen, but she was very ugly. Redival, the middle sister, was beautiful, but was also lascivious and vain. However, the third sister, Psyche, was blessed the beauty and the temperament of the gods. She was not only beautiful, but was wise and kind. I cannot really tell much else about story without ruining it, except maybe to say that after much pain, tragedy, and betrayal, Orual becomes Queen and rules for many years.Near the end of her life, she writes a complaint against the gods. She claims that though she has done nothing but serve and honor them her entire life, they have given nothing in return but pain, grief, and destruction. She recognizes that she is powerless before them, but she feels that if there is one thing she can do against them, it is to make her complaint known by writing it in a book, and making it available for people everywhere to read. That book is the first part of C. S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces.But after she finished writing her complaint, she is given a vision. A vision of her life. A vision of her life replayed, but not from her perspective, but from the divine perspective, the perspective of the gods. It is they who saw the entire picture, while she saw only her small part. And this vision shows her that she has been wrong in her anger, and hatred, and bitterness toward the gods. It was not they who treated her so wrongly, but she who treated others wrongly. It was not they who were punishing her and destroying her life, but it was her own actions and behavior that brought pain upon herself.But even then, the gods took her actions, which had caused so much pain for so many people, and used them to accomplish good in the lives of others, especially those of others that she dearly loved.When she learned all this, she wrote a second book, which she concludes with the following statement:\\"I ended my first book with the words \\"no answer.\\" I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words. Long did I hate you, long did I fear you. I might--\\"And with that, she died.Here, I think, is the message of the book: We do not have faces until God makes one for us, and this He will only do by forming one from the garbage of our own lives. Until we learn to see ourselves clearly for who we really are, we see nothing clearly at all. In this book, Orual is brought face to face with herself, and hates what she sees. But it is only after she sees her soul's twisted face that she is given a new face, a beautiful, shining, radiant face of the gods. The most critical statement in the book is this one:\\"I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till the word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?\\" (p. 294).Here are a few other quotes from the book which opened my mind in wonder:\\"For all I can tell, the only difference [between reality and a dream] is that what many see we call a real thing, and what only one sees we call a dream. But things that many see may have no taste or moment in them at all, and things that are shown only to one may be spears and water-spouts of truth from the very depth of truth\\" (p. 277).When she stands on trial before the gods, she has this dialogue with another person who is there:\\"I cannot hope for mercy.\\"\\"Infinite hopes--and fears--may both be yours. Be sure that, whatever else you may get, you will not get justice.\\"\\"Are the gods not just?\\"\\"Oh, no, child. What would become of us if they were?\\" (p. 297).It is quotes like this from a master story-teller like C. S. Lewis which makes Till We Have Faces such a great book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold\\" is a sensitive retelling of the Psyche and Eros myth from the viewpoint of her sister, Queen Orual of Glome. We follow Orual from her childhood in Glome with her two sisters, extending to Psyche's sacrifice, and well beyond that through Orual's adult life to her death. More than the story of Psyche and Eros, it is the story of Orual's journey through life, how her life and her decisions affect everyone she cares about, including her youngest sister. In many ways, Psyche's journey is also Orual's journey. Seemingly, Orual's ambition destroys the lives of those she cares about most. The book does not end exactly where one expects it to, and though ironic, the ending also leaves the reader satisfied. The book does bear rereading, as it isn't what you would expect during the first reading and requires a second reading before the book's full message sinks in. Don't hesitate to reread this book and absorb the full message. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I agree with the many other Lewis scholars who strongly believe that Till We Have Faces is Lewis' greatest work. His lifelong love of ancient mythology shines through as Lewis presents the classic myth of Cupid and Psyche through Psyche's older sister Orual, who is Crown Princess, and later Queen, of the kingdom of Glome. We suffer with Orual who has been cursed with acne scars all over her face, and a father who believes that her only virtue is that of the strong capability to run a government; and we admire her for her military prowess, her wisdom, her strength, and her courage as she fights, not only with the sword, but with her sharp intellect. The tale of this brave warrior woman belongs on the bookshelves of all those who love and respect great literature!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Anyone who is a fan of C.S. Lewis may be somewhat shocked by \\"Till We Have Faces\\" for it is unlike any other piece of writing Lewis ever published, yet it is distinctly his own and aligns seamlessly with his other works. \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a retelling of the myth of Psyche and Cupid, but it goes far beyond the classical story to a reinvention that is better than the original. For this work is not only about the myth, but about human nature in general and how we all too often mistakenly see the world around us.The tale is narrated by Princess Orual, the oldest and ugliest princess of Glome. She did not always know of her ugliness, but it is made plain to her especially by the birth of her youngest sister, Istra, who is beautiful beyond comparison and worshipped as a goddess among the village people as she grows up. When famine and plague come to the land, the people are convinced that Istra is to blame and she is sacrificed to the Shadowbrute. Orual is devastated by the loss of her sister but cannot come to terms with what has truly happened to her for in her eyes it is a fate worse than death. Yet for the rest of her life, even as she becomes Queen of Glome, Orual searches for a way to reconcile herself to not only her lost sister, but to herself and to the mysteries of the gods.\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a philosophical examination of the classical myth of Psyche and Cupid. Lewis created a world that instantly comes to life and characters who are very real in their struggles even when those struggles are supernatural. It is a thought-provoking work about the nature of love and worship and how all too often our eyes remain closed to the truth that exists within the myths we create for ourselves."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is incredible! The writing is wonderful, and the way it is put together is very well done: the pages are the right size and material, and the font easy to read. The only thing I don't like is the strange, Renaissance-y cover art. However, the writing is gripping and the plot both meaningful and exciting. A rare artistic retold myth about the way we view God!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis triumphs again with a stunning retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. It is so beautifully written and as always in his writing, challenges your mind and touches your heart."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a myth retold. The myth of the love affair between Cupid and Psyche is the basis of the story, which is about a young princess that is so beautiful that no man would dare pursue her, because she was thought to be a goddess. This makes the goddess Aphrodite terribly jealous and demands that Psyche be offered as a sacrifice to the god's. Aphrodite instructs her son Cupid to put a spell on her to desire the worst of mankind; however, Cupid falls madly in love with Psyche because she is so beautiful. Because Cupid is a god and Psyche is a mortal, Cupid hides himself from her even though he is her husband. Psyche's two evil sisters come and deceive Psyche into uncovering her lover, and therefore, bring the punishment of exile on her. Aphrodite is happy again.Lewis takes this sad legend and transforms it into a story of redemption. The novel is written with the literary theory called \\"the broken-hearted reader\\" motif. This means that the narrative is written in a self-justifying prose that, in the end, exposes the brokenness and weakness of the writer. Something like Nathan's prophecy to David about the coveted lamb would be a good Hebrew example.The story is told by one of the supposedly \\"evil\\" sisters named Orual. Orual is leads a tragic life of one love and loss after another. Her father, the king, is an abusive tyrant who despises her, not only because she is a woman, but because she is ugly. Orual's greatest love, however, is reserved for her younger sister, Psyche, who is ripped away from her by a strange sacrificial demand for her life by the goddess Ungit. Orual is devastated, yet hopes that Psyche is alive, and finds her one day in an obscure forest. Psyche is blissful and full of life. She is passionate about the love of her \\"husband\\" and refuses to return with Orual to the kingdom. Orual's jealousy corrodes her mind, and out of \\"love\\" manipulates Psyche into betraying her husband. Psyche is lost, and Orual remains bitter.The king finally dies and Orual comes to power. She wears a veil to cover her ugliness, and becomes a legend throughout the land. She is cunning and brave as she rules her kingdom with the sword and her good counselors beside her. One of her counselor's is a man named Bardia, who is a commander of the military whom Orual is in love with. Yet, she also resents him because he is married. She despises him and makes him work long hours away from his family which in the end takes his life. Orual grieves for him and goes to comfort his wife who accuses her of murdering her husband with hard toil. Orual is disheartened.However, the biggest blow comes when Orual is told the legend of Psyche by a temple priest. The story is told in such a way that makes Psyche the victim of her \\"evil sister,\\" and Orual is outraged. She labors mightly over a book accusing the gods of injustice and defies anyone to tell her she is wrong. Orual accuses the gods of stealing Psyche from her, and pours out her complaint to them in a divine courtroom. However, as Orual is reading she realizes that she made Psyche violate the god not because Orual cared not for Psyche's life, but because she so wanted the highest place in Psyche's love.Orual is interrupted by the judge and realizes that the gods have no need to defend themselves. Orual's protest is its own indictment. Orual then knows she has condemned herself. Her essential jealousy has been the jealousy of the godsa desire for their power, the beauty the posses, and the love they receive. Hence, Orual becomes the broken-hearted reader.However, there is redemption. Orual is allowed to see the journeys of Psyche through her exile. Orual is humbled to see that Psyche has been bearing her grief working to restore her broken sister. Orual's story ends with an encounter. Her heart has been finally prepared for the grace she is about to receive. In her last vision she is visited by the god who is \\"all that is dreadful and all that is beauty\\" and beholds herself reflected in a pool beside her sister, both of them made beautiful!The book ends abruptly, but that is only to show how inadequate words are to describe the feelings of reconciliation, peace, and forgiveness. Lewis writes about the book, \\"I ended my first book with the words no answer. I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice? Only words, words; to be led out to battle against other words\\""},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"CS Lewis, the master Christian apologist, was also a fabulous storyteller, as well as a sort of Classical scholar. This book is a synthesis of his theology, his love for the classics, and his storytelling ability. It is a reworking of the Psyche/Cupid myth, spun by Lewis in such a way as to teach important moral values--values which Lewis propagated in his Christian writings, but which he proves (in this book) to be important to all cultures. One of the most compelling things about this novel is that it is set in a \`barbarian' society, with many gods comparable to those of the Greeks. Even in the midst of this foreign religion, however, Lewis manages to teach his Christian moral values with surprising success.In a nutshell, this is a story about too much love. Orual, Psyche's sister, loves Psyche more than anything. Her love, however, is a selfish love, and Orual ends up destroying her sister because of that love. The central message of this book (to me, at least) is that people often treat their love protectively, and that jealousy often prompts people to hurt the one they love in an effort to keep the beloved all to themselves. The result, in this story and in others, is that someone (like Orual) who claims to love another person (like Psyche) ends up being the person in the world who hurts them the most. This culminates, in the novel, with Orual using Psyche's love for her as blackmail to get Psyche to destroy her life with the god Cupid.Readers familiar with Lewis's \`The Screwtape Letters' and \`The Great Divorce' will recognize this familiar theme of love gone too far. As always, Lewis provides insights in this book that are both profitable and that hit close to home for many of us. This is a great work of fiction by CS Lewis, both for its theological content and for the narrative itself. I couldn't put it down until I'd finished it, and both enjoyed and profited from the reading."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The main character, Queen Orual, in C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces has a bit of an image problem. She was very ugly as a youth and the ghastly response her face evokes from others causes her to wear a veil in front of them. Physical beauty is almost always an invaluable asset for a leader to possess. It helps enhance their image and how others perceive them. Lewis explores the effect of appearance as well as other different aspects of image in this remarkable book.On the surface, this is a sophisticated retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth (my favorite one, actually) from the point of view of one of the jealous sisters. We get to learn much, much more about Psyche, her family and the culture into which she was born. We are presented with an in-depth exploration of a pagan, pre-Christian, barbarian tribe on the fringe of Western Civilization and how they come to be influenced by the blossoming and dominant Greek culture and philosophy. Lewis uses iconic characters to display the great, cultural shift from a barbaric, pagan worldview into the civilized Greek philosophy. So sophisticated is Lewis' narrative that you can also anticipate how the worldview will shift from Greek philosophy into Christian philosophy, which is itself a further refinement of Aristotle and Plato.The way the story is constructed, told in first person by a Queen reflecting on formative moments in her life, likely had an influence on one of our favorite authors, Gene Wolfe. The character of Orual and the way she tells her story seem to be a precursor to Severian (c.f., The Book of the New Sun) and perhaps even Silk (c.f., The Book of the Long Sun). Near the end of the book, a pagan priest finishes up the tale for her, just like Horn chronicled the Patera Cald&eacute;. We also notice a broader picture of the events occurring around the characters, although they may not realize the importance of them at the time. Names also are translated into their literal Greek meanings such as the character Lysias who is always referred to as The Fox. We see this type of thing often in Wolfe.All comparative analysis aside, the book's greatest achievement is demonstrating how image helps a leader motivate people and maintain order. Perception, rather than reality, can make or break a leader. Controlling how others perceive you is one of the main jobs of someone in a leadership role. Like the works of Machiavelli or Robert Greene, this book highlights the reasons why it is important for a ruler to appear a certain way and to always maintain control over emotions while in front of others. For example, a leader must never appear weak or foolish. The rabble wants a strong leader, not a buddy. When times get tough, and they always do, the rabble will turn to the leader. If the leader is weak, they will turn ON him. If he is strong, they will trust him, even if he is brutal as long as the brutality is does not push them into rebellion.We get to know two main political leaders, each displaying a different level of \\"image\\" control. First, we meet a Warrior King, who--although valorous on the battlefield--is cowardly, blustering and tyrannical. He is politically backward and does not tend to his image at all. As a result, he spends a great deal of time and energy stamping out insurrections and fighting pointless, pyrrhic skirmishes with neighboring kingdoms. After his much celebrated death, his daughter, Orual takes over. She is very focused on image, even taking the drastic step of hiding her ugly appearance behind a veil. Not only does this mask her foul looks, it actually creates an aura of mystique around her, enhancing her image. Below the superficial, though, Orual is brave, diplomatic, wise and merciful. Before you get too worried, dear reader, take heart. This isn't feminist \\"women good, men bad\\" stuff. It is highly unlikely that an Inkling would espouse such beliefs.Underlying the image control of each leader is their unique leadership style. The King relies too heavily on his oppressive power and blustery personality to sustain his reign. He neglects nearly all other aspects of his kingdom and does not build a very good infrastructure to counter the bad times. The Queen, however, always tries to appear calm, majestic and wise. She never loses her composure in front of her subjects. She instinctively understands how this will undermine her credibility. As a result, her people trust her and she motivates them to new levels of achievement. She also has an eye on the future and invests time into her kingdom rewarding and recruiting talented artisans, craftsmen, builders and scholars. It is initially an expensive venture, but ultimately her investment pays off. Her backwater, barbaric kingdom flourishes and becomes a rich and mighty center of culture. Her \\"command and control\\" father ruled with an iron hand and would have never invested money on builders when he could conquer and enslave a smaller, neighboring kingdom.A very good example of the contrasts between these two managerial approaches is shown by the attitude each ruler takes towards their kingdom's only valuable commodity, silver. The kingdom has several mines in operation during the king's reign. The king does not see the potential in the mines and primarily uses them for capital punishment. He sends his prisoners, enslaved enemies and political adversaries there to work hard labor until they die. As one would expect, output, production and profits are not pouring out of these mines. Orual, however, clearly sees the potential in the rich, silver deposits and completely overhauls the mining operation. She frees the slaves and prisoners and replaces them with skilled laborers. These laborers are allowed to keep any silver they mine over a certain quota. Since skilled, motivated, profit-sharing laborers are always more productive than slaves, the mines are soon working to full capacity. The wealth pouring forth begets technological and cultural innovations which then lead to even higher levels of wealth and satisfaction. The kingdom is rich and the people are happy and fulfilled. Orual has done well. Her fair and democratic managerial style has reversed the nearly fatal autocratic style of her bumbling predecessor.Orual's focus on image and how she is perceived by her subjects plays a large role in the success of her administration. It allows her to inspire confidence in her people, challenge the status quo and turn around a failing enterprise. These lessons are as true today in our modern business world as there were in the pagan, uncivilized and barbaric world of Till We Have Faces."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Although they are, by now, superfluous, I add my five stars to the constellation that's already gathered around 'Till We Have Faces' in part to underline the comments already made by many reviewers and in part to hide from you what those comments betray. For 'Till We Have Faces' is a tale whose telling is as much a reason to read the book as the tale itself. It is a story whose characters, places, and very language will haunt you in the most wonderful ways--its sounds and smells will seep into your subconscious and change the way you see and feel. It is story-telling at its most vivid and lucid and profound.Above all, I wish to emphasize that this is a book about mysteries, religious, psychological and philosophical. Consequently, the very way in which the story unfolds leads the reader (and the main character!) into a darkness suddenly illuminated by a dazzling revelation. And so this is why I began my review by saying that one of my goals was to hide from you what other reviewers give away. If you want to experience the mysteries and revelations of 'Till We Have Faces' with all the intensity felt by Lewis' heroine Orual, please stop reading the reviews here. Read on, though, for marvelous plot summaries and reflections on the book. But no matter what you choose, please READ THIS BOOK for a story that is as achingly beautiful as it is richly insightful."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"If you're looking for a book to keep you company and entertain you on a stormy night, C.S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces will do quite nicely. If on the other you're looking for a book that will teach and inspire you, Till We Have Faces will do just that. If you're in search of a book that will do both, that's right, you need look no further, Till We have Faces will keep you turning the pages and open your eyes to greater things. C.S. Lewis is a master story teller. This book will send your mind on a journey, taking you to a unknown land, and there spin a story that will make your mouth water with anticipation. Though the story is an adaptation of a Greek myth, and maintains some fantasy, the characters are so real and emotionally intricate that it evokes perfect pathos. The lives of the characters that Lewis portrays causes the reader to evaluate their own life, their own loves, and helps them see a better, purer way to love. It has the power to reach most everyone. There really is nothing static about this book. It can suffice for pure entertainment purposes. The story is compelling, and demands the readers interest as to how the conflict will be resolved. The story telling is vivid and brings the tale to life. And throughout the story Lewis communicates issues of faith and love, that no one can escape, issues that effect everyone. It's practically perfect in every way. I have no qualms whatsoever about suggesting this book to my closest friends and family. To say that it is good reading and thought provoking only scratches the surface of what this book can do. I believe that everyone can enjoy and benefit from reading Lewis' Till We Have Faces, it will bring you into a new and brighter world."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is a book that makes you grow. It changes you in ways that last a lifetime. I first read this years ago, and I'm still growing from the memories of the story and from the parallels to daily life. It can help resolve lingering anger issues, just by reading a simple story that seemingly has nothing to do with you. It removes you from your own life for the moment and at the same time gives you clarity over it. I once read an excerpt to a friend who was, at the time, in the process of watching her health deteriorate and she said it gave her \\"chills\\" it was so good. It's a book that helps you grieve, also. It helps you sort through the pain of a loss (of any kind) very well and brings about priceless peace of mind when you need it most. I know that CS Lewis is seen as a Christian writer, but I don't see this book as a Christian book, personally. I see it as a story about what it is to be human. You will inevitably see yourself in at least one character in this story. I feel this book helped me mature as a young adult and I still gain something from it with every read. I have the audio cd of the book as well. It's nice in many ways, but I feel the reader (Nadia May) over-dramatizes the prose at times which I feel detracts from it. Still, in listening to it, I picked up on things about the story that I didn't pick up on when reading the book. No matter the method in which you experience the story, however, it is a story you should be told."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"In his masterpiece address, \\"The Weight of Glory,\\" Lewis says, \\"if our religion is something objective, then we must never avert our eyes from those elements in it which seem puzzling or repellent; for it will be precisely the puzzling or the repellent which conceals what we do not yet know and need to know.\\"Through the retelling of an ancient myth, Lewis deals with the uncomfortable issue of God's justice in light of what seems a very unjust world. Why have the gods always seemed indifferent to the afflictions of man? Why must holy places be dark places? Why can't the gods just answer us without all the guesswork and riddle?If these questions bother you, you will be able to relate to the book's protagonist, a woman named Orual. That is the great thing about this work, if we are honest, we shall see ourselves in Orual. And while admittedly not answering all the questions that arise along these lines, the book, I feel does succeed in giving us a glimpse of at least that part of the problem that we can control and at some level understand.The main issue that is dealt with in this book is perhaps the most puzzling aspect of faith. There are clearly those things that go far beyond our ability to control, and each of us shall leave this world in ignorance and most assuredly in wonder, why this, why that? But to his credit, Lewis does an amazing job of taking these tough questions and once again through myth, helping his readers to understand a bit more clearly perhaps, the most mysterious of all things, the human heart.Once we understand (in some measure) our own hearts, perhaps we too will agree with another of the book's characters, The Fox, when asked by Orual, \\"are the gods not just?\\" He answers, \\"Oh no, child. What would become of us if they were?\\"The Blackstone Audio of this book is excellent by the way. I read the book once and found (as I do with most of Lewis's works) that I enjoyed it even more upon the second reading. I hope you will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis was of course the author of the \\"Narnia\\" children's stories, the moral comedy \\"The Screwtape letters\\" and a number of other novels and books about religion, most of them told from a more or less openly Christian perspective.This brilliant retelling of the legend of Psyche and Cupid is unusual for C.S. Lewis in that it considers the relationship between human and divine while stepping outside his Christian perspective. It is also possibly his best novel.The story reads as a memoir written in her old age by Queen Orual of Glome, who had been eldest of the three daughters of the previous King. Orual herself is wise but ugly, and loves her beautiful younger sister Psyche in a way which is genuine but fierce and also jealous.During a famine, The priests advise the King that there is a curse on the land and to lift it he must leave his daughter Psyche chained in the wilderness as a sacrifice to the gods. Orual is frantic and offers herself as the sacrifice instead but neither the King nor the priests will hear of it. Psyche is left chained in the wilderness, and when she is not there the following morning everyone assumes she has been killed. Instead, however, Cupid the God of Love takes her as his wife, refusing to let her see his face.In the original legend, Psyche is allowed to receive a visit from her two sisters, who are consumed with envy at the sight of the luxurious home which the God has given Psyche, and trick her into shining a light on her husband while he sleeps. Furious at this disobedience, the god condemns her to wander the earth in great misery.This version is similar, but with two key differences: the first is that Orual cannot see the beautiful house which Psyche believes she is living in. To Orual's senses Psyche is living in the open air and dressed in rags. Orual's motives in persuading Psyche to shine the lamp on her sleeping husband are far more complex and less unequivocally evil.The second difference is that, where in the original legend the Gods cause the malicious sisters of Psyche to die soon after their betrayal of their sister, in Lewis's version Orual survives her father and becomes Queen. Indeed, Orual's struggle to rescue her country from the mess in which her father left it provides some of the most powerful scenes in the book. (I'm not giving away anything here: the narrator introduces herself in the first pages of the book as Queen of Glome and makes quite clear that she is describing the events of her youth from the perspective of old age.)When she starts the narrative, Queen Orual is writing it as a complaint against the Gods who have mistreated her and slandered her. By the end of the book Orual's perspective has changed.This is a magnificent and deeply moving story. If you like the Narnia books, think of it as Narnia for grown-ups."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis' \\"Till We Have Faces\\" gives a contemporary twist to the original myth of Cupid and Psyche while remaining true to the original. Lewis takes the story to another level with marvelous depth and revelation. Although the setting and society are very different from that of our present day, Lewis uses his knowledge of symbolism and tone to adapt the story into any culture. The theme of conditional love and knowing oneself are consistent throughout the piece.Set in Glome, a \\"barbaric pre-Christian\\" society, Lewis tells the story of Orual, Psyche's ugly older sister. Orual first struggles with secrecy not only in her family but in the world around her. Orual's father was the king of Glome and Orual was to stay inside the castle at all times. Psyche, who was the most beautiful girl in the land, was thought of as something different, something dangerous. Orual looked after Psyche during her whole childhood and felt a deep and eventually harmful love for Psyche. After a horrible crop season and famine spreading it was decided that Psyche would be offered to the God of the mountain. After the sacrifice Orual goes to give Psyche a proper burial. Orual eventually finds Psyche alive but thinks that she has gone crazy. Psyche tells her of a palace in which she eats, sleeps, bathes, and is visited by a God during the darkness of the night. Orual leaves mad at Psyche for having believed such things were true and ends up going back for Psyche. Orual tells Psyche to turn on a lantern one night while the God is there to see him for the first time. Psyche knows that she will break the God's trust, but Orual threatens to commit suicide if Psyche does not comply. Psyche does what Orual tells her and is sentenced to a life of wandering and exile. The God tells Orual that she will have to live with the guilt of having led Psyche to such a fate. This is the point in which Orual's love for Psyche becomes less love and more of a demon inside Orual. When Orual returns from the mountain she is a changed woman and eventually becomes the Queen of Glome. Once she is older, Orual begins to understand that there is no such thing as unconditional love and that beauty is as important to the God's as it is to humans. She constantly wears a veil over her face and loses herself in the role of Queen. Once a person has created an image for themselves they begin to create a soul and the sense of self. This is what becomes important and until one can realize this they cannot be acknowledged and understand the truths of life. Orual loses herself in the constant demands asked of her and she eventually realizes that there is more she has to do in order to truly survive.C.S. Lewis' style is that of tone, dimension, and underlying meanings. He doesn't give anything away, but presents the situations to the reader in a way that gives support. His style supports his scholarly reputation and the targeted audience. This piece just adds to Lewis' long list of scholarly significant works. Other works by Lewis include \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", \\"The Screw tape Letters\\", and \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". Lewis wrote this contemporary fiction after the death of his wife almost as a testimonial of Christianity and the human struggle between love and hate. The society that Lewis portrayed in this piece was reminiscent of Greek society in which the belief in Gods and oral myth was the absolute religion. Fox, Orual's mentor and teacher, taught her to think beyond what she was taught. In the end all of Fox's teachings and wisdom turned out to be wrong and he admitted his misconception.This piece of literature provides a fascinating modern look at the struggle between humans vs. Gods, good vs. evil, and ugly vs. beautiful. C. S. Lewis was able to take the Greek myth to another level of meaning and also provide a brilliant story of love."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"i have never read a book that so drew me into the so called &quot;bad character&quot; i knew the original myth of pysche and cupid but this truly does not focus on pyshce but instead on her &quot;ugly&quot; sister. the trials she goes through as she changes from a scared child to a queen is fascinating. the beautiful phrases lewis uses are aw inspiring as his eloquence is put forth for all to view. i would recommend this book for anyone who needs something other than mindless mush. it's beautiful and heartbreaking all in the same stroke and you sob with and for each character, definetly a great book and a complete classic. ( one finally not exclusively for english teachers, instead it's for their tortured students looking for something past the scarlet letter) :)"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis used fiction to lay bare the soul in ways his more apologetic work could not. The cast of characters in The Great Divorce, for example, or in the &quot;Space Trilogy&quot; invariably remind us of people we know - and give us insights into what makes them tick. Nowhere in Lewis' works is the soul explored better than in Till We Have Faces, Lewis' masterwork of fiction and a stunning psychological and spiritual odyssey.TWHF retells and enriches the myth of Cupid and Psyche, although a lack of familiarity with the myth in no way diminishes from the enjoyment of the book. In Lewis' hands, the story sorts through issues of family, jealousy, gender, faith, and ultimate meaning, culminating with a frightening and yet wonderful 'face to face' scene that gives rise to, and explains, the book's title.Readers who are looking for the kind of in-your-face Christian symbolism that characterized the Chronicles of Narnia will be disappointed with TWHF. Although I appreciate and am nourished by Lewis' Christian parables and apologetics, the theology in TWHF is pagan, at least on its surface. Underneath the surface, however, Lewis does a masterful job of intertwining the traditional beliefs of the main characters - including a stand-in for Greek rationalism - with rumors of a much more intimate and beautiful way of knowing the gods. The climactic scene itself plays off the biblical phrase, &quot;Now we see in a glass dimly, but then face to face&quot; - a phrase that comes, in fact, from I Corinthians 13, the famous chapter on Love in the New Testament. So Lewis does indeed lead the reader toward the One who is love, but he uses the carrot of intrigue and spiritual longing rather than the steamroller (if you will pardon the mixed metaphor) of too-obvious symbolism.This is my favorite of Lewis' works of fiction and was, reportedly, Lewis' favorite as well. Few books can nourish the soul the way Till We Have Faces can. Just one caveat: you really will need to read it twice ... and you will understand why once you have read it through the first time."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Besides containing one of the greatest lines about being an author ever written: \\"I was with book, as a woman is with child\\", C.S. Lewis's \\"Till We Have Faces\\" also did me the service of giving me a good slap across my metaphorical face. How wrapped up we all become in our own little lives. How one-sided and self-favoring is our vision.Though a book about many things--holiness, love, and philosophy to name a few--\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is mainly about how our perceptions can fail us. How in the name of doing what we think is right, we can do horrible things.Orual, the protagonist of the story, spends an entire life learning what the apostle Paul meant when he said \\"Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.\\" The real twist in \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is that the reader, more likely than not, learns the same lesson (I know I did).C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors for many reasons. This book is definitely one of them. Lewis considered \\"Till We Have Faces\\" to be his best book. I do not know if I agree, but it is certainly a great story.I give \\"Till We Have Faces\\" a very high recommendation."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis's novel Till We Have Faces is based on the classical myth of Cupid and Psyche, however Lewis chooses to tel the story through Orual, Psyche's older sister. While Lewis does retell the well-known story of Psyche and Cupid, that is only a tiny piece of the story he creates. Till We Have Faces is actually the story of Orual's struggle to find love, and to discover her own identity. The actual setting of the story is unclear-it takes place in a country north of Greece, in a time long past, but Lewis does not choose to elaborate on that. In fact throughout the entire book, he focuses very little on sensory details; it is a story of emotion and psychology rather than action and physical description. Orual writes her own story, beginning at her childhood in her father's castle. There she leads an isolated life, surrounded only by her fathers servants, advisors, and her sisters, Redival and Psyche. Redival, with her golden curls and curvy figure, is superficially pretty, but Psyche is the embodiment of perfect and natural beauty. She is not only outwardly beautiful, she is also pure, unselfish, and loving. Orual, though, is neither pretty nor beautiful. She is, as she is constantly reminded by her father (the king), indescribably ugly. Orual never feels that she is loved by anyone, that is, until Psyche enters her life. Psyche's mother dies giving birth to her, and Orual takes it upon herself to become Psyche's guardian and to raise her. Orual loves Psyche more than anything else, but her love is selfishly and fiercely possessive. Orual is tormented by the thought of having to release Psyche from her suffocating grasp, and she does everything in her power to prevent it. After being separated from Psyche, Orual gradually comes to the realization that she (Psyche) is like the goddess Ungit-greedy, jealous, blood-gorged, and ugly of soul as well as body. She also compares herself to her father, the violent, selfish, cowardly, and dishonest king. Orual recoils from this realization, and as queen, she tries to be everything that her father, and Ungit, are not. While she is described by her subjects as \\"the most wise, just, valiant, fortunate and merciful\\" of all rulers, Orual feels that her actions are only a mask of her inner ugliness. She despairs of ever overcoming her hideousness inside. She says, \\"I would set out boldly each morning to be just and calm and wise in all my thoughts and acts, but before they had finished dressing me I would find that I was back in some old rage, resentment, gnawing fantasy, or sullen bitterness. I could not hold out half an hour . . . I could mend my soul no more than my face.\\" Like the veil she wears to hide her ugly face, she feels that her good actions only conceal the hideousness of her true self. C.S. Lewis felt that we, as humans, are like rough blocks of marble. He said that suffering is the tool God uses to carve away our rough edges and to refine our souls. As Orual experiences suffering, she doesn't realize it, but she is actually coming closer and closer to becoming the perfected statue. Each trial chips away another piece of the marble that conceals the perfect form within. The title, Till We Have Faces, may refer to the process of refinement and self-realization. Till We Have Faces is a captivating book from beginning to end. As the reader, I could not only identify with Orual's struggles, I felt as though I was Orual, going through the same turmoil and inner-conflict. It is a book that I can read over and over again, each time experiencing new epiphanies and gaining deeper insight. It is impossible to adequately describe, even to a small degree, this fascinating and complex novel; it must be read and read again."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Many authors have taken old stories and retold them from another character's point-of-view in order to change the theme and lesson portrayed in it. C.S. Lewis did just that in his Till We Have Faces, a retelling of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche from the perspective of one of Psyche's treacherous sisters. In doing so, Lewis adds depth to a superficial story and makes his readers question the motive of their love.Orual, the eldest sister of Psyche, doesn't love anyone more than she loves her youngest sister. In turning the story in this direction, Lewis shifts the conflict from one between the sisters to one at first between Orual and the supposed gods who were the cause of Psyche's sacrifice and then, after Orual realizes her fault in her loss of Psyche, a conflict between Orual and herself. Orual's haunting self-examination and the revelation that she has loved Psyche so much that she pulled her away from happiness, and that she also has done so with everyone she has ever loved is a stirring wake-up call to all of us. The lesson that love is not a selfish action, but one in which, if you act with pure intent, your most important wish is for the one you love to be happy, is one which we all need to learn, as it will bring about greater happiness both in our lives and the lives of those we love.The title of the novel is the source of another important lesson. Throughout her life, Orual lives with the fact that her looks are anything but attractive. To make things worse, her sister Redival, whom she absolutely detests, is considered somewhat of a beauty. Her father tells her she looks like a man, and that her looks could knock down a horse, and the like, and she becomes embarrassed to show her face to anyone. She puts on a veil, and decides never to take it off. When she does so, people stop noticing her ugly looks and begin to focus on who she is. As queen she becomes famous for her generosity, courage, and wisdom. She is remembered as the bravest, most valiant queen who ever lived. Her fame spreads, and so do tales that she wears the veil to cover a beautiful face, because certainly no one whose acts are so lovely can be ugly. Thus, through her actions, Orual receives a new face, a beautiful one, one which fits her personality and love for others. In doing so she conquers the goddess, who has no face, and achieves her victory over the gods.Lewis' portrayal of love as the only thing to brighten an otherwise bleak and desolate world is fitting in this day. At a time when selfishness and greed are prevalent, the world needs a lesson in the value of devotion to others. Till We Have Faces is just that lesson. It provides a great example of love to all who are willing to learn from it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"'Til We Have Faces' is the sleeper novel of the century. Better than any self-help book for those who are more sinned against than sinful, better than any pop-psychology text, Til We Have Faces addresses the difficult questions of God, justice and life's meaning with underlying compassion and incisive perception. C. S. Lewis re-works the ancient Cupid and Psyche myth. He retains the mythological setting, but this time tells the tale from the point of view of a sister of Psyche; Orual. This 'ugly' sister resents the gods for the injustices of her physical unattractiveness and her consequentially loveless life... and after a lifetime of angst and loss, finally learns a liberating and joyous truth. Lewis' deft handling of the story allows him to grapple with the anguish of lovelessness and the value of the soul; timely themes for our era, obsessed as it is with physical beauty and superficial materialism. The novel satisfies at many levels: a good story; an anticipation of 'the beauty myth'; a Jungian treatise; a neo-Platonic manifesto... an articulation of the very human yearning for love, justice and meaning. An important book, a beautiful book; something for those who are between their first and second enjoyments of fairytale and fantasy."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. The two bracketed opening paragraphs were written in Sept 2001 but never published. Mike London 10-3-2012][\\"Till We Have Faces\\" is essentially Lewis's view of the four loves put into action, and how destructive they can be if you abuse them. The central character, Orual, is a very selfish sister who wants her sister totally for herself. Easily the most complex all Lewis's fiction, there are so many examples of evil love throughout that the entire book can be hard to figure out as many of these are obscure. While the third book in the Space Trilogy certainly has its complexities, only this comes anywhere close to topping it for thematic complicitions, and topping it this novel does. We get a very accurate picture of why the main character has been a consumer all her life, and why she eats people up to be her own. Individuality is a thing very hateful to her. This also shows up in Screwtape's multiple letters to Wormwood.If published anonymously, it would be one of the few works that would be very difficult to tell it was by C. S. Lewis, as the style is so much different from his usual one. He very clearly enters into this mind of Orual and it becomes very much her own story. This is a retelling of the Cupid-Psyche myth; hence the subtitle A Myth Retold. For those readers who are most interested in reading the sheer depth of Lewis's skill as a writer, this is the best place to come.]TILL WE HAVE FACES, is, simply put, one of the most beautiful books I have read. Its depths are enormous, its truth fantastically illustrated, and the author is completely given over to the character. If you are reading this for Lewis's style, don't. In an amazing feat of creation, Lewis used his God-given gift, and has completely come into Orual's mind. This is some of the best characterization I have ever read, with Lewis completely laying down his own style, and yielded to that or Orual. Although that may be disquieting to some, it reveals the true creative power God gave that fine Christian brother. He immerses us into her world, told from her eyes. The book is very, very deep, demanding several rereadings.The plot of the book is a daughter is born to a king, named Psyche. He already has two other daughters, Orual and Redival. Her older sister, Orual, becomes very loving of her. Yet this love is exactly what it ought not to be: a selfish love. Psyche, seemingly a goddess in the eyes of the people, must be taken to sacrifice to the god of the grey mountains. Orual is very distraught. They take and leave her. Then Orual, along with another character named Bardia, go up to the mountain, and Orual finds Psyche, in love with the god of the mountain. Orual, being blind (although not physically), cannot see the palace. In the end, she has Psyche, who loves with selfless love, the truest and deepest and most real of all loves, look upon Eros, the god of the mountain, and Psyche is exiled because of her sin against the god. She was not to look or cast light upon him, but she did for Orual's sake.The king is an impotent ruler, and only after Orual takes over the kingdom does Glome become something of a powerful place. All things considered, Orual really does help Glome politically and financially, and is a much better ruler than her father was. He is an abusive man, and is an evil father. He cares nothing of his daughters, and wishes for a son. He especially resents Orual for her ugliness.The Fox is a Greek philosopher brought into educate the girls as well as help the King. Redival is least interested. He examines through the Fox the rational point of view. The Fox can never live up to his beliefs, and is constantly violating them. He is out of balance, placing to much on reason and logic and not enough on faith. He greatly influences Orual.Redival is a selfish one, and wants what is best for her. This is exactly what not to be.Orual: A much more complex character, and the narrator of the book. She loves with a jealous love, a love tainted by sin and ungodliness. She wishes Psyche for herself, and she cannot understand why she must go away. The book is about how she moves away from that selfish love and into the love of Jesus Christ. She is also marked by ugliness, and later starts wearing a veil to hide herself. After many years, people begin to think her wearing the veil for, ironically, great beauty, or something more mysterious, no face at all. This is representative of her spiritual life. She is ugly because of the taint of sin. Yet, because she is made in the likeness of God, the beauty that God gave her can be placed through. But as long as she remained uncured, as long as she remained [unstilled] hidden away, she could not come face to face with God. How could she when had no face. She refused to acknowledge her selfish love. For much of her life she worth both a physical and a spiritual veil. Only when old age approached, did she set down an account of the \\"evils\\" done to her by the gods in Part I. Then, in Part II, she lays down her veil, and begins to examine her life, and in the end comes to peace with God.Psyche is the mostly Godly character, full of selfless love for others. It is she that is Orual's love. There is much to learn from Psyche.In this book, we have what Lewis wrote in his nonfiction The Four Loves. These were written and published about the same time, and he had met Joy Davidman, who was to be his wife. Erotic love, that had so long passed him by, had suddenly and out of nowhere appeared on his doorstep. So love weight heavily on his mind during this period of his life. To have a deeper appreciation of this book, read both this and his The Four Loves, because basically he tackled the same subject in two separate genres: fiction and nonfiction. In that book, he says friends and lovers are essentially different, although bound by the same reality. Friends are friends because they have a bond, yet they are not whole concerned with the other. They are comrades, and do things side by side. Lovers are intensely interested in the others, looking at each other, not working side by side. This is illustrated in Orual's relationship with Bardia. Bardia, a prime solider, is a close friend of her, and the closest to a sexual relationship she ever obtained. Yet he is married, and so Orual cannot know erotic love as did Redival and Psyche. She is friends with him, and will not destroy his family. In this way, God is helping her to the point where she will drop the veil and let him put a face on her. Through the course of the years, she is showing more character in her relationship with Bardia than in her relationship with Psyche. She will not destroy the man she loves although she did destroy her sister's happiness. Already God was gently prodding her to a more real and honest place with him...-----[The above text is a revised version of a review written in 2000. The original review ran over 1000 words.

Lewis has woven another wonderful tale in the tradition of the Chronicles of Narnia, but for a much more sophisticated audience. This was a book I could not put down until I had finished so that my essays went unfinished, and I hardly slept while I was reading it. 313 pages after I began, I realized that my time had flown by and I was finished. This is truly delightful to read, and it also raises many literary and philosophical questions. Lewis retells the myth of Psyche and Cupid, but changes the perspective to that of Cupid, whom he names Oural, and so changes the story. Told constantly of her ugliness, Oural lives a life of loneliness. Without comfort from her golden-haired sister, she turns to her Greek tutor for intellectual discussion and fatherly love that she does not receive from her true father the King. Later in life, Psyche is born to the step-mother. An almost overly-perfect child, Psyche is raised mostly by Oural. During this raising, Oural comes to have a deep love for Psyche. Changing her very core of being to a love for her sister, she then faces only bitter pain when Psyche is torn from her grasp forever. Her bereavement sets up a questioning of the implications of true love. Oural's motive's seem almost selfish at times as she tries to do what is best for the Psyche that she becomes fated never to see again. The direct empathy for Oural's vicarious suffering is masterfully portrayed so that I could not help but feel pangs of sympathy for Oural's plight. Her love raised Psyche, and then that love led to her losing the near goddess and destroying both of their happiness. Besides questioning the interplay between love, happiness, and the trials of life, there are more issues brought up. For one, Lewis tells the story from a woman's perspective. Oural is a very real, complex character, and it is interesting that Lewis could have done such a good job imitating a woman's voice. One of the ways he does this is to make Oural fairly masculine. Ugly as a brick, she eventually learns to fence, and subsequently becomes queen. However, as a queen, she remains man-like, leading her armies to war and through various journeys. Gender and love were intriguing facets of the book, but perhaps the main focus is on Oural's relationship with the Gods. She finds a basic conflict that enumerates the problems that religious men and philosophers have debated throughout the millennia. Her native traditions and upbringing teach her that there are many gods, animistic in nature. Unhappy gods, they demand appeasement through sacrifices and daily rituals. However, these views conflict with the teachings of her much-trusted tutor and friend. He refutes the myths and legends about the gods as uncultured fancies, and turns her thoughts to the logic of Greek learning. Layered upon this dual mesh of beliefs are the approaches that are taken to religion by the characters around her. Some choose to ignore the gods, others are dedicated to serving them, while still others believe strongly in them, but choose to seek as little interference as possible. Another conflict comes with the god who interferes with Psyche, who seems to be viewed as the all-high god, someone above even the many gods who reside in the land and provide fertility or omens. Thus, a sort of monotheism is acknowledged that continues to clash with the other ideas, providing much material for debate. Unable to reach any definitive conclusion about the nature of the gods, but providing good insights, Oural begins a letter of complaint to the Gods. Unsure of why she has not been told exactly how she should have acted to prevent the constant pain that she eventually comes to live with, Oural bitterly recounts her tale and her suffering woe. Despising the gods for their distance, and for having taken Psyche from her, she writes until the end of her life. However, before she dies, she sees a vision, wherein she presents her arguments to the gods, and receives her answer. She becomes another beautiful Psyche in the process, after finally having found the face that she has sought for so long. The ending must be read, so I will not even attempt to explain the rich complexities that Lewis has woven into the triumphant and mesmerizing conclusion. Although I am in the habit of finding new books to read, this is one of the few books that I will read again, and I am sure to find even more subtle insights into the human condition and the manner of our lives."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"There's no doubt that &quot;Till We Have Faces&quot; is Lewis' most profound book. Its prose is masterful: spare, stark, the best writing Lewis ever did. He creates memorable, fully human characters, especially in Orual, daughter of Trom King of Glome. She is ugly, brutalized by her father, friendless until love enters her life through two characters: her Greek slave tutor and her youngest sister, Psyche. The novel becomes an examination of loves true and false, of manipulation of love, and of the power of grace to redeem and love the unloved and unlovely. I've read this novel at least a dozen times; it never grows stale. You needn't know the original myth to enjoy the book. I only wish more readers knew about this book--even many Lewis fans are unaware of this one. It will move your heart and make you think."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I struggled with this book from the very beginning. I look at all the 5 star reviews and wonder what is wrong with me but the book was boring and never went anywhere. I found myself wading through a lot of unnecessary verbiage that only made it all go that much slower. And the story itself didn't grab me as being worth the read. Maybe I'm too impatient and want the writer to get to the point and have a little excitement, but I didn't find it as one of Lewis' better books even though it is touted as that. I'm not a great fan of Greek mythology and often struggle with Lewis' writing so the combination of these two did me in from the beginning. His writing didn't help me \\"see\\" what was happening, nor why. I guess I don't appreciate what the world calls \\"great\\" writing."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Probably one of the best books that I've ever read. I'm really looking forward to reading it again and seeing how my perceptions change, because the story and message are timeless."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"As a teacher of college-prep high school English, I include Lewis' Till We Have Faces on the list of 20th century classics. Since first reading it some twenty years ago, I have reread this incredible story numerous times. Lewis' rich treatment of the themes of love and justice (among others) is outstanding. I'd love to have it in hardcover; my paperbacks keep wearing out from reading and loaning and reading and loaning..."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"As a passionate student of Grecian Mythology, I have read many interpretations on the classic tale of Cupid and Psyche, but never with such depth. C.S. Lewis cast upon this book a brilliancy that is reflected in each theme he uses in this book. It is in the view of Psyche's older sister, and a bit like the story of Ever After(the movie), if the movie were in the view of the chubby sister. I am not as gifted as Mr. Lewis to put into words the magic of this book, but, when one has familiarized oneself with the classic tale of Cupid and Psyche, one shall feel, after reading this book, as though they knew nothing at all of the story, before reading the book!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"&quot;Are the gods not just, then?&quot; &quot;Oh, no. What would become of us if they were?&quot;Orual lashes out at the gods for the things that have come to pass in her life. She demands proof of their existence, and then later, a meeting; a hearing of sorts, face to face, where she can present her case and accuse them. Why did they take all she cherished away from her? Are they really there, or is it all just a cruel trick? Why are they silent? In this story that so deftly reveals our prides and passions, Lewis shows that when we encounter Diety, we've come across something so far beyond us that our thoughts and imaginings are undone. Some of us will surrender into Diety's keeping with joy, others reel back in hatred. It's not allegorical. It's sweeter, more subtle, and more powerful than that. The telling of the tale through the lens of Greek myth shows the stoke of the master artist at work. Holding on; letting go; pride; surrender. I've seen no other work that so aptly plays out the fabric of our lives torn between Heaven and earth, between love and pride, between the sacred and the profane."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Upon my first reading of this book as a rather fundamentalist Christian teenager, I was disappointed with its seeming lack of an &quot;overt&quot; Christian message. During my second reading (and following a conversion to Roman Catholicism) approximately 15 years later, I was moved tremendously by protagonist Orual's tendency to clothe herself in defensive strength rather than yielding to faith. The book suddenly seemed very &quot;modern&quot; to me. I smiled as I wondered what Lewis would think if he were able to see (and indeed, hopefully he is) how accurately the book he wrote some 30 years ago reflects the struggle of women in the '90s. There is something deep lurking in this spare and somber prose for female AND male readers. If you have ever longed to plunge into mystery, to learn to balance your ultra-rational side with the faith-filled portion of your soul, then I strongly recommend this book to you. (By Lori Pike, on a friend's E-Mail)"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"For anyone who enjoys reading tales of the classic greek gods, goddeses and heroes of ancient Greece and Rome then this book is a must. An excellent adaptation of the classic story of Cupid and Psyche, C.S. Lewis retells the story beautifully. His rendition of the story is extraordinary and the book tells the story in such a vivid and fascinating way. For anyone at all who enjoys Greek Mythology this book is a must. Not only is it a great read but it is a book worthy of being called a classic. :)"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is an amazing, wonderful book. I love Lewis's style; at once thought-provoking, half-humourous, and deep. The characters are so clear and precise, there is no mistaking who they are. In fact, I have ceased to view them as 'characters', but now I think of them as people.The story itself is so intricate and deep that you feel as though you can never quite comprehend it entirely. I have read the book three times, and I still stumble across new things that I have never seen before. Just like the Chronicles of Narnia, this book bears the marks of a true classic.I highly recommend this book. However, don't read it if you don't want to have to think too hard. At times, the reality of the story can be disturbing."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"To be sure Till We Have Faces is written poignantly, eloquently and descriptively in the style our parent's and grandparent's generation came to expect from C.S. Lewis. Lewis is at his core a master story teller. Like his popular work (Chronicles of Narnia) this one flows along, captivating the reader and often delivering the unexpected. However, a good exists reason why Till We Have Faces never reached the popularity and acclaim of C.S. Lewis' other works.In his retelling of the Latin novel Metamorphoses (the story of Cupid and Psyche) Lewis rewrites the story with a more ambivalent motive and a different character for the heroine. The story remains mostly faithful to the original but many odd and unbelievable passages exist in the book; contradictions that cannot be overlooked. First, we are led to believe that young Orual (central character) is magnificently endowed with the powers of persuasion, natural authority, god-like bravery and ruthless discipline when she is suddenly made Queen. For the first portion of the novel Lewis paints Orual as a kind if homely, playful if brave, emotional and sentimental character. We are given no indication that such a fantastic transformation of her character would seem possible so quickly (even after her grueling pilgrimage up a mountain). Furthermore Lewis would have us believe that the King, who had a palace soldier castrated for secretly courting his other daughter, would run a household whereby Orual could merely slip away for two days without being noticed by the King's servants and confidants. The Queenly, warrior-like personality shift that Orual undergoes as her father dies is sudden, awkward and the reader is unlikely to believe the transformation. Once Lewis commits this transgression the rest of the novel takes on an unbelievable tone. Meek Orual, now Queen, slaughters men in battle, wages war and rules with an iron fist.Many other passages exist in the novel that are puzzling. For example, the King is consistently portrayed as a brute that beats and insults his daughter, and executes, punishes and humiliates men arbitrarily. And yet one of the novel's most noble and trusted characters, Bardia, states \\"....he's no bad master to soldiers, shepherds, huntsmen and the like.\\" Likewise, the castrated soldier reappears towards the end of the novel. The eunuch has somehow survived his disgrace and sentence of hard labor, miraculously reintroducing himself as an ambassador to a powerful King from a far away land. Unbelievable? Till We Have faces is peppered and ultimately drained by these sorts of small but ultimately damaging contradictions and flaws.For all of his beautiful writing and occasionally triumphant literary sequences, C.S. Lewis delivered an inconsistent, disjointed work with Till We Have Faces. His more notable works show a thoughtfulness and a maturity that Till We Have Faces simply never achieved."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"My book came quickly with no problems. I was very moved by this book. If you have not read it, you should!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Why anyone in the world would not like this book is beyond me. It is one of Lewis' best! I can't say much about it because everyone who has reviewed this has already said all that is to be said."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The book &quot;Till we have faces&quot; is a retold myth by C. S. Lewis. The original myth was found in one of the few still known Latin novels, the Metamorphoses of Lucius Apuleius Platonicus, who lived around 125 A.D. The story talks about two princesses, one unattractive and the other one beautiful. The older one, who is also the unattractive one, was named Orual. She wrote the story in her older age, because then she did not have any fear anymore. It is written from her point of view. In the beginning of her story she explains, in her own words, the reason of writing the story down: &quot;I will accuse the gods, especially the god who lives on the Grey Mountain. I will tell all he has done to me from the very beginning, as if I were making my complaint of him before a judge.&quot; (page 3; Chapter 1) The story begins with Orual getting a new sister named Istra or Psyche who was the beautiful princess. Her mom, Orual's stepmother, died while giving birth. The king, and father of the sisters, was very angry of having another girl instead of finally having a son. Because of that Orual raised and loved Psyche like her own child. They both had a wonderful and loving relationship. One day a fever came to their city. It was Psyche who nursed the Fox, their teacher. After his recovery, Batta -- their nanny-- spread the story of &quot;how the beautiful princess could cure the fever by her touch; soon, that her touch was the only thing that could cure it.&quot; (page 30; Chapter 3) Psyche went out and tried to touch sick people to make them believe she could save them. Unfortunately, many people were not healed and suddenly a brute was also seen coming down from the Mountain. Because of these events the people said that Psyche was the source, &quot;the accursed one&quot;. The belief was that things like that could only be cured with a human sacrifice. That sacrifice had to be special. Ungit, the God, did not only want just any human, but rather the most perfect human. The people's choice fell on Psyche. She was sacrificed and so Orual lost her beloved sister. When Orual went to the place of the sacrifice, thinking that she would find at least a few body parts of Psyche she found her near alive and well. She could not see what Psyche saw. She was shocked about the rule Psyche had to live by; every night after dark her husband came and spend the night with her, but she was not allowed to see him. Orual, who thought that was strange, convinced her sister to light the oil lamp and to look at him while he was sleeping. As she did what she was told a drop of hot oil woke him up. He got very angry with her and punished her and made her suffer. Since then Orual had to live with her knowledge of being guilty for her sister's sufferings. She would always hear Psyche's wining voice wherever she went. Whatever she tried her life changed dramatically. For me from this point of the book on it got more interesting. The rest of the book helps us to understand why the book is called &quot;Till we have faces&quot; . . . even the most unattractive person could look really beautiful. Reading the book one has many opportunities to think about certain points and views in one's life."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This exploration of a Greek myth in ancient Near East setting has nice parts but ultimately the tempo sags. It is not as insightful as Ransom trilogy."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces may have had a message to share but I am afraid I never gave the deeper points of the novel enough time to penetrated my young, ADD mind. I'll admit honestly that I enjoyed this book mostly for it's sparce, but well written, action scenes. I loved the swordfighting. I think C.S. Lewis paints a convincing picture of a dark and dramatic fuedal kingdom, complete with heavy-handed tyrants, oportunist nobles, superstitious peasants, eerie priests, and discontented princesses both beatiful and loathsome. From the very beginning, the book seems to be preparing for a really big adventure, but I spent the whole novel waiting without ever having my thirst for action completely satisfied. Obviously the author had something else in mind. The truly dramatic moments were few and far between, but when they did come they were vivid and believable. Though the philisophical and historical efforts of the author were, for the most part, wasted on me, though I did like the way he portrayed the helenistic lifestyle. When we studied greek mythology in high school english, I thought it was ridiculous that any group of people would have actually believed in the moody and promiscuous Greek gods or their Roman counterparts. I imagined the people back then probably chuckled through their togas as they wrote about Zues, Aphrodite or Apollo. However, C.S. Lewis effectively presents people that do believe in their gods, at least enough to kill for them. Till We Have Faces, a tale told through the eyes of a no-nonsense girl, makes a good case for believing in the unseen. Near the end of the book there is a switch from reality into a vision, or metaphorical dreamland I am not sure what. I feel embarrassed that I got lost near the end. I think a more careful reader might gain some important insights from the abstract portions at the end of the book. As for me, I just had to think too hard. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is not anything against C.S. Lewis as a writer because I am a huge fan of his Narnia series. This is just a note of caution to the reader, I am an avid reader of mythology and the story of Cupid and Psyche is one of my absolute favorites. It has to be said that anyone who truly loves that myth should be forwarned before reading that it practically has no resemblance to the myth and is told from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's older sisters. I came to the book with preconceptions and was severely disappointed when I read it. I could not even completely finish the book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I'm really very sorry that I cannot agree with most of the reviewers.I've tried very hard to enjoy this book, but unfortunately it didn't appeal me so much as I hoped.I was sadly disappointed.Sometimes during the reading I was tempted to put it off, because I found it slightly *boring*, but I kept on hoping to find something *more*, I had faith in Lewis and hoped I could at last discover and feel the same emotions the other readers were inspired (and I am in such a need for them!).The book isn't bad at all, it's maybe my fault that it was too much different and diverging from my expectations.I expected something wonderful, explosive and utterly original, something that could &quot;change my life&quot; with a sort of &quot;epiphany&quot;: I wanted to be given strong emotions and shocking existential revelations. I had instead soft hintings and delicate characterization.It was not what I was looking for.At least, thanks to C. S. Lewis, I will never forget the myth about Eros and Psyche, and my culture has a bit increased."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Maybe it was because I didn't know the story of Cupid and Psyche before I read the book- but I was not overly moved by this book. I especially did not enjoy Part II, when I just kept wondering, what the heck is going on??? Thank goodness that Lewis included the summary of the traditional myth at the end- it might be helpful to read this part first."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"It does give an explanation of why Psyche was prompted to see who her mysterious husband was. The book just needs to be taken in the context it was written. A good read but I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Typical strangeness of C.S. Lewis but too cryptic and drawn out for me."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The book is brilliantly written as long as it concerns itself with Orual's passionate indictment of the gods. It loses its power, however, when Lewis falls prey to his tendency to preach. Part 2 undermines the rest of the book first by telling the reader what to think and then by couching the lessons in an implicitly Christian moral context. In this way, it is reminiscent of &quot;The Last Battle,&quot; a coda which mars the otherwise enjoyable &quot;Chronicles of Narnia.&quot;"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a pretty story told in fairy tale style, but C.S. Lewis fails to bring the magic of his other fiction writing to this novel. Lewis fails to create characters whose feelings and actions ring true; in particular, the main character, Orual, is not very believable. Throughout the novel her obsessive actions don't seem appropriate for the character-her development is too shallow. Lewis fails to capture the female perspective for his characters, and this gives the story less impact on the reader. The truest moment comes toward the end, in a twist on the little developed character of Redival . . . if only all of the characters could have had so insightful a background.This could be a fun quick read if you like mythology, but don't expect classic literature."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I can't resist stopping by to review this because it is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read. It is in my top 3 and, sadly, I don't have the words to describe why except to say it's lean yet full, rich and interesting, deep with meaning and even funny... It is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is an uncanny display of how Lewis writes from a female perspective--and succeeds most excellently (see all the ecstatic reviews?). Lewis was a master thinker, observer, writer, and story-teller. Till We Have Faces awes me, for Lewis artfully writes from a very Other perspective. He does this so very well in That Hideous Strength, as well (third in his sci-fi trilogy). Enjoyable! Wah-hoo!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"There is something about classic stories retold that totally changes the way I feel about the story. The change of perspective and point of view has the power to evoke new emotions and responses. This is the effect that Til We Have Faces, by C.S. Lewis, has on the myth of Cupid and Psyche. By telling the story from the sister's point of view the story changes completely. When seen through her eyes her actions make more sense. What was accepted for fact in the original story becomes a misunderstanding. It all goes back to hearing both sides of a story. When only one side is told the reader is conditioned to think one way. But when the other side is told the whole picture comes into focus. There are so many points of view from which this story could be told. By choosing Psyche's sister, Orual, C.S. Lewis changed her from a jealous, plotting, sinister sister into one that loved Psyche so much but made a horrible mistake and suffered for it the rest of her life. With this change in perspective the story transforms into an in-depth tale of the joys and struggles inherent with loving someone too much. The joy that is a part of Orual's life with Psyche is so great that she suffers unceasing torment when Psyche is no longer with her. This is really very different from the original. Yet this change in perspective makes it into a very different tale. Lewis took an old tale and made a new one that is wonderful to read. From Orual's perspective it becomes apparent that there is nothing of jealousy in her for Psyche's beauty and her own lack thereof. Orual has a sisterly love for Psyche that supersedes everything else in her life. Nothing that Orual does in life means more to her than what she does to Psyche. In fact her life revolves around Psyche. Without Psyche's company Orual ceases to be herself and becomes something not quite human. Soon after Psyche left for good she changed into something called The Queen, whom even she didn't really know or understand. The real Orual lies deep within this new being and comes to the surface only to feel deep pain and remorse. All the struggles that Orual goes through really bring the reader into the book. It is easier to relate to someone who has problems and feels pain than someone who is perfect. That is the essence of the whole book - dealing with pain and loss. Orual is a very complex character. First she is ugly, which she accepts, then she hides her face and out comes the inner beauty which everyone else sees but she has a very hard time accepting. It's as if she can accept the bad about herself but never the good. When she does something right she doesn't really believe its her doing it. It's either The Queen that does it or one of her advisors. She won't take credit for it. This really makes me feel for her. She has a very low self esteem that is the result of her circumstances. She is an easy character to get close to because of her weaknesses and faults. Since she isn't perfect it is only natural to relate to her and her feelings. Lewis does an excellent job of making Orual a real, living character. Her experiences, while bizarre, really brought me into the story. Her sufferings reached out to me and cried for help. This book was very easy to read and hard to put down. I really enjoyed seeing this other side to the classic myth. By having Orual tell the story it was easy to relate to her. The reader knows everything that she is thinking and feeling. Which is wonderful when it comes to really being able to understand a character's point of view. Through all of her joys and pains Orual truly develops into a wonderful person."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I, by no means, wish to criticize C. S. Lewis' Till We Have Faces, but forgive me if I did not enjoy the book. This, I understand, is a result of my own preferences and tastes. The novel is well written and exciting. Lewis is able to retell the myth of Cupid and Psyche very well. Perhaps Lewis crafted the characters and told the story in a way that made me pity them to the point that I could not enjoy the book because I could not stand to see them suffer. Perhaps I did not enjoy the book because it deals with gods and dreams and tells such a fanciful tale that I personally lose interest, on account of my dislike for such fantasies. I maintain, however, that the novel was beautifully crafted, and I would readily recommend it to others.C. S. Lewis uses words in a beautiful and skillful manner in Till We Have Faces. He is able to convey the emotions and sorrows and anguish of the narrator, Orual, in such a manner as to move the reader with pity and sympathy for the horrible life that Orual was forced to lead. The words and phrases themselves draw the reader in, enticing the reader into reading further, into turning page after page and forgetting the bed that awaits him or her, forgetting the other pressing matters of the day. Indeed, the craftiness of the novel sucks the reader almost into another world, a world that the reader can well imagine, due to the descriptions and imagery that Lewis uses. As Orual walked, so did I, and as Orual suffered, so did I. Several times I wanted to put the book down, only to free myself from the horrible sufferings that I, through Orual, had to endure, but kept reading only to find what the words would reveal on the pages between my fingers. Perhaps my involvement in the novel was the reason I disliked it. Perhaps it was that I wanted to rest the book when I could no longer stand to read of the life of Orual because I suffered with her. Lewis tells the myth of Cupid and Psyche through the viewpoint of Psyche's sister, Orual. The book tells of Orual's fierce love for her sister, of Orual's possessiveness of her sister. Orual blames the gods for her suffering and for Psyche's suffering, and, indeed, for any suffering endured by anyone at all. In trying to save her sister from false happiness, she becomes the reason her sister must suffer. By the end of the novel, the reader has come to understand what the god meant when he said, &quot;You also shall be Psyche.&quot; Orual takes on her sister's suffering, who then is able to perform her tasks happily, as Orual suffers for her.The book is almost depressing. The parts that I most enjoyed were parts that avoided the issue of Psyche, when Orual's suffering was not quite so evident. When her father died and she ruled the kingdom, I loved to hear of how she governed and of all the reformations she brought to her kingdom. I loved to hear of her relationships with those who worked closely to her: with Arnom, Bardia and the Fox. I enjoyed also hearing of how she got to know the nobles in her kingdom. I was pleased by her popularity. Though Orual was not truly happy during these times, though she admits that her happier times were with the Fox and Psyche years before, I enjoyed these times most. Orual came to be loved by others and that pleased me (indeed, I believe it pleased me more than it apparently pleased her). Perhaps I enjoyed reading about these times because she did not dwell so heavily on her sufferings.If I truly did not enjoy the book, then on what grounds can I recommend it? What would move me to tell a friend, &quot;You should read this book.&quot; I fear, though I am not certain, that I did not enjoy the book because it was not happy, because it moved me to pity, to anger, to sorrow. How masochistic would it be for me to say, with a smile on my face, &quot;Oh, yes, this was a good book, a very good book&quot;? The book makes you think, but at what cost?At what cost, indeed? The book did make me think, unlike the happy pap that perhaps I am more inclined to enjoy. The story and the suffering of the narrator make me feel. They make me think, not only about the novel and the decisions, reactions and sorrows of Orual, but also of my own life, decisions, reactions and sorrows. I am inclined, after reading this novel, to evaluate my own life, motivations and irrational thoughts, feelings and fears. If this reaction will be mimicked in any reader of the book, then I will not hesitate to recommend it to others. I cannot, in good conscience, withhold the feelings that this book may stir in others just because the feelings are not happy. I cannot discourage others from having the opportunity of reading this book just because they may suffer as Orual. The book made me think, however uncomfortable or unhappy the thoughts were. I also was Orual."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is for me C.S.Lewis's greatest work. But I've known others who have read it and found little to appreciate in it. If you can relate to the psychology of the characters in this book, and to the religious context in which the tale is set, it will be a book read many times. If you can not, it will be at best no more than a charming but rather obscure tale set in a distant land.It is a book that tells a tale completely divorced from the self, while being (if it captures one) intimately about the self. It sets rhyme against reason; love against hate; beauty against ugliness; the Gods against humanity; doubt against conviction; the priesthood against the state; the profound against the profain; dark superstition and blood sacrifice against the devine and sacred; what is real against what is illusionary; and culminates with exploring the issue of how life itself can through all of these conflicts be discovered to be not what it always seemed while lived.It is ultimately a character study in how we may each live a lifetime oblivious to who we really were; how we can blame anything but ourselves for all our own perceived misfortunes; and only discover at our end that nothing was quite what it till then seemed. It is in that moment when we find our faces (see ourselves as we really were) that we know both the damnation of all that we have till then been and the salvation of finding all our accusations against the Gods finally answered.The book sugar coats these (and many other) deep philosophical and spiritual issues in a story that is fast paced, gripping, absorbing, and once read ever remembered as a haunting tale about a quaint land and time not ones own brought to life through C.S.Lewis's wonderful skill at painting memorable pictures with words. This is a tale that stretches from the cradle to the grave, and then if one believes such things beyond.Personally I take huge exception to the number of Christians here who claim that this is somehow a \\"Christian\\" tale, in some sort of attempt to claim this book as their own. It is nothing of the sort. Indeed my personal experience has been that Christians tend not to like this book, because it is set in a religious context more druid than christian, and deliberately so for I think that C.S.Lewis wanted to throw away the trappings of his own religion the better to explore the nature of religion itself.The tale is of a greek myth retold in an even more pagan setting, set in an ancient time, perhaps 200 or 300 BC. It is a philosophical and intellectual exploration of that pagan myth, and as such this book would be as accessible to a muslim, an atheist, a buddist and/or and a jew. This story is not one intended to teach the reader what to believe but rather one designed to speak to the whole issue of belief itself, and to challenge ones own beliefs in subtle and not so subtle ways no matter what they are."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"\\"Till We Have Faces\\" may come as a surprise to those readers who come expecting a heavy-handed allegory, such as you find in The Chronicles of Narnia. Some Christian readers may even take offense at Lewis' use of \\"pagan mythology\\" as the basis for his story, referring to \\"the gods,\\" such as \\"Ungit (aka Aphrodite),\\" who demand sacrifices, sometimes even human, and the pagan priest who is actually one of the characters who utters truths that go beyond simple logic (although these truths are mixed with humanity's imperfect understanding and sometimes vindictiveness). This book is far more subtle, and Lewis takes pains to bring forth deep truths about humanity and the spiritual world. Reason and truth, divine and human love often take separate ways in this book, and the inferiority and selfishness of the human love to that which is divine is carefully unfolded. The complexity of the human heart and mind, and the way we interact with the spiritual world, often making the spiritual world fit our own understanding or even wishes, is illustrated in a brilliant way.The story itself is compelling, emotional, and a FANTASTIC read, bringing life, humanity, and reality to a well known myth. But anyone who is willing to plumb the depths with Lewis will not be disappointed. It may grip you, convict you of viewing God and spirituality through either humanistic or even spiritually dogmatic eyes, and leave you in awe of the greatness, holiness, and \\"other-ness\\" of even the POSSIBILITY of One who will ultimately judge our thoughts and actions! Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I first read this book 20 years ago, and I loved it! It was my then-boyfriend's favorite book and I remember so many wonderful discussions we had about the themes in the book--beauty, jealousy, love, immanence, everything.Then, we broke up. It was the usual disastrous college-sweetheart breakup, and for 20 years, I couldn't look at this book without thinking of him.For some reason, for the hell of it, I guess, I picked this novel to teach in my intro to lit class, remembering only how much I'd loved it when I was their age. And oh. Oh my. After 20 years this book still has so much to say to me. Different things, I think, than it did then. When I was young it was an intellectual thing; reading it this time, with marriage and life and love, and false-loves behind me, I think I *feel* the novel more than before.You will want a pen in hand when you read this book, to underline all of the brilliant, insightful lines Lewis throws at you with almost careless ease. And though in my bookstore I found it in the Christian section, I don't think it really belongs there. It's not of any one religion, though Lewis was an ardent Christian. Bottling him up, in this text or with Narnia, as solely 'for Christians' does a real disservice. True wisdom, true spirit, true beauty and insight belongs to no one religion. This book is magnificent and wise no matter what religion the reader brings to it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis dives into the depths of the human psyche in this novel. As one reviewer has already noted, the tale has some undercurrent of the ancient myth of \\"Cupid and Psyche\\", but you don't need to be familiar with the myth to read the book.The story centers around a central character Orual, and the meanderings of her life and mind as she deals with the realities of her tough world. Her father was ruthless king, an alcoholic and abusive upon young princess Orual. Her tutor, and old man considered the \\"Greek\\", schools her in the philosophy of essential naturalism and Greek classics, and tries to offer her advice along those lines. The main religion of the day in Orual's kingdom involves ritual sacrifice and praise to a god named Ungit, whom she wonders much about, as he seems not to care or intervene but merely requires bloody sacrifice. At one point in the story, her sister, born beautiful and captivating and much loved by Orual, is taken by force and sacrificed by the elders of the community to an unknown \\"god of the mountain\\" to try to stave off a plague of raining arrows. Orual seems to become hardened more and more as the story goes on because of these sorrowful events.Through the story, we follow Orual from a first person perspective. We can see into her heart and mind as she considers what all of these events and people mean, and who really is \\"god of the mountain\\" or \\"Cupid\\" or whoever it is that took beautiful Psyche away from her. Who has subjected her to such a tough and loveless life of suffering, and why won't they speak to her? The answer, as it turns out, is not what one immediately thinks.In order to grasp the significance of this novel, you cannot read bits and pieces nor can you merely read the ending and hope to understand. But, if you read it in its entirety, you may need to read the final chapter several times to understand what the story means. It certainly was the case for me. In a monumental instance of indirection, CS Lewis invites us into a personal \\"leap\\" in which we consider who we really are and why god is silent.On a personal note, anyone who is an adult child of abuse, or who is sick of ritual religion, or who is unsatisfied with various natural philosophies, should seriously consider this work. I could not recommend it more for a person seriously interested in the meaning of life.Would that we all knew who we really are!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Wow, this book strongly affected me in a positive way. The first 50 pages were okay, because period pieces are not always my favorite. I hung in there since C.S. Lewis is my favorite author. I'm so glad I did because I got hooked. By page 50 I was so engrossed I couldn't put it down. By the last 50 pages I finally understood what the book was REALLY about and finished the book sobbing at 4 in the morning. It's been over ten years since I first read it and I think of it often. It makes you think about your own life and if you are having an impact on those around you for good. Why are we here and what are we doing about it?"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I can't say enough good about Till We Have Faces. This deep, strange, profoundly Christian book changed my life when, as a young agnostic attorney, I read it in 1985 and realized I was reading an allegory about, of all things, a religion (Christianity) which until then I'd dismissed as shallow myth. Till We Have Faces woke me up. Since then I've learned it's I who am shallow. I can't see His depth because I lack eyes. I can't see His face because I don't have a face. Christ's purpose is to help us shape our divine face if only we're willing. As Hamlet realized: &quot;The readiness is all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I've always liked C.S. Lewis's allegories and writings on faith, but I never thought that he would produce such a beautiful and subtle work of fiction. This was actually assigned as a summer reading project in English, and I was also surprised at myself when I not only enjoyed it, but liked it better when I had to map out all its themes and parallels. The novel takes place in the times of ancient Greece, when myths are still being made, and it is interesting just to see the myth of Cupid and Psyche from another's point of view, Psyche's older sister Orual --especially the angry shock when she finds out how much the &quot;true&quot; story has been altered by the tellers of tales. It is also interesting to see how the gods themselves -- in this case, Aphrodite -- exist in all cultures but have different forms, and the beautiful goddess of the Greeks can be the vengeful hag of Orual's people. The myth structure is used to explore a number of themes: the nature of love, the nature of the gods, and the personal journey every person must make.Besides all this, though, there are two things that surprised me most of all: the main character, Orual, is multi-dimensional, and very female (even though her circumstances are different from most women). Whether you like her actions or not, you understand them, and you find yourself sympathizing with her even when she is being greedy or selfish. The other characters are interesting, too. The other thing is the way that Lewis masterfully combines the elements of myth and the ancient, polytheistic religion, and brings them to very Christian revelations. But if whether you are a Christian or not, you will still be moved by Orual's discoveries at the strangely satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I first read this book in my high school sophomore English class. I sort of enjoyed it and saw some value in it but, for the most part, it was obtuse.A year or so after high school, I saw it in a bookstore and, since I'm an avid C. S. Lewis fan, thought that I should read it again. I'm so glad I did! It instantly became my favorite book, and defends its place up to this day.I've talked to other people about it, who seem to come at it as if it were an allegory. If you read it that way, you will be disappointed! There is an intriguing depth to it, but as the priest says, \\"holy wisdom is not clear and thin like water, but thick and dark like blood.\\" This book will give you a glimpse into the depths of reality, but not in the same way \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" does.I'm rereading it for probably the fourth time, and my love for it continues to deepen. You have to learn to take the story the way it is and let your understanding of it grow before you can enjoy the marvel and mystery of this book. Yes, it has a deep allegorical element in it, but it's because of what the story is, and not the other way around.I can see why C. S. Lewis thought this was his best novel. It was also his last, and has a very personal nature to it. It is a masterpiece of modern fiction, but it seems like few see it that way. But if you love George MacDonald, J. R. R. Tolkien, or Charles Williams, you should really give this book a fair chance."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"As there exists a wealth of [mostly] helpful reviews, I will try to add to the current body rather than restate it all.Till We Have Faces is known, by now, to be an allegory using the myth of Cupid and Psyche. For those who want a primer, Lewis has Apuleius' version of the myth summarized at the end of the work, which is helpful for keeping the allegory in mind, rather than trying to figure out what is going on with the plot.By far, my impression is that Lewis' strength in this work is his stunning use of characterization. He makes both Orual and Psyche, as well as the King and Fox, so incredibly consistent-consistencies that required \`tweaking' of the myth itself in order to implement-and consistencies that are required in order to make them seem more real. The result of such piercing characterizations is the ability to find pieces of ourselves in the characters, which adds to the meaningfulness of the allegory and the satisfaction from the story.Here I wish to warn the reader: the climax and denouement are gentler in this story than they are in The Last Battle, The Space Trilogy-I should just say, gentler than Lewis' normal style. It is no less impacting, and no less worthy, but a careless read will cause the reader to miss it. Unfortunately, many (not all, of course) readers tend to speed up near the end, where things \`get good'. I would advise against this: for those readers who know they tend toward this, tread carefully in Part Two.I also cannot declare that it is Lewis' best fiction: maybe such a thing differs depending on which of his works personally speak to which readers. However, it is certainly worth the time and energy, and there are many benefits to the way he chooses to retell the myth. I personally do not find that it detracts from the myth in any way, but that each can be savored separately.Enjoy!--The Medieval Chick"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis' book Till we Have Faces is a fantastic literary achievement that shows how important point of view actually is. We are all familiar, I'm sure, of the Greek myth of Psyche and Cupid. The myth in a nutshell says that Psyche was married to Cupid, but she could never know to who it was she was married. Psyche was extremely happy, although she never saw her husbands' face. She lived in a big palace, and was pretty much set for life. Psyche's sisters, however, came to visit her one day and saw her big home and her happiness, and they became extremely jealous. They decided to ruin Psyche because that is what all good sisters do. They convince Psyche to turn on the lights that night to see who her husband is. She does and becomes doomed to wander the Earth aimlessly. She later is forced to do impossible labors for Cupid's mother, who is jealous of her beauty. Eventually Psyche becomes reconciled with Cupid and she becomes deified. Then they live happily ever after. C.S. Lewis version of this story casts a very different light on the story when it told from Orual's, one of Psyche's sisters, perspective. This is why this book is so interesting. In C.S. Lewis version we learn that Orual's intentions are really quite pure, and that she inadvertently brings about Psyche's downfall. She then blames herself for years for bringing such misery upon the sister she loved so dearly. So by simply changing the point of view of the story, Lewis creates a character who is sympathetic rather than spiteful. It is this message of looking at things from different perspectives that is one of the main themes in this story.The other theme of this story is that beauty, true beauty, is found on the inside. I have wondered why Lewis chose to name this book Till we Have Faces, and I am still not sure of the significance of it. It is possible that the whole theme of beauty is what this title suggests. When we are beautiful on the inside, then it shows in our countenance and our faces. Our faces then reflect what we are, and people see us in that way. It is interesting that until Orual veils her face, she is considered ugly, but once she does veil it, she is considered to be very beautiful because she then allows her true, beautiful self to take over. In this way, people really don't see her true face until she veils her ugly one.This book is a great read. It is full of symbolic elements that are interesting to try and interpret. Lewis is a great author, and this book lived up to all of my expectations for it. If you do plan on reading it, plan a huge block of time when you can read the entire thing, because once you start it, you won't want to put it down. I really enjoyed it because it made me think. C.S. Lewis is a terrific author, and he does not disappoint with this book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have a confession to make...I am not a big fan of Lewis. I think as far as intelligent & clear-headed thinking - especially on difficult faith issues - he certainly had a gift. However, I think he makes (made) things too black & white without a real, first-hand understanding of the strength of emotion, disillusionment, and difficult experiences when dealing with faith. This is true at least until the end of his life when was \\"defeated\\" in theological debates by a female atheist, he married a divorced woman (something he had earlier condemned), and then he lost his wife tragically. (The movie Shadowlands explores this marriage and its effects on him.)These events rattled Lewis to the core, and for awhile he lost all confidence in his former theological proclaimations (except that God is good). It is my understanding that Lewis wrote \\"Till We Have Faces\\" after this huge shake-up in his life. This book represents an understanding he came to after almost all of his faith foundation had been smashed and he had to rebuild it. And, I think, this new level of depth really manifests in this work. While I'm not a fan of Lewis in general, I think this book is absolutely phenomenal.What Lewis has done, as many reviewers have mentioned, is to retell the story of Cupid & Psyche. And he chooses to tell it from the perspective of Psyche's older (and supposedly evil) sister Orual. For the entire first part of the book (labelled Part I), Lewis takes you through a fantastic, confusing, emotional, biting story. Unlike his simplistic themes in the Chronicals of Narnia, Lewis relates a very twisted account of love & jealousy through complex characters, relationships, and landscapes. And as he does so, he allows the reader to become fully sympathetic to Orual and her position...even though she instigates some unfortunate situations.However, while it is tempting with Lewis to draw trite lessons and observations, I encourage you to not do so. I encourage you to let yourself be confused and wonder at the purpose at Part I. For, in Part II he brings it all together very powerfully. Not only does his explain the story, but I think he delivers one of the most disabling blows I've ever read in a novel. I don't want to give away the ending, but Orual's own gasping revelation as she tries to justify her bitterness was simply phenomenal. And, when considering Lewis' likely similar bitterness regarding his short-lived marriage, I feel that this all came directly from his heart.A one-of-a-kind title that I would recommend to anyone willing to grasp with faith and potentially ugly revelations about ourslves."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I went into this book not knowing what to expect; I'd never even heard of it before. The first time I read it, it blew my mind. The second time, it struck me in different ways, all just as powerful and intriguing. I can safely say that this is one of my favorite books of all time.The story follows the \\"ugly sister\\" of the Eros/Psyche myth -- the one who seeks to destroy Psyche's happiness in the original fairytale. Here, the myth gains new life as it is stripped of its fairytale trappings and set into a realistic world. In short, it explains why the myth is the way it is, and at the same time it is an engaging tale of the true nature of \\"love.\\"Just thinking about what Lewis manages here is amazing enough. I don't think I've ever read a book that so effortlessly entwines 1) an engaging story, 2) a strong allegory, 3) a philosophical treatise, 4) beautiful character development (beautiful characterization all 'round!), and best of all, 5) pure entertainment. Most incredibly, Till We Have Faces effortlessly \\"instructed\\" me -- one of those rare books that left me looking at my own character and my relationships with other people. Anyone 13 and up can enjoy it -- the writing style is sharp and concise, communicates much with very few words, delivers some wonderful turns of phrase, and in general is very earthy and strong and rich. In my mind, Lewis is easily a master of the genre.This is not a \\"perfect\\" retelling of the Eros/Psyche myth and takes some liberties by focusing only on the ugly sister, but it only serves to emphasize the meaning behind the myth. In fact, I find the story far more engaging because of its altered focus. Don't be fooled... the Psyche myth is here, and it's absolutely integral; this book is all about the myth and how it reflects Orual's life. It's running inbetween the lines if one would care to look for it. In fact, I much preferred reading about the far more complex and interesting character of Orual (the ugly sister) than her sweet and perfect sister Psyche who, in my opinion, was annoying.There are only two reasons I can think of that would turn off the potential reader. Firstly, it may be boring if you dislike reading about somebody's daily life. If such exposition is painful for you, you'll probably hate this book. That said, the way Lewis described the daily life of these ancient people brought the entire culture alive for me. The second way you might find it painful is if you dislike having thick philosophy stirred in -- and the allegory/philosophy comes to a head near the end of the book in such a way that will spin an unprepared reader's head. The first time I read this I had to read it about three times and I still didn't get it. The second time it was much clearer, but obviously Lewis was an excellent philosopher, which I am not.One can enjoy this book on its superficial level and come away feeling oddly relaxed and good at the end, even without completely understanding why. And if you dare to dig deeply, you will get more than you know what to do with. Lewis found it important to really know what one was saying -- to say what one really meant, one should get at the foundation of a word. If you want to get some extra oomph out of your reading, if you want to expand your mind and your understanding about the integral concept of \\"love,\\" this is the book for you. If you want an entertaining ride, the book is this, too.I do not understand why it doesn't have any more critical acclaim; perhaps its Christian allegory is part of this, in which case it is a shame. This book manages what most \\"artsy\\" books can almost never claim: it is entertaining at the same time that it is thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is, I think, Lewis' best fantasy novel, written close to the end of his life. Many elements that annoyed me about his earlier works (such as his occasional flashes of misogyny) are refreshingly absent here, in a story very much focussed on strong female characters.This is usually sold as religious fiction (which it is, in a roundabout way). But it has plenty of the usual fantasy trappings (a cool warrior queen, swordfights, weird pagan gods, human sacrifice, battles and other fun political intrigue among ancient kingdoms, etc). It is no more religiously-inspired (though arguably no less so) than his Space Trilogy, or his Narnia series, which you often see shelved in the fantasy sections of bookstores, and is in some ways better than any of them. Lewis is a compelling read, and the pages just fly by. On the other hand, it is no doubt far too introspective for someone looking for the latest Dungeons & Dragons style action adventure.Anyway, if you like intelligent fantasy, but find the title a little off-putting, may I suggest you just pick it up from the shelf in your bookstore and read a few pages. If you are intrigued by the beginning, I doubt you will be disappointed by the remainder.ADDENDUM 4/23/2006: A more recent post has inspired me to add a few comments. They are as follows:(1) Since this forum is not set up for debate, it might be best if reviewers stick to reviewing the book rather than reviewing eachother's reviews.(2) I stand by my review and my choice of words. There are obviously many ways a character can be \\"strong\\". I trust the reader will understand what I mean (and what I do not mean) after he reads the book. It would make no sense to give away half the plot with an extensive discussion of the issue.(3) I was intrigued by Lewis' treatment of the middle sister, which does not neatly compare to any other character in Lewis' fiction. I can see, however, how she might be misunderstood by a very inattentive reader. To say more would be a spoiler.(4) Because I really liked this book, I hoped to convince others to read it. My review is mainly addressed to those who to some extent enjoyed Lewis' other sci-fi/fantasy fiction, but who might not have considered trying this title. I trust no-one will be misled into believing this is a radical feminist tract."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"To my mind, this is perhaps the finest piece Mr. Lewis ever produced: an allegorical re-telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche. It is neither bogged down by excessive detail and fatuous elements that go seemingly nowhere, nor does it seem too spare...in a word, this flows...and does it beautifully...almost mirroring Alan Paton in terms of sheer smoothness and comfort of read. While spare, the prose does not seem to lack for anything...Lewis constructs his story well, patiently, building us slowly to climax.This is, as mentioned earlier, a re-telling of a myth. It is also an exploration of love, false love, attachment, jealousy, envy, pride, limitation of human understanding, and, above all, the power of grace to redeem even the least lovely and least desirable among us. This is a lovely piece, giving a marvelous message of both hope and comfort. I recommend it most highly."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The widely beloved author C. S. Lewis has a devoted following of readers, especially in regard to his works The Chronicles of Narnia, The Screwtape Letters, etc. but many have never even approached his fourth and final novel, Till We Have Faces. This is unfortunate because Till We Have Faces simply has more substance as a novel than the Space Trilogy (excepting Perelandra) in the ways of the human soul in conflict. The novel is modeled after epic, in the true meaning of the term, mythology that retells Apuleius'erotic version of the marriage of Cupid and Psyche as included in his The Metamorphoses. Lewis structures his novel as a narrative presented from the point of view of the elder of the wicked sisters of Psyche. Lewis has this sister, Orual is her name, deliver her story as an accusation to the gods for having stolen Psyche from her. In this work Lewis quite often, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, gives tribute to the many classical influences that shaped his life and writings. Knowledge of Dante's Purgatorio may not be critical to understanding the major conflict of the story, but it certainly helps.Anyway, without revealing too much as well as for the sake of brevity, Lewis has created one of the most powerful and heart wrenching sagas yet written that attempts to tackle the questions concerning perverted love, inadequate love, and sacred love and the difference between the sacred and profane. Lewis presents arguments between the thesis of paganism(blood, sacrifice, mystery), the antithesis of intellectual paganism(rationalism), and finally the synthesis, Christianity. It begins rather confusing to most but if you stick with it, the novel has a very rewarding conclusion and an interesting \\"twist\\" ending that Lewis himself attributed to his conversion to Christianity.As high-brow as this may sound, this book is targeted to a wide audience and is very accessible ,yet can be read repeatedly with new insight, new depth, discovered by even the most discerning of readers. Fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings as well as of Lewis should definitely try this mythology and find out why the gods refuse to answer until we have faces."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I had a friend of a friend hand this book to me, obviously excited about it.

This book was one of the best I've ever read. I can hardly wait to read it a second time. C.S. Lewis does a fine job of illustrating his characters. He makes them totally believable, and his writing style sucks you into the plot line before you know what's happened to you. He explores the differences between sacred and profane love through Orual and her sister Psyche's relationship. The book is based off of the original Mythological tale of Cupid and Psyche. His rendition and interpretation of it is absolutely captivating. This book is a good one to read whether you are a Christian or not. If you are, C.S. Lewis will help you to become a stronger believer. I would encourage anyone to read this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is the best work of fiction by an engaging master of English prose.

The first time I read this book I was incredibly sick and promised myself (at about 7 pm) that I would read just 1 or 2 chapters and get to bed. At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept. This book is surreal, empowering and cathartic all at the same time. It brings mythical characters who often feel cold and drab in mere textbook descriptions to life as utterly human, modern characters with a depth of feeling and thought beyond the scope of that captured in most novels."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"In his re-telling of the Greek Myth of Cupid and Psyche, CS Lewis communicates more of his understand of man's relationship to God than in any other work. Some of my Christian friends have asked me how a &quot;Christian Writer&quot; could write about &quot;gods&quot; other than the true God. My reply is Mr. Lewis' own (paraphrased), that all stories of gods are about man's faulty knowledge of the God. This is not a book of theology, it is a story of the persistence with which a loving God pursues each of us, without shame or hesitation, and most certainly without end. Mr. Lewis has combined his considerable talent as a story teller, and his personal knowledge of God, gained through reason and through experience, to convey to us a tale of both the misery and the mystery, the fear and the joy, the anger and the forgiveness, all both given and received, of really knowing God.

As always, Lewis writes well, with insight into the depths and heights of human psychology, and with subtle allegory and a taste for grand and weighty endings. It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth the time.Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian. It hasn't happened yet, though! Perhaps, having been brought up on the Narnia books, I've developed some immunity..."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"a friend told me that \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is to \\"The Four Loves\\" as \\"Perelandra\\" is to \\"The Abolition of Man.\\" In other words, sometimes Lewis' fiction explains his theology more readily than his theology books do.My friend was right. This book is about love. About sacrifice, bearing one another's burdens, false love...what is it when a mother or a sister or a friend loves the other so much that it becomes selfish and keeping the loved one to oneself becomes more important to the lover than what is best for the beloved?It is a retelling of the Greek myth of Psyche and Eros, from the viewpoint of the ugly sister, and it is very well written. However, if you are looking for a simple retelling of the myth, with all the details of that story, don't look here. This is not about Psyche, but about Orous, the sister.Lewis drew me in from the first sentence, and kept me enthralled until THE END. He develops all the characters very well, but especially the first person, the narrator. I knew how she felt; I felt with her. How a man, a classic scholar and a fusty English gentleman was able to delve so deeply into the feminine heart and mind, I don't know. Lewis was a genius, and that is no lie."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Of all the fictional work by C. S. Lewis, this is the most mature in that he took time to craft the novel more than in previous works. It is a beautiful picture of Christianity. Just as Christians have a \\"husband\\" (God) that cannot be seen, He still is taking care of them and loving them. Although young readers can enjoy the novel on a story level, it will take a mature reader to see the symbolism and appreciate the various emotional levels of the book. It should be read and re-read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces puts a new twist on the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. C. S. Lewis spices it up with making Psyche's castle invisible to the sister, changing the setting and the characters and adding characters. Lewis places the story in a fantastical land that believes in their own goddess named Ungit (the Greek Aphrodite). As in the original the king has three daughters, of which the youngest is the most beautiful. Her name is Istra, but her older sister Orual calls her Psyche because of the stories she has heard of the Greek myth. I really enjoyed how Lewis unfolds the whole story and how he tells it from Orual's perspective. It really seems to come more realistic from her viewpoint. Orual reacts to things in much the same way as the rest of us, whereas Psyche seems almost god-like from the beginning. I really delighted in the religious allusions that Lewis always manages to include in his writings. The similarities between Jesus Christ and Psyche are amazing. Everything that she did and went through could compared to His life in some way or another. Orual's growth of understanding and knowledge progressed throughout the story, which helped me relate to her a lot more. As I go through life I learn from the experiences and come to understand that although I don't understand everything that is going on, there is a purpose for it. Other of Lewis' new ideas such as making the castle invisible helped me to understand how hard it would have been to believe that Psyche was married to a god. If I saw it, I don't think it would be as hard to fathom as if I didn't. That kind of alludes the basis of faith. Seeing is not always believing. Lewis has an amazing ability to write and is able to get his message across very well. His twist on the old Greek myth brings in the more modern thoughts of Christianity."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"'Till We Have Faces' is not the retelling of Cupid and Psyche, it is the story of the troubled sister watching from a distance. Reading this story was like looking from the outside in; the view of a non-Christian of the beautiful, but mysterious joy of the Christian. It is a breathtaking story told in a style completely unlike Lewis, bringing together the light and dark of a legend of ancient Greece, with a deeper understanding of human nature.\\"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\\" ~1 Corinthians 13:12"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Cupid and Psyche. In the classic myth, a beautiful princess becomes the bride of an mysterious, nocturnal suitor who forbids her to see his face. Goaded by her two ugly, jealous sisters, Psyche disobeys her husband and lights a lamp to look at his face while he sleeps. As luck would have it, her husband, the god Cupid, awakens and abandons her. Heartbroken, Psyche wanders the land looking for him until they are at last reunited, and she is made a goddess. Lewis tweaks the myth in his retelling, choosing one of the \\"ugly\\" sisters--here named Orual--to tell a different version of the tale. In Till We Have Faces, Orual is the doting older sister who adores and cares for her much younger half-sister, Psyche, after her stepmother dies in childbirth. But when Psyche finds love in the arms of a enigmatic lover, Orual feels betrayed. She tries to sabotage the relationship not from jealousy of her sister's good fortune, as the myth claims, but out of jealousy for Psyche. Lewis's novel is rich and multi-layered, interweaving themes of unconditional love, death, and adversity to create a truly compelling tale. While the pace is rather slow, patient readers are sure to be rewarded by the story's end."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I typically read a book and then pass it on.

The novels that I have read multiple times are Adam Bede and Middlemarch by George Elliot, To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, and Till We Have Faces by CS Lewis.

C.S.Lewis, How do you DO it? He took a simple myth, gave it life and history and plausibility... and beyond that, made it a passionate description of our innermost struggle with pride and acceptance. Simple enough for anyone to read, the story hooks you in, the truth hits you deep."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is a high point in the writings of C S Lewis. Truly one of his best. Lewis wrote on a number of levels from children's works through to some pretty heavy going university lectures. While the cover of this book may suggest otherwise, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is actually an easy enough read when considering the depth and complexity of the subject matter.Also worth noting: this paperback is a nice edition with larger format and type and a quality feel. A masterpiece from the master."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Read this with my 12y-o-daughter. We loved it!! We used the study guide/commentary offered by Veritas Press in their Omnibus curriculum which greatly facilitated our discussion and deepened our understanding of this excellent work by C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This novel is timeless. I read it every year and see new nuances I hadn't picked up on the years before. It's a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from a different point of view. It lacks the strong Christian themes of his other works, but if that turned you off from his other works, this might be right up your alley."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This beautifully written novel by C. S. Lewis is not only an unusual and creative retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, but is also a novel that explores with great understanding and depth the nature of love.The protagonist of the story is surprisingly not Psyche, but Orual, her sister. The novel is written in the first person with Orual stating her case against the gods who have wronged her by putting out a false version of Psyche's tale to the mortal world - the story of Psyche and her jealous sisters. Orual thus sets out the past and the reasons behind her actions to prove to the gods that her actions were based on love. We the readers are, therefore, members of the jury, and in this function we cannot avoid engaging in a personal soul-searching as well.The poignant message of the novel is that love - at least mortal love - is seldom selfless. Orual, in the course of her narration, comes to realize this fact and reconciles with the gods.This novel is bound to have a deep impact on the reader as it makes one evaluate one's relationships with others, and realize the inevitable truth that love is always selfish. Lewis also conveys the message that letting go of what one loves (something extremely difficult to do) is love in all its selflessness.A must-read for all."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"My favorite book of all time.

Lewis offers a glimpse into the darkness and light of the human heart as we struggle with the requirements of the gods."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This story is beautiful and haunting. It is so very human and so much more adult than the Narnia series, yet still has something childlike in its portrayal of love, family, and heartbreak.The myth of Cupid and Psyche is somewhat well known. C.S. Lewis mixes classical Greek elements drawn directly from the myth with an almost tribal sense of spirituality and a fairy-tale setting to tell a wonderfully unique and thought-provoking story from the point of view of Psyche's sister.We feel firsthand the heartbreak and intensity of first love, family love, betrayal, and loneliness. This story draws fewer allegories than Lewis' other fiction (Narnia, Out of Silent Planet trilogy, Screwtape) and instead is a powerful story from a wonderful storyteller which is much more subtle in its morals and questions of life. A must read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Having heard much about this book from a Wheaton professor, I finally read it with an expectation of receiving great insight. For that, I will have to re-read, I think. There are hints of truths, some of which I know I missed, since I am accustomed to didactic presentations. Didn't quite realize until the end that it is indeed a retelling of an old myth. At any rate, it is an interesting read, even if taken only superficially."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I thought I had read everything by C.S.Lewis, and was pleasantly surprised when a friend recommended Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. I downloaded it to my Kindle while experiencing a rainy autumn week-end in Northern Michigan. Within this excellent read the sun came out, even though the rain was still giving me a great reason to curl up in a chair and enjoy the genius of Mr. Lewis. Needless to say, I spent a very enjoyable week-end because of this wonderful novel. I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Not what I expected but still a good read. Unlike some of Lewis's other works, this book does not have such obvious links to Christian theology since it is based on Greek polytheism. However, the book does deal with the theme of how our limited knowledge of God and ourselves means we cannot often understand why difficult events in our lives happen from a theological perspective. If Lewis's Narnia books are a fable version of \\"Mere Christianity\\" then \\"Till we Have Faces\\" is loosely a fable version of \\"The Problem of Pain\\"."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Considering that at the time I'm writing this review, it's had over 150 five-star reviews, I hesitate to add another little voice to the huge chorus, but here it is.

Whenever I meet someone I like a lot - I give them a copy of TILL WE HAVE FACES..."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The first time I read Till We Have Faces, upon finishing the last page I immediately returned to the first page and began reading it again, something I have felt compelled to do only one other time in my life. It was Lewis's last work of fiction and, in spite of being written in first person from the viewpoint of ancient queen in a largely mythical past, his most personal. His deepest thoughts on God and faith are entwined throughout the story, though it is certainly not an allegory, even in the less formal modern sense which encompasses the Chronicles of Narnia. Certainly metaphors and symbols abound (readers familiar with Lewis's life will see a certain level of autobiography in the tension between the Old Fox and the priests of Ungit) but they often flow along complicated currents. Lewis once said that life is like a tree that branches out as it reaches towards perfection, not a pool that gathers towards unity. Till We Have Faces represents the highest branches, arrived at in the last chapter of the author's life."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This was nothing short of amazing. I have yet to read anything by Lewis that did not amaze me. For some strange reason I've been looking for this, and BOOM! I ran into it, and I had to pick it up. The title doesn't really give too much away as of what to expect. Then I read the back cover, (uh-huh, 2 sisters, and one is ugly, and it is set in the backdrop of Glome. OK! Cupid also plays a role in this) and not really knowing that much about myths, I basically cracked the first page and uttered to myself, \\"Here goes!\\" I knew that this had to be something good: I just had to find out what it might be. You talk about the old saying, \\"More than meets the eye...\\" Uh, YEAH!So Orual is embittered because Psyche is loved by a great lover. Sounds simple, maybe a little too simple, but it isn't all that simple! Some may call Orual jealous, maybe even self-possessed when it comes to Psyche. What the heck is Lewis trying to say here? He always paints a picture, but what did he bring to the canvas this time? Take a closer look, a good look, and you'll be looking in the mirror. What? Yeah, I felt like putting it down a few times. But I know I would've missed something very revealing. How obsessed are we with ourselves? We are strange creatures! This time it is beyond special, and a favorite work of C.S. Lewis. One of his personal favorites!Nothing will really prepare you for what is to come. A king, a knight, maybe even a servant or two? That doesn't even crack the surface! Being a myth retold (as the title suggests), you might even say that the gods come into play. In short, I found this to be some heavy stuff. I believe I found it heavy because Lewis never offers the easiest of answers. Yeah, leave this alone if you seek an easy popcorn read. This is meant to get into the head a little. It's also meant to prick the heart just a little bit more!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I'm not a big C.S. Lewis fan. He writes well, but I dont really care for his overall stories. However, TWHF is a book that even readers who dont like Lewis' normal over-the-top christian themes can enjoy. I know I did."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone. The protagonist is angry at the gods for the problems in her life. She questions their existence and condemns them for their arbitrary nature due to the difficulties that she faces.As I read this work I could see many of less desirable traits I possess in the protagonist. I, like many people I suppose have bemoaned &quot;why me&quot; and &quot;when oh Lord is it my turn&quot;. Reading this book provides a mirror of such emotions.I highly recommend this work for anyone but especially for someone who might wish to indict the Gods."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"To put into words how I feel about Till We Have Faces is an impossible task. It would be easier to put into words abstract feelings, than describe to you the pure genius of this book. C.S. Lewis is truly a master storyteller, and his magically gripping ability to involve the reader from the very first page is truly unparalleled. If you have ever want to read a book that can relate to your life this book is it. Till We Have Faces is defiantly one of the best books I have ever read. The story of Orual is a story of extremes. The book at points takes on many aspects of a psychological thriller in much the same fashion as Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Orual is constantly being pulled by different characters that represent the extremes of her own mind. The internal strife of having to deal with issues surrounding her sister Pschye, propels Orual on a voyage of self-discovery, that in the end shows her the true nature of life, happiness, beauty, and self-worth. Lewis employs some great techniques to get his points across to the reader. On the surface and the obvious level, Lewis gives the reader a great story about an ugly sister, great love for her goddess like beautiful sister. The story contains sword fights, wars, famines, death, sacrifice, gods, goddesses, and natural disasters. All the ingredients necessary to make a great page turning novel. However, just beneath the story lies Lewis attempt to make a statement. That statement being: Self Worth is not measured by beauty but actions and the person themselves. The book in the interpretive sense is very much a story about the trial and tribulations one must endure on this earth, and why they must be endured. Lewis will always be a great author. Generations from now his stories will be considered classics. Stories such as the Chronicles of Narnia will always be considered Lewis's greatest works. I feel that Till We Have Faces could easily join the ranks of Lewis's greatest books. Not only that it is a must read for anybody. The book itself is easy to follow and comprehend. The youngest of children could pick up on the moral that Lewis is presenting to us in this book, yet the wisest of adults could find deep and meaning insights into life and love also. The book truly contains something for everyone, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I personally sat down and didn't get back up until I had read the entire novel."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Look, forget any praises of the book you have heard because it \\"has strong female characters\\" or because it's not \\"in-your-face Christian apologism.\\" There are lots of things to praise about this book, but those two praises are entirely misplaced.For one thing, as long as we're discussing Lewis's improved!female characters - so far as I'm concerned, Orual is Lewis's typical example of any soul that is still prideful, in all of its grubbly and idiotic self-will (but she can use a sword well, so that will be enough for some). Psyche is someone who has conquered that self-will, but most would see her as a goody two-shoes saint. Asnit is a wife and widow - and that's about all. Redival is a typical Lewisian villain, almost absurdly sneaky and two-faced, with the added femmy element of being boy-crazy. And a magnificent fighting queen farther north is mentioned - once. I'm not saying I have anything against it on these grounds. But it's absurd to come to \\"Till We Have Faces\\" looking for a feminist book.As for the idea that this book has less overt Christianity for the non-Christian reader to swallow - well, superficially, the gods in this book are all pagan. But there are large whacks of this book I imagine I would have found very boring before my conversion - boring, melodramatic, and vague. In fact, Christian point of view aside, the two conversations between Orual and Psyche in the Shadowbrute's valley could have used an editor's red pen. The views of the Fox and Bardia (who are both good, loving men nevertheless) are examples of the ways believers can be fuddled and led astray. And towards the very end Orual is using blatantly Christian verbage: \\"I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?\\"Of course, anyone could read it, and many enjoy it. For example, the \\"worldly\\" parts of the book are very interesting from any viewpoint - life under the temperamental petty king (who, seemingly, would have found in Henry VIII a kindred spirit), the purchase of the Greek captive Fox, who becomes the girls' tutor, the skirmishes between the King and the Priest of Ungit, veiled Orual learning to fence and challenging a king in combat (with Fox saying that its \\"foolish and, what's more, unseemly\\"!), and the details of the Queen's busy and shrewd reign. And we've all been trained to appreciate Greek pagan aesthetics, so that's another element to the book anyone will like - Lewis is rich (perhaps overrich) and pretty in his symbols and pictures and visions for Orual.But this is a morality to Orual's eventual, mature judgment of herself that not everyone is going to share. For example, not everyone would have thought it shameful to admit that she (at one point!) appreciated and even encouraged Prince Trunia's flirtacious banter. For those who do, of course, it's a rich dimension to the book.The details of life in Glome are well-envisioned and enjoyable.So why did I give this three stars? I love Lewis's nonfiction works, but I've yet to read one of his fictional ones that didn't leave something to be desired (mind, I haven't yet read Perelandra). Perhaps because he is sometimes trying to be too allegorical, his characterizations usually suffer. Several in \\"Till We Have Faces\\" are maddeningly flat. This is the best fictional work of Lewis's I've ever read. But it's far from the best fictional work I've ever read."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I wanted to finish the book since so much more reading is piling up. As it is I stay up late doing my Bible reading by flashlight. So I just finished the book. I read the last half in about 2 days. I should know better than to do that. Reading deep stuff so quickly always makes me cry.I found myself crying at the end, because it was my story, my prayer. The whole story, as I guess Lewis intended, and Orual's final prayer. \\"Long did I hate you, long did I fear you,\\" she says at the very end. Oh God, that was so me! Now, 10+ years after reading this the first time, I understand. I understand so clearly. It moves me to tears. How could I have been so blind for so many years?I had always thought of Ungit as somehow good. Gods have to be good, right? I never saw that she was a metaphor for all that was ugly and sinful in us - a profane love that was not really love.It is odd to read this book through new eyes. We are Psyche. What that means I do not know. But reading this book a second time I see many of the layers I missed the first time. This is not like the Narnia series where the metaphors are often easy. This is a hard, deep book, meant for adults. I see many Christian metaphors I missed the first time because my head was with HER instead of Him. It's like how I used to read the Bible and it never made sense. Then, after I became a Christian, it became the most wonderful book and I began to study it with new eyes, and saw many things I'd overlooked before.And still I feel I've missed so many nuances in the book. Many things, I think, have double meanings. Lewis was a master with words. Something will have a meaning in the book, and another, deeper, Christian meaning.All of this went over my head the first time. I didn't understand a tenth of what Lewis was trying to convey. I guess I did not have a face then; I was not ready to listen to the truth, both the truth about me, and the truth about God (there's that double meaning again!).I could go on forever. There's not time nor space enough to write everything Lewis wove into this story. All I know is I thank God for showing me my life in these pages. The girl who was first handed the book was Orual, not able to hear the truth, not yet ready for the answer that would unmake her, change her. I know I'm not perfect. I won't truly have a face until the day I die and stand before God. But every day I die a little and become more the woman God wants me to be. \\"Long did I hate you, long did I fear you.\\" But no more. No more."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This could be Lewis' fiction masterpiece.So many themes converge in this work - it's like a cut jewel in a bright light: look at it from a slightly different angle, and a new facet will sparkle before your eyes.There's the theme of redemption. The backdrop of the Cupid and Psyche myth. The 13th chapter of Paul's first letter to the Corinthians. Gender. Jealousy. Power. The fragility and brokenness of human nature. Pride. The variation of St. Augustine on the last page: \\"Long did I hate you.\\"For me, this is perfect story-telling, intertwined with powerful Christian teaching - yet it's all done so delicately, with such a light touch.If you're new to C.S. Lewis, I don't know that I would make this the first book of his I'd read. Not that it's difficult, but it's so much richer - you'll see many more facets of the jewel - if you've read Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, The Problem of Pain, The Four Loves, or Miracles. At least re-read this one after you've read some of them."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I first picked this book up as a child. My mom had read it in a course on C. S. Lewis in college, and remembered it as good, although she told me it was very confusing. Now, years later, after having read this fine novel a number of times, I would describe it not so much confusing as so multi-layered that the reader can get lost at first among them. This is not a failing, however, but a great strength that has made this novel very well received among critics and those who have read it. Unfortunately, relatively few people, including fans of Lewis' other works, have ever even heard of Till We Have Faces, much less read it.Why is this? Maybe some think it looks boring; just one more retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth, with perhaps a few twists, but essentially the tale we all learned in high school Greek mythology. This is far from the truth. C. S. Lewis uses the myth as a basis for exploring history, and issues ranging from God to family interactions to faith, and ultimately redemption. The story builds slowly throughout, and eventually gains so much emotional momentum that you feel simultaneously drained and uplifted when you finish the final page. If you want a novel that makes you think about more than superficial topics, and is in actuality highly original, then I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is a magnificently textured work, a tale of self-discovery and epiphany. The central character, Orual, is the ugly and seemingly unlovable daughter of a cruel monarch (her father hits her for sport and calls her 'goblin daughter'). She is loved, however, by a spiritual-emotional triumvirate: Psyche's compassion, the Fox's conscience, Bardia's courage. It's interesting that Lewis retells the Psyche myth from the point of view of the stepsister. Orual's perspective allows the reader to experience and question the things she does on an intimate level. Her journey matches that of many people who feel a sense of inadequacy and spiritual longing. Fox is her tutor and voice of reason, a captured Greek fond of quoting philosophy and giving lip service to the gods. He's the agnostic of Orual's life. Bardia, the captain of the guard, provides Orual with the skills to defend herself, allowing her to go from shrinking violet to warrior queen. Psyche is the true believer. She has seen the gods, but finds that convincing Orual is futile. Orual longs to be with the beautiful, but fears what she will find. Her belief is a forced one, a faith through fear, and therefore she can't see clearly what Psyche sees. It is not until the end of her life that she sees clearly: &quot;I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?&quot; This evokes the words of St. John, &quot;we know that, when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him just as He is.&quot;Lewis uses language the way it was meant. He eschews flowery prose; rather he conveys the complexity of emotions in a simple yet not simplistic fashion. He provides profundity and clarity both, not merely one to the exclusion of the other. The mysteries of the spiritual are always seen more deeply and clearly in great works of literature. Till We Have Faces is one of those works."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"When you pick up this book and begin reading, you might labor at first, trying to get through the beginning chapters, but then the story begins to grow on you and the more you read the more involved you become in what is unfolding. Lewis has a style that is patient, not premature as to move too quickly to the climax, but savoring all the details in order to develop, in the long run, a wonderfully elaborate and captivating tale.This book is a retelling of an all too famous mythological tale of love (between Cupid and Psyche). While Lewis adds his own spices, the story essentially remains the same. It is a tale of love, sadness, fascination of beauty, betrayal, regret, shame, depravity, and finally triumph. The story centers around two sisters, the older very ugly, and the younger, half-sister, very beautiful. Their father, a king, demonstrates his impatience at not having an heir (a son) and he (the father) torments his daughters for being just what they are, daughters. However, the eldest daughter, Orual, is very ugly in appearance, while the youngest daughter, Psyche, is the most beautiful in the whole region, and the story mainly centers around these two characters and what evolves into a tragedy and at the same time a triumph of decisions, emotions, thoughts, and actions (I don't want to give too much of the story away).Even though this is a story that has already been told, Lewis adds his own dimensions to it and gives it a refreshing type of life and vigor. If you are a fan of Lewis' writings then you will certainly enjoy this work. However, even if you have never read Lewis, you will still enjoy this masterful piece. Unfortunately, this piece from Lewis, has not received the attention and status as a great piece of literature that it deserves. This is an intense and very eloquent novel which is, I believe, one of the greatest of this century."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I've only read this book once. I devoured it, and now I am just waiting for some time in my crazy schedule to sit down, pick it up again, and let it seep into my soul.Lewis subtly carves the most blunt, honest questions of the human soul into the woodwork of this masterfully-retold Greek myth. On the first read, the plot will keep your attention. On the second, the text will veritably explode with parallels galore to the Christian life...indeed, to life itself. Not meant to be an all-encompassing theological expos&eacute;--just a long, gritty, detailed look into the human psyche and its relation to God.If you have ever questioned God; ever doubted his goodness; ever raged against him; ever endured Job-like terrors that he seems to do nothing about, this book is for you. If you wonder why he utters no answer, why he hints and hovers and never shows himself clearly--here is your commiseration. I hope you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I bought Till We Have Faces based only on a familiarity with the Narnia chronicals that I read as a kid. Knowing nothing of the &quot;classic myth of Cupid and Psyche&quot;, I let this book sit on my bookshelf for months before I opened it one rainy day. What a mistake! I was drawn in by Lewis' elegant, simple story of two sisters and how their relationship colors their lives. The plot and characterization are accessible to the casual reader, but the allegorical relationship to the ancient myth gives it deeper meaning. This is one of the rare novels which nourishes your soul while providing pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces was a fascinating and well-written book which explored the darker side of love. Telling the story of Psyche from the perspective of her sister Orual, the book plunges into the exploration of a jealousy caused not by hate, but by love. The author crafts his story skillfully, and in a gripping manner, leads the reader through a journey within to discover that it is often love, not hate, that is the most dangerous enemy of all to the human soul. In the classic story of Psyche, Psyche's two sisters ruin her life with the wind god because they are jealous of her beautiful palace and riches. It is the most obvious form of jealousy and that to which much that goes on in this world is attributed. Lewis uses this typical background story with typical motivations to expose a deeper, more complex motivation where the other is thought to be. Rather than jealous of Psyche because she is luckier than her sisters, Lewis shows Orual to be jealous for Psyche because of her great, undying love. In one sense, Orual is jealous not of Psyche, but of her husband, the wind god, because he has taken from her the one person she loved the most. The idea of jealousy when a loved one is taken away is common in literature. Yet typically, this jealousy arises from a more selfish standpoint in which it is not pure love only which causes the jealousy, but loved mixed with something else, such as dependency in the case of a lost parent, or lust in the case of a lover. Orual's love, on the other hand, is unaffected by such circumstances as these, and the jealousy that arises cannot justly be attributed to them. It is likely that Lewis chose to characterize her emotions thus in order to portray that it is not merely love combined with other emotions that can be dangerous, but that the purest, simplest form of love itself can be a deadly weapon of demise. It is because of Orual's deep rooted love for Psyche that she convinces her to betray her husband. Psyche's other sister Redival is jealous of her in the traditional sense - envious of her beauty and wonderful luck - but Lewis dismisses the power of this harmless, surface jealousy by leaving Redival out of the picture when Orual goes to visit Psyche in her new home. The most that Redival and the townspeople can to to hurt Psyche is to offer her up to the dark, mysterious goddess of the earth Ungit, as a sacrifice. While they do this with somewhat dubious intentions, the action, lacking the dangerous force of love, merely ends up benefitting Psyche, sending her to a higher plane of life with the gods. In contrast, Orual's pure love brings only misery and causes Psyche to fall from her life of ease and happiness with the god of wind. Psyche as a result loses her husband and is condemned to wander the earth for a period of time. Because of her love, Orual is the only one who has this power over Psyche, as she discovers near the end of the book. It is Orual, Psyche's best friend and biggest fan, who places the biggest roadblocks in her path to happiness and diety. Thus Lewis creates a picture in which the roles of hatred and love are reversed so that hatred brings Psyche closer to life with the gods while love draws her away from it. This picture exposes a very revealing attitude about the gods. Lewis, though Christian, creates a powerful and fascinating characterization of the polytheistic gods of the time of Greek and Roman myths. The gods Lewis uses in this story represent the different sides of human nature. Ungit, the main goddess whose influence is felt the most by the people of the kingdom, is characterized not by light, truth and goodness, but by darkness, formlessness, and hatred. She consumes rather than gives, and is jealous and greedy rather than altruistic and sacrificing. While the wind god and others draw kinder pictures of humanity, it is Ungit, representative of mankinds evil or dark side, that predominates. It is she, too, that demands the sacrifice of Psyche. However, it is because of this demand that Psyche is able to marry the god of the wind, and later to achieve the rank of a goddess herself. Thus evil propels Psyche higher and higher, while the wind god, representative of joy and love, serves to propel Psyche downward, ejecting her from his palace and forcing her to roam the earth in agony. However, a provision is made for Psyche's agony. Rather than falling on the innocent Psyche, Psyche's agonies are placed on the back of Orual, who feels the real pain in every instance. Thus the real danger of Orual's love is not to the one she loves, but to herself as she suffers vicariously every ill that befalls Psyche.Till We Have Faces is a complex book with many interpretations and levels of meaning. It is a book which requires a great deal of thought to delve into the inner motivations and intentions of the author. However, it is well worth the effort it requires. The story is gripping and I found myself within the first twenty pages unable to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a creative, fascinating, and deeply moving novel. It is one of the best books I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces is one of the greatest books I have ever read. It tricks the reader into sympathizing with the supposed oppressed. Then it rips out your heart as it shows that the oppressed is truly the oppressor. The real sting of it all is that it reveals the oppressor within each of us. Each of us is wrapped within the confines of our own experience. Each of us, like Lewis' Orual, tends to see only our own challenges. Each of us tends to most hurt the ones we love. Are we alert enough, focused enough on other's needs to live the truly &quot;good life?&quot;The greatness of Till We Have Faces is not that it hits us with a self-convicting surprise. Its greatness is in showing how prevalent the problem is. Even those of us with the greatest of intentions are infected by self-interest and sin. Read Till We Have Faces--it is a life-changing book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis seems to be giving the same message of Christian love in all of his literature, but he does it far more powerfully in 'Till We Have Faces' than in any of his other novels, essays, or poetry. 'Faces' is particularly effective because of its wide accessibility.The story is essentially a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, although no familiarity with the original story is required to enjoy the novel. Orual is the oldest--and by far the ugliest--of three princesses. Istra, or Psyche, is the youngest and most fair and pure. When Istra is married to the invisible and enigmatic God of the Mountain, son of Ungit, a powerful and jealous goddess, Orual finds herself unable to accept Istra's complacency with a life filled with comforts that are invisible and undetectable to anyone but Istra and her husband. She plots to destroy Istra's happiness, masking her true intentions behind a veil of sisterly concern much like she later veils her ugly face from the world.Orual is at once a remarkably unique character and an \\"everywoman.\\" She personifies the universal weaknesses of pride and possessiveness while tempering her negative qualities with a strong sense of justice, a confidence born of her veiled ugliness, and all the other attributes one would expect to find in a great queen. Orual's narrative is full of excuses, and all but the most hardened readers will be sorely tempted to listen to them. After all, this warrior queen is torn between the world of reason presented to her by her beloved Greek tutor and the dark, bloodthirsty religion of her pagan upbringing. It's hard to blame her for her uncertainty and manipulation of the innocent Istra. She rails against the gluttonous, possessive goddess Ungit while, at the same time, becoming Ungit herself as her jealousy and confusion over her sister's good fortune and happiness combines with her growing power to turn her into a minor goddess in her own right.The story is essentially about a convert to Christianity (Istra) who has found joy in something that simply doesn't seem to real to non-believers. Orual, who lacks her sister's faith, can not understand Istra's dedication to her invisible god. Eventually, Orual comes to see herself unveiled and naked at last. It is only then, as Istra sacrifices all to bring Orual the greatest possible gift, that the old queen understands the futility of her possessive love.This book is a beautiful and sometimes painful examination of what it means to truly love another person. Many readers will find themselves feeling ashamed after reading the book, yet longing to read in again at the same time. Lewis' oft repeated message rings so true (ironically in a story that takes place in a pre-Christian setting) in the pages of this, his greatest novel, that everyone, Christian or not, can appreciate its power."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C. S. Lewis has created a masterpiece in Till We Have Faces, the retelling of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. The first time I read it, I thought it was amazing but did not understand it. The second time I read it I thought it was perhaps the best book I had ever read because I did understand it. Lewis takes 1 Corinthians 13:12, \\" For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know fully even as also I was fully known,\\" and makes this his theme, masterfully weaving this theme into the story of Cupid and Psyche. Orual is the protagonist, the ugly sister of Psyche who is vilified in the traditional telling of the story. Lewis retells the story from her perspective, and through her questions about the justice of the gods are raised. In this book, Lewis rewrites in fiction what he wrote in the Problem of Pain, and in a much more eloquent mannor. Through Orual he asks the questions raised against Christianity and by Christians: why do bad things happen to me, where are the gods, why are the gods punishing me, etc. It is so well written that it is a great read even if you do not understand what Lewis is saying. It is all the better if you do.A good number of previous reviewers have glorified the fact that this is not as openly Christian as Lewis' Narnian Chronicles. I fail to see why this makes it so much of a better book. The reason that this book is better is not that it is not as Christian, but that it goes so much deeper into the questions of Christianity than his other books tend to (with some exceptions). It is not that he leaves off talking about Christianity, he simply approaches it from a different angle in this book. Most of what is said of the \\"gods\\" can be looked at as talking about \\"God.\\" He simply set his story in a polytheistic setting, so talk of the gods was necessary, and it would hardly do to have openly Christian conversations when the setting is way before the life of Christ.Lewis said that he deemed this to be his greatest work. I am very inclined to agree with him.Overall grade: A+"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I find myself recommending this work more than any other of Lewis' fiction. It is a painting of general revelation, where Lewis builds on the ideas within The Last Battle, where a character who has always worshipped the demon god Tash finds that he so loved Tash with true love, that he was actually worshipping Aslan, whom he never personally met. In Till We Have Faces, Lewis looks at how someone could come to Christ who lived at the time of the Israeli kings, far to the North, in a country where the protagonist, Orual, could not possibly know anything of the Judeo-Christian tradition. It is two love stories in one, building on the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, to explore how Jesus woos us to love Him with all that we are- each in different ways, in a personal relationship.The book is mythic in style, and the beginning has a feel of timelessness and legend. Orual and her sister, Psyche, grow up together, learning about the ways that men objectify and treat women based on their appearance- for a woman, appearance is everything in the eyes of their society. (Somewhat familiar.) And then Psyche finds a mysterious man, that Orual knows nothing of.Through the wooing of the mysterious stranger, Orual and her sister Psyche learn to more fully love others. And because of the focus on female characters, this is some of Lewis' most feminist work- strong female characters who think and develop and become complete, and completely heroic."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"A beautiful retelling of the famous Greek myth; I reread this one every other year or so and am constantly surprised with new insights on each new reading."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I purchased this book to read it for the first time. It was wonderful, like all of the other works of Lewis that I have been able to read. I found myself thinking, even as I was reading it, that it would deserve a second visit. The story itself is very intriguing, but Lewis intends to communicate a lot about how we can know truth.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The first time I read this book, it entranced me. To put it tritely, &quot;I could not put it down.&quot; This book is amazingly enchanting, though can seem a bit obtuse. I confess, I had to re-read it before I began to understand the point. You will find yourself discovering new facets of the story each time you read it, which I have done several times. It is a piercingly beautiful story, written with Lewis' clear, sharp talent."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This truly is a &quot;Myth Retold&quot; as the subtitle indicates.Lewis uses the greek myths addressed as a beginning and acontext for the story line of _Till We Have Faces_.I found Lewis' early shortstories to be compelling, butlacking the polish of his Christian allegories and apologetics.In _Till We Have Faces_, he brings together the inventiveskill he shows in his shorter works and the refinement of hisbest work.The story is a wonderful look into identity and reality.It is one of the few works of fiction I have read that havecrawled inside my head and changed the way I see the world.Unlike most of his other works, this book only brieflyalludes to Jesus Christ. In fact many conservative ortraditional Christians might object to the slight mentionof it in a story about gods and goddesses, fate and theeternal soul."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"'Till We Have Faces' is a retelling of the Cupid / Psyche story from Greek mythology. Wikipedia gives a nice run-down on the myth, but it's a bit long...Super short version: A king sacrifices his youngest and most beautiful daughter, Psyche, to the gods by leaving her chained to a tree high on a mountain. She is rescued by the gods and becomes the wife of Cupid, Venus' son, although Psyche doesn't know at the beginning who her new husband is. She only sees him at night and is forbidden to look at him. Her sisters come to see her in her new home and convince Psyche that because she is forbidden to see him, there must be something wrong with her husband. They give Psyche a lamp, and tell her to light it one night while he is sleeping. She does this and sees that she is indeed married to a god, but because she has broken her pact with him, he abandons her. Psyche then is forced to undergo all kinds of trials before she is allowed to become a goddess herself and be reunited with Cupid.I just finished listening to this in audio-book form. The C.S. Lewis version of the myth is told from the point of view of Psyche's older sister, the one who gave Psyche the lamp. I almost gave this a 4 star rating, because as a story it has a lot of strengths -- Lewis always has been able to paint other places and people vividly, which is what I love about his writing. He creates some really interesting characters in this story, and there is a wonderful vagueness at times over whether the things Psyche has experienced are supernatural or not (yes, they are). It was interesting to look at the events through the somewhat skeptical eyes of Psyche's possessively protective older sister, Orual. The whole book is centered around Orual's growth as a person, and her realization that her urge to protect Psyche did not come from love, but from jealousy and selfishness. When Psyche is abandoned by Cupid, the god appears to Orual and tells her, \\"You are both Psyche.\\" At the end of the book we see that while Psyche has been set with many difficult challenges, she has been able to face these challenges with a light heart, because Orual has held the weight of sorrow for the two of them. I thought that was a really creative twist. What disappoints me is that we really don't get to see Psyche's side of the story, except briefly in Orual's dreams. While Orual is a character with a lot of depth, the sadness of her personal life makes the story drag at times. If indeed she and her sister are the same, it would be nice to experience some of Psyche's challenges as well -- If only to experience a little less melancholy and a little more action."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Lewis' tale is a reworking of the Psyche and Cupid mythology. I'm not familiar with that myth so reading this novel was a fresh experience. Psyche in NOT the main character in this tale. Instead Lewis has made Orual, the eldest of the three princesses of Glome, the heroine. I think this is a sensible choice because Orual certainly made a more sympathetic, accessible heroine than Psyche who seems too perfect. Psyche is extremely beautiful and graceful, a virtuous woman, and superior in almost every way than most women, including Orual. Orual is a rational, thinking woman who happens to be rather ugly. She is called a goblin by her brutish father, the King of Glome.Orual is educated by a Greek slave named \\"the Fox.\\" The Fox has immense influence on Orual and gives her fire to make her case or accusation against the gods. Orual's most joyous times were when her beloved Psyche, the Fox, and herself were together learning, studying, and observing nature. Those times were soon cut short.Because of her undesirable face, Orual is fated to remain a virgin throughout her life. But she wouldn't complain all that much about that cruelty if it weren't for losing Psyche. The goddess Ungit (Venus), jealous of Psyche's beauty, demands that Psyche be sacrificed to the brute. Orual is in total despair over her beloved Psyche, whom she considers as a daughter. Orual is driven to do things that end up making life worse for Psyche. This drives her to writing this accusation against the gods.Bardia, a captain of the guards, teaches Orual fighting and riding skills. Soon enough, Orual finds herself in love with the already-married Bardia. Orual decides to veil her face at all times after losing Psyche, and she finds that this veiling grants her more respect and a sort of power over people.The fighting skills she has learned come in handy later when her father becomes incapacitated, and the throne is turned over to Orual. She quickly becomes the renowned, veiled Warrior Queen, deadly in combat and strategy. Her improvements to the kingdom are numerous, as she is wise and depends on loyal and faithful counselors, mainly the Fox and Bardia.The ending is a bit bizarre, what with the visions Orual has and her accusation against the gods finally being heard by the assembly. However, the ending does tie up some loose-ends and gives the story the mythical quality of the original tale.Lewis does an excellent job of portraying this story through the eyes of the sad but not pathetic Orual. She comes into her own in a big way, despite her aesthetic shortcomings, by becoming the \\"most wise, just, valiant, fortunate, and merciful\\" ruler of Glome."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I recently read Till We Have Faces again, having read it with disappointment over a decade ago when I was still in high school. After my first reading I sold or gave away my copy of the book, thinking I would never desire to read it again. I'm glad I changed my mind and gave it a second shot. It is a gripping tale which probes deep into the soul as it explores the destructive fruits of self-centered love and the need for reality in facing the deformities in our own souls. I couldn't put it down and plan to read it again in the future. Needless to say, I will hang on to this copy . . ."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Masterfully written, by a man who knew how to write and keep the attention of his readers. This myth retold, created by C.S. Lewis, has both the sensitivity and power to give the reader a true sense of all that's taking place in the story, pulling them into the plot and giving them both an internal, and external view of all that goes on. In the beginning, a woman begins her story of growth, renewal, worship, confusion, and eventual success in finding whom she, and those around her truly are. The setting is a barbarous land, where the people worship various gods, and offer sacrifices to them, devoting their lives and themselves to images and ideas they truly don't understand. But, Lewis is able to put a twist into the tale, helping it to come around in such a way that many of the more endearing qualities and characteristics favored by the Christian world are brought into play by the various characters. Orual, a princess, and the teller of the tale stands at center stage, guiding us through the thickening plot as we journey into a different land and time. With a masterful hand Lewis uses his descriptive language, and the very actions of the people around Orual to help give the reader and understanding of who she is and at what age she is, so they can then gain an understanding of what it is that is truly going in the tale. Small details, used in unison with general understandings help bring vivid images to the mind of the reader, showing them all that is taking place. One of my favorite things about the tale is the very manner Lewis uses his words to bring out emotion in his characters. All of us have experienced the same ranges of emotion he depicts in Orual, her beautiful sister Psyche, her tyrannous father, and all the rest. Precision of word and use of language help to paint a clear picture of Orual as she grows, gaining experience in all the aspects of life she will need as she later becomes the Queen and ruler of her kingdom. We are told of beggars and peasants coming to the gates of the castle, begging for the princess Psyche to come out and touch them, believing she is a goddess and can heal them of their sicknesses because of her unimaginable beauty; the human offering that must be made to the god of the grey mountain to end the drought that has plagued the land; and the powerful god who falls in love with the beautiful Psyche, building for her a heavenly mansion that her loving sister cannot see. Of the greatest qualities of the tale is its ability to help the reader see how confusing the thoughts and feelings of man can be, and how easy it is for anyone to avoid the truths in their lives as they pad the pain they have felt with excuses and scapegoats. We are shown the very deepest of thoughts and feelings come into play through the decisions and actions of those in the tale, and we are also shown the truth that compels those thoughts and feelings. Till We Have Faces is a literary accomplishment, written by a man who has had many. The power of the tale he tells, and the deep perspectives he shares about the very essence of who we are is very much worth the time invested to read it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"There are few books in the world that make you pause, which leave you breathless and strangely still. This retelling of the famous Greek myth explores the deeper layers beneath our daily masks to the darker underbellies of ourselves that we dare not share even with ourselves.

Once I began to read I was totally pulled in. Could not put it down. There were so many things that spoke to me about my own spiritual journey. There a few typos in the kindle version but I got past those pretty easily.Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Two books in one. Till We Have Faces is divided into two \\"books\\" representing the protagonist Orual's movement from the logic of Greece to the metaphysical realm of the gods. Based on the myth of Psyche, the first Book outlines Orual's journey from ugly sister to righteous queen in Lewis's own doggerel medieval English. Book Two recounts Orual's visions and her quest for a true face, written in a profoundly metaphorical yet almost tactile description of mystical experience. Two books for two sisters, two states of being, two kinds of love. What makes Lewis so special is the way he persistently locates and beautifully depicts a kind of overlap, a special domain free of the duality that structures his novel and haunts the West. Allegory is the calculus of his special unified field, especially the extended allegory that is book two, in which Lewis describes the metaphysical and physical as one inseparable reality. It's breathtaking--almost worth slogging through the 250 pages of leaden prose better known as Book One. Maybe this is further proof that sacrifice is necessary for salvation. Or maybe Lewis just writes better allegorical fantasy than historical fiction."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is truly one of the most moving and epic stories I have ever read. Orual and Psyche can come to represent any one of us in our everyday lives. A journey of moral development, coping with jealousy, and sibling love and rivalry. This is possibly the greatest of Lewis's works. Anyone who has read The Lord of the Rings or The Chronicles of Narnia is sure to love Till We Have Faces"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Save for the science fiction trilogy, this was Lewis's only venture into adult fiction, and he considered it his best work. Unfortunately, reviews at the time were tepid, and, daunted, he did not try again. This is a shame, as the novel is a brilliant read, and should acquire classic status. The story is told by Orual, Psyche's ugly sister, and it is her voice, at once erudite and lucid, that lends the novel its charm and power. Lewis made one mistake: he added a section at the end tying the novel closer to the myth. The first section forms a perfect whole. My advice: read the second section once, but discard it on subsequent readings."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I have now read this book about ten times.

Of all the books I have read thus far, I believe \\"Till We Have Faces\\" the most poignant and the most profound. C.S. Lewis uses the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche as a basis for his tale of two sisters, one guiltless and beautiful, the other good but ugly of face. He employs their lives as an allegory of the incarnation and sacrifice of Christ to answer the timeless question of why God allows bad things to happen to good people.Superficially, \\"Till We Have Faces\\" is a grave and at times grim fairytale of the sister princesses Orual and Istra in the dark primeval kingdom of Glome. The book is constructed as the complaint of the homely Orual (who comes to represent a virtuous, but flawed mankind) against the gods for the sorrows of her life.Through the embittered Orual coming to see her own selfishness of heart and how futile it is to try to fathom the designs of the divine with mere mortal reasoning, Lewis does not belittle human sorrow or suffering in comparison to the greatness of God, but rather attempts to represent salvation as a power to heal the deepest wounds and the greatest sorrows."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Orual,the least beautiful of the princesses in the kingdom seems as if she uses the Golden Rule throughout the book.

Lewis was endowed with a natural ability to tell tales. Whether they were fictitious or true, he was always able to convey his ideas clearly, through characters and ideas, such as in Till We Have Faces. Throughout the story, we are introduced to multiple characters which, when analyzed, are seen to have a foil of some form or another in the story. Lewis cleverly wove these characters to represent the opposing ideas and concepts of the main character, Oural. One such example of this were the characters of the Fox, and Bardia. The Fox was in fact an intellectual Greek who was sold to the King of Gloam, and raised Oural from childhood through adolescence. While rearing her, he consistently invited her to not only to questioning everything, but to analyze life's occurrences, and search for some logical explanation as to their purpose or makeup. The Fox not only created, but represented the logical portion of Oural's thinking, while Bardia was the exact opposite. Bardia was a warrior and a devout follower of his heart. He believed that supernatural forces did exist, and that there were some things in this world that were never intended to be explained. Both of these extremes would come to play a critical role when Oural convinced Psyche, her younger sister, to confirm the identity of her new found husband. The logical portion of Oural told her that her sister was in fact married to a thief who was using her for her &quot;natural attributes,&quot; while her emotional portion told her that her, from the back recesses of her mind, that Psyche was in fact wed to a god. Once Oural discovered that Psyche had been married to a god all along, it is her emotional portion that kept her strong, when her logic failed. The use of the external characters to not only explain how Oural attained her qualities, but as examples of such was pure genius on the part of Lewis. Oural's struggle as to how to deal with the situation only became more evident in her sidestepping and/or outright lying to the Fox and Bardia as to what truly happened on the mountain that fateful evening.Lewis also created a simply brilliant contrast as to what beauty truly is. Psyche was, as described by the story, to be among the most enchanting and beautiful creatures to ever grace the Earth. She was even so radiant that the public of Gloam even began to worship her as a goddess. Her outward beauty was unmatched save only her inner beauty. While in sharp contrast, Oural was in fact quite an ugly individual. The King even told her on one occasion, that to strike her in the face would only be an improvement. Oural, because of this &quot;curse,&quot; was never given much if any love as a child. Oddly enough, once she veiled herself, after Psyche disappeared on the mountain, and proved herself to be a noble queen the people began to see her as beautiful. The citizens of Gloam even believed that she was so beautiful beneath her veil, that to show anyone, would place all others in a distant second. Lewis purposely created Psyche to be so perfect, that we, as readers, would naturally withdraw ever so slightly from her as she represented that which is unattainable for mortals - perfection. While he created Oural with realistic qualities (the opposing physical traits), illustrating that true beauty does emanate from within, and that even physical shortcomings can be muted by dedication, love, and a pleasant demeanor. It is this contrast of beauty and representation of personalities that made this work so enjoyable to me, and will hopefully for you as well."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S.

The citizens of Gloam even believed that she was so beautiful beneath her veil, that to show anyone, would place all others in a distant second. Lewis purposely created Psyche to be so perfect, that we, as readers, would naturally withdraw ever so slightly from her as she represented that which is unattainable for mortals - perfection. While he created Oural with realistic qualities (the opposing physical traits), illustrating that true beauty does emanate from within, and that even physical shortcomings can be muted by dedication, love, and a pleasant demeanor. It is this contrast of &quot;beauty&quot; and representation of personalities that made this work so enjoyable to me, and will hopefully for you as well."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"To say the least, I throughly the book Till We Have Faces. It was a book that once started could not be put down until I had finished - I actually read the entire book in two days. It is set in mythological times, and tells the story of Cupid and Psyche from a different perspective. I enjoyed the book for many reasons. The first was for the exciting storyline and great action - this was the main reason I couldn't put it down. I was completely caught up in the adventurous life of Orual, and those surrounding her. There was never a dull moment - new issues and episodes would always arise to keep my interest. The book is definitely successful in keeping the reader interested. The second, and the more important reason this book was good is because many lessons can be learned from the message it puts forth. Even though the setting is not in our times, many parts of the book can be applied to life today. Throughout the book the characters were very easy to relate with. This was the main reason applications to life could be drawn from the story. Orual, the main character, went through the most amount of change. Changing characters are the easiest to relate to because our lives and perspectives are constantly changing. As the book progresses from start to finish, we see different parts of Orual's character revealed. Her relationship with the Fox, Physhe, Bardia, and her father are all revealing to her character. The Fox helps her learn many lessons, and causes Orual to grow. He was captured from Greece and forced to become a slave in her fathers house. He was assigned to be Orual and Redevil's tutor. As the story progresses the Fox and Orual grow closer and become great friends. They even work together after her father dies. Orual learns to trust from this relationship. From her relationship with Phyche, Orual learns other important lessons. Phyche is the child of one of her father's wives. When it is found out that she is a girl, her father doesn't want anything to do with her Orual takes her under her wing and learns to love in an almost motherly way. It even gets to the point that she loves Phyche too much - she was willing to do anything for her. Her love for this child, her half sister, shape most of her life. In the story Bardia is the king's best helper. As the story progresses Orual comes to be in contact with him more and more. They grow to be great friends and they work together a majority of the time. She is forced to learn the bounds of this relationship, and in the end hurts much because of this. Orual never marries, and her relationship with Bardia is the closest she gets to experiencing this. Orual's father was king of the land. He was busy all the time with important matters, and he had a violent temper. Growing up, Orual knew that her father didn't love her. He made it plain to her that she was ugly and that he didn't think anything would come of her life. This helped Orual in more ways than it hurt her. She pushed away from him, turned to the Fox, and made something of her life just to spite him. The relationship helped her grow even though it wasn't a very healthy one. There were many other things that influenced Orual and caused her to change but these were just a few. Her relationships with others did most of the revealing. It made me think of how I relate to others, what I learn from them, and how I change. It provided a new perspective and I was very glad I had the opportunity to read the book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This is one of the more difficult books by C.S.

I just finished it and I don't have words to describe the power Lewis' symbolism has. His language, word choice and the message are amazing. Read it...you'll love it."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C. S. Lewis' novel Till We Have Faces is highly thought provoking. It is a remake of the Greek myth about Psyche and Cupid. The tale is told from the perspecitve of Orual, the sister of Psyche. It involves her inner struggles over love and loss. Orual is pitifully ugly. She is told so from the day that she understands what the word means. In contrast, her younger sisters, Redival and Psyche, are beautiful. She must deal with the daily comparisons that are made between them. She tries to distance herself from jealousy, but the reader can see how close to the line she actually treads. On the surface, her actions seem to portray unconditional love for Psyche. Yet as the story progresses, the reader becomes puzzled by the strange love that Orual shows Psyche. Orual is near homicide in her love. For example, Orual goes to search out Psyche on the mountain (an act of love), yet when she finds her and realizes her happiness she can't control herself (jealousy). She seems to be upset that Psyche, who once worshipped her, was now subject to a new &quot;lord.&quot; Orual cannot stand the competition for Psyche's love. Unconditional love would place Orual is ecstasy that her Psyche is so happy. That leaves the reader with the question &quot;Is pure love peaceful or stormy?&quot; The story also shows Orual's struggles to reach perfection. She constantly compares herself to people that she deems perfect and imperfect. This tempest that is beating in Orual's mind adds the question, &quot;What is perfection, and how does one achieve it?&quot; As the tale progresses and she gets older, Orual realizes that perfection has nothing to do with outer beauty, but rather inner beauty and the works that a person performs during his or her life. She discovers that all her life she has been searching for something that has always been inside her. The story is easy to read, but the symbolism is hard to decipher. The second book is also quite confusing. It is in this book that the psychological aspects of the tale are brought out. The whole story is rounded off in this section. I liked the book and would recommend it, but with a warning. It is easy reading, but if one is trying to analyze the text in depth, he or she must do just that. The reader must dig down deep in the heart of the story to understand it completely. I don't think that it is a normal work for C. S. Lewis. The meaning in it is different than that of the Chronicles of Narnia. I don't think that this book was specifically written for children, as was the Chronicles of Narnia. I found the book powerful and inspirational. If we could all realize in the beginning of our lives what it took Orual an entire lifetime to realize, we would lead happier and more productive lives. We would be satisfied with our talents and ourselves. In this way, the world would hopefully become a better place in which to live."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"probably one of the most incredible books that I've ever read. Read most of his works, but this one is incisive and piercing every time I revisit the agony of reality it presents. &quot;Lekhem panim&quot; in hebrew refers to the bread of G-d's presence, but literally translated is &quot;bread of faces&quot; and resides in the Holy Place. Something that we need for the nourishment of our souls, and CS Lewis is definitely the consumate baker."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"C.S. Lewis is one of the most amazing writers of our time. He tells this story with haunting descriptions and a raw honestly. No aspect of a charecter is hidden. This is an amazing book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I had read many C. S. Lewis books before this one, so I was expecting it to be a pretty good book. I was surprised, though, with how much his writing style had changed from his other books. I felt like I wasn't reading a book at all, but rather was being told the story. It was more of a tale, than a novel.The difference for me between a good book and a nice story is what happens after you put the book down. After reading a nice story, we immediately go about other business. A good book will make you think all the way through it, and even after you've put it down. A good book will help you discover things about yourself that you didn't know, or hadn't realized. That is what Till We Have Faces did for me. I found as I was reading, that I had acted in the past more like Orual than I wanted to. I struggled with her character because it was such an accurate reflection of the way that I had seen things. I have changed since then, but it was amazing how C. S. Lewis was able to portray a character that was so well-thought out and so accurate.The book is neither easy reading, nor hard reading. It is somewhere in between. At first glance, the book seems like it would be as easy to read as a child's book, but with all of the description, imagery, thoughts, feelings, and emotion that Lewis put into it, you can't help but slow down. There is so much more going on than the story alone would denote. There is the conflict with Orual and others, the conflict between Orual and herself, and finally- and you only get this in good books-the conflict between Orual and the reader. I don't often find myself making vocal comments to fictional characters, but I did several times during the course of the book. With every little nuance of character that Lewis puts in this novel, you'll want to do yourself a favor and allow time for reflection.Maybe the greatest part about this book-and this can be said of all great literary works-is that every time you are going to get something different out of it. It addresses so many topics that you could probably spend a whole college course just identifying and talking about what each one says. You might barely scratch the surface even then. This time I was focused on Orual's jealousy at losing what she felt was her rightful possession, the next time it may not be.The approach that Lewis decided to take with the story was an interesting one. In the original myth of Psyche and Cupid, Psyche's sisters (Orual and Redival) see their sister's happiness and the life that she lives, and they want to destroy it all because they don't want her to be better than them. It is simply a matter of pride. Lewis takes a different route, though. In Till We Have Faces, Redival isn't even really part of the story and Orual's jealousy of Psyche's happiness is not motivated by hate, but by love. Orual raised Psyche almost as her own daughter and loved her with all her heart. But, she can't stand the idea of Psyche being loving anyone but herself. Throughout almost the entire book, Orual justifies her selfishness by placing herself as the victim. This was an interesting choice by Lewis because we, as humans, often do the same. Orual is so convinced that anything good for her is good for Psyche, that she practically destroys all happiness that Psyche has. Selfish motivations blind her into believing that she is doing Psyche a favor by destroying her marriage to the god on the Grey mountain. Orual uses every kind of manipulative technique throughout the book to get what she wants. She not only destroys Psyche's life, but everyone who surrounds her, including herself. Orual commits the biggest sin when she lies to herself, telling herself that she's doing all of this for her sister, that her sister could be making the biggest mistake of her life, and that Psyche's happiness is foolish. Orual is dripping with the &quot;if only she could see things the way I do, the right way&quot; attitude. It makes me sick, but mostly because as I stated above, it hits so close to home. Any book that can bring emotions out of you as strongly as it did to me is either a literary masterpiece or a piece of trash. I promise you that this book is the former, and not the latter.I can't say I was pleased with the whole book, though. It is broken up into two parts. The first takes up about 9/10 of the book, and the second only 1/10. In the second part, Orual pretty much redeems herself for all the evil and sinful deeds she's done throughout the previous 250 pages. To me, this ending was completely unsatisfactory. It turns Orual into a hero, sets everything right. I didn't buy it for too reasons. One, it was way too easy. Orual's penance in no way made up for the horrible things she'd done. And two, it was a little to abstract for me. It didn't match the first section of the book, but was all dreams and visions. The second part let me down. I would have liked an ending based a little more in reality. I just couldn't relate to the second part.The second part notwithstanding, it was a great book. A good investment of time for anyone I would say. It's not perfect, but it doesn't pretend to be. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a very thought-provoking good book. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This books is amazing. It offers faith to the sceptic and traces Lewis' own path of belief. It follows the reader through so many stages of trust and religion. It lies at the core of Lewis and will lie at the core of you."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"For all C.S.Lewis fans this book is a 'must-read'. The story really draws you in and you feel you are really living in the harsh olden-times in which this book is set. The book finishes in typical C.S.Lewis fashion with a 'happy-ever-after' Christian theme. There is a strong Christian thread in the 2nd-half of the book, but it is more like an historical myth in the first half. There is a magic and a wonder about the story which shows Lewis at his best. The heroine of the book is made to see her motives for what they really were and herself as she really is, but everything works out well at the very end!"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I love this book even though the ending confused the heck out of me. C.s. Lewis did a great job of retelling this myth i had not heard of this myth befor until i got to the end of the book where the author tells you about the real tale and how he changed it he did a great deal the tale and he changed it for the good wich made the whole character change and gave her a different out look throughout the whole story in the real myth the main feelings of the character was jealousy twards her sister psyche and in the myth retold the feelings of jealousy arent twards her sister Psyche she feels anger twards her sister at times and she feels that her sister does not lover her anymore because she wont come home to her. This tale has many twists turns ups and downs like a roller coaster and if you miss something you might not get certain parts of the book. I still think I need to read it again. I hope this might of helped and I hope that you enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"This book is extremely hard/boring to read.

Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"It is generally agreed among students of Lewis's works that, while _Perelandra_ is preferable on an emotional favorite (and Lewis's personal favorite), _Till We Have Faces_ is his masterpiece, and that the author himself thought so. There is a clear development in style, symbolism, and thought from _The Pilgrim's Regress_, Lewis's first book after his conversion, to _Till We Have Faces_, his last work of fiction (with the exception of a novel fragment and a few short stories). It demonstrates the deep influence of his wife, Joy Davidman, and the deep understanding of love which Lewis gained from their relationship. He always said that he wrote stories based on &quot;pictures&quot; he saw in his head, and books on Lewis report that he said the pictures stopped coming after Joy's death. The book is deeply psychological, and the three sisters in the story are representative of Plato's Tripartite Soul: Orual, the narrator, is the _Logos_ or the reason; Psyche is the _Thumos_, or the passions; and Redival is the _Bios_ or the animalistic passions. There is some historical reference to Henry VIII and Elizabeth I (Lewis's professional speciality was the Renaissance, and he wrote a text on _Sixteenth Century English Literature, Excluding Drama_). The book is based upon Apuleius' _Metamorphoses_, but adds a Christian level to the story. Like _The Space Trilogy_, it illustrates Lewis's belief, taken from St. Augustine's _City of God_, that the gods (small &quot;g&quot; is important) are not supreme beings, and are not incompatible with the God of monotheism. They are equivalent to angels and demons. So, in _Till We Have Faces_, the kingdom worships one major goddess, Aphrodite (standing for God the Father), her Son, Cupid (representing Christ), and a third figure embodied by the Wind (the Holy Spirit). The tree on which Psyche is sacrificed (&quot;the Blessed must be the Accursed&quot; -- the most holy person takes on the sins of the people). The other characters represent various influences: the King is the masculine stereotype"},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retoldis the most novelistic of the many books by C. S. Lewis. But don't expect it to satisfy on that level. All of Lewis' fiction is an allegorical exploration of man's relationship to God. Till We Have Faces deals particularly with the question of why God seems so distant.The story is a carefully crafted version of the Greek myth of Psyche, a mortal woman who has a difficult romance with the god Eros. The point of view is that of a homely sister, Orual, who is consumed by unrecognized jealously at being ignored (as she supposes) by the gods. Over time, experience develops in her an independent spirit - a \\"face\\" of her own - that qualifies her to converse with God.I enjoyed this book much more 30 years ago, when the pleasant narrative and the dream-fantasy sequences were enough to carry the allegory. But in my latest reading, the relatively weak characterization and the lack of real challenge in the protagonist's life detracts from the effect.I respect C. S. Lewis highly as a clear-minded Christian theologian. But like princess Orual, his life experience was hardly rich enough to support the weight of his message."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"The book we ordered was in good condition and I would purchase from this vender again."},{"Title":"Till we have faces: A myth retold","review":"I was assigned to read this book for an intensive wrinting course at brigham young university. Needless to say i wasn't very excited about the assignment. It seemed like high school all over again, and besides, i was still trying to finish &quot;King Lear&quot; by shakespeare. and i'm still struggling to finish it. But anyways, &quot;Till we have faces&quot; was a great book. I'm sure you don't want me to ruin the book for you, but i'll tell you that it was a great story, taken from the greek myth about psyche and cupid (if you haven't read the greek myth, you're still okay, and you won't get lost in the story). But the novel is about two sisters (they have a third, but she isn't important). One of the sisters is really ugly, and the other is beautiful. the town has a plague, and the beautiful daughter is to be the sacrifice for the plague to go away. so they decided to sacrifice her. Lots of things happen after that regarding the beautiful sister (psyche) and the ugly sister (orual). Orual eventually becomes the queen of the land and she's a good queen, does lots of wonderful things, but eventually she decides to write down her life story when she's very old. so she does. but eventually Lewis has to end the book (maybe he was tired) so orual dies, and the story's over. If you want to know the details of the book, you're just gonna have to read it yourself, because i don't want to ruin it by telling to much, because i'm afraid i already have, although i hope i haven't really. So that's the book, buy it, read it, and ENJOY IT.

Lewis has created an entertaining, thought provoking reinterpretation of the Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche. The myth, in his hands, becomes a Christian parable and an apologia for a transcendent god who remains unseen and unheard. Like his friend, J.R.R. Tolkien, I cordially dislike allegory. He has some interesting things to say about selfish love and authenticity, but the story drips with self-conscious wisdom and profundity.

With no archaeological evidence whatsoever to explore, he embarks on his journey to learn about Abraham by interviewing members of various faiths, and finds himself enmeshed in a bewildering array of legends and claims. Abraham begins life as a polytheist in Ur, but is called by a foreign god, Yahweh, to journey to a new land. The promise by this strange god? \\"All the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you.\\" Various passages in the Bible retain echoes of this polytheism; Abraham is a transitional figure, with a foot in both worlds.In this new land, two sons are born to Abraham, and God asks Abraham to sacrifice one of them as a test of his faith. So diverse are the legends about Abraham that there is not even agreement over which son is the requested sacrifice, but the Biblical account favors Isaac. This sacrifice--of whichever son--plays a major role in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Feiler writes, \\"Considering that I set out in search of what I thought was one Abraham at the heart of all three faiths, I was amazed by how much time I spent trying to figure out when one religion's Abraham ended and another began.The Jewish religion appears to have seniority. \\"Long before Christians and Muslims set about reinterpreting Abraham, early Jews were the first to perform reconstructive surgery on their purported father.\\" Feiler describes how the Israelites set about codifying their Bible, gathering and recording oral stories. Suddenly, Israel had scripture that described their ancestors, but what difference did that make? They still needed to make that text relevant to their lives. They needed midrash. Qumran provides excellent examples of Jewish midrash, and how Abraham was molded into their image.Some years later, Christians entered the scene. In Paul's fourteen letters, he refers to Abraham nineteen times, more than any other figure except Jesus. But the idea that Abraham belongs to all humanity, which appears at least in spirit in Paul's letters, soon begins to dissipate. Matthew traces Jesus' lineage through Isaac to Abraham. God's sacrifice of his Son is compared directly to Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham, says John, knew about Jesus thousands of years before Jesus was born. Abraham has been appropriated to the Christian side.Hundreds of years later, Muslims trace their relevancy through Abraham's other son, Ishmael. Ibn Kathir accuses Jews of dishonesty and slander, claiming they introduced Isaac into the story, even though the Bible says Abraham went to sacrifice his only son, his favored son. For Muslims, Ishmael was the favored son, so he was the one Abraham took to sacrifice. As Feiler interviews a Muslim leader, he is told, \\"Abraham is the father of one religion, and that religion is Islam.\\" \\"So what will happen to me?\\" Feiler asked. \\"You'll die,\\" came the answer.Thoroughly rattled, Feiler retreats. His book has become something entirely different than what he set out to write.(please follow the link below for further discussion of this topic)[...]"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This was a great book to read.

It would never have occurred to me to read so much into Abraham and Bruce Feiler has made an academic 'chase' very accessible to the lay person. Whether you are Jewish, Christian or Muslim, I am sure you would enjoy this."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"As I continue my reading to gain better insight into today's conflict with Islamists, I felt it would help to delve into the common roots of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This book came into view and looked to be a good step in that direction. In fact, it appears to be the very reason Feiler wrote it. \\"My experience in the region persuaded me that it's possible-maybe even necessary-to gain insight into a contemporary situation by turning away from the present and looking back to its historical source. Especially in matters of faith, even the most modern act is informed by centuries of intermingled belief, blood, and misunderstanding. And in that conflagration, as it has for four millennia, one name echoes behind every conversation. One figure stands at the dawn of every subsequent endeavor. One individual holds the breadth of the past-and perhaps the dimensions of the future-in his life story. Abraham.\\" (9)This book is part travelogue and part self-awakening. Feiler explores the role of Abraham-part myth, part oral history-in the growth of the three great monotheistic religions.He uses an airy, enthusiastic style that bespeaks wonderment and excitement at every step of the way. Unfortunately, Feiler often displays a pendulum-like tendency towards hyperbole that is distracting. For example, he refers to Abraham at one point as \\"the Albert Einstein of his day\\" (28). In another section he compares Abraham's life to a three-act Hollywood play (70). Incredibly, he goes on to say God was acting \\"against [His] natural instincts\\" in this play. This is an amazing statement that bespeaks a presumed, but inappropriate, familiarity with Him. Sometimes I got the sense that Feiler just likes to hear himself talk.Still, there are interesting insights along the way-the root meaning of \\"Arab\\" (21) and the symbolism of male circumcision (68), for example. Also, Muhammad's vision (Islam) stems directly and deliberately from the Jewish interpretation of biblical history (76). Particularly interesting, \\"Abraham, I was discovering, is not just a gentle man of peace. He's as much a model for fanaticism as he is for moderation...[B]y elevating such conduct to the standard of piety, he stirred in his descendants a similar desire to lash out, to view pain as an arm of belief, and to use brutality to advance their vision of a divine-centered world.\\" (108). His discussion helps to explain religious fanaticism and the willingness of some (unfortunately, far too many these days) for martyrdom.Feiler touches on the roots of the enmity between the followers of these religions, but I found his discussion lacking. A few examples pretty well sum up his view: Early, proto-Christians saw the Jews as having \\"corrupted the Temple...abandoned the poor, and blasphemed the laws of purity\\" (138). \\"Church fathers saw in the misfortune of the Jews more evidence of their own triumph and a vindication for their claim to be the true kingdom of Israel\\" (152). \\"Pious Muslims continue to see the Koran as the unfiltered word of God, which is one reason for the devotion it elicits. There is no third-person narrative in the Koran. God speaks directly in all of the text's six thousand two hundred verses\\" (165). \\"Islamic midrash, know as tafsir, is considered harsher toward Jews than toward Christians, largely because of the political circumstances during the prophet's lifetime\\" (174). \\"For Muslims...Islam didn't supersede Christianity and Judaism, it preceded them. Islam, in fact, was the faith of Abraham, which his descendants twisted for their own purposes\\" (176). He provides glimmers of the underlying friction, but they don't go far enough.I had flirted with the idea that since Abraham was the common source of these three great religions, perhaps he could also be their source of reconciliation-a common bond that could serve as a rallying point. If he could be, this book doesn't hold out much optimism.Overall I found this book only somewhat enlightening, but certainly not to the degree for which I had hoped. It comes across more as a journal of self-discovery punctuated with exposition of the religious meaning or tradition of various aspects of \\"Abrahamism\\" to flesh out a book. I'm pleased to have read it, but with an ever-growing reading backlog, had I known more about this book beforehand I would have passed it by."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"It's been said that England and America are two peoples divided by a common language. Judaism, Christianity and Islam represent three faiths divided by a common founder: each looks back to Abraham as the first of the faithful, and each is uplifted by the hope, as Abraham's children, to come into the inheritance of God's blessing on him and his \\"seed.\\"Feiler has chosen the figure of Abraham as a concrete way to explore the question of what these three great religions have in common, how they differ, and whether our many common elements offer any credible hope that we will learn to live together in peace and mutual respect. He explores the question from Jerusalem, where the hopes of the three faiths run the highest, and where the hopes for peace these days seem dimmest. There are no facile reassurances here, but Feiler's generosity to the other two faiths, his willingness to re-imagine Abraham from their point of view as well as from his own Jewish tradition, and (no less) his refusal to paper over the controversial or the politically incorrect, convey the depth of his own determination that we have to find our way to a \\"yes.\\"The book is simply written, readable in one or two sittings. It makes no pretension to being scholarly or exhaustive; it is an account of one individual's study and exploration of the question. But its simplicity is clearly the achievement of judicious selection and pruning. As fascinating as the varying portraits of the patriarch are in their own right, he recounts no story or midrash unless it illuminates the different approaches of these religions to God and to one another. He makes every anecdote count.Perhaps the greatest ground for hope lies in the historical pattern he discovers: for each of the three religions of the Book, Abraham was initially understood as a common spiritual father of all mankind; and only after centuries did each tradition succumb to the temptation to lay claim to exclusive status as Abraham's heirs. Those exclusive claims have laid deep grooves by now in all three spiritual paths; but the roots remain to be rediscovered and reclaimed.This book deserves to be widely read, among all three communities. It has no final answers; it is really only the barest beginning of the critical trialogue that has to take place. But its honesty, its painful urgency, its commitment to hope, and its publication in one place of narratives so long heard only within the confines of this tradition or that, make it a valuable beginning."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This book is, unfortunately, basically worthless. While it's thesis is promising, the author does a poor job of developing it. Rather most of his time is spent in polemics about how much he wishes the three faiths could 'just get along'.While the author might be forgiven for this obviously well intentioned desire, there are worse problems with the book than that. Many, many of his assertions about Christian dogma are blatantly untrue - something he should have known with a minimum of study on the subject. One that comes to my mind is the assertion that Jesus never claims his divinity. As most Christians know, that is blatantly untrue. Pick up the gospel of John sometime.While I cannot claim to know much about Judaism or Islam, I must assume that the author made similar mistakes with his assertions about those religions, given his many mistakes with VERY basic Christian dogma. The reader has to assume that one of two things is wrong with this author:1.he was too lazy to do even the most basic of homework before setting out on his trip or 2.he was trying to portray one of the three religions in a better light than the other two. I don't know enough about Islam or Judaism to guess which of those two problems this book suffers from. The larger point is that if this book suffers from major errors on basics than I feel no choice but to dismiss it's assertions as a whole.If there is anything of value in this book, it is not the Abrahamic historys, but the author's personal struggle to come to some kind of understanding of them. As a personal journal/travel logue this book does have a bit to offer. You get a true feeling of the tension in Jersualem and it's surrounding areas as you read about the author interviewing a 'firebrand' Islamic minister, being escorted by four armed guards into a sacred tomb, and suddenly finding himself alone and without transportation in the middle of a war zone. If this sort of travel adventure interests you, you may like this book. If you are looking for a book about Abrahamic history, then leave this one be. There are plenty of good books, both from varying religous and secular sources, on the subject not to have to spend time sifting through the truth and untruth in this little volume."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler has traveled and written about life in Japan, the circus, England, and the Biblical Middle East. In this post-9/11 book, he returns to Israel from Manhattan and explores the history and lore, from the perspective of three monotheistic faiths, surrounding the patriarch of ABRAHAM. Maybe Feiler was destined to write this book. His mother's maiden name means \\"House of Abraham\\", and the Bar Mitzvah parshat of both Feiler and his brother was \\"Lech Lecha\\", the biblical story in which Abraham is told by god to \\"go forth\\" and be himself. Coincidentally, or eerily, I read this slim book on a flight in which I, a Jew, sat between a Muslim and a Catholic nun. And like the mixed nuts that were served on the jet flight, this book is a nice appetizer to further, deeper study -- it is a brief, light, enjoyable, comforting, hopeful, and even humorous read. Feiler tells the reader that The Akkedah story is read at both Rosh Hashana as well as the Eid al-Adha. And obviously a father sacrificing his son is critical to Christian liturgy as well. To Muslims, Abraham is the first Hanif, and to Christians he is the father of faith. In this book, Feiler explores how three faiths invented stories around Abraham to reinforce their worldviews and to reflect upon their times; they even swapped stories, like the story about how Abraham visits Ishmael in his later life. I found the chapter on Christianity most enlightening, especially Feiler's quick discussion on St Augustine's views on Abraham and the Jews."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"It is so difficult to understand the reasons behind the present conflict. That is why I think books like Feiler's is a must. I also read Drummond's best seller, Holy Land Whose Land and between both of these books I could finally say I understand. The solution must be attached to knowledge and not superstition and fear. I thank these authors for their clear insights and difficult journeys for us.Timothy,"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"There are great theological books about Abraham in the three religions. But Feiler's book is more than theology! He's telling us a story, his story -as an american jew after september 11, which he experienced in New York- in discovering Abraham, in exploring the bible, speaking with jewish, christian, muslim sages, travelling the abrahamic-biblical places even in times of war.I read it in a single rush - and think you will probably do the same. If you like good storytelling and believe in the possibility of peace - just read it! And if you don't - well, then read it nevertheless, chances are good that Feiler would convince you!

I've heard him speak in person, and he communicates verbally with the same thoughtfulness that he does on the page.Although &quot;Abraham&quot; is a quick and easy read, it offers deep wisdom and insight into the troubles of our religious struggles. Don't read this book expecting to justify your position or bolster your particular brand of faith. Feiler exposes too much dirt to give you that option. Instead, he bolsters faith as a universal concept.For those willing to join in constructive dialogue, Feiler sets the table with little-known facts as appetizers, then leads us to the main course of three religions. Showing little favoritism, he sheds light on the errors of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims alike. He outlines the need that these three religions have for Abraham. He also outlines our need for this historical connection. With words as drink, he washes down the bad taste of extremism and offers hope for something better.I came away from this literary meal having discovered more about all three faiths, good and bad, and having found empathy and care for those that are different from me. In light of recent terrorism, I think Feiler handles the truth wisely...never shrinking from the pain, never extinguishing grace. He takes us into the thoughts of radicals and moderates on all sides. We share in his hopelessness and anger; we follow along as he offers paths to peace.No, &quot;Abraham&quot; doesn't throw out false hope for total reconciliation, but he does challenge us to seek for it individually.

It's written as a travelogue and an essay. Much of this work is opinion and more opinion.What I liked -- I enjoyed the personal relfections Feiler inserts about his Judaism and his visit to Jerusalem.

Hope this is a smash hit around the world."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This is a wonderful Sunday school book, an easy breezy amble through the origins of three great modern religions that's as comforting as a back rub and about as useful as a placebo.Early in the book, Feiler stumbles across a relevant fact that might have produced a great book had he cared to pursue the idea; primarily, that to succeed Abraham \\"must leave his native land and his father's house.\\" In other words, grow up, go out on your own, and accept personal responsibility for what happens on this earth. It's an idea expressed in Genesis XII; Abraham understands what God has told him, Feiler treats God's gift of individualism to Abraham as a Club Med travelogue.For tribal people, before the time of Abraham and still valid for those who need the comfort of group-think, identity is defined by the clan, tribe, cult or ideology. Abraham is the first to endorse the idea of individual identity, not in terms of personal hedonism and irresponsibility but as responsible to God for the basis of a moral life. It's an idea that has yet to be widely adopted; \\"born again\\" fundamentalists of many faiths believe they can do whatever they like because they \\"accept\\" God or Jesus or Allah who forgives them all their sins. It reflects the modern attitude, \\"Jesus paid for our sins, so let's get our money's worth.\\"This contrast between mass identity and personal individualism has been often explored; a classic example is \\"Escape from Freedom\\" in which Eric Fromm says people who cannot live with freedom will invariably turn to fundamentalism of some kind. The fault with the three great religions Feiler portrays as having grown from Abraham is not their common origin, but the fundamental fanaticism of modern followers who willingly submit to totalitarian faiths.Feiler ignores the contrast between tribal or group comforts, and the individualism of Abraham which gave birth to societies where individuals feel isolated, dehumanized and alienated. The result is often blind devotion to a cult, abject submission to a Leader and barbarous policies of suicidal mass murder. The individualism of Abraham is like the Ten Commandments of Moses -- great ideas from the very Highest and Best of Authority -- but how many people are willing to accept the full reality of such wisdom?Instead, Feiler limits himself to a Sunday School recitation of nice but conventional ideas about Abraham. He ignores the basic lesson God applied to Abraham, \\"Okay, Bro, you're on your own . . . . take responsibility for your own actions and you'll be okay.\\" Instead, this book is written in the image of Big Daddy looking after all of us, if only Big Daddy can figure out why we're fighting among ourselves.It's a great read, but that's almost a foregone conclusion when you consider the basic source of the original material. It could have been much better. Today's deadliest conflicts are not the product of Abraham or God, they occur because we expect God to look after us instead of accepting what Abraham learned -- accept responsibility for yourself.Buy it, then read it as a springboard to enable your mind to leap into the future. It doesn't offer answers from the past; but, as individuals, there's nothing like a nice review of the status quo to serve as an incentive to leap into the future."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This short, easy-to-read book feels like two. The first half of the book recounts the story of Abraham, a few of the many interpretations of the story by Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and some of the author's own thoughts (a few of which are actually interesting, such as Feiler's focus on Abraham's obsession with fertility, and on the idea of leaving family to find oneself). The second half of the book is much more focused on Feiler's conversations with clerics of various religions, which (other than one conversation with a fanatical imam) are mostly praiseworthy but boringly repetitive endorsements of human brotherhood."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I picked up this book because I'm a history buff and have found that the interesting stories of the Old Testament were rather glossed over my childhood Sunday School classes and adult church services. I found the stories as told by Bruce Feiler fascinating and I really enjoyed learning about the similarities and differences between the three faiths. Knowing that the author was jewish, I was prepared for a jewish slant, but found he treated all three religions very fairly and gave equal time to all. His conclusion is that all three religions have interpreted Abraham for their own, that generations in each religion have and will continue to re-interpret Abraham, and that this is not necessarily a bad thing. It only becomes a bad thing when one religion tries to claim Abraham (and other religious figures, events, practices)exclusivley for itself and shut out the other religions. I listened to this book on audio cd and enjoyed listening to the author read the book himself. His extensive research and enthusiasm for the subject made for a great audio book."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This book gives a fascinating look at the past by bringing it to life in terms of our modernlife.

Plese read all his books."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Bruce Feiler lives life to the fullest. He learns. He travels. He experiences deeply spiritual journeys. He writes well, and using his literary skills along with the other things noted above, Feiler produces books that take us with him on each grandiose voyage. His book, Abraham: A Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths, does not disappoint.As in his other works, Walking the Bible and Where God Was Born, Feiler openly identifies himself as a man of Jewish faith raised in the American South. His cultural context clearly noted, he then dives into the murky waters of searching for truth. Abraham may well be the most difficult project for Feiler as a man of faith. He painstakingly notes numerous ways in which followers of his own ethnic and religious tradition has molded sacred texts and crafted oral tradition so as to support their own agenda. He treats commentators and interpreters of Islam and Christianity in like fashion.Across the narrative, the book gives a snapshot of Islam, Christianity and the Jewish religion with emphasis on how each claims a foundation in the patriarch Abraham.Abraham provides a close investigation of the multifaceted and crafty, traveling monotheist. Using the texts of the Hebrew Bible, the Koran and numerous commentaries, Brue Feiler struggles with the dualism of Abraham, as both a unifier and a divider. Unquestionably for the majority of the world's religious followers, Abraham stands as a father of polemic children, making him the father of three international and contentious religions. Indeed Abraham is the father of the faith. Given all who claim lineage, Abraham's promise of offspring numbering as many as the grains of sand came to fruition. Can the father figure Abraham heal his larger than life, fractured and estranged family as it exists today?"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Best read on the subject. Enlightening, showing how the history of religion has been manipulated by three faiths for their own people set in the times of the writing."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"If you want to learn why the Middle East runs the way it does you should read this book. The passions of the story will answer some of that for sure.Again Bruce Feiler hits a home run with this book. This book shows the importance of the bible in today's world better than any seminary teacher could. This book is about the bible hero Abraham, the father of three faiths. Those three faiths are Christianity, the Jewish faith, and Islam. Most people seem to forget that. This makes the story of Abraham important to today's world.The book is very well written. It is fast paced and easy to read. Feiler takes the reader through the story of Abraham. This commentary isn't like anything you read at church or in the religious section of the book story. This commentary is from the point of view of a reporter. He gives the story a new look that few can match. He interlocks stories of the current world into the story that brings it to life. This book lacks some of the discussion about the land that his previous books had but it is still very worthwhile.Through this story you can see how Abraham is truly the father of all nations, just like God promised. All of the major faiths of the land claim him. Through that claiming they shape their own movements. At the end of the book Feiler describes his visit to the tomb, going through armed guards and checkpoints. You can get a mental picture of the war zone that Hebron is. The intensity of the story of Abraham made it what it is, something to die for, something to hold on to. It is also something that forces you to be constantly on guard for the others who want to die for the cause. You get a sense of the importance the bible has in today's world.The last chapter Feiler talks about various intra-faith efforts here in the US that uses the Abraham legacy to try to bring peace. All great efforts and I hope they succeed. However these efforts to date are isolated things.Again, if you want to learn the present you need to read this book about the past."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"What if Christianity, Islam and Judaism were all the same religion? Bruce Feiler's study of Abraham tells us that they at least started out that way. But human jealousies and a curious biblical characteristic sent Abraham's younger son Isaac, considered the originator of the Israelites, to the Promised Land, and his older brother Ishmael, a leader of Arab tribes, to Mecca. In each case, their progeny founded multiple tribes which would later unite under powerful leaders: King David on the one hand, and the Prophet Muhammad on the other. Christianity ultimately drew believers out of both groups. Given those circumstances, you would think that we all could just get along.Are the Abraham stories really true? Feiler goes back to the earliest scriptures and traditions of all three religions to find out. His well-written analysis holds your attention, and also divulges a lot of information about early Jews, Gentiles, Christians and Muslims that you probably haven't heard before. Abraham is a study of civilized man's earliest written history, and it shows us how historical events can occur in one era then appear to change during subsequent passages of time. The act for which Abraham is best known, the near-sacrifice of his own son, is an example--Jews, Muslims and Christians do not even agree which son it was.Bruce Feiler's books generally describe his own experiences and for this one he embarked on a year-long journey to find the origins of the stories about Abraham in today's Middle East. You are treated to an arresting tour of Jerusalem and its surrounding towns as he interviews rabbis, imams, and bishops. His verbal visages of the old city take you to the very core of the problems that would probably break the real Abraham's heart if he were alive today. The final irony of the book is Feiler's visit to Abraham's tomb in Hebron, where he finds the tomb itself divided politically and physically between Abraham's Jewish and Muslim descendents.Feiler finds that the many stories and traditions about Abraham converge on one overriding characteristic: Abraham was a good man, who obeyed God and rejected the false teachings of men. Feiler's descriptions of life in Jerusalem today give the impression that some of Abraham's descendents never got the message."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Bruce Feiler examines the way Abraham of the Bible; known as the \\"Father of All Nations\\", is celebrated by the three major religions of the world - Muslim, Jewish, and Christian. He expands on the life of Abraham and his family as depicted in the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran. I found his observations fascinating, beautifully expressed, and captivating.Any book written by this author is a delight - a feast - a learning experience. Just as his book \\"Walking The Bible\\" is a classic, this one is also a spiritual pilgrimage as he seeks out and provides the reader with information you could never imagine. He describes the people past and present who lived and now live in the Holy Land - how they all view Abraham a little differently, as well as how they worship in their own way, together and yet apart,within the Holy Land.I don't know of another person who could write about this subject matter, not offend anyone, and provide the opportunity for an open discussion between people of the three faiths. They really do have some common ground. Abraham - we never knew you!

This is an enormously insightful book in helping to understand how all three faiths look at Abraham [and Isaac and Sarah, and Ishmael, and Hagar]. Surely one of the most interesting books I've read in a long, long time. Well-written ... a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Author Bruce Feiler again takes his readers on an enchanting journey into the Biblical past. In \\"Abraham: A Journey To The Heart Of Three Faiths\\" he studies the role of Abraham as reflected in the traditions and scriptures of the three great monotheistic faiths which claim to be his children, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The map for this journey is drawn from the Old and New Testaments as well as the Koran. For anyone with a less than a thorough immersion into these scriptures, this book will be very educational. It certainly brought new concepts to my mind. Coming from a Christian background, I had always thought that it was clear that Abraham had taken his son Isaac to sacrifice, but that, at the urging of angel, Isaac was saved. Feiler introduces the traditions that it was Ishmael who was to be sacrificed and that the one was offered was actually killed. This is just one example of the traditions brought out which broaden ones understanding of these ancient works.Perhaps the greatest gift of this work is an enhanced appreciation of the crucial role that Abraham plays in the history of civilization. Abraham's great gift was the realization that there is only one God. This we share with our Jewish and Moslem brethren. It boggles the mind to think that this ancient wanderer has played such a role in the history of our world and in our own lives as well. I finished this journey in awe of this man. This, alone, makes the journey worthwhile."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Bruce Feiler's \\"Abraham: A journey to the Heart of Three Faiths\\" is the second in his three part series on the Bible, and I think his best of the three. In it he examines the root of three of the world's top religions: Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. And the root of all three is the patriarch Abraham.Bruce first examines Abraham's birth and call, then discuses his two sons: Isaac and Ishmael. However, the best part of this work is in the subsequent chapters when Feiler discusses how each faith tradition credits Abraham as its founder yet interprets him differently from the other two religions. Its an intriguing read and fits nicely after his first work \\"Walking the Bible.\\""},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Abraham is the great progenitor of the world's three interrelated but independent monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. In this thoughtful book, author Bruce Feiler goes on a journey of discovery, both in the ancient texts of these three religions and in the footsteps of Abraham, to understand the man and his meanings for our own day. And he invites the reader to share the journey with him.It may seem self-evident for Christians steeped in the Old Testament that one would look to Genesis for the stories about Abraham. And in many ways they do serve as Feiler's starting point and main thrust. However, what soon becomes apparent is that Abraham is so revered by so many diverse peoples that a whole body of oral tradition about Abraham exists beyond the sacred page. Feiler shares many of these insights with us, and since he is not limited by the passages of Scripture, there is a richness in his revelations about the man who first insisted there is but one God.As this book unfolds, we learn about the geography of Abraham and also the impact that geography has upon his saga. We are invited into passages that are familiar to us, but with an eye to what the Jewish or Muslim perceptive on those well-known passages might be. We see the story of Hagar and Ishmael in new ways, as Feiler points out the ramifications of the first-born son's legacy, in ancient terms.We also meet modern day guides, whose sharing of parts of Feiler's journey of discovery gives us further insights into the patriarch's story.Here is just one quote that shows the ways in which Feiler asks us to look beyond what we have already experienced in the person Abraham:\\"Hollywood has been particularly neglectful of Abraham. Moses merits a Cecil B. DeMille epic and a DreamWorks animated blockbuster. Steven Speilberg and Harrison Ford spent an entire film looking for the lost ark of the covenant... But no Abraham. Yet Abraham's life would seem to fit the three-act mold that Hollywood demands. Act one is his early life... Act two is his picaresque adventures on the road to Egypt and back... Act three-the most action packed of all-(is the one) in which Abraham is trapped in a deadly love triangle...\\" (page 70).This book is timely and informative, but it is more. It invites us to look for ways to incorporate Abraham's story into our own.Bruce Feiler writes for the \\"New York Times\\", the \\"Washington Post\\" and \\"Gourmet\\" magazines. He has authored a number of other laudable books, including \\"Walking the Bible\\". A native of Savannah, Georgia, Feiler has a great sensitivity to the nuances of similarities and differences between the world's great religions.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Having read Walking the Bible just prior to Abraham, I was able to get a good feel for the writing style of Bruce Feiler and his infectious enthusiasm for his subject matter. Feiler objectively delineates the first interfaith examination of the man chosen by God to be the patriarch of his people. He thoughtfully and rigorously dissects Abraham through the scripture, teachings, research, sometimes heated interviews, and, of course, his many dangerous travels through The Holy Land to the very sites of the historic happenings.I must admit, albeit a short work, I gained quite a bit of knowledge from Feiler and his spontaneous, yet well-constructed writing style. I learned quite a bit about the current Middle East conflict between the Palistinians and Israel and the prevailing open hostility of many Muslim people toward Israeli Jews. Feiler discusses jihad - according to The Koran it is NOT a justification for violence, but rather an invitation to Islam for \\"infidels.\\" Regrettably, the fundamentalist sects have made their own contrary interpretation. One tidbit: Ishmael was purportedly to be sacrificed, not Isaac, by Abraham, according to The Koran. Interesting and provocative stuff. Definitely worth a look-see."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"When I was given this book to read, I thought, \\"What can we know about Abraham beyond what is written in the Bible?\\" And, of course, the Bible record is limited and open to dispute. Indeed, this book is less about what we do know about Abraham and more what people say, think and believe about Abraham. If you come to this book with the anticipation of finding scholarly research into ancient manuscripts and archological findings, you will be dissapointed. While the book does have a list of suggested readings to learn more about Abraham, it is not footnoted and sorely lacks the type of documentation one would expect from exploration of a historical figure. A number of times the author makes a statement of \\"fact\\" without documentation which leaves the reader wondering what his sources were (for example, his assertion that the Torah was not written down until the exile).What I did find to be of interest was how views and understandings and stories about Abraham have changed with the passing of generations, with cultural adaptations and the emergence and evolution of religions. The book was helpful to me in understanding the Islamic view of Abraham. He makes an important point that Abraham has been used by all three primary monotheistic religions to further thier own agendas and purposes.Feilen's conclusion is that we need Abraham--in fact, we need to fabricate a new Abraham for our generation to help us learn to live together with our differences. In the end, this book is more about philosophy of religion than Abraham. When I evaluate a non-fiction book, some of the questions I ask myself are, \\"What did I gain from reading this book? and How is my life enriched?\\" Unfortunately, my second paragraph is about it."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This is certainly an interesting read and an easy one. I thought the author did an excellent job of providing three points of view from the three major faiths that each claim Abraham. More importantly, he provided an insight to the factthat Abraham is a different person to each of the faiths, or that he is a composite of many individuals, or questions if he actually existed at all. The end notes, questions, and readings provided at the end were helpful.The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star was a note of flippancy that I detected some time. Spending paragraph space on why Hollywood hasn't depicted Abraham, referring to the average individual as \\"joe sixpack\\", and some what I would call \\"cute\\" phrasing seemed to take away from the significance of the book. This is definitely not a reference for someone working on a doctorate in theology, but it does provide a good overview for those of us who just want to \\"get an idea\\" of who Abraham was and the often conflicting views of his story.Lastly, the appeal for understanding between the faiths is commendable, but it seems to provide a feel of \\"grasping at straws.\\" Sadly, however, that may be about all we have to even begin to bring an end to the huge chasm between the three faiths."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Bruce Feiler gives us a book which well documents the next step in exploring Abraham beyond the Genesis account; development of extra biblical tradition and Judaic/Christian/Islamic interpretation down to today. It is very well organized into sections covering the three different faiths. I particularly liked how the author demonstrates each faith's attempt to make Abraham exclusively its own via the rabbinic application of Gen. 26 which has Abraham keeping the law prior to the law being given, the Christian Paul using Gen.15 for &quot;midrash at its most elastic&quot; to establish the righteousness by faith doctrine in the N.T.of Romans 4, and the Islamic sacrificial dream son being Ismael as opposed to Isaac. Feiler accesses some very respectable references as well as random everyday people he encounters as he visits various sites where Abraham walked, but for the most part they offer personal opinion some of which I found little to no relevance in. Other interviews reveal the continuing division, and with some even a non-disguised hatred between the differing faiths. This is why I call Feiler's conclusion, that Abraham as the father of many nations can be the foundation for mutual understanding in our day, youthful idealism. Just the same I would recommend this book for the positives previously cited, as easily readable, and Feiler's end chapter premise worth the reader's drawing their own conclusion on."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I found the author of this book unreliable as to both facts and scriptures. Linking the three faiths to Abraham is a very promising idea. However, failure to modify sweeping statements, unhistorical interpretations of some incidents recorded in scripture, treating matters of faith as matters of established fact, all contribute to a book that is less than it might have been, less than it should be."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I have a limited religious background and I was looking for this book to give a high-level explanation of the 3 religions and to try to understand why they are so violently different (especially since they originate from the same place). But it was difficult to follow, mainly because I think that the author assumed you have a fairly solid religious background; he used a lot of terms which he didn't define. I may have had different expectations than what the author was trying to convey."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler's &quot;Abraham&quot; is a good book about the father of three religions written for people who have never bothered to read the Book of Genesis. For the totally uninitiated, Feiler gives a summary of the biblical stories. Instead of Feiler's &quot;Abraham,&quot; I would recommend first that people read the biblical Genesis. This is a much more interesting and lively book than Feiler's. And second, if you want insight into the same material that Feiler is writing about, read Dennis Shulman's &quot;The Genius of Genesis.&quot; Shulman's book has more depth, and is as well written as Feiler's."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Do NOT expect this book to answer your questions about Abraham and his relationship to Christianity, Judaism or Islam. This is a chatty, pleasant, first person account of the author's views on Abraham and the middle east. This is most emphatically NOT a scholarly book and should not be purchased or read with that expectation.It is, however, a good primer on Abraham and the three faiths of the middle east. You can move on to more informative and informed books from this one or not, as you choose."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This book covers Judaism, Christianity and Islam with diginity and thoughtfulness. Our father, Abraham, joins us and separates us at the same time. The author in his searching has found information that helps us to understand each other and how we are all connected through this man named Abraham.I recommended this book to lay persons as well as ordained clergy in assisting us in clearing our vision of others and how their way of faith is perceivedMay all God's people be one!"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Walking the Bible by Bruce Feiler was a marvelous adventure of a man searching for answers. His journey through the Middle East allowed him to literally walk through the first five books of Moses, discovering there is much more to the Bible than the stories inside. Feiler's use of words as he described his feelings, events, and the sites visited on his journey was absolutely amazing. It felt as if you were seeing what he was seeing, and feeling what he was feeling.As you can imagine, traveling through the desert will deprive a person of the type of foods they are accustomed to eat on a regular basis. As Feiler approached a small community he described the houses as \\"a giant hamburger, or more accurately, the contents of a can of tuna.\\" I can only imagine what he truly wanted at that moment, but it was a great way for him to relate what he was experiencing to his readers.Not only was it an interesting book, but very easy to read. It is not another story of facts and countless number of history lessons, but a personal adventure with real people, real stories, and real emotions."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler's study of Abraham and his legacy is a fairly quick read, which is good, because I'm about to read it again. I like his style, and I like his message. I'm particularly interested in the suggestions in the final chapter for opening dialogue--and maybe some minds. (Unfortunately, the people who are willing to put aside long-held hatred in the interests of peaceful co-existence are probably already open-minded.) The idea of Abraham as a common ancestor is one that is new to me, and I want to explore these ideas in greater depth."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This is poor, since it is but one man's wishful, uninformed, unimpassionate theological thinking.John Warwick Montgomery summarizes Feiler's opinion so well in his new book \\"Tractatus Logico-Theologicus\\" -- The characteristic most fully shared by the religions of the world is their incompatability with each other. This fundamental incompatability is at root logical, not sociological. Indeed, sociological conflict between two religions positions commonly rests in the logical incompatability of their respective beliefs.\\"\\"The desire for religious unity, though not logically justifiable, is eminently understandable; it is a special case of man's fundamental concern to bring oneness out of the diversity of his experience. . . . \\"We may wish most fervently that the world's religions taught a unified doctrine, but what is the case is not determined by what we wish to be the case.\\"What Feiler wishes to be the case from random, speculative stories does in no small way override the deep-founded, sacred beliefs held to by the three religions, incompatabile at their root level.Poor effort, unfounded by serious believers of any of the three. Wishful thinking doesn't make it so."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"The author's goal is apparently to show how Abraham, whose story he says has been claimed and re-invented by three warring religions, can be common ground for a dialog of peace between Jews, Muslims and Christians. The author argues that these religions' tales of Abraham are partly and crucially fabricated. His \\"biography\\" of Abraham is crafted to show that, as each of the religions came to need an historical Abraham as its legitimizing patriarch, each defined an Abraham who favored its own followers. Thus, the main source of Jewish/Muslim/Christian inter-religious conflict is not any historical action, viewpoint or instruction of Abraham himself, but arose through the later intervention of partisan religious leaders who, however well-intentioned, poisoned Abraham's legacy. Knowing this, we can now join in the growing conversation for peace that, once again, redefines Abraham--but this time the common father of three religions will be unifying force.All this is well and good, and if your spiritual hopes and existence are attuned to a PBS-style monologue of hand-wringing pleas that we can all just get along if we strive to understand our common heritage while respecting cultural and religious diversity (etc.), you may even find the book as inspiring as do those mainstream publishing professionals whose 5-star reviews seem possibly influenced less by a critical analysis of its content and style than by a desire to believe in (and help propagate) a worldview whereby the author's dreams of Middle East (/world) peace and brotherhood would achieve the historically anomalous status of more than mere wishful fiction.Personally, I was interested in a biography, an unemotional anlysis of what historical evidence exists regarding Abraham's life and what we think we know about his actions and their results. I'm about 20% satisfied in that regard. The book is largely the author's personal story, a tale of how his faith and travels have involved a quest for his own private Abraham (with whom he now hopes to supplant all others). I don't care about his bar mitzvah, don't have any interest in the physical characteristics or speech accents of his various colleagues, and am bored by how he personally felt when looking at this and that holy whatever. He personally reads the audio version of the book, and his diction and emotional inflections seemed off-key and distracting in a way that further alienated me from the text; I kept wondering, \\"perhaps the style is that of a Jewish sermon, and would be somehow endearing to my Jewish friends?\\" I wanted to know more about Abraham, and his place in Islam, Judaism, and Christianity; I heard far too much about the author's life, emotions, NY 911 credentials, and dreams for one-world peace.I would recommend this book to those who have little or no knowledge of the religious underpinnings of Arab/Israeli conflict, and who seek a quasi-intellectual emotional understanding of how Abraham's legacy may be a factor in modern perception of that conflict."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"REMARKABLE... AMAZING... INSPIRING... INTRIGUING...Bruce Feiler, has successfully written a novel which draws clear connections between the three major faiths of the World. Feiler's writing style is not only remarkably intriguing but also inspiring.As Feiler explores various notable landmarks in the Holy Land the reader is taken on an exciting journey through one of the Bible's most remarkable figures -- Abraham. This novel is bound to become a classic to be utilized for generations to come in religious education classrooms.As a religion teacher of seven years, this novel will hold a special place on my bookshelf. This is a perfect companion for anyone looking to further their knowledge of Abraham or just for those starting to explore the Bible."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler, a non-theologian, tries to approach Judaism, Christianity and Islam as three offshoots from a common source, their forefather Abraham. In gathering his information, he speaks to a large number of people and makes some interesting discoveries along the way, e.g. he notices (or is told) that the Akedah is not mentioned anywhere else in the Tanakh. On the whole, however, the book disappoints as it rehashes more cliches than elucidates the unbridgeable differences between the various cultures shaped by Judaism, Islam and Christendom. Feiler fails to note that he is not grappling with three &quot;faiths.&quot; Judaism is a culture, a civilization, based on veneration of a sacred text and a basic understanding of a resultant code of conduct. Christianity is indeed defined by a set of articles of faith, but has little to do with Abraham, and has branched into a large number of widely divergent denominations. In Feiler's reading, Jesus was almost incidental to Christianity -- a gross misunderstanding of this religion. Both Christianity and Islam are to be understood as developments out of Judaism and in opposition to it. New Testament and Quran are collections of midrashic narratives derived from the Hebrew Scripture: When it comes to biblical tradition, they do not attain to equal status, but are reactive. The attempt to forge commonality, based on the thin strand of Abraham, seems strained and,ultimately, unconvincing. What we end up with, then, is more of a string of notes in a journal of religious search by an individual, rather than a scholarly contribution to our understanding of religion in general or the Hebrew Bible in particular."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"\\"Abraham\\" is an interesting and well-written book, but it seemed to me that Feiler has the shadow of 9/11 hanging a bit too darkly over it. Perhaps because of its more specific topic -- Abraham -- it's also a less expansive work in some ways than either \\"Walking the Bible\\" or \\"Where God was Born.\\" Worth reading, but I didn't find it as good as \\"Walking the Bible\\" or \\"Where God was Born.\\""},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"The story of Abraham marks the emergence in human history of monotheism, and idea that represents a major shift in human consciousness. For believers in a single deity, it's an idea whose simplicity gives it an integrity that is self-evident. Three thousand years later, the complexity of not one but myriad Abrahams confounds understanding of the one God he believed in.Feiler's informative book gives us in broad brushstrokes an account of how that transformation took place. His search for common ground between competing belief systems takes him on a perplexing journey to sacred sites in the Holy Land, where he interviews men and women who have devoted their lives to study of God and the descendants of Abraham. The answers he gets to his questions illuminate his subject and raise even further questions.At first I didn't think I was going to like this book. I expected something scholarly, and this seemed more like magazine writing - breezy and superficial. Then as Feiler wades into deeper theological and political waters, the subject became compelling and full of unexpected surprises. I recommend this very readable book for readers with even a passing knowledge of Abraham, the ancestral father of three world faiths, and who wonder at the current ferocity of religious beliefs that haunts our days."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"While being the common ancestor shared by the three predominate monotheistic faiths, Abraham is revered, respected, interpreted, misinterpreted and sometimes even manipulated by theologians and the faithful who seek claim him as their own. Bruce Feiler attempts to collect the varied and sometimes conflicting stories of the man many believe to be the first to enter into a covenant with God.Universal agreement concerning Abraham does not come easily. Most Jewish, Christian or Moslems would agree that he was the first to acknowledge the existence of a single God, that he entered into a covenant with God wherein he agreed to follow God's instructions to leave his homeland for an unknown destination. Already old and childless, he and his wife Sarah were told by God that they would bear a son, and that their descendants would create a great nation. Later, God instructed Abraham to offer his son, \\"the son whom you love\\" as sacrifice to the One God. Beyond those gross generalizations, the story of Abraham morphs in various directions depending upon the beliefs of the story teller.The instruction to take \\"the son whom you love\\" serves as a critical focus of debate for many, as Christians and Jews believe that Abraham offered his son Isaac by his wife, Sarah as the sacrifice; whereas Moslems believe that it was his older son Ishmael (born to his slave Hagar) that was placed on the sacrificial altar. Feiler discusses how the various religions interpret similar writings or incidents, and yet arrive at dramatically different conclusions.What elevates this book beyond the realm of a comparative religion text book, is Feiler's balanced portrait of a man who exists in a singular position of relevance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Fundamentalists of any persuasion will likely take issue with some of his observations, but Feiler treats his subject with respect and awe, and a desire to place Abraham into a position that might bridge some of the passions that exist today in the Middle East. He succeeds in that regard, with interviews and discussions with Abrahamic scholars and clerics that give a glimmer of hope for all of us."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"After having enjoyed Bruce Feiler's previous book, \\"Walking the Bible,\\" I was a bit skeptical when I heard about this one. He had already covered the journey of Abraham in the first book, so what more could he add with a sequel? It wasn't until I heard him talk about Abraham on National Public Radio that I realized this book is not another travelogue. It's a chronicle of Feiler's own inner journey to understand the connections among Judaism, Christianity, and Islam through their common father, Abraham.As Feiler tells us in this book, the sedrah portion he studied for his own Bar Mitzvah was \\"Lech lecha,\\" the section of the Torah which deals with God's call to Abraham to leave his home and go to a place that God would show him. It is said that one's Bar Mitzvah portion is forever connected with one's personal destiny. This is certainly true in Feiler's case. His lifelong fascination with Abraham has led him to write a very interesting and thought-provoking book.Don't expect this to be a scholarly study. It's not. In fact, there are some glaring historical inaccuracies. For example, Feiler credits the \\"Essene\\" Qumran community with \\"starting\\" the tradition of midrash (Jewish hermeneutics). Apparently he's not up on recent Dead Sea Scroll scholarship, because it is now seriously questioned whether (A) the Qumran community was Essene and (B) whether the scrolls in question came from Qumran or a Jerusalem library that was hidden at the time of the Roman siege. At any rate, midrash did not begin at Qumran. (He also confuses midrash with the Mishnah at one point...)I'm sure that Muslim and Christian readers will find similar errors -- but that's not the point of the book. Feiler is exploring how the three religions have viewed Abraham in various periods of their history, and how those perspectives have changed over the centuries. What he seeks is a way to bring the three monotheistic religions together in a productive dialogue where they can meet as equals on the common ground of sharing their origins in Father Abraham. He presents us with an Abraham that we can relate to at the beginning of the 21st century. That's the heart of the book; all the rest is commentary.Regarding that commentary, the book is a bit lopsided when it comes to Jewish POVs. Feiler never identifies what kind of Jew he is, but I looked up his childhood synagogue, Mickve Israel in Atlanta, Georgia, and it's listed as \\"America's Oldest Reform congregation.\\" Nothing wrong with that -- except that I suspect he carries a common Reform prejudice against Orthodox and Hasidic Jews. He never interviews any -- except for a token Hasidic boy who just happens to be at the Western Wall. The Jews he does interview are all academic scholars and \\"modernized\\" rabbis. On the other hand, he goes out of his way to talk to top leaders in the very traditional Christian and Muslim communities. He seems fascinated with their colorful clerical garb; perhaps the plain black clothing of the Hasidic Rebbes was not as exotic?There is also a certain flippancy about the way Feiler describes the relationship between God and Abraham, as well as his own relationship with the stories. I realize that he is writing for the general public, and is probably giving voice to the \\"skeptic\\" POV for the benefit of his readers. Still, the fact that he is Jewish and has not included the POV of the more traditional (and respectful) branches of Judaism leaves the reader with the wrong impression that all Jews are as irreverant as he sometimes is. Muslim and Christian readers should be aware of this, i.e., that Feiler's reactions are his own, and do not represent the POVs of all Jews. Within Judaism there is a vast diversity of views, the same as with any other group.When he can set his academic skepticism aside, Feiler's prose soars and inspires. At times it reaches the level of poetry. I get the feeling that this is the real Bruce Feiler, the sincere seeker who, like so many Reform Jews I've met, feels he must show a \\"scientific\\" face to the world but who, deep down inside, is a really a mystic on a quest. Like all such quests, it is the process of the pilgrimage that transforms the person, not the facts he encounters along the way. Read from this perspective, this book is indeed a fascinating journey."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"How do you write a 226-page book covering someone whom we have very little historical knowledge about? Put a lot of space between the lines, and fill in the gaps with long, superfluous descriptions of what the weather was like the day you were doing your research, and you can stretch it out to 226 pages. Yes, the content of this book is quite thin, stretched out to needless length. But fortunately, it's an easy read, so it goes fast even though you do have to wade through some of those verbose setting-the-mood descriptions.I ended up reading this book through a book group discussion. I work at a Fortune 500 company that has a diversity committee, like most big corporations, but usually such groups tend to focus only on race, gender, and sexual orientation issues. At my company, they also include other types of diversity, such as generational differences and religion. This book was a perfect choice for such an environment because Abraham is an important figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, so people of all three of these major world religions could find something in the book for them.I found it quite interesting how the three religions have developed views of Abraham that are quite divergent, even though they all have the same historical writing about just a few incidents in his life. The most surprising view to me was the Jewish interpretation of Abraham in the Middle Ages, which according to this author, had become similar to Christ: \\"Abraham had become a savior, a celestial figure who embodies divinity on earth, represents humans in the afterlife, and contains, in the deeds of his life, the scripture of God's intention. The Jewish notion of Abraham had become remarkably similar to the Christian notion of Jesus, in which Christ is the logos, the word and the law.\\" He also states this view of the period: \\"Abraham may not have died at all; worms did not destroy his body once it was placed in the ground.\\"Overall, the author's take is that these religions have made the meaning of Abraham's life into whatever the religions needed to make him important to their beliefs. It certainly was interesting to see how the interpretation of Abraham's life has changed throughout time and by each religion. If you'd like an easy read about three religions' views of Abraham, this book can be a good overview."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"With the current political climate continuing to build up heat and tension, religion is playing a significant role in the politics of the world today. In an ironic twist, that some would say proves the existence of a God with a sense of irony, three of the world's major religions (and the 3 most involved in the middle east tensions of today) all claim some fountainhead with one man - Abraham. The interesting part of the story is how three worlds could work with the same man and his family, and mold that into the image that would best suit each religion's needs and agenda. This is what I found most interesting about the book - how a sketchy story in the distant past could be used and interpreted to certain ends in order to help religion develop. Some other reviewers have quibbled with Feiler's interpretations of interpretations, but overall he does a credible job in exploring the stories and the major faiths involved. He approaches each of the faith with a skeptical eye, looking to understand how and why such interpretations worked out. He even turns the questioning eye to his own Jewish faith and the development of Abraham into the father figure he is. Like in his \\"Walking the Bible,\\" Feiler starts off in Israel, looking to find the pieces of the Bible that he can see, and touch. But quickly he realizes that instead of physical locations and objects, for the most part the story of Abraham resides not in the land but in the stories, and the hearts of the faithful. He is engaging in less of a journey through history as he is a journey through the hearts and minds of those who came before. Hardly the last word on the topic of Abraham, but a good introduction and exploration of the issues involved. An interesting and very accessible book."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"To study Abraham as such is absolutely enlightening concerning the three directions. In a completely unbiased approach I am convinced from this book Abraham would be shocked himself at the various interpretations, especially Islam and the one major holiday they celebrate over his ultimate offering God had asked him for. This is a book that you should find a quiet place to read, it is easy to read but demands complete attention as details grow. A very educational work, from the time of Abraham to current faith. A must have if you are a believer or an Atheist. I wish to recommend a book that carries on from here in a very similar theme but with Moses and Christ, title is SB: 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I got so much out of this book! Bruce Feiler challenges his readers to understand how the three monotheistic faiths that grew out of the revelations of Abraham developed their beliefs and used Abraham's story to further their own causes. I found it especially interesting to see how each religion tweaked Abraham's story, and in some cases changed it wholesale. Yet I don't think (and I think Feiler doesn't think) that diminishes the power of what Abraham brought to the table. Abraham gave to the world the idea of a loving, portable, all-powerful God that roughly half the world celebrates in some form or fashion. Now if only we could all come together and find peace through this one God that Abraham, in essence, discovered for us!"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly but was disturbed by Feiler's tendency to make sweeping statements without giving any authority for them. Certainly many of his statements about Christianity are incorrect. For example, he mentions in passing that Jesus never claimed to be the Messiah. This is not true. Among many other things, Jesus purported to forgive sin (which only God can do), claimed that He has always existed and will come to judge the world at the end of time. His teachings pointed to Himself (\\"I am the bread of life\\", \\"If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father\\", \\"I am the Light of the World,\\" etc.) rather than away from Himself and toward God. Feiler also discribes Paul as \\"not formally educated.\\" The common understanding among Christians is that Paul was highly educated, born into a family of Pharisees (the most rigorous observers of ancient Jewish law), was sent to Jerusalem at a young age to study under the great rabbi Gamaliel where he surpassed his contemporaries in religious knowledge and practice. If there is authority for the statement that Paul wasn't formally educated, Fieler doesn't give it to us."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"-First of all, Bruce Feiler is clearly a great adventurer who walks deserts to descend into caves in the midst of war-torn countries. Additionally, he has an intense and admirable passion for this subject and writes an engaging book that ends up being part history, part travel literature, and part theology.-However Feiler seems to stretch at times in making his case that Abraham \`unites' the three religions of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. On the contrary, Abraham is more a point of contention than one of unity. I wish Feiler had made the statement that all three positions on Abraham cannot be equally true since they often directly contradict each other. A worthy goal is always to divide truth from error in order to understand which position, if any, is accurate. Instead of taking this path, Feiler seems to desire peace at the expense of truth as he places religious harmony higher than a right understanding of theology.-Feiler is correct that the most mesmerizing story of Abraham's life--his offering a son to God--plays a pivotal role in the holiest week of the Christian year, at Easter. This is surely the case as Christianity sees Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac as a foreshadowing of the substitutionary atonement of Jesus. However, this is a radically different interpretation of the event from either Judaism or Islam.-Feiler states that Abraham, is a character who has shape-shifted over the millennia to the extent that the religions don't even agree on which son he tried to kill. This is true, and the interpretation may have shape-shifted, but that does not mean the scriptural documents were changed. That is, with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the claim that documents had been changed in order to fit with dogma, has little foundation.-Feiler claims that Abraham is a type of metaphor and that this historically elusive man embodies three religions. That's a difficult claim to back up. Abraham \`embodies' all three religions? Certainly Christian scholars would not make that claim. They would claim that only Jesus would fit this role. Abraham was the one to whom the promise was made and Jesus was the fulfillment of that promise. Abraham's role would be significantly secondary.-Feiler concludes with a passionate and prayerful argument for peace between faiths. This is a valiant attempt and his motives are surely good. However, it would have been refreshing if he would have explained that when two people theologically disagree with each other that does not mean that they necessarily hate each other. The existence of truth means that at least one party is wrong, but that does not mean that the parties cannot respect each other as people, even though they may not respect all theological positions. Grace, peace, and love can and do exist side by side with truth - and if truth exists, so does error. One party being \`wrong' is part of the package and it is the reality. I wish Feiler's final sentence had been, \\"Call your brother wrong and love him with those words.\\""},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I, like many evangelical believers, have always (unknowingly) viewed Abraham through Christian-colored glasses. This book expanded my vision, opening me up to views of Abraham that go beyond the simple biblical text. The depiction of Abraham in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), for example, was modified, shaped, and re-interpreted by Christians, Muslims, and even later Jews, often depending upon the situation at the time. The pivotal event of the Abraham story is the near-sacrifice of his favored son to God. Interestingly, to Jews and Christians, the favored son was Isaac, while Muslims hold Ishmael to be the favored son. Christians, of course, regard this event as a foreshadowing of Christ's sacrifice. Interestingly, Jewish rabbis after the time of Jesus interpreted the text to say that Abraham actually did slay Isaac, who later would return from the dead.The different interpretations of the Abraham story lead the author to conclude that there are actually a multitude of \\"Abrahams\\" to fit different historical, political, and social situations. Indeed, Fieler makes a little too much of the fact that there is no archaeological evidence that Abraham ever existed. He doesn't take a hard-line position on Abraham's existence or non-existence, so I guess one could call him an \\"Abraham agnostic\\". His ultimate goal, to find common ground and possible reconciliation among the monotheistic religions on the basis of Abraham would have a very shaky foundation indeed if it was based on a mythical character.This book is much more than a study of Abraham. It documents a personal journey by the author to the crucible where these great religions lead a frighteningly non-peaceful co-existence: the land of Israel. After reading of his encounters with various Jewish, Christian, and Muslim clerics, one sadly sees little hope for a full reconciliation. Of course, that should come as no surprise. But this little book can go a long way in cracking open the doors of understanding."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"In this intelligent and engaging book, Feiler a gifted story-teller, digs into the books, explores the land, and meets the clerics, then spins different stories of Abraham, his children (Ishmael and Isaac) and his people (Jews, Christians and Muslims) that are sure to enrich the reader's mind and spirit.It was very interesting to notice that the details of the stories differed not only between the 3 religions, but also in the same religion during different historical periods. Interpreters looked at the same text and made different conclusions that helped them deal with the circumstances of their lives at a given time. It shows that we (Jews, Christians and Muslims) are only human after all. As a Muslim, I've only come to know our father Abraham as described in the Qur'an and it was enlightening to see him from the perspective of the other two religions. If we look beyond the details, the essence and morals of the stories are the same: surrendering to one God. Unfortunately throughout history all the people of Abraham never tried to emphasize their similarities but concentrated on their differences, demonizing and killing one another while trying to attain God's blessings as the sole heirs of Abraham.Ignorance breeds intolerance, and this book is an honest and unbiased attempt at teaching us about one another and is hopefully a step towards bringing the people of the 3 faiths to common grounds. This is not impossible since the essence is one: surrendering to one God, believing in the Day of Judgment and doing good deeds. God tells us in the Qur'an,\\" Those who have attained to faith [in this divine writ], as well as those who follow the Jewish faith, and the Christians, and the Sabians (probably means the followers of John the Baptist)-all who believe in God and the Last Day and do righteous deeds- shall have their reward with their Sustainer; and no fear need they have, and neither shall they grieve.\\"(2:62)(Translation from: the Message of the Qur'an by Mohammad Asad)Reading the chapter on Islam, I thought it was good however, the author seemed to imply that Islam is a religion invented by Mohammad, and some of the statements were without any foundation, for example:\\" The Koran says...During Noha's Flood the Ka'ba had been taken up to heaven, where angels fluttered around it,..\\" Actually, nowhere in the Qur'an is this statement made or even implied! Another important point that the author failed to clarify (although he mentioned it in passing) is that Islam has 2 meanings. The original meaning is: surrendering to one God, later it came to mean the religion revealed to Prophet Mohammad. So when the Qur'an says\\" The only true faith in God's sight is Islam.\\" It means that the only true faith is surrendering to one God. If you read the Qur'an its all about that. Mohammad, Jesus, Moses, Abraham, all the prophets are only men who delivered the message of \\"worship one God\\" to mankind, they are all secondary to God. And since they all delivered this message of one God they are all \\"Muslims\\" or in other words believers in one God. To be honest not all Muslims understand this concept in this way and the majority interprets the verse differently. Finally, one thing I personally found shocking is the way the author talked about God at times, as if God was human: with needs and whims!Overall, an interesting, enjoyable and informative book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"As an Arab, I thought that a book about the current conflicts occurring written by a western writer must be somewhat biased and uninformed about our culture and point of views. However, i was very surprised. The book protrays all the controversial issues that are cuasing the problem in a scientific approach rather in an argumental one. While Bruce forms his own conclusions in some pages, he still manages to leave space for the reader to analyze and conclude. Moreover, he did some hefty research into all three cultures and civilizations that made the book very professional and provacative. I really enjoyed the book and found it insightful."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler makes some very interesting points about how Islam, Christianity, and Judaism have all come to claim Abraham as their own patriarch.

So many literary efforts erroneously portray him as a Jew, which he was not."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"As Abraham was called by the Almighty to leave his home and journey to the land of promise, Feiler invites the reader to leave behind the familiar land of one's faith and listen to the life stories of people of faith who inhabit the land around Jerusalem."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I'm not sure why I forced myself to finish reading this book except perhaps to confirm that it's weaknesses persist from cover to cover. Alas, they did. On the whole it is a silly book. Whatever meaningful scholarly exploration was done by the author fails to appear in the writing. The conclusion are the same tired conclusions pandered by those who see villainy in anyone who has the audacity to suggest that there such a thing as objective truth. In the place of reasoned, well supported conclusions the author takes great flying leaps of opinion leaving the reader to wonder what logic made the flight possible in the first place. In his discussion of each of the faiths he chooses talking heads from each of the great monotheistic religions that fail absolutely to represent their faiths in any meaningful way. (How could one possibly concluded that the the attitudes or opinions of the Bishop of Jerusalem are somehow representative of Christian faith and practice? Incredible.)In Feiler's view it doesn't matter whether or not Abraham actually existed since the paucity of direct sources prevents us from truly knowing him. In this view it is more important for each of the three faiths to feel warm and respectful of whatever stories have been made up (because they are all made up anyway) than it is to discover the truth in the sources that do exist. The logical conclusion is that it is also unimportant to attempt to truly know God, since He is made up from the same needy fantasies of those who invented Abraham.Fortunately, for many of us, the truth does matter. Either Abraham existed or he did not. There are no alternatives. If, as Feiler suggests, Abraham is simply a marketing tool, the self-serving creation of religiously needy people in various social settings across history who shared Bruce Feiler's disdain for the notion of objective truth, then Abraham has nothing to teach us anyway. On the other hand, if Abraham was a real person, chosen by God, then our task is not so much to understand Abraham. It is rather to understand the God who chose to reveal Himself through Abraham, and who also chose to limit the preserved record of that revelation to the sources we have at hand."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This book is so well-written and researched.

What imam or sheikh would ever say such a thing is beyond me. Then the crack about how mainstream muslims really believe that God wanted 9/11 to happen?This book has an agenda and it has nothing whatsoever to do with Abraham.;)"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"It is unfortunate to see so many inaccuracies, non factual opinions and biasness in this book. Read it if you mostly like fiction."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Oh my, did I mess up when I check this one out. I have seldom been as disappointed in a work as I was this one. I like facts. I enjoy knowing bits of this and bits of that. I very much enjoy historical biographies. I enjoy travel books. I enjoy books of individual spiritual searches. I enjoy books written my competent archeologists and historians. I enjoy speculative fiction and non fiction. Sadly to say, this one, for me, missed the mark on just about ever one of these counts.Basically, the author writes of and about Abraham, who, no question, is a central figure in three of our great religions, Judaism, Islam and Christianity. The author attempts to define the differences between these three religions, using Abraham as the central figure. How does this one man, Abraham, hold so much power, and have so much influence over the teachings of each of these religions? This is also something of a spiritual journey for the author, a kind of \\"lets find my roots\\" sort of thing. The author dashes here and there, interviewing various church leaders, asking their opinions about this and that. The basic, overlying questions is...Did Abraham exists or did he not exist? I am sorry to tell you that the author has come to the conclusion that it really does not matter; it is sort of the thought that counts. I am sorry, but for me, this conclusion just does not work. If the author was unable to find out one way or the other, and I can see why as there is little physical evidence one way or the other, then that is fine. The author should just say so. As another reviewer put it, \\"it does not matter, just is not acceptable!\\" Now don't read into this that I am anti- religious. I am not. I am sure that Abraham, if he did exist, was a pretty good old boy and certainly did the right thing under the circumstances of the time.I really did not find anything new in this work. There was very little I was not already aware of. I did read the opinions of some high-up religious officials, of whose opinion I could care less about (as if one of them is not going to follow the \\"party line\\"). For the most part I found many of the author's \\"facts\\" just a bit questionable and most of it completely hearsay and speculation. When all is said and done,there was not much which I have not already heard and read many times before in other works. Also, to say that to understand the conflict in the Middle East at this time, a reader needs look no further than the last portion of this book, is the biggest bunch of bunk I have read for sometime now. Folks, it is much, much more complicated than that.Now I will give the author credit. He can write, ergo, the two stars. His descriptive prose is quite nice. I might suggest he try travel books or something like that. On the other hand, the author is not a theologian, historian, archeologist or educational expert. This is all too apparent quite quickly after reading a few chapters. I am not real sure what he is, other thana young man in search of something that he probably does not even understand. I feel some might enjoy this sort of thing. I did not, and certainly cannot recommend reading it. I suppose if you feel you must give it a shot, I suggest you check it out at your library before you plunk down the hard cash. Like a previous reviewer, I am not at all sure why in the world I finished this thing."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"A great book! A very insightfull work with contemporary views from clergy of all 3 faiths. It gives one a whole new perspective on Abraham and new insights into these 3 faiths."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I picked this book up at a local store and read it while I had some down time between homework assignments. Feiler takes an ecumenical look at three faiths, Islam, Judaism and Christianity - starting with Abraham. Of note are the interviews Feiler performed with leading Islamic, Jewish and Christian scholars and holy men. While the book does not draw any really solid conclusions it is a good place to start when looking at the religions originating out of the Torah.I am sure Muslims will take issue with how they are portrayed by a Jewish author, and Christians may tend to do the same. But, this does not mean it is not worth reading. A good place to start when having a conversation about faith with someone outside your own tradition is to find common ground. Feiler tries to do this in his book, and does it with some success.Joseph Dworak"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"In late 2002, The Miami Book Fair was broadcast on C-Span. One segment had a panel which included Bruce Feiler. When I heard some of the titles of the books Feiler has written, particularly his book on the circus, I found him rather interesting, but wondered what he would have to say about his scriptural subjects. Well, all a person has to do is read his either WALKING THE BIBLE or ABRAHAM and one will quickly realize that Feiler gives the reader ample ways to look at faith and scripture.In ABRAHAM, Feiler looks at the \\"father in faith\\" of three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and explores the ways each of the three faiths uses the story of Abraham. Feiler shows how each faith tradition uses the same basic story but interprets it in different ways. Feiler not only shows the different ways in which the Abraham story is interpreted, but also how these interpretations have often led to divisions as well. In light of the present world situation, Feiler's observations could be prophetic and could lead to a better understanding of that which decides so many.The book is written from a perspective of faith, which is probably its greatest strength. Feiler has a great appreciation of scripture and seems to make a great effort at finding authorities on Abraham that are both experts and people of faith. For this reason, the book gives the reader a great deal to ponder. Readers also see that Feiler himself is journeying in his faith: he is both rediscovering the faith of his childhood and discovering a more vibrant mature faith. His ability to bring in his own experiences while not making the book about himself is admirable and allows the reader to become engaged in the book and perhaps see their own spiritual journey.Readers should note that while this book is carefully researched, it is not a scholarly work and there are a few small errors in the book, but the errors are small and do not detract from the overall message of the book."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler does make interesting and true accounts of the three major religions. Feiler also adds far too much personal (and unsubstantiated) conclusions. One is left with as many questions as one started off with. Much of Feiler's &quot;investigations&quot; are not from scholars and are not noted properly. I cannot understand why this novel has had so much success unless it is only because there is not much else to choose from!"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Anyone who surveys the global situation in these early years of the 21st century could logically feel a sense of despair if they dream of world peace. Despite years of effort, peace in the Middle East seems a more distant goal then ever; and the United States finds itself embattled in a global struggle with radical forces who claim to be guided by tenets of their faith.In this dark time, Bruce Feiler's &quot;Abraham&quot; can serve as a beacon of hope and light. In this slim, gracefully written volume, Feiler invites us along on his personal search for Abraham--the father figure for the three great faiths in the world today. He chronicles how little is actually known about the man--and how this has allowed each faith to mold an Abraham who seems suited to his needs. Sadly, he points out how first Christians and then Moslems at first tried to use Abraham as a figure of inclusion and a bridge with the other religions, but then evolved toward an exclusionist view that only embraced their own version of the prophet.Although his ideals shine brightly in this text, Feiler is not looking at the world through a false prisim; he readily acknowledges the violence and tensions that radiate from the bithplace of these faiths--Jerusalem--and around the globe. But he holds out hope that despite these setbacks, the three faiths are evolving toward an inclusive view of each other, and makes an eloquent case that Abraham can be the foundation on which to build that new understanding."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This is ultimately an unsatisfactory book. Feiler does little scholarly research and depends mostly on personal encounters. His thesis that Abraham is claimed as the father of three great religions is incorrect. Feiler tries to account for 4000 years of history in a book of a few hundred pages. As a result much history is oversimplified.For a more detailed discussion of this book go to seniornet.org and look at the book discussion section."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This well written, flowing account of Abraham and his application to the three great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Although a refreshing account this book contains a number of outright fallacy's. First of all the story of Abraham is not, in fact, identical for the three faiths. The most obvious point here is the distinction in Islam of Ishmael who in the Torah/Old Testament is cast away and who god describes as \`a wild beast of a man, his hand against all others'. The question the author raises is \`Since Abraham is the father of the three faiths can't he be used as a unifying person to bring understanding'. In short, No. Abraham is not the central figure in any of the three faiths. Judaism has Moses, Christianity has Jesus and Islam has Mohamed. Abraham is simply a father figure but not a dynamic prophet of god. He was a shepherd with a small number of followers and a small family. He frequently lied to local rulers and said his wife was his sister, so that he would not be murdered for her. His brother, Lot, ended up in a cave and made love to his own daughters. Abraham circumcised himself at an old age and his wife gave birth when she was 80. But the parables and stories aside the man, Abraham, is a very human fleshy character and the authors thesis does not hold true. He is not a unifier, he is simply a beginning, like Adam and Eve or Noah, who are equally nebulous. In the final result this book does not hold the water is reputes itself to hold."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I read this book slowly taking in all aspects of the author's logic as to why Abraham is the gatekeeper to Judism, Muslim, and Christianity. This book gives the layperson the information needed to understand how Abraham was instrumental in the evolution of these three faiths, and how the pendulum has swung among the three throughout history. The book suggests and encourages that in today's world there must be purposeful dialogue among the faiths to bring the focus back on the shared ideals of all, namely--one God. Only through educated discussion can we force out the nurturing of hatred that continues to undermine the growth of humanity."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ABRAHAM.

Bruce Feiler provides so much fascinating information about the three religions that claim to originate from Abraham -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. He carefully compares and contrasts the three without pronouncing a \\"winner,\\" but instead, he repeatedly demonstrates how all three religions depend on the man (or the myth) called Abraham. I was especially intrigued by his exposition of the contradicting claims about Abraham, Isaac and Ishmael that are made by the three religions. It makes you wonder whether we will ever know the historical \\"truth.\\" It's much easier to simply accept your own religion's teachings through blind faith."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Using the vehicle of the author's personal journey to explore the historical Abraham, what Feiler has actually done is to take the reader on a journey of discovery through the common point of the Christian, Islamic, and Jewish faiths.All three religions place Abraham in a central role in their theology, and all agree he was an important prophet. All share the same geographical sites and (some of) the same stories.However, just as crucial as are the similarities, so to are the differences--both theologically and geographically. The three religions can not agree on even the simplest fact of which son Abraham sacrificed. Thus, representatives of all three religions battle metaphorically for history, and concretely for geography.Feiler clearly has problems with the Muslim interpretation--suggesting that it has the least room for tolerance with the other two versions of the story of Abraham (and notes the lack of a central Islamic authority figure who could suggest a revision). However, having also just read \\"The Trouble with Islam Today\\" (Irshad Manji), there are clearly others who disagree.A powerful (and powerfully written) book, despite its biases and short comings."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This book is beautifully written, insightful, compelling and provocative. Everyone, be they Jew, Muslim, or Christian should own a copy.For me, there has never been a conflict between Judaism and Christianity. God is saving the world through the Jews, and he started with Abraham. I've never understood how anyone who calls themselves Christian could harbor hatred toward the Jewish people; the Jews gave us Christ, and Christ gave Himself to the world. The message is one of inclusivim, not exclusivity, and those who wish to emulate Christ OR Abraham, must reach out to those around them, regardless of race or religion.To me, Abraham is an example of faith we must all follow. He was a man, not a Jew, Christian or Muslim. He made mistakes, many of them, but God never abandoned him. To me that is the greatest hope of all; God's grace does not depend on our perfection or adherance to a litany of rules. He was humble without being overly pious; he was simple in his execution of his faith without being pedantic about it. It was a way of life for him, service and sacrifice to God without getting bogged down in a bunch of meaninless arguments and details. That is the Abraham we should all seek to emulate."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"Feiler weaves a fascinating a tapestry depicting Abraham, drawing on history, religious text from three faiths, fable, interviews, and personal experience. He begins by describing Abraham's calling as a universal religious symbol that ties together the world's three major monotheistic religions, progresses through the many versions of Abraham's story which evolve into a struggle to \\"own\\" Abraham, and concludes by drawing the diverging stories back to a common theme of inclusiveness.Though parts of the book may be too flippant for deeply religious readers, overall, Feiler successfully attempts to balance reverence for sacred texts and critique of their apparent evolution. Likewise, he delicately navigates a minefield of political issues related to the story of Abraham and its impact on the Middle East. He achieves this by quoting individual interviews of an eclectic group ranging from religious leaders and Harvard professors to shopkeepers and taxi drivers, essentially creating dialogue between people who would otherwise never engage in conversation together.I don't take issue with the lack of scholarship or the dearth of references in the book as that is exactly what makes the book so accessible and universal. If anything, the approach appropriately reflects the theme the book. This is such an easy read that it would be a wonderful choice for any book club."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"By Joe Thomas, from http://www.ragingliberal.orgThis is a book that sat on my shelf for almost a year. I got it through one of those paperback book clubs when I forgot to tell them I didn't want the selection of the month, and when the cover said it was by the author of Walking the Bible, my own prejudice about titles like that gave me an excuse to hold off on it for a while. But recently, as I was trying to minimize my possessions through some donations, I figured I'd read it quick before turning it in. It didn't seem long so I thought I could get through it quickly and besides, I have a strange psychotic disorder that makes me feel odd about giving up a book that might have a little merit without having read it. All those brave people who tried to instill in me a love of reading did their job, maybe a little too well. The bottom line-after reading it, this book didn't go on the donation pile.Feiler begins his book with typical vignettes of Jerusalem: trains of people separating into groups of Jews, Christians, and Muslims, wending their way to some of the holiest sites of their respective religions. He quickly moves into a narrative of his personal journey to discover who Abraham really is, and what he can do to bring peace to his descendants who have become not a great nation, but several rival states.While Feiler's knowledge and use of the religious texts from all three traditions is appealing to thinking religious person and those interested in learning more about the world's three most populous monotheistic religions, his descriptions of the current state of affairs in the Middle East are most interesting to the student of politics. The interviews with individuals and the discussion of the larger issues involved bring the situation to life like nothing else I've read or seen. All the usual suspects are present. The Israeli who believes peace will never come without compromise. The Jewish settler who has every wall and window in his home sandbagged to prevent his family's being shot. The Muslim imam if a mosque in Palestine who calmly tells Feiler the attacks of September 11 came from God. And the &quot;radical&quot; Muslim cleric, who while preaching a hard line on issues such as the right of return, can still come to the conclusion that, &quot;If we look beyond the details, which we may disagree about, and follow the principles of Abraham-truth, morality, and coexistence-then most of our problems will disappear.&quot;This book doesn't have the answers, but it is an insightful journey that could help us find the right questions."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"This is a review of the audio book, not the book itself.

I don't recommend this audio book"},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"In &quot;Abraham: A Journey to the Heart of Three Faiths,&quot; author Bruce Feiler examines how Judaism, Christianity, and Islam tell the story of the Biblical patriarch. He notes that the Biblical account provides few details, allowing each religion to fashion a patriarch according to its changing needs throughout history. He reveals important parallels as well as key differences, and organizes his presentation around the tension between the idea of Abraham as the inventor of a universal faith in one God versus each religious group's desire to stake a unique claim on the patriarch.In general, it was an interesting if lightweight overview. Needless to say, if you will be offended by an essentially historical approach that stands outside the tenets of any particular faith, you won't like this book.Given the weighty subject, I was surprised at what a quick, easy read this book was. This may be attributed to the author's very well-organized presentation, but also to a rather oversimplified approach. I was also surprised by the author's optimistic conclusion that the three monotheistic faiths can use Abraham as a point of commonality to bridge their differences when millennia of sad experience (as reviewed throughout the book!) suggest otherwise."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"As a Christian I am interested in the phenomenon of Abraham as the progenitor of three of the main religions on earth. Of particular interest was the portrayal of this character through the lenses of the two other belief systems that I am not so familiar with. In an easy to read format this is at once a book for the curious without the need for serious scholarship,and will therefore be appealing to a wide readership. Coupled with this is the current apetite throughout the world to understand better the problems of the middle-east and also the clarion-call for religious tolerance and reconciliation. All of this may be found in this book which will therefore guarantee its success as a money spinner.What I find disturbing is the tendency of the writer not so much to find the truth of Abraham, but how to reconcile the different faiths. There is the overarching but unwritten goal to find the common ground by which these three religions may be reconciled. It reminds me of the saying \\"peace at any price is too high a price\\" It seems to me to beg the question \\"is the reconciling of differences really worth the sacrifice of truth?\\"It seems never to enter the writers mind that actually one of the faiths representation of Abraham might actally be true as an historical fact and therefore is a sound basis for faith.The book never seriously offers Abraham as the embodiment of a life lived by the truth, and that to agree with a fabrication in the name of tolerance is actually to undermine the basis for living in harmony.Abraham as understood through the various \\"manipulations\\" of each of the different faiths theologians over a long period seems as far as I am aware to be represented fairly and without bias by Feiler, but to say that Feiler doesn't have any presuppositions or is indeed a neutral seeker of truth is a far different thing. In the end I have to say that what is tacitly ignored in this book is the fact that truth by its very nature is exclusive, but that is not a popular thought in todays pluralistic and relativistic culture. Not to explore the possibility that actually one of those views of Abraham is true and the other two false is a serious flaw in his work, but completely understandable, given todays religious climate.All in all well worth the read but disapointing in seeing the pervasiveness of the modern maxims in yet another author, move over Dan Brown :a) God is a construct of theologians.b)There is no such thing as absolute truth.C)Tolerance is more important than truth.d)To defer to tolerance is a guarantee of neutrality.e)To be intolerant of misbeliefs is to be bigoted.f)History is dependent on the flavour of todays revisionists."},{"Title":"Abraham","review":"I thought the book was very well written.

He is not special; he is not godly; he is not righteous. Yet God sought him because he was faithful and trusted he would rise to his lofty standards.Don't expect scholarly story. Feiler explores how the three religions viewed Abraham in throughout their history, and how those perspectives have changed. He seeks to unite the three monotheistic religions in a productive dialogue where they meet on the common ground their origins in Abraham.

Although lightweight in many areas, it covers a wide range of church history, which makes it very readable. Many topics may not go into as much depth as you like but there is enough to identify interest. This lack of depth is what makes the book so readable, never becoming bogged down in uninteresting topics, it keeps moving while providing stepping stones for additional reading.What I did not like about the book is its tendency to deviate from a mostly chronological presentation. I found this was particularly annoying in the first several chapters. Later, I got use to it. There are \\"Protestant Pearls\\" (quotes) thrown throughout the book. Literally, they seem to have been thrown, having no relationship to the text. I think they should have been presented in the context of the relevant text.

Unfortunately, the style and quality of the book change abruptly beginning with Chapter 21 through to the end - and the change is definitely for the worse. That portion of the book covers the impact of the Protestant Reformation on North America. Since there are two authors, it appears to me that the work was divvied up between them, with one of them writing the bulk of the book and the other writing the last few chapters.

For those who think they know their denomination/religion and/or the protestant bible this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Reformation and Protestantism","review":"I bought this book while earnestly attempting to understand the Reformation movement. I really had nothing else to compare it to, but based on reviews of the same, I was trusting that this would accurately reflect the past and present status of this movement. In that regard, I found much of the information provided to be helpful and am grateful for that. However, being a Catholic, at first I was angry and then honestly had to laugh at many parts along the way. The misinformation and negative references to Catholicism were peppered throughout. Is there a dark history of the Catholic Church? Certainly -- who's debating that? But, c'mon folks, do you really think that all Catholics are bad, misled people going to hell? Honestly? In the spirit of ecumenism (referenced on page 345) I respectfully suggest to all readers that if they get to the end of this book and feel angered once again at us darn Catholics that they do what I am trying to do -- their homework -- to try and understand the other side. In that vein, I recommend you read the Catechism of the Catholic Church as an excellent resource if you are ever truly interested in learning more. Or, if you feel more comfortable doing so, I respectfully suggest you read anything by Scott Hahn -- a highly learned, respected non-Catholic Christian who, after doing his homework, converted to the Catholic Church. PLEASE don't short change yourself and assume, as these authors seem to imply with their continuous targeting of the Roman Catholic Church, that everything tied to \\"bad religion\\" in this world was and is still somehow the fault of the Catholic Church. You are taught, among other things, as Protestants to use the glorious brain God gave you to think, read and question (which we are also taught as Catholics, by the way, with the caveat that we need to augment this with a properly formed conscience) -- now is a great time to use it by reviewing the resources I suggested herein. God Bless."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"I have always desired more publications from homeschoolers that depict a realistic view of thier families. We homeschoolers aren't all perfect, headed for Harvard, or winners of the spelling bee! I desire more of the heartaches and failures as well as the triumphs and accomplishments. I say, Bring it on! Let's all really look at the lives of homeschoolers and see what needs improvement!That being said, this is not a good book to read. While I started with an open mind, I was almost immediately put off by the way in which this author depicted herself. The author prints terribly personal and not nice things about her ex-husband, (I also wince, as another reviewer stated, at the idea of her children reading these things about thier father, true or not) details about her children I am sure they have not appreciated her sharing, and through all of this, has not managed to say anything at all negative or humble about her own personality and character. SHe hasn't taken any responsibility for any of the sadness or disparity from which she and her family suffers so.An example of this : I almost fell over when she wrote that she did what she thought was best for her kids, and didn't care what her (then) husband thought because he wasn't around enough to contribute and therefor didn't have the right to an opinion.She never mentions the fact that but for his absence she wouldn't be able to be with her children full time.It was a very sad thing to say about one's husband and this kind of thinking is indicative of her tone throughout the book. She blames him (and others) for all bad and claims the victory of all the good.I wouldn't wish this book on anyone, and while I wouldn't burn the book of psalms (as another reviewer mentioned !LOL) I wouldn't be the first to save this book from the burn barrel.In short, don't waste your time. Try Rhonda Barfield's book for a more realistic depiciton of homeschoolers."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"Between the typos and the grammar errors, I am scared to death someone will pick up this book and use it against homeschoolers everywhere. Her life is messed up, her parenting is scary and her writing style is way below standards. She doesn't connect her stories, let alone her ideas. There is no way a college professor would let her turn this in.If you do read this, don't hold it against other homeschoolers. Most of us are better than this. We can write complete sentences and our parents are way more involved in our lives. There's no way I wouldn't stay in touch with my mom for more than a day, married or not.Not a good read and not a good example.A Teen in California"},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"A friend recently lent me this book for an opinion. As I read the book, I felt a vague sense of unease that was difficult to pinpoint. Some words that come to mind are irresponsible and selfish. It seemed as though she was looking at herself through rose-colored glasses. I am not able to recommend this book to anyone - especially new homeschoolers. There dozens of excellent books out there written by those who have successfully educated their children at home while adhering to a wide range of philosophies. This is not one of them!"},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"After taking a little while to get into the groove of this author's writing style, I found this book to be a gem of honesty and vulnerability. Connie Colten began her homeschooling when there was little or no information and during a time when people were under the threat of arrest at doing so. Her writing style does take a little getting used to, the journal feeling disjointed at times. Newcomers to homeschooling and unschooling in particular, or those who don't know anything about it would do better with a 101 book. This book is for those who are needing more substanance in their advanced reading. Every parent, every student, struggles with education as did the Colten family. Not every homeschooled child becomes a rocket-scientist, and not every public schooled child becomes \\"square\\" and boring. My own education left me completely bare when it was time to struggle through college, and my parents had no idea how horrible my education truely was, nor did they realize the severity of some of the relationships with teachers who yelled and belittled children in the classroom. I honor Ms. Colten for being real in her writing. I have also met her, and walked away from that experience thinking that I had finally found a woman who had enough love, experience and hindsight that I could see her as a possible mentor. This book may not be understood by those who are one-sided or biased, and is a gem for families going through similar issues and needing a personal and honest account of them."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"I did not like this book because the author seems to be a very unhappy person living with a dysfunctional family. She seems bitter that during the divorce between her and her husband, her daughter decided to live with her father. Another son and his wife she doesn't even speak too. It seems hard to read about a homeschooling experience that leads to such an unhappy end. The author tends to blame everyone else for these problems and I winced to think that she would print the things that she didn't like about her ex-husband for everyone, including her children, to read. I wish the author had taken a better look at herself and her role in the dysfunction in her family and solved a few of these problems before writing this book. This book unfortuantely can be very discouraging to new homeschoolers and in the end, I am sorry to say, I wish I hadn't read it.I did want to say that I thought the author has a talented way of writing and I hope she tries again in the future."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"Whew! What brutal reviews! I am not a fan of the diary style of writing presented in this book but found the authors honesty captivating. I'm sorry other folks who homeschool took such affront at Ms Colton's book, she was simply sharing her life, I don't recall her stating that this is how all homeschool families live. From what I can see families from all walks of life have these same problems no matter where their kids attend school.Also as the mother of a large family I know how hard it is to please every member. In many ways this is a sad book and I felt sad at the end, if this book is fiction she sure could have written a happier ending.For me this was more than a book about homeschooling, it was the story of a woman's life, warts and all."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"I got this book from another homeschooling mom. She said that she did not like it. So I thought I would read it. I would have to agree with Rachel! The only thing I found: If this dysfuctional family can homeschool anyone can! I think that the author seriously needs to look in the mirror for the answers to her problems and quit blaming everyone else. I would not pass this book along to anyone. I burnt my copy as I know others did as well. Overall book was a waste of my time. I hope that everyone in America does not think all homeschool families are this dysfuctional or really lacking in family moral."},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","review":"When I began reading this book, I almost wept, because it brought memories of all the reasons why we decided to homeschool. As we gain experience as homeschoolers, we often lose touch with what it was that inspired us to do it in the first place.Homeschooling is probably the most radical undertaking in our society today. And though I don't really enjoy chronicled or diary type forms of literature, I appreciate Ms Colten's willingness to let us in on this aspect of her and her family's lives.As for the dysfunction that led a previous reviewer to burn the book (good Lord, has the reviewer also burned the book of Psalms?), all I can say is that dysfunction has led to some of the finest and most inspiring art in the world. That isn't to say that I believe the author's family was dysfunctional -- but so what if it was?Nevertheless, sometimes dsyfunction can lead to some of the best humor, as when Ms Colten is dealing with the struggle (and who hasn't gone through it?) of having decided to homeschool, and she finds her child, Chris, crying on the bed. When she asks, \\"Do you want to go back to school?\\" the child's reply is \\"No, I just wish Shawn [a sibling] would go back to school.\\" Such light moments in the midst of intense struggles are worthy of being quoted in any homeschooling magazine -- even The Teaching Home (a fundamentalist Christian homeschooling magazine). I know I will drop that line at every opportunity.Ms Colten gets into her divorce, her home business, the public school shooting in San Diego at Santana High School, abortion discussions, support groups, homeschooling email lists, what sounds to be a cynical mother (who after hearing that Colten was going to write a book, replied with, \\"Good, now I can finally see how it is you teach.\\"), and challenging the status quo (like when she discovered the baby carrier which straps to one's back, as opposed to the standard stroller; the carrier was far more liberating for her and her child). She gets into TV viewing, divorce (she determined to put the children first by not disrupting the schooling arrangement they had), learning styles (one of her children was a late reader -- something not as unusual as the Zeitgeist would suggest, and something that typically freaks out the average parent, but not Ms Colten), food control, and challenging City Hall (her brother, an ambulance drive, had been killed on a particularly bad highway in Minnesota. Her activism -- daily in the presence of her children -- contributed to highway funding increasing considerably. Not her fist choice, which would have been for the authorities to extend the highway up to Canada, but definitely progress just the same).There is truly something for everybody in this book. Bits and pieces of what most of us have had to endure on this pilgrim's progress. The editing is sloppy in places, but that is to be expected from small presses.Ms Colten has set out a personal homeschooling chronicle and guide which can only help those of us who in this postmodern, and often lonely, world, need all the help they can get."},{"Title":"Jade (Fred Ward Gem Book Series) (Fred Ward Gem Series)","review":"There are not too many books on Jade, so I'm glad I found this one.

She brings this depth of experience alive on the page, as she explores the meanings of the various numbers and their vibrations.Shirley takes each number back to its Kabbalist Roots. She demonstrates how the meaning and energy captured in the original pictograms is still alive, if hidden, in the meaning of the numbers and letters we use today. The Example of how the Hebrew LetterAlph, which evolved into our letter A, is in fact a pictogram of an Ox's head, turned upside down. Now take that image, it is also a stylized picture of the female reproductive system. So A is tied intimately to the creative principle of the universe. This is just a tiny example, but letter by letter she lays bare why given shapes where chosen to represent different vibrations. Shirley's vision of numerology is rooted deeply in the tradition that sees number as vibration, and vibration as music. She will truly introduce you to the music of the spheres.Shirley's ease with the subject makes the style of this book very conversational, and yes that leads to a lot of anecdotal passages. Personally I find the anecdotal material one of the strengths of the book. Here we have the direct experience of a practitioner with 40 plus years in her craft. This is one of the best books I have ever read. Even if your not interested in divination now, by the time you finish the book you may well be! An author with a wonderful voice, talking passionately, and knowledgably about the craft she loves. It doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"The Secret Science of Numerology","review":"If I were to rate this book on marketing and appearance, it would get 5 stars. The cover is nice, the title is catchy, the paper is high quality, and the text is nice.But all that glitters is not gold. And maybe not even silver, or come to think of it, worthwhile. This book glitters, but definitely isn't gold.The main problems I had was that it is full of logical fallacies and irrelevant, anecdotal, and circumstancial &quot;evidence.&quot; Actually that's two problems. Big ones.But don't believe me because just *I* said so. Here's an example: she says that because the Hebrew equivalent for the letter &quot;h&quot; has a particular meaning within Kabbalistic Numerology (itself a distinction she slyly fails to make), the letter &quot;h&quot; in English therefore has the same meaning. Since when are different languages interchangeable? Next thing we know it'll be Greek, or better yet, Korean!And her &quot;evidence&quot; is largely anecdotal. Most people know that if you set out looking for something, you'll find it; if you have a preconception about the way it's supposed to be, it quite likely will end up being that way. And of course she found the &quot;evidence&quot; she needed to &quot;flesh out&quot; her dog- er, I mean beliefs. As such, her stories become very shaky &quot;evidence,&quot; at best circumstancial.This reminds me of another thing that bothered me a lot. Ms. Lawrence should probably study physics along with metaphysics; there are four elementary particles so far discovered: neutron, electron, proton, and neutrino. She also made several other scientific errors - perhaps the next version will correct those &quot;minor errors&quot; as well. Bad Science isn't such a big deal ... unless your book has &quot;Science&quot; in the title.All of this -[in my opinion] - thoroughly destroyed Ms. Lawrence's credibility.I don't have anything against Ms. Lawrence or numerology (I'm quite fond of the latter, actually), but it was seriously disappointing to buy this book and find it to be so uncredible. If I disregard what I knew both before and after reading this book, the &quot;hidden meaning of numbers and letters&quot; would still be &quot;hidden.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Secret Science of Numerology","review":"We find this book presents an interesting reader-friendly introduction to the historical bases and concepts of Numerology, including delightful discussions of concepts of potential energy vibrations associated with sounds, colors, words, numbers, etc., and how these vibrations may affect the energy fields, etc., in the world in which we live.

I've read two others, and this is gives a clear overview of what numerology is all about, connecting it to color and the alphabet. I call this book an overview because Pythagoras, who taught this science, had students who studied for years on the subject. One book can hardly make someone an expert, but Lawrence's book gives you an outline on the subject, what numbers are and how they relate to color and music.The book is nicely laid out in six parts with charts and figures throughout.Part One: The search and science behind it all, which includes the power of a name, of a word, the power of thought, and the fourth dimension to the influence of music.Part Two: Tracing the Roots; gets into Pythagoras(582 B.C.-507 B.C.) and his school: Disciplines, mathematics, music, astronomy/astrology(yes, they used to be studied together, bringing together the two sides of the brain, science and spiritualism), divination and freemasonry. The origin of the alphabet and an introduction to the mysteries including what that drawing of the mystical tree of life actually means.Part Three introduces you to the mystical letters.Part Four is about number groups and numbers and it's truly amazing how word totals have meanings. I couldn't help but think that someone far smarter than us had to invented our number/letter/musical system because they all correspond to each other.Part Five is about Keys to self-knowledge and word analysis, how to chart your own name, how a W means double-you just like it says. Makes you think of a certain president who actually went by just W. What's the meaning in that?Part Six introduces a new age inner guidance number. The Beta state; the Alpha state (using the creative principle of the Tree of Life; how inner guidance takes form; your color wheels.This book makes a great reference tool.

I edited this linked edition, so I am a bit biased).What makes Andrew Murray's book so good is that he says that prayer is an outgrowth of abiding in Christ and that our prayerllessness is fundamentally a lack of abiding, not simply a lack of prayer. In this way, he presents a challenging call to us to have a deeper Christain experience and out of that will flow a life of prayer.There are no how-to lists. There is little on how to pray.

In the counter-insurgency / low-intensity conflict arena there are many valuable lessons to be learned from this text, and for the armchair historian or casual reader the story is still gripping enough to keep you enthralled to the last page. Basically this is story of the birth and death of one of the most feared insurgency units of the time, as told by the founder of this outstanding unit; Ron Reid-Daly. It covers the units training, selection, operations, and personalities of the unit with the war being the tool that propels the story and evolution of the unit. One of the most remarkable aspects of Selous scouts was their employment of pseudo-terrorist techniques, which were used to melt into know terrorist cells, to either eliminate the terrorist themselves or direct other assets to the known cells to be neutralized. While conducting these type operations the Selous Scouts maintained the cover of being a combat tracking (mantracking) unit, as to keep their true purpose under wraps from the rest of the Rhodesian Security Forces. I would also like to point out they were truly all trained tracks and maintained this capability to superb levels of proficiency. This book is a re-release and completely revamped version of \\"SELOUS SCOUTS - Top Secret War\\" (original title). If you read the original edition you will enjoy this one much better. Many areas in the book have been rewritten and their many additions and details added to the text. Many of the names of individual have added into this text, originally kept exempt for security and safety reasons. Also there are many new photographs added and the Illustrations are a lot crisper. One of the biggest treats in this edition is the added appendix covering; roll of honor, wing nominal roll, awards and citations. Bottom line is this version truly opens the door to this once \`Top Secret\\" organization of combat trackers turned pseudo-terrorist specialist."},{"Title":"Pamwe Chete","review":"This is an excellent and comprehensive book on the Selous Scouts - a special forces unit based in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) during the 1970's. The book covers the history of the unit from the time its founder, Ron Reid-Daly, spent in Malaysia with C Squadron 22 SAS, to the end of the war. What is interesting is the high level of racial integration in the unit, and the use of 'turned' guerillas. In some cases captured guerillas were turned, briefed and back in the field within hours of capture.While the unit's informal approach to standard military discipline made it shunned by the high command the unit had stunning military successes, especially with cross-border raids to target enemy bases.This book is a must read for anyone interested in the bush wars in Southern Africa in the 70/80's and terrorism in general. Special forces soldiers could learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Pamwe Chete","review":"Pamwe Chete offers the reader information that has never been divulged regarding the legendary special forces teams of the Rhodesian Security Forces.The author Col. Ron Reid-Daly founded the unit at the request of his superiors during the bloody guerilla bush war taking place in Rhodesia during the 1970's. Rhodesia which had gained its independance from Britain in 1965 was being infiltrated and attacked by numerous communist factions operating from bases in neighboring Mozambique and Zambia.The Selous Scouts were named after Frederick Courtney Selous, a famous hunter, explorer, and soldier that was killed fighting the Germans in Africa during World War I. The Scouts were such a top secret, anti-insurgancy fighting unit that many of the senior officers in the Rhodesian army were not privy to the details of their tactics and operations.Col. Reid-Daly details the history of the unit from its formation to its disbandment towards the final days of the war. He includes anecdotes and stories of the major operations the scouts were involved in during the war. The scouts were responsible for over 68% of the total enemy casualties during the war.This book is interesting reading for anyone that is interested in studying the breakup of colonialism in Southern Africa or highly trained special military units."},{"Title":"Pamwe Chete","review":"LTC Ron Reid-Daly has written a superb book on the finest killing machine in Africa, the Selous Scouts.

This group of highly skilled black and white operators wrecked havoc on the guerilla forces inside and out of Rhodesia. Because of his availability to intelligence Reid-Daly also gives the reader a overview of the conflict and the politics behind the decisions.

It had been about twelve years since I'd picked up my dusty, tarnished flute, and I admit that I had forgotten everything I learned. After the first few lessons, I was hooked again! My husband was shocked that I could remember so quickly, but it's not me, it's the book!The book goes through the necessary steps including how to make a sound (which is easier said than done), fingering, charts, and the language of music. It is simple, fun and you'll be anything but frustrated! It may be a bit juvenile (come on, the first songs you learn are &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot; and so on) but it is still a very worthwhile investment.

But for those who can, this is the stuff. \\"Lord Royston's Tour, \\" to name one, is the funniest and best story in the English language. I made a fool of myself giggling at it in a laundromat. . ."},{"Title":"Almost No Memory: (Stories)","review":"While Lydia Davis can crystallize so much in a short short, her metafictional style begins to cloy. It may be the first person point of view, or the use of present tense, or the constant references to what the character is writing at that moment, but so many of these stories sound like they flow from the author's journal, rather than from a planned fictional arc. Frequently they are mere moments, rather than stories in which something happens, and leave this reader--who picked up the book looking for something more daring--longing for the traditional. Overall, this was disappointing."},{"Title":"Almost No Memory: (Stories)","review":"Lydia Davis's second short stories collection displays a fine tuning of her talents for minimalism. In the 51 stories - some short, and some shorter - \\"Almost no memory\\", she digs deep into the human condition and the beauty of everyday life. Each word counts and makes a point.\\"Lord Royston's Tour\\", for instance, is a beautifully traveling account through Eastern Europe. This is story is placed right after \\"To Reiterate\\", a single-page comment - rather than a story - about traveling accounts. Story after story resonates in the reader's mind, because together they bring a mural of human life. Some of them are interconnected by characters and/or places.In \\"Almost no memory\\" Davis uses a fist person voice that makes the stories sound like confessions, as if she was opening her heart to the reader. In her first book, \\"Break it down\\", she also uses this approach that is very effective in her hands building a straight connection between writer and reader."},{"Title":"Almost No Memory: (Stories)","review":"After having stumbled upon Lydia Davis three years ago, I read every one of her books, and fell quite in love with them. I proceed, as though I am reading a list. Every detail is a full bite. There are no flowers; it is not sentimental. Her prose is simple and clear. When I am finished, there is such incredible meaning that I am surprised by what I have found, and how easy it was to get there. That is a true pleasure.This short story collection is my favorite of them all. It includes \\"The Mice\\" and \\"The Professor,\\" two of her absolute best. Lydia Davis is a master of the everyday. She places her finger on the spot where our actions speak of our emotions, and reading her creates such a resonation, gives such weight to the simplest act, because when I read it, I know it. I recognize the act, and the paranoia, or the hurt, or the confused love that is behind it. I know the subtle emotions that are drawn on the line of the moment. She writes as though she knows the excuses we make, the way we cover our weaknesses.Some people find her short forms troubling. But I find them very comforting. That she can bring an idea to completion in a few sentences is incredible to me. There is a weight in each of them, and they feel to be very carefully considered and broad, rather than accidental and finite.These are brave and unusual stories. I find it easier to approach her with suspicion, to question whether in fact, she is writing about a mouse, or a house, or a fish in a tank. She is brilliant and, all at once, like everyone and no one I know."},{"Title":"Almost No Memory: (Stories)","review":"This collection of 51 short stories, little fictions, and prose poems by Lydia Davis intrigues and rewards. The pieces come in every length. There's the 46-word \\"Odd Behavior,\\" and at the center of the book, Davis gives us a forty page story, \\"Lord Royston's Tour,\\" an extraordinary period travelog, written perfectly in the syntax and idioms of early nineteenth century Britain: \\"...a good deal tossed and beaten about off the Skaw, before sailing up the river.\\" We learn in after-credits that the tale was adapted from a memoir Davis found, written in 1838.She employs many styles, tones, and voices. The pieces come variously comic, peculiar, tragic, surreal, mysterious, whimsical, quirky, lyrical, cerebral, and earthy. Some are faintly Kafakaesque, Borgesian, Beckett-echoing, and most have plenty of Davis's originality. Some are very ambitious, others narrow in intent. Each defines its own terms as a fiction. If the reader finds one piece less than compelling, he eagerly continues, if only to see what she will come up with next. And is soon again enthralled. There are meta-fictions, such as \\"The Center of the Story,\\" and a number of the pieces seem to be written for an audience of writers and sophisticated readers. Other pieces aim more broadly.In \\"This Condition\\" the narrator conveys a state of generalized erotic feeling. It's lovely, sexy writing, a prose poem, with no single object of desire-- sexuality finding its echo in the universe of animals, minerals, vegetables; ideas, maps, texts. A sort of erotica for the lover of life.In \\"The Professor,\\" Davis's narrator, teaching English out West, reveals a fantasy of marrying a cowboy.\\"...I started listening to country Western music on the car radio, though I knew it wasn't written for me.\\"She fastens on someone in her class who, though he'll have to do, doesn't quite fill the cowboy bill:\\"The facts weren't right. He didn't work as a cowboy but at some kind of job where he glued the bones of chimpanzees together. He played jazz trombone...\\"They have one odd date together, but nothing comes of it, and now years later, our professor, married and living back East, still finds herself subject to the cowboy daydream. Davis ends on a delightful goofy/comic note:\\"I'm so used to the companionship of my husband by now that if I were to marry a cowboy I would want to take him with me, though he would object strongly to any move in the direction of the West, which he dislikes....\\"\\"It would end, or begin, with my husband and me standing awkwardly there in front of the ranch house, waiting while the cowboy prepared our rooms.\\"This collection exemplifies the wild and wonderful possibilities in very short fiction where the only real rule is: Make it good. Davis knows how."},{"Title":"Almost No Memory: (Stories)","review":"Far superior to &quot;Break it Down.&quot; The stories are clearer, more enjoyable, the lengths are perfect, the language is wonderful.

Her voice is a departure away from the usual and that is refreshing, but I could'nt get over the feeling that anyone might sit down and write something much like this. There are some books I have not enjoyed at first reading, only to go back to them at another time, in another mood and found that my feelings had changed. I am sorry to say this was the case with Almost No Memory.

Davis is indeed, a good writer, but, I feel nothing for these sketches and the characters that inhabit them. If she is portraying the emptiness that so many people feel today, then she is masterful! But, what strikes me more than anything is a formula that she has contrived to be her 'style' and this leaves me very cold and amused that so many find this type of writing anything more than a mental exercise on the mundane. Her deliberate lack of emotion and endless trivial details in these stories leaves very little in my own mind or heart to mull over.

Tessa Delacantro is the baby in a family of three. She is accustomed to being looked after by her older brother and sister. She's been doted upon, perhaps a bit too much. Finally, she's struck out on her own - so to speak. Her older sister lives in the apartment right next door and photographer big brother is just a phone call away. But Tessa has her pride. She drives an older, unreliable used car instead of allowing her family to buy her a new one. She works at a temp agency doing accounting work. The temp agency is because she seeks adventure, change and challenges. All things that have led to her current position working for a billionaire playboy. Her boss is heading out of the States for a holiday and Tessa is scheduled to watch his mansion for him. I mean, what could be more fun than house-sitting for the rich and famous? How about walking in on the middle of an armed robbery, and then being thrown into a small space with a younger, more handsome version of the boss man? Not much.Reilly Ledger has had a chip on his shoulder for a long time. He thinks his father got his mother pregnant then bailed on the family. Now, years later he's trying to get back into their life. Reilly doesn't like it. He goes to his father's to have a little chat with the man, but interrupts an armed robbery. He takes out several of the offenders but is then taken by surprise, knocked unconscious, and thrown into the servant's quarters. When he wakes a cute young thing is in there with him. He assumes it's another of his father's flings. Much to his surprise, he finds she is his father's employee.You think that's a lot? That's only the first couple chapters. So much more happens, but I hate spoilers. Jill Shalvis is fast becoming one of my must have authors. Though Tessa is not a heroine I would normally root for Shalvis has done such a magnificent job of making her a well-flushed character, I couldn't help but smile and root for her. And Reilly?

However, no one warned Tessa Delacantro how dangerous house sitting can become. Armed robbers invade the home leaving a frightened Tessa stuck in a frozen room with her only potential warmth being the other prisoner, her employer's son CPA Reilly Ledger. Sharing a small bed and a need for warmth leads to the most passionate evening either ever had.Former CIA agent Reilly manages to get Tessa out of the potential hostage mess. Afterward, both agree the cold and the moment brought the heat to equatorial levels, but that was last night in the wrong bed and this is freedom and the morning after. Still, neither can forget the best night of their respective lives in spite of the danger, but Reilly believes that a good woman like Tessa deserves a more grounded and safer person than someone like him guarding her heart and still trying to mentally come in from the cold.BACK IN THE BEDROOM is a heated humorous romance with some early suspense that readers will fully enjoy and be tempted to search for Jill Shalvis' back list (worth the effort). The story line is fast-paced as the enchanting duo sing \\"I'm Not In Love\\", but cannot get enough of the other.

He argues for taking events and the process of becoming as the starting points for analysing reality. This organic interpretation is not simple, but it does make more sense than the abstract concept of matter as assumed by scientists and philosophers for so long.Whitehead criticizes the idea of nature as a mere aggregate of independent entities, each capable of isolation. According to this idea, by their accidental relations entities form the system of nature. In this theory space might exist without time, and time without space. The relational theory of space is an admission that space without matter or matter without space cannot exist.But the seclusion of both from time is still accepted. Whitehead's alternative is that nothing in nature could be what it is except as an ingredient in nature as it exists. There cannot be time apart from space, because every event forms part of a whole and is significant in the whole. Likewise there can be no space apart from time.Our knowledge of nature is an experience of activity or passage. Events are active entities; their relations with one another differentiate into space-relations and time-relations. But this differentiation is comparatively superficial, since time and space are each partial expressions of one fundamental relation between events, which is neither spatial not temporal. Whitehead calls this relation Extension: it is the relation of including and does not require spatio-temporal differentiation.I found the book extremely challenging to read and had to go back constantly to re-read and properly assimilate previous passages in order to proceed. And Whitehead uses mathematical formulae that I am not familiar with. But people with a solid grounding in the natural sciences will have no such problem. A determination to understand at least some of this great man's ideas was certainly rewarded in reading and studying this book.The chapters are titled: Nature and Thought; Theories of the Bifurcation of Nature; Time; The Method of Extensive Abstraction; Congruence; Objects; Summary, and The Ultimate Physical Concepts. The book concludes with an index."},{"Title":"The concept of nature (Ann Arbor books)","review":"The great thinker Whitehead made contributions in the fields of education, logic, mathematics, metaphysics, philosophy of science, physics and theology. Whitehead's process philosophy was developed into process theology by Charles Hartshorne in works likeThe Divine Relativity.This 1920 publication consists of the Tarner Lectures in the philosophy of science that feature Whitehead's assessment of the impact of Einstein's theories on nature. He argues for taking events and the process of becoming as the starting points for analyzing reality. This organic interpretation is not simple, but it does make more sense than the abstract concept of matter as assumed by the scientists of his time and many philosophers.In his work of the previous yearAn Enquiry Concerning The Principles Of Natural Knowledge, Whitehead explains the method of extensive abstraction. This method of abstraction defines e.g. a formal element like a point in terms of a series of similar shapes encompassing and extending over one another. These and similar thoughts are further developed in The Concept of Nature.Rejecting the dominant dualism, Whitehead defined nature as that which is disclosed in sense experience. This does not mean the simple awareness of particular sensations but instead a profound consciousness of a spatio-temporal passage occurring in nature. Within this passage or movement, he distinguished between events and objects.Events are occurrences that, while they may overlap, are born and then pass away. Objects on the other hand are constant and may be considered as recurring patterns. Whitehead ascribed the uniformity of nature to pervasive patterns providing the quality of permanence.He rejects the idea of nature as a mere aggregate of independent entities, each capable of isolation. According to this notion, entities form the system of nature by their accidental relations so space might exist without time and time without space. The relational theory of space is an admission that space without matter or matter without space cannot exist.But the separation of both from time is still accepted. Whitehead's alternative is that nothing in nature could be what it is except as an ingredient in nature as it exists.

The book concludes with an index.Whitehead's more accessible works includeReligion in the Makingwith its beautiful definition of the Eternal Divine andAdventures of Ideaswith his thoughts on inter alia history art, beauty, truth, freedom. He cautioned against complete certainty and rigidity of thought, warning that evil results when mankind transforms the partial truths that we are able to discern into whole truths. This came to mind as I was reading Chantal Delsol'sThe Unlearned Lessons Of the Twentieth Centurythat echoes Whitehead's insight.For me, Whitehead's metaphysics resonate in the same way as that ofMichael PolanyiandFrithjof Schuon. His economic and political persuasions, derived from his observations on force, slavery, persuasion and commerce, reflect the views of the great economists of classical liberalism such asLudwig von MisesandFriedrich Hayek."},{"Title":"The concept of nature (Ann Arbor books)","review":"The subject matter of the Tarner lectures which comprises Whitehead's book THE CONCEPT OF NATURE, is defined by the founder to be \\"the philosophy of the sciences and the relations or want of relations between the different departments of knowledge.\\" Whitehead starts with an obvious need to define nature and defines it thusly: \\"Nature is that which we observe in perception through the senses.\\" Sounds simple and elegant, however, now having formed the baseline, the next 100 pages were for the most part over my head. Interesting read, but over my head.Okay, not entirely over my head. Some interesting quotes include \\"The relational theory of space is an admission that space without matter or matter without space cannot exist,\\" and \\"You cannot have a theory of rest without in some sense admitting a theory of absolute position.\\" I got those. There were also many other points--splitting hairs, really--that, although not immediately accessible, I still understood, like the difference between simultaneity and instantaneous, the discerned versus the discernible, and duration, moment, and time.If you were curious as to what an important 20th century philosopher philosophized about, and didn't want to read more than 100 pages, then this book's for you. If you're taking some time off to read a little, then, that too is a good reason to read this book.

She lays down the foundation on why the negotiation failed. It heavily focuses on the mindset and complexity of both nations. The Palestinians base their demands on their desire for domestic legitimacy and their experiences from the Nakba (when Israel was established and thousands of Palestinians left their homes in the Israeli territory after the Arab nations declared war on Israel). On the other hand Israel's mindset is heavily on national security, and fear of actions by the surrounding Arab nations. In the conclusion Wittes clearly lays out her thoughts on why the negotiations failed and what she recommends to do in the future. This book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in trying to understand where the violence in the Middle East stems from and why the negotiations during the Oslo Peace Process have failed. I strongly recommend this book to anyone studying global negotiations as it clearly lays out a great example of the complexities of negotiation."},{"Title":"How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Oslo Peace Process (Cross-Cultural Negotiation Books)","review":"For the reader who is already well versed in the Oslo and Camp David II negotiations much of this book will be rehash because much of the information is a thumbnail sketch of the negotiations, so in that sense the book isn't revelatory at all, but what the book does do very well is give readers insight into why the negotiations played out the way they did. One of the aspects of these negotiations that is so wrenching is the fact that so many times the two sides came so very close to agreement that it seemed to be an assured thing, but then failure would inexorably but freed from the jaws of success time and time again. For those who read in detail about these negotiations or study them intimately it is excruciating.What this book does is help answer some of those questions about why the two sides could come so close only to see, seemingly, trivial items lead to failure. Tamara Cofman Wittes brings experts from the U.S., Palestinian and Israeli perspective into this volume to discuss the cultural problems that confronted each side in their respective negotiations. Once again for the intitiated reader much of this will be common knowledge such as Israeli over reliance on security matters, to Palestinian paracholiasm and back biting, to the U.S.'s misunderstanding of the needs of both sides, but this work focuses in on these factors and eplores them exclusively which really brings them into a new light. Instead of isolated incidents creating small ripples in the negotiating waters, one really sees how these cultural cues had a much larger role to play becoming waves that helped to sink the negotiations.What is really good about this work is that each expert really explores their sides mistakes with an honesty rarely found in this dispute. This honesty and focus provides a clarity to the role cultural elements play in this dispute. I found this work to be highly enlightening and a very quick read as well. All four contributors write do a great job, and Tamara Cofman Wittes does and excellent job tying all the threads into a single idea that is cogent and powerful. I definitely recommend this important book."},{"Title":"How Israelis and Palestinians Negotiate: A Cross-Cultural Analysis of the Oslo Peace Process (Cross-Cultural Negotiation Books)","review":"I certainly was wondering what a book with this title could be about. After all, Israelis want and need peace. But they can accept no substitutes. Arabs probably want peace too. But some of them prefer to deny human rights to Jews. And that includes Arafat's gang of thugs. When those folks make it to a negotiating table, nothing good comes of it.But let's see what the authors have to say about all this!William Quandt seems to exist in a fantasy world. To him, all the negotiations so far, UN resolution 242, Madrid in 1991, the Oslo accords, the Beilin-Abu Mazen understanding, and so on, are reality. To me, they are a big and silly joke. And the issues they discussed: Hebron, Gaza, Jerusalem, refugees, and so forth, are to my mind minor and irrelevant. If Arabs are willing to abide human rights for Jews, these issues will be settled easily. If not, there will not be peace.Quandt speaks of \\"painful concessions.\\" That indicates to me that he's not playing with all 52 cards. Is peace and prosperity somehow more painful than death, destruction, and poverty?Omar Dajani explains that the Levantine Arabs see themselves as deserving of victory. After all, the situation is that a giant is facing down by a dwarf (actually, I have no idea which one he thinks is the giant). He complains that the Arabs often had no plan in the negotiations, and sometimes agreed \\"to concessions at the eleventh hour.\\" Really! I can assure him that I would have given his team all the time in the world, and more, to prepare a plan. My feeling is that Dajani made some good points: the Arabs did indeed give many people the feeling that they were not serious about reaching a deal. I know that had I been on their team, I would have wanted to reach a deal, even if I intended to break it. And I think there it was a real problem for the Arabs to decide what they really wanted as well as to decide if they ought to ask for what they actually wanted.There is a strange article by Aharon Klieman. He suspects that the West Bank is being used as little more than a bargaining chip by Israel for \\"security tangibles.\\" That's possible, of course. And he lists four things that bothered the Israelis about the Arab negotiators:1) Arab insistence on sole victimization and full entitlement2) Arab refusal to accept compromises or make counteroffers3) Arab intolerance for fundamental Israeli rights and claims4) Arafat's demand for the \\"return\\" of Arab refugees not to a new Arab state, but to Israel, as well as Arafat's absurd claim that there was never a Jewish Temple in JerusalemStill, isn't there something missing here? Such as the constant anti-Israeli rhetoric by Arab leaders and media? And the hate taught to Arab schoolchildren? Klieman seems to have overlooked all this. And we see the result when Klieman is unable to understand Barak's reaction to the failure of the Camp David talks. Barak complained that in Arab culture, lying creates no dissonance. \\"Truth is seen as an irrelevant category. There is only that which serves your purpose and that which doesn't. They see themselves as emissaries of a national movement for whom everything is permissible. There is no such thing as \`the truth.'\\" Klieman wonders why Barak would say such a thing. I'm not wondering at all: he observed the Arab negotiators doing just this and he didn't like it. He was frustrated with all the lies. Klieman must be blind not to realize this. And it is outrageous for Klieman to find fault with what Barak said without even discussing how accurately it might apply to the Arab negotiators.Tamara Wittes talks about a \\"clash of worldviews\\" between Arafat and Barak. I think she's right about this. I think we're not talking about a disagreement over facts. I think we're talking about a more fundamental issue. And I think Arafat was a racist who believed that Arabs had a Divine Right to oppress non-Arabs in general and Jews in particular, while Barak believed that Arabs and Jews ought to treat each other as fellow humans with equal rights. Of course, that's not quite what Wittes means. She seems to think of Arafat as wanting to focus on \\"justice,\\" although I must admit that she did use the more accurate term \\"pan-Arab issues.\\" And of Barak as wanting to focus on security issues.I claim that the reason there was no peace was that the Arabs refused it. But why was there no piece of paper? I have to admit that I expected at least an agreement, even if the \\"peace\\" it produced lasted for only a few microseconds. Wittes offers three explanations:1) It was just too hard; the gap between the two sides was too great on issues such as the Old City of Jerusalem or Arab refugees2) The personalities of the participants was too much of a problem3) There was a failure to communicateWell, that's enough for this book. I'd prefer a more stimulating and academic topic. I think even a tome about the number of angels that can dance on a microdot would be more enlightening."},{"Title":"An inkeeper's diary","review":"Thanks for this copy of an old novel, that I learned about during a trip to England where I stayed in some old inns and b & b's...It was written in such a way that I felt a kindred spirit to the author,since I had visited some of the area. Ialso read a lot of the Regency period books and can see where some of those authors get some of their background for their stories...The condition of the book was in excellent shape, and will be a keeper in my personal library."},{"Title":"Cannibals and Christians","review":"This is a collection of Mailer's work from 1960-66 and includes political articles, book reviews, a couple of stories, a few interviews, and some of the worst poetry ever written. Most readers either liked or hated Mailer, but whatever side of the fence you came down on it was impossible not to realize, even appreciate, the seriousness of his intent. Probably a quarter of the book is in some way concerned with Lyndon Johnson, and although he is highly critical, especially concerning events in Vietnam, he is also respectful and deeply reflective. Mailer also writes about the Kennedys, NYC politics, architecture, and a number of writers, including James Baldwin, Mary McCarthy, and Philip Roth among others. Of the interviews (one of which appears to be made up by Mailer), the best is the Paris Review one, where he is at his most speculative and ruminative. The stories, one a SF experiment, are forgettable, and the poetry, which is sprinkled throughout the book, is embarrassingly bad. The non-fiction Mailer represented here shows the author in full stride."},{"Title":"Cannibals and Christians","review":"...and the kind of writer that one either loves or hates. However one reacts to his turbulent personal life -- which he never tried to keep separate from his writing -- his work always fascinates. He had insights that compel us to see events and ideas from fresh points of view, and he expressed himself in ways that will intrigue those who love the creative use of language."},{"Title":"Acts of the Anti Slavery Apostles","review":"This is an impressive volume in size and weight. It would look impressive on any bookshelf viewed by anyone who does not know its true worth. On a windy day you can use it to secure your blanket at the beach. The author Parker Pillsbury is mentioned often in histories of the abolition and anti-slavery movements. I am yet to discover why. On page 250 he explains the reason for this book. \\"This work is Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles, not history of the anti-slavery enterprise.\\" He explains people who have not lived through the period of the 1830's to 1860 can only learn of the heroism of these apostles through the \\"pictures\\" taken at the time and on the spot where these brave souls did their deeds. Very true. Unfortunately this is mostly the acts of one apostle and with his style of writing we soon tire of his recollections.Pillsbury, in many words, gives a cloudy picture of the part the church in general, all the Christian faiths together, played in promoting slavery or abolition. Reading a few pamphlets of 15 to 40 pages would do a much better job enlightening the uninitiated than lowing through these 503 pages. One enlightening fact comes to light. Pillsbury was made aware of a meeting to discuss the Christianity of church structure. He tells us in great detail of the moon being bright enough and the snow being of such quality that he and a friend were able to take a horse and sleigh to another friends house where they joined this good fellow and walked the rest of the way to the meeting. Oh, I forgot to say they left the horse and sleigh at the first stopping off place. The author did not forget this point. Are you bored yet? Now comes the juicy part. At this meeting, after intolerable prayer by some preacher, another rose and read a piece form a newspaper containing a study of Wm. Garrison's head by a phrenologist. I could cite many such interesting facts and apostolic acts, but why bother. If you have nothing else to do and no better way to invest your money, you can buy this book and read it for yourself.Many books that treat the relation between the church and slavery are terrible books because of their content. But for this reason they are interesting. This book is terrible because of its lack of content, its style is that of a want-to-be orator, and is therefore boring. If I knew how I'd change the rating from three stars to two. I hope this will keep others from wasting their money and time."},{"Title":"Clingman's Brigade in the Confederacy, 1862-1865","review":"Clingman's Brigade and its leader for whom it was named, has received a mixed assessment for their Civil War activities. Often on the losing side of engagements, the brigade has been ranked \\"below average\\" by some; Robert E. Lee, however, after the affair at Drewry's Bluff in May 1864, said that Clingman's men \\"did their duty well,\\" and Jefferson Davis, who witnessed Clingman's charge at the same battle, described it as \\"the most gallant ... he had ever witnessed.\\" Casstevens's purpose in this book is to examine the military activities of the Brigade in order to determine its impact on various battles and affairs. In this she does a credible, evenhanded, and thorough job.Thomas Lanier Clingman was a proud man from a proud family. A \\"scholar-soldier,\\" he was born and raised in North Carolina and loved nothing more than to wander the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains, mainly in pursuit of minerals and gems. He studied for the law and was elected to both the state and national legislature; he had no military training. Clingman's Brigade was formed late in 1862 and was sent to the eastern part of the state, where it saw its first action at the Neuse River (RR) Bridge near Goldsboro, in December. Ordered to protect the bridge, an overwhelming Federal force was able to capture it and burn it. Clingman and his men fought bravely, however, and blame for the failure rests on an insufficiency of men to do the job properly. Thus a pattern formed that attached itself to Clingman's Brigade like a curse: he and his men would perform their orders and their duty well, but circumstances beyond their control would intervene and diminish results.The Brigade also saw action at Battery Wagner, New Bern, the Wilderness, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and Globe Tavern, where Clingman was severely wounded in the leg and was out of the war until almost the very end. Like most fighting units, Clingman's Brigade had some successes, some failures; had luck and better planning been on their side at some engagements, they might have done better; they certainly could have done worse. Most of the time they did what they could under the circumstances, which might be high enough praise for anyone.Casstevens presents a very full picture of the Brigade and its leader. She is honest and shows the men in good and bad light, though usually presents an \\"excuse\\" for the group's failures (most seem reasonable). She also draws a thorough picture of Clingman himself, his years as a congressman and his character. My favorite description of him is from Mary Chestnut's Diary, where at a party she is critical of Clingman's dancing, which is \\"a serious business with him.\\" When his partner insisted on talking while they were dancing, Clingman told her, \\"Pray, withhold all remarks. It puts me out. I cannot do two things at once. If you will talk, I shall have to stop dancing.\\" Reams could be written about the man from that statement alone. Civil War buffs and historians will find much to appreciate and debate in this excellent regimental history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Leakeys: Uncovering the Origins of Humankind (Great Minds of Science)","review":"This is a great account of the lives of Louis and Mary Leakey and their professional achievements.This book entails the hard work and dedication it takes to answer some of life's most interesting questions, such as; When did our human ancestors first appear on earth? Loius is an anthropologist and Mary is anarchaeologist who together searched and made some remarkable findings. The book is great at depicting the successes and failures of the Leakeys."},{"Title":"The Colors of Memory","review":"Beautiful journey and enchanting characters make a great story. Very visual in her language because she's a screenwritter and movie director too.She directed a famous Mexican blockbuster called \\"Ladie's Night\\".Really worth a try."},{"Title":"Can You Choo-choo?","review":"My 21 month old son LOVES this book. It's always the one he choses to read. He loves to point to all the vehicles and name them. The colors, page layouts and simple sentences are perfect! I do wish the fire truck looked more like a fire truck, but I love the big airplace and the boat and the cars. This is a big hit at our house!"},{"Title":"Can You Choo-choo?","review":"Whether he's the author, illustrator or both, this guy rocks!!! This book is perfect for any little guy or gal. Big, bright illustrations, simple, yet engaging text, an all-around winner!We are going to use the adorable illustrations from this book to paint a mural in my 2 year old son's room. We had previously decorated his nursery with illustrations from a different, but equally adored, Wojtowycz-illustrated book, Rumble in the Jungle. We are even planning so far ahead for a 2nd child to have his/her nursery decorated in a Commotion in the Ocean theme.But enough about me, buy this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Can You Choo-choo?","review":"ISBN 0439394856 - Books for very young, budding readers abound but Can You Choo Choo? just has something a little special. The board book binding you might expect for toddlers isn't it, because this is an over-sized hardcover with paper pages just like other hardcovers. It isn't even the sounds, which have all been featured endlessly in other books too. I think, if I have to guess, that what this book has is author and illustrator David Wojtowycz.Illustrations in bright colors look more like felt cut-outs pasted onto a flat background, giving them a unique, attractive look. Each page features a vehicle and the sound it makes and near or in each vehicle is an animal (I find it funny that there's a pig on the police car page but that'll go over the heads of toddlers). Kids will love it and it's a super-fast read for those \\"hurry up and get in bed\\" nights.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Japan Unmasked","review":"It is amazing to read this book. It may be controversial, but after reading this, I strongly feel there has been much change in Japan since Mr. Kawasaki wrote this book in 1969. The Japanese people must not forget his messages."},{"Title":"Moon Basket (The Ghost Riders, Book 2)","review":"Samuel Keaton returns in book 2 of the Ghost Rider series to try to figure out a double murder in this fantastic mystery. He ends up chasing all over Wyoming and Colorado to sort out the whole mess. The plot is excellently written so that the reader can discover the clues and put them together just as Sam is doing. In addition, this book adds great characters like the Doc and Jake and explains more of Sam's past.Again, Sam seeks to uncover deeper truths. However, the truths he discovered in the first book don't seem to have been absorbed and he relearns half of what he should have already figured out. That can be a little tiring, but generally it isn't so bad.Finally, (perhaps I just did not get it) but the title of the book absolutely baffled me. Sure, it's referred to once or twice, but it didn't seem to fit with anything else. This irked."},{"Title":"Moon Basket (The Ghost Riders, Book 2)","review":"This is a very good book. It has action, adventure, even a little romance, and the main character is even searching for the meaning of life, which you don't find very often. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A diplomatic history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna (Harper's historical series)","review":"Although published over 35 years ago, this is a wonderful book. The title is somewhat misleading in that this is a global survey rather than one merely of Europe. It is also a general history of power relationships in the modern world, in their diplomatic, political, and military aspects, rather than a narrow history of diplomacy.At its core, this book tells a tragic saga, the self-immolation of Europe in two devastating world wars and the decline of European power from world dominance to near irrelevance. It also covers the rise of the USA and Russia to the status of twin super powers and, at its end, foresees the emergence of China as a mighty third pole. The bulk of the book covers the period from the Franco-Prussian war to the end of WWII and treats it, as it should, as a single arc of history. The author's command of the material is magisterial, and his tone of ironic detachment lends itself well to this convoluted story of human folly and brutality.This is a long book (695 pages) but goes quickly for anyone interested in the subject. The only other work I can think of to compare it with (in that both are popular yet supremely authoritative) is Tony Judt's marvelous \\"Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945.\\" In many ways, Ren&eacute; Albrecht-Carri&eacute;'s work provides an excellent background to understanding the postwar period and is a wonderful corrective for anyone foolish enough to believe that we live in a \`post-historical' time."},{"Title":"A diplomatic history of Europe since the Congress of Vienna (Harper's historical series)","review":"This book is easy to read and informative.
