The sometimes witty, often satirical, and always humorous quasi-science-fiction/fantasy story about a young man traveling the galaxy on an involuntary quest for the meaning of existence has managed to survive and remain startlingly current through an entire generation of changes in technology and literary trends.Arthur Dent doesn't have a lot on his mind other than surviving his hangover when he wakes up one morning to find that his house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a bypass. His objections are met with sympathetic indifference by the crew chief until he lies down in the mud in front of the offending bulldozer. What he doesn't realize is that the earth itself has been slated for destruction by the evil Vogons as part of the development of a hyperspatial express route. Moments before the earth disintegrates, Arthur and his secretly alien friend Ford Prefect escape by hitching a ride on one of the Vogon ships, and their journey begins.As Arthur and Ford and the improbable gang of galactic characters they join up with travel from system to system in search of the mythical planet Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer, they are guided by The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, an e-book that offers such insightful wisdom as \\"Don't panic\\" and contains articles on subjects such as the importance of towels as well as helpful information about various planets and species. Along the way, Adams hilariously lambasts everything from religion to art to politics to human nature.The story, while mildly entertaining, is not what makes the book work. Rather, Adam's sardonic narration and ultra-dry humor are what make it worth reading. Virtually every page contains at least one description or parodic exposition that makes you want to either laugh out loud or groan.Since the book doesn't have a message or even much of a plot, it might be hard for some to find a reason to read it. But those who enjoy British humor (think Monty Python) or want to see how the destruction of the earth can be so funny may well enjoy it. The good news is, if you really like it, there are four sequels, so you could potentially be laughing for a long time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've always thought of Monty Python as the Thinking Man's SNL. I now think of Douglas Adams as the seriously Thinking Man's Monty Python. The subjects it tackles are those of time and space. The jokes it makes are humorous, drawing snickers and belly laughs from the readers. The points it makes can even be thought provoking at times. The story is this. Arthur Dent is saved at the last minute from the destruction of the world by his friend Ford Prefect. Ford is not actually from the planet earth. He is an alien from a planet in Betelguese who is writing a revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. For technical reasons he has been stranded on earth for 15 years. They hitch a ride on a spaceship and their adventure takes off from there. I won't tell you the whole thing, I'd ruin some of the greatest jokes. I'll just tell you to read it. If you're interested in &quot;Destruction of the World&quot; stories, do yourself a favor and don't read &quot;Left Behind&quot;. Those books are boring and pointless, no matter how many times I've tried reading them. Read this instead. It's ultimately better. And shorter, for that matter!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This satire is probably the most hillarious book I've read. The one liners are so witty that I was actually laughing out loud while reading. All the folks who keep posting that they don't like this book don't seem to understand the concept of sarcasm. The characters are written as they are for a reason, there's no development for a reason. If you have a sense of humor and enjoy quick reads, this book is awesome."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Reading this book is absolutely essential to human existence, what more can I say?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you ever doubted that there was nobody funnier that the British then this book is Douglas Adams saying &quot;Eat your words!&quot; Every line brings it's own angle on reality, every word precisely chosen to reduce the reader to an hysterical blubbering mess. No other author has succeeded in writing a book that is so thoroughly detached from reality, and yet full of astoundingly cynical observations of human life. He systematically demolishes people who read too much into life, everybody from Jesus to Freud. The main thing you notice about the book however, is the style of writing, not the humour. This is an author who would be just as comfortable writing the biography of a physicist as writing a sci-fi novel about an alien and a neurotic broadcaster. Douglas Adams is a literary genius with a flair for the english language, and an obvious passion for storytelling. Buying this book is the best thing you could possibly do for yourself, after all, laughter is the best medicine."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you like reading, and have any sense of humor whatsoever, you will LOVE this book! The story line follows a mishappen Arthur Dent on his exploits across the Galaxy with his Beatlegeusian savior, Ford Prefect.

That makes five of them. I thought they were fantastic. Talk about a trip! I recommend the books to all of my friends. All I can say is grab these books, grab a towel, and laugh yourself silly. You will learn the meaning of life, how to fly, and the TRUE origins of humans. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Wonderful!! I've read all 5 books of the trilogy, but this one has to be the best (the last one was a bit depressing and the third and fourth just go on..and on...)

The gags are a work of pure genius and the characters are very well put. destined to become a classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Los Angeles Herald Examiner was right, this book is Wacky!

Douglas Adams is like no author I have ever read. It's not just the fact that the book is funny, it's the uniqueness of the humor. The atypical metaphors and off the wall observations are what make this book a must read. Even after reading all five books in the &quot;trilogy&quot; five or six times, I STILL enjoy every last word of each of them."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"....then &quot;Hitchers&quot; is for you.

The Earth is facing destruction. Before the Earth is destroyed, Arthur, along with his alien friend Ford Prefect, hitchhikes through space, using advice from the Hitchhiker's Guide. Arthur is thrust into situations where he loses limbs. At other times, he is suddenly thrown out into space with only 30 seconds to live. This book makes you reconsider the roles of animals, and their level of intellect and control over us. I thought this book was very good. This book is only one book in a series of five. If you watch the movie, be careful not to get too tied up with the story line, since the movie is based on all five books put together. If you cannot handle thinking outside the box, and do not like very random out of the blue conversations and situations, then do not read this book. If you can handle crazy, unrealistic, yet amazing ideas this book is for you. Moe Naynar"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No doubt about it, Douglas Adams created a force that has been able to cross many media forms in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Mr. Adams caught the true essence of good story telling, which made it a very quick and enjoyable read. I would love to hear copies of the radio show some day.My favorite mental picture from TH2G2 is that bureaucracy is just as screwed up in the whole of the universe as it is on planet Earth. I thoroughly enjoyed the description of Arthur Dent protesting the demolition of his house while Mr. Possner, the local bureaucrat, stood and thought, \\"Obviously somebody had been appallingly incompetent, and he hoped to God it wasn't him.\\" To then read about supposed higher life forms making the same errors, having the same inferiority complexes, and looking for the same easy exits out of the day-to-day hum-drum of earning a living is classic.Enjoy. Good story telling can be fun, which is what this book provides."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books ever produced. It should be required reading for all high school students as an example of British literature. Maybe I exaggerate but after 30 years it doesn't feel the least bit dated. I am dead serious when I say that Douglas Adams's Hitchhikers quadrilogy is to sci-fi humor what Tolkien is to fantasy.I can remember reading this book as a teenager and wishing I had my own Hitchhikers Guide. In a certain sense Douglas Adams was a visionary in that the Hitchhikers Guide is essentially a laptop and Wikipedia. Slap the words \`Don't Panic' on the case and you have a terrestrial version. The one complaint I've heard about the series is that there is no real plot which probably stems from the fact that it was originally written as a series of radio programs. It plays out like a literary version of Monty Python in that that overall plot is much less important than the individual setups for jokes. In literature humor is perhaps that hardest genre to pull off but Douglas Adams nails it. Hitchhikers is the kind of series that's so good it feels like the author made a demonic pact to briefly give him the talent to produce a book of near perfect quality. It would lend weight to my theory in that Mr. Adams was never able to recapture the magic that was the Hitchhikers Guide and after his two Dirk Gentry books seemed to just give up on producing novels. Alright, I don't actually think Douglas Adams made a deal with the Devil.Douglas Adams managed to pull me into the book so thoroughly that when the super-computer Deep Thought was preparing to deliver the answer to life, the universe and everything I half expected him to actually do it. For me the Hitchhikers Guide is about as close as a book has come to a mystical experience. This may well be my all time favorite book and I can give it nothing less than a perfect score."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book is written from the point of view of Arthur Dent, an Earthling who doesn't know much about the Galaxy. Arthur and Ford Prefect are beamed up from Earth into a Vogon ship. Unfortunately, the Vogons don't like guests, and throw them out of the ship. Fortunately, Arthur and Ford land into another ship, the Heart of Gold, which is piloted by Zaphod Beeblebrox (who also stole this ship from the planet Damogran), Trillian (who plays perfect foil to Zaphod) and Marvin the Paranoid Android (my favorite character). The five of them travel to the planet Magrathea, which they are curious to explore as its denizens create designer planets. There, Arthur learns about the Answer (to Life, the Universe and Everything), and finds out why the Earth was created, and other bits of fact like how human beings are only the third-most intelligent beings on the Earth. The book has some complicated scientific ideas but it is not necessary to understand them to enjoy the book. A fun read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a witty piece of fiction, written by the creative genius Douglas Adams. You definitely have to enjoy this particular kind of humor to fall in love with this book. It is absolutely random and there is no telling where the author is going to take you next. The answer truly is 42, and you should read the book just to find out what the question is. Perhaps a bit on the geeky side, it is very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Warning -- Reading this book will result in periodic outbursts of uncontrollable laughter!

By the time I was thirteen, I had read the entire series (some more than once). Space travel has always been looked at as either an abduction or a mission.

The two together would make one incredible book. It seems like the story really ends at the end of &quot;Restaurant&quot; and after that the series starts getting a bit worse, so at least read the first two. If you like this type of humor you'll probably also like the funniest nonfiction books ever written too -- Woody Allen's 3 books.

Funny that a satirical science-fiction novel has a hidden message!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sit down and hold on to your seats of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. This book is a satirical look at the way that governments work. The entire story is overflowing with British comedy. Most people in American society today do not understand the paticulars of that kind of humor. For some reason they do not find it funny. Hitchhiker's Guide is true to its British creator. The concept of the book was even funny, since it came to Adams while he was lying drunk in a field. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is intended to be a sci-fi, what with the aliens on Earth (well before it is destroyed in order to put in a pointless hyperspatial express route). The main characters are Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Trillian. Some of these &quot;people&quot; are very odd. Such as Zaphod, who is portrayed as completely insane. Ford is a dry character, put in for comic relief. Arthur is the stereotypical human, who is completely clueless in the ways of space. Trillian is also human, but she actually has a working brain. Adams manipulates words and characters to fit into his perfect little universe. He twists logic so that it is beyond recogntion. But that's what works for him. Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a woderfully satiric story that is worthy of the short time it takes to read the 143 pages of the book. Remember to have your towel with you, just in case the Earth is destroyed along the way and you are force to live the rest of your life in space, hitchhiking."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Superb and impeccable!

Was I moved? Was I changed forever by reading this book? Nah. Nothing like that.But I laughed myself sick, if that helps. Adams pokes fun at nearly everyone and everything, particularly those who want to take themselves seriously. I was skewered, but I was laughing so hard, I hardly noticed.So, if you've nothing better to read, I suppose this wouldn't be all bad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is another one of those books that is touted as a must read sci-fi classic (like Dune or Foundation). Invariably those books never live up to my expectations. Although I did like the Monty Python British type humor, the story wasn't that great or well written. Sorry, but I've read better (and funnier). The story ends abruptly without tying up loose ends, so I wouldn't consider this a complete story by itself. If anything buy the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide and read all the books as one novel. If you're looking for a bit of light reading away from all of the serious sci-fi novels and you don't have anything else to read, then give this a look."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A couple of the earlier reviews have called this book's satire dated.

All the cute nerdy boys I had crushes on in middle school carried this series around as though it were a bible. So, being an inquisitive young lass (and also trying to suck up to them) I forced myself to read the entire series too. Imagine my shock to discover they are just totally silly and pointless flights of fancy with little insight &amp; all the dated humor of a bad Monty Python sketch. I personally blame this book for my switch to dating obnoxious metalhead morons in high school and my 13yr aversion to an otherwise fascinating genre, science fiction. Read &quot;Whipping Star&quot; by Frank Herbert instead, if you're looking for comedic and zany sci/fi that's not empty-headed."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read HHGG way back in college. I thought it was engaging, hilarious, profound, etc. That's how I remembered it. I decided to give it a shot again, so I bought this nice, trim, hardcover edition from Amazon. I was sad to find that it just has not stood the test of time -- which is ironic for a book that plays fairly fast and loose with the concept of time. The humor may have worked back in a day when just about anything Python-esque was considered cutting edge. But unlike, say, Monte Python's Life of Brian -- which HAS stood the test of time and then some -- the Hitchhiker's Guide is, today, about as engaging, funny and/or profound as Jabberwocky. As with that lackluster Terry Gilliam flick, The Guide develops a compelling premise for cultural satire and philosophizing but, alas, bogs down in its over-reliance on a now-dated notion of what constitutes drollery. I know this evaluation amounts to sacrilege for HHGG's true believers, but the truth of my judgment can be demonstrated empirically.On the other hand, kudos to Adams for anticipating the iPad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't need to tell you that this book is amazing so I will leave it at that (if you don't agree, you probably take life too seriously).What you need to know is that this version, for the Kindle, does not honor the content. It is truly ugly. There was no thought put into the cover design (the image that Amazon posts for it on the Amazon.com is NOT the same that is delivered inline with the text, only the cover art) and the table of contents is a travesty. A book would not be printed with such shortcomings, it should not be digitized as such either.These may seem like trivial complaints to some, but this book and it's author deserve better."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide is light, fast-reading science fiction. Two earthlings and two aliens travel through the universe on a wild adventure.The plot is engaging, with a significant amount of random and disruptive twists. Offbeat and improbable are key descriptors of this work. This is escapist fiction, but it inserts a bit of pop-philosophical content of the physics variety from time to time. The author has a distinctive ironic style that you'll either enjoy be annoyed by. This is a funny book, using the characters, common modern man and the elites to humorous effects. It also serves as a time capsule of how earthlings in the 1970's viewed computers, space and the future.This is an enjoyable read for vacation, beach or late night consumption."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How many times have you asked a simple question and go the answer as \\"42.\\" Yep, you are a victim to this book.

He awakes to find a team of bulldozers parked outside of his house. He soon finds out that his house will be demolished to build an overpass. His friend Ford persuades him to relax and have a drink. He'll need it. Soon, a giant cube comes out of the sky. This is a Vogon ship, Vogons are ugly alien creatures with almost no compassion. They are here to destroy earth, to build an overpass. One minute later, Arthur finds himself aboard one of the ships with Ford. Ford turns out to be a humanoid from another planet who reports for a virtual book called the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Arthur is beginning to understand things until they are found by the Vogons. The Vogons then subject Ford and Arthur to the most horrible torture imaginable, poetry. Worst of all, they are thrown into space where they are rescued by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, his girlfriend Trillian, and Marvin, a very depressed robot on the starship Heart of Gold. On this ship, they go on an amazing adventure and discover the meaning of life, the universe, and everything. To find out more, read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.I really loved this book because it gets you to think about how simple yet complex life can be. This book also has a very strange sense of humor. The plot involves multiple twists and turns. This book is part of a series that I am in the middle of. This is also a complex book that will entertain anyone. So in the end, I would recommend this book to anyone, not just sci-fi addicts."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is about a perfectly normal man named Arthur Dent. His life is changed completely when his house gets bulldozed down and Earth gets blown up,to make room for an intergalactic highway. He and his alien friend Ford Prefect are picked up by the spaceship Heart of Gold and go on to completely improbable adventures around the universe.My favorite part in the book is when Ford and Arthur have just got picked up by the spaceship and a crowd of monkeys trying to write a Shakespearean sonnet attack them. I also like when they get to the planet Magrathea and are informed that the world is run by mice and that Earth is a planet manufactured for rich idiots.I would only recommend this book to people who get the point of not needing an explination for everything in life. I found it entertaining, since I like Monty Python, but some people might not get it at all. I will always remember one part in this book, and that is that the universe is always safer if you bring a towel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams illustrates a vast universe in an extremely humorous light. Much of the novel revolves around a particular book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which, instead of a novel, is actually what its title prescribes. The book follows the life of an extremely perplexed human, who one day awakens to find the Earth being destroyed by Vogon Constructor ships. He is then carried of into one of these ships by a long time friend who happened to be an Alien all along stranded on Earth. From this point on, he is constantly making new discoveries of the universe as he hitchhikes his way through vast amounts of space. The narration throughout this novel is clever and random and often lectures on completely irrelevant but increasingly comical facts. For example, the narrator at one point in the story explains the most popular drink in the galaxy, the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster. The effects of which, are like having one's brain smashed out with a lemon wrapped around a gold brick. The narrator finds deems it worthy to bestow the reader with these tidbits.The story is page-turning and exciting. Around every page there is a surprising new outlook on the fast developing story. Though there is a sharp lack of visual details, the dialogue paints a very visual image of the chemistry between the main characters. Some of which include a manically depressed robot and a two-headed galactic president. Each character has something excellently amusing to offer, and each have drastically distinguishing characteristics that make for an excellent combination of conflicting personalities. There is even a character named Slartibartfast.Adams takes on a very innovative tactic in this novel by making the narrator extremely personable and pointedly witty. The narration is what really makes this book such an entertaining read. Several times the narrator will read excerpts from the real Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Many of which are seemingly educational but are of course only relevant to one traversing the galaxy with nothing but a towel. According to the novel, a hitchhiker's towel is his most important possession. This is because when someone picks up a hitchhiker and they have a towel, it is automatically assumed that they also have a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit., etc.Adams' approach to antagonists in this novel is more than likely supposed to be the mice. According to the novel, humans are third most intelligent beings on Earth behind mice and dolphins. The mice are pandimensional beings that commissioned, paid for, and ran Earth. Ultimately they were seeking the ultimate question to the ultimate answer of forty-two, and earth was a 10 million year project to compute this question. The entire plot is comically sinister and complex and creative to boot. Adams did a fantastic job in illustrating an imaginary universe and concocting a very interesting tale for the human imagination."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVED this book! It was one of the best books I have read. If I could give it six stars i would. Douglas Adams is such a brilliant writer. He puts all the right combinations of humor and sarcasm in all the right situations. It was very intelligently written book that makes you question everything that is! And that British humor! You have to love that British humor! This book keept me laughing till the very end! I would recommend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in reading anything. Well I'm going to go read the other three now."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, let me say that this review is for the book itself, not for any given edition or printing.That being said, let the plaudits begin. When I say that this is where it all began, I mean it. The (very-innaccurately named) trilogy, the cult surrounding the books, my sense of humor and consciousness of the world around me; everything. (Of course, to be totally precise, the BBC radio show preceded even the book, but why split hairs.)I have probably read this book (as well as the other 5 in the series) at least 7 or 8 times, and it gets better with every read. There is so much in it, that every time I read it I can come at it from a different angle, and find something new, laughing the whole time.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" can't be called \\"irreverent,\\" because people usually use that word to describe pointless diatribes made up of bad logic, poorly worded; Adams' prose is impeccable, clever, and strong. He makes fun of humanity, and all that that entails. Nothing is sacred. And yet, Adams' brand of very British nihilism is so charming, one can't be offended.I won't tell you the plot, because this is a review, not a synopsis. But the premise, the idea, of this book, is to take a man, place him in totally alien environments, bounce him around the unfamiliar and frequently noisome universe, in order to draw out (and then skewer mercilessly) that which makes him, well, a man. Like all truly great science fiction writers, Adams succeeds in using the fantastic and whimsical to magnify the particularities of the personal. He doesn't beat you over the head with his philosophy at the end of it all, either; no proseletyzing here. He just shows you humanity in a petri dish.If all of this pretentious posturing sounds a little too cerebral for you, don't worry; this book works on many, many levels. At its heart, it is an adventure story of a man, his Betelgeusian friend, the girl he once loved, the 2-headed rock star who stole her away...ad infinitum. Each of the myriad characters in this bizarre galaxy is as colorful (and often delightfully despicable) as the last. Adams' masterful writing carries you through the travails of his protagonists as quickly and surely as their starship, the Heart of Gold, carries them through this vast universe we call home.In short, this book is funny. Very funny. (If you like Monty Python, you are bound to love this book. If you don't like Monty Python, there's still a pretty good chance you'll like this book.) And, if you let it, it can be profound as well.If you've ever wondered about the meaning of it all, the answer lies here. (Literally.) Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well, folks, it turns out that man is NOT the most intelligent species on Earth, after all. No, not dolphins either (they're number two).Follow the adventures of Arthur Dent, the second to last human being left alive after the Earth is demolished by the Vogons to make way for a \\"hyperspace bypass\\", as he roams through the Universe to decipher its secrets on a stolen starship. Premise sound stupid? No, it's really the best in British humour (not humor!) that I have come across. Only a Brit could pull this one off successfully; and he did.Adams's approach is quite novel: combine comedy with science fiction. Leave Star Trek and 2001 behind, this book will have you laughing your a$s off until the Gnab Gib (opposite of Big Bang)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Question: what do you get when you take one big galaxy, one bigger dry British sense of humour, one outlandish cast of characters and then have a bunch of mice in a position of authority? Answer: Not sure, but whatever it is DON'T PANIC.When Arthur Dent manages to unwittingly get off his blue/green planet, which is located in the unfashionable end of the galaxy, with help from his friend Ford Prefect he has to face the most ridiculous characters, eat at places one wouldn't suggest even to the in-laws, deal with a depressed robot and, worst of all, listen to Vogon poetry. Hyperbole, metaphor, didactics, truisms and sarcasm fly in hyperspeed as Dent copes with the needless demolition of his house (and planet) and hitch hikes his way with the freelancing writer for The Hitch Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy. It might not all make sense, but hey it is a big galaxy after all and the tidbits from The Guide and the universal translators known as the Babel Fish seem to help - well kind of.The absurdity of everything, anything and nothing all come under the cosmic microscope as we take in the busy, bizarre business of the universe.

Don't panic, and whatever you do Read this book.Trying to describe the plot is pointless, for one it makes no sense, and it's not why you read a Adam's novel. I won't give away any jokes, or the such, but if you like Monty Python, or better yet have the smallest hint of a since off humor, read this series.

This is a very funny novel, very inventive and will stretch your imagination. One caveat would be if you know you don't like the British sense of humor, this book probably won't work for you.Though it made me laugh a lot and shake my head at its ingeniousness, it gets 4 stars because of some basic problems in that there is virtually no character development and the plot is razor thin.

The book has many interesting twists and turns along with large amounts of dry humor mixed in. The word play and puns quickly catch the readers' attention and hold it there throughout the book. And although the book is occasionally confusing, the wit and energy quickly ensnares the reader all over again.

Able to hitchhike aboard passing interstellar crafts, Ford, a writer for \\"the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor (6)--The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy--saves his friend Arthur from its destruction and into the clutches of a Vogon Constructor Fleet, or rather, into the clutches of the insidiously inane personalities of the Vogon aliens. Whether a gift or a curse, Arthur is soon able to understand Vogon speech (and particularly awful poetry, including the wrenched poem beginning with \\"O freddled gruntbuggly...\\" [60]) due to \\"probably the oddest thing in the Universe\\" (55)--the Babel Fish. Considering the Vogon's ill-temperament towards hitchhikers, the unlikely duo are soon jettisoned into the expansive vacuum of space, which \\"...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is\\" (70).With the probability of 2276,709 to 1 against being rescued by a passing craft, the two are normalized within the confines of the stolen starship, The Heart of Gold, which had been stolen by the Zaphod Beeblebox, the President of the Galaxy. The ship with the Infinite Improbability Drive is crewed by the widely eccentric president, his Section ZZ 9 Plural Z Alpha-native tag-along Trillian (Tricia McMillan), and the paranoid android himself, Marvin. Unbeknownst to even himself, Zaphod is out to find Magrathea, the industry specialist of \\"custom-made luxury planet building\\" (102).Their initial welcoming consisting of guided missiles, the ship turns on its Improbability Drive and is randomly shifted to the surface of the same planet a whale had recently descended upon in an amazing free-fall of self-discovery and splattered blubber, the occurrence their landing on the same planet 8,267,128 to 1 against. The seemingly abandoned surface and derelict innards of the planet factory's office give rise, after an unfortunate bout of gassing, to the wondrous facilities of the factory in full swing. Just who are benefactors of the colossal project, what are their objectives, and how in good name of fjord engineer Slartibartfast will the quartet escape to The Restaurant at the End of the Universe?------------The tumultuous cavalcade of silliness is typically unrelenting; something which can't be said for the remaining four books, in my memory serves me correctly. Arthur should be described as a protagonist if he wasn't also the whipping boy for the more free-willed, free-wheeling Zaphod and Ford. Arthur plays the silent role, more in the novel for comic relief at the expense of the monkey-like humans and their pathetic planet than for his sheer diligence, social prowess or keen insight. It's Arthur's role as lost boy amid the galaxy with a couple of crazies that's the most entertaining bit in the premise. Sadly, like mentioned above, Arthur seems to be left out or seems to have taken a passive, backseat role. Some resulting sections of \\"coincidences\\" are simply too random to be funny and borders more on absurd than witty. This absurdity over wittiness is more prevalent in the sequel: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I LOVE IT!!!!

There is a lot of interesting history and other behind the scenes type information about the book, but when it comes to the section with the book itself, they use huge borders around the text, leaving the readable area about the size of a trade paperback. That makes it very distracting and awkward to read. Also, I had somehow gotten the impression that all three books were included in this edition, much like the Ultimate HHGG. However, it is just HHGG and not the two sequels. I'm not factoring that into my review as I went back and read the description and didn't see anything mentioning it containing all three, but I wanted to point it out in case anyone else mistakenly had the same assumption I did.

Arthur Dent is a typical male human being from England who wakes up to a typical sunny morning to find out;that his house is going to be demolished to build a bypass through. Arthur's wacky friend Ford Precept has much more concerning news and that the Earth will be destroyed very soon. As a alien race of creatures known as Vogon's destroy Earth, of course Arthur and Precept escape by boarding their craft and are now in for a wild adventure.Ford who has been stuck on Earth for 15 years has come out saying he's from the planet Beatleguise who has in his possession,\\"DONT PANIC\\", 'The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy'. A book of incredible knowledge of the darkness of space. Along the way they come along another pair of humanoids, Trillion the female human, and the President Of The Galaxy, Zophod Beeblebrox and the very depressed Marvin the Robot. The ship called \\"The Heart Of Gold\\" has been stolen by Zophon himself and he's positive he knows of the unknown wives-tale that is the planet \\"Magrathea\\".Zaniness ensues and the most unpredictable science fiction book I've read in a long time has tickled my brain. Some of his writing reminds me of another one of my favorite authors, Kurt Vonnegut. The ideas of 'What if?' and the ultimate question;Why are we here, what is life?, is always intriguing and makes you think outside your box.Whatever you think this book is about,it's not,whatever you think can't happen will and what does a sperm whale, a pot of petunias,dolphins and mice have to do about it? Everything or nothing?.I found myself out loud laughing to this book, so silly and understandable?, it's hard to explain. Maybe the point is that the universe is much to vast for our understanding. Maybe we aren't supposed to, read it and you'll have a blast waiting to find out.\\"THGTTG\\" is part 1 of a 5 part series.This book is wonderfully written for young teens to aged adults, because we're never too old to take a ride through the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I loved this book! It's hilarious -- I was laughing out loud almost through the entire thing, and I thought it showed some pretty insightful observations about life, people, and the world in general.It starts off with Arthur, a man from Earth who is trying to save his house from being torn down to build a new bypass on the land. He's friends with Ford Prefect, a man from Betelgeuse 5 who is a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and who has been stranded on Earth for fifteen years. In the beginning of the novel, Earth is destroyed to make room for a sort of intergalactic bypass. However, Ford saves his friend Arthur, transporting them onto a nearby spaceship. Crazy adventures ensue.At first glance, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy may seem ridiculous and random for it's own sake. However, Adams has crafted a novel that speaks about how it is to live life. Sometimes, weird stuff happens and you just have to go with it. Like Arthur, we will find ourselves in strange situations, completely out of our element, and we will need to figure out a way to get through it. And maybe, just maybe, we take ourselves too seriously sometimes.As for the narration -- well, it was narrated by Stephen Fry, so I think that's enough to tell you that it's amazing. He brings such personality to the characters that it's hardly like reading a book at all. Rather, it's more like being a bystander in events taking place.I highly recommend this book. It's funny, insightful, and a true classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read this book several times in different languages, I have seen the movie and now I have heard Stephen Fry read it!

Arthur doesn't want them to knock it down so he sits in a mud pile in front of his house so that the bulldozers wont knock it down. Later his friend ford tricks Mr. Prosser to sit in the mud pile while they get a drink. Mr. Prosser then gets in the mud pile and sits there while ford and Arthur leave to get a drink. When they go to the bar ford tell Arthur that he is an alien and that the earth is going to be demolished. Then ford tells Arthur to drink 3 pints of alcohol before the trip to leave earth. While Arthur is drinking he hears his house get knocked down and run to try and save it but is too late. Then they left and an earth was destroyed. Then they get off the planet as hitchhikers.

Marvin tells them to follow him to go to the captain of the ship Zaphod Beeblebrox who is also the president of the galaxy. Marvin later tells them that Zaphod has stolen this aircraft. Zaphod is an old friend of ford and once met Arthur at a party. At the party Zaphod takes the girl who Arthur had liked. The girls' name is Trillian and later Zaphod tells her that he is a real alien and takes her with him back to space. Later Arthur goes to sleep and the rest of them found the planet Magrathea. They where looking for this planet because this planet belonged to the rich people who made planets. The next day they where going to land on the planet when a recording said that they should leave the planet. Later it spoke again and it said that it would be firing missile at them.

Then they asked the computer how long and he responded by saying 7.5 million years. So they left and 7.5 million years later he told then that the answer was the number 42. Then the two men asked him what do you mean. And then the computer told him the answer is 42. The computer also told him you asked me the wrong question. They asked to tell them what question they asked him to answer but he told them that he will not be able to but I know how you van find out.

Douglas Adams is an exceptionally talented writer. Throughout the book, he approaches details far from the main flow of information and in the last sentence of the chapter makes it all fit together. It is extremely hard to describe his style except that of what some would call slapstick comedy. This type of comedy is completely zany and just throws around plot elements, introducing new items very liberally and taking others away rapidly.The plot and content are excellent. The charcters are very developed and interesting. Because most of the book does not take place on the Earth, Adams pokes a lot of fun at the Earth and its not-so-brilliant residents, humans. The book is constantly refering to The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (an actual book in the story) giving the reader more information and continuing to reveal the plot in Adams's unique style.I really enjoyed this book. I was often laughing out loud and recieving interesting looks from the other kids in study hall. This book is unequivocally humorous with a very extensive plot and developed characters.

However, it's far too short and moves far too fast for me, though I could readily keep up with the plot. The ending was far too abrupt, and his description of some scenes was nonexistent (at best), though I appreciated him letting the reader create his own \\"Heart of Gold\\" and picturing what each of the character's look like, with a little bit of direction.The nostalgia factor (though this was my first time ever reading Adams' work) definitely helped me like this book because all my friends still speak fondly of it.Whatever the case, I am a fan of Adams: I may not think he is greatest author (I disagree with some of style), but he is a damn funny one. The man must have been a stand-up comedian, because he knows how to make someone laugh. He's got comedic timing down for pat. So, if you're reading the book for the first time, I say (especially if you have a Kindle) get the sample first.

Indeed, the adventures of Arthur Dent, the thoroughly confused Earth-man, are full of bits of satire and comedic dialogue. When Dent is rescued from going up in smoke with the Earth, so begins a journey that takes him from the bowels of a dead planet to the deck of a spaceship made to do the improbable. Alien wrecking crews, insane presidents, manically depressed robots, and a confused sperm whale all tie into the story, all with hilarious effect. The interaction between characters is often done with tongue in cheek, and it is genuinely hard to stop from laughing. Arthur's confusion leads to hilarious dialogue, often after he has failed to take in a situation. Though short, this book is a staple in the diet of any comedy science fiction reader. If you think the movie will be a perfect replica of the book to film, prepare to be disappointed: Hollywood had its way with the script, and the second half of the movie is thoroughly edited.

Get it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I first set my sights on this book and after reading short synapses and positive reviews of what the book was mainly about, I thought it would seem interesting. This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time. And not to mention, a total waste of my 10, plus some dollars I used to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...but I thought this book was terrible.

The book shows how far the author can expand his realm of wittiness about aliens and outter space but one couldn't fail to notice the disorientation caused in the process. The invention of odd words, pronouns, and situations only makes it far from intriguing unlike it was intended to be. Not worth the hype given to it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is marginally funny, at best. At its worst, it's just plain boring. I bought this book because I heard it was on the same level as Monty Python, nothing could be further from the truth, Monty Python has jokes, funny ones, this book relies on lame puns. Most of the time the book is just plain weird, some of it doesn't make a lick of sense, a hippie with three arms is president, people can understand any language in the universe by holding a fish to their ear, the meaning of life is 42, what the hell is that all about? Is this supposed to be funny? Seems there are only two schools of thought on this book, people who think it should outsell the Bible and people who use it for kindling.

In the end, I was truly disappointed. In no way did i find that this book was good. It attempts to make fun of the creation of Earth, praises the \\"intelligent\\" mice and most shockingly, pokes fun at the High and Almighty God. In the end, of course, the author, Douglas Adams fails miserably...except for the part where he worships the lowly mice. In no apparent way is this \\"wholly remarkable book\\" remarkable, or even close to being satisfactory. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is an absolute failure as a satire piece, and could not have been any worse as a sci-fi novel. How do you save yourself from something that is utterly boring - and miserably disgraceful?The plot is pointless, the characters aren't developed, and the setting...the setting is just messed up. There is no theme, no meaning for this book.

He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity.

They won't make a fool of you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and, being an avid SciFi reader, I followed her advice. I eagerly read and re-read the back of the book, thinking that I was in for a real treat. I was wrong.It is hard to tell whether the author was intending the book to be science fiction or comedy. After re-reading passages several times that (supposedly) explain some of the 'scientific' elements of this book, some shreds of logic are able to be discerned, though this can prove difficult at times. While a few parts were admittedly funny, there wasn't nearly as many as I would have expected from all the hype.The characters were underdeveloped, and the plot nearly non-existent. You go through the book in a total state of confusion, and just when the plot looks starts to make sense, it falls apart again.I have a feeling that if you were to get a writer from Looney Tunes to create a SciFi book, this would be the result.Besides the major literary flaws, this book struck a nerve for me too. I get the impression that the author does not have a high opinion of Earth or the human race in general. It was Roddenberry's belief (the creator of Star Trek) that humans were the most remarkable species in the galaxy. While I realize that it would be arrogant and ridiculous for every SciFi work to hold this sentiment, in most we at least have a shred of respect.In The Hitchhiker's Guide, however, humans are dull (and if you're using Arthur Dent as a reference, I can see how you would come to this conclusion) and the only recognition Earth has are the words \\"Mostly Harmless.\\" \\"Mostly Harmless?\\" If they had given us just a few hundred more years to develop interstellar travel, we would have shown them \\"mostly harmless.\\"All in all, I would say that if you want a good SciFi read, with understandable plots, excellent character development, and plenty of laughs to go around, check out Animorphs (by KA Applegate).

I'm worried that if you let your children read this, it will make them think the world really works like this, and that you can talk to mice like they are people (no kidding -- it says that). Good luck teaching kids right from wrong after they've had their brains scrambled by this rubbish. At times I could not tell if Mr. Adams was trying to be funny or if he really thinks this way. I suspect maybe he needs professional help or something. I shudder at the thought of encouraging people to publish this sort of insane rambling as if it were a travel guide to outer space.

This summer, I re-read Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for the sixth or seventh time. Obviously, as I am a fan of this novel, and the rest that follow in the series, this review will not be critical.Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy chronicles the exploits of Arthur Dent, a human, Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent's friend who, posing as a human on earth, was collecting data for the actual Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the Galactic president, and other eccentric characters, including Marvin, a manic depressive robot. This novel is amazing, and so are the others in the series. Read them.One of the main strengths in this book is the comedy throughout. Sometimes dry, sarcastic humor, sometimes slapstick, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book. Everything from the characters' names (e.g., Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox) to the omniscient and sarcastic narration (e.g., the head of the construction crew at Arthur Dent's house at the start of the novel being a descent of Genghis Kahn) makes this novel difficult to overlook. Also, if so inclined, the reader can look deeper than just the superficial hilariousness of this novel, and actually gain something from Douglas Adams' view of everything, which is intelligent and insightful. Still, it is not Camus, but I am fairly sure Douglas Adams knows that.There are few weaknesses in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because, this being a sarcastic and comedic view at the way things works, a reader either likes sarcasm and irony or they do not. For me, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not only a funny novel, but full of insight which I have actually benefited from, but I guess there are some people who do not have a sense of humor that parallels the sense in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As far as addressing one of the \\"essential questions\\" is concerned, I wouldn't use Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a reference point for \\"fine art,\\" at least not traditionally (note: I am trying to avoid the debate of what is \\"fine art,\\" \\"art,\\" etc..), but I think the novel is \\"timeless and universal\\" (i.e., no. 6) because the story does not feel dated, and the concepts throughout are universal and still reflective of contemporary culture. In fact, it is the timelessness and universal qualities of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy which make it so appealing. Being read this novel when I was little, many of Douglas Adams' concepts have stayed with me my entire life, and whether or not it is a good thing, I judge many things I hear with the concepts I found so universal and appealing in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"On top of the cliffs stood a reception comitee.

I'll be venturing out to see the movie soon now as well.However, I can't say as I appreciate the attached 'Making Of...\\" featurette. That's the unpleasant surprise with this particular copy of the book. The book's screamingly abrupt ending was rendered especially sharp by, what was it...92 pages of this non-sense? I suppose I should have realized that it was included in advance, but there's no way I could have anticipated the (lack of) ending, and its effect was only worsened by having so much more of the bulk of book ahead of me.

But since that was several years ago and I just finished the book for the first time, it was fun to finally understand what the hell they were talking about!

His personality was the most human, and interactions with his character were some of the most humorous passages in this book. This was my first venture into science fiction, and after reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, I am hooked on Douglas Adams' writing, and can't wait to read all his other books. I loved the unexpected jokes, the whimsical names, and the way millions of years of anticipation and egos are deflated by single hilarious sentences.HOWEVER, I agree with several other reviewers that this book is way too short. It doesn't feel like it's over when it's over. And I was disappointed that the Hitchhiker's Guide itself was ignored for most of the book! Can't say I learned much about galactical hitchhiking at all..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've just finished reading all 267 reviews that Amazon has right now on The Hitchhiker's Guide. The reviews simply split into two camps. The 'I didn't get it' camp was home to a small, and unfortunately quite vocal, minority who simply thought the plot was confusing or the author was 'dumb' or some such schtick. Not to berate these readers, some were genuinely confused, but the sole reason they didn't like it is that they didn't *get it*. The people who understood the context of the novel, grasped its underlying satirical genius, loved it. So much so that their 5-star ratings totally eliminate the negative effect of the few low ratings. Folks, if you like to laugh and you're more intelligent than a mattress, give it a read. It's short, and it's worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams takes sci-fi to the next level; humor.

All the characters are intensely likable, even Marvin the depressed android, who in a lesser writer's hands would be simply anoyying. In fact, Marvin is my favorite character.

(Did I spell that right?) I had a few good chuckels with this one. I like how the author, Douglas Adams, sometimes strayed from the plot, wich was a nice break from the story. I could relate to the main character, Arther Dent, who was just a normal guy who got swept off his feet into a world were the impossable can happen. The style of writting is excelent and makes ful use of the interesting settings and events. I liked the supporting characters, too. Each had their own destinct view on life and the universe. The Bad: The main character didn't interact withe the supporting cast enouf. He barly even talked with one of the most interesting character. I would have liked them to continue fighting and not getting along. Aurther Dent is to normal. He should have had more to do with the story. I felt like the author was just using him as a camera, to take pictours and not to interact withe the world.

At others, like watching a Monty Python sketch that drags way too long."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S.

If your into the whole space-fantasy thing then you will love this book. There were some random parts that didn't even really relate to the plot that stuck with me and were actually very very funny. You really need to have an open sense of humor and can handle a lot of different types. There is a lot of cynical humor, and some cracks about British people. Actually now that i think about it, this book is very satirical and if your one of those people who really hates the world and human culture then this is the book is for you!

In fact, it probably is the funniest book I have ever read. The story starts off simple, but gets more and more complicated and detailed, with many seemingly meaningless happenings. As the plot thickens, Aurthur Dent, the main character, gets more confused and out of the loop, and keeps getting more confused throughout the series. Aurthur Dent is the last surviving human from Earth after the Vogons blow it up to make way for an interstellar bypass. Aurthur is led by his alien friend and fellow hitchhiker, Ford Prefect through the adventures this catastrophe leads to, but most importantly, he is guided by The Hitchhiker&#65533;s Guide to the Galaxy. This book is full of exciting twists and turns, and will leave you wanting more of this hilariously and ironically complicated book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The best book I have read in recent memory was A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I also recommend all of the other books by in this series, although I don't recall their names. The sequel to this book is called something like the restaurant at the edge of the universe or something like that. A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, is an extremely entertaining book. It takes place in a Galaxy that is quite different from our own. The book doesnt really have a clear plot but does feature hundreds of strange technologies and many different species. The book is written in a pretty random style so you never really know whats going to happen or what tangent the author is going to fly off on. I recommend this book to any one and every one. Especially those who enjoy science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've never read a book quite like this one.

All in all a really fun read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is what historians call a &quot;classic&quot; - at least, if we travelled into the future, it's what we will have called it. That is, if the Earth is still around.Read it before you're demolished by Vogons."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How many books try to combine two very different types of writing, let alone do it successfully? Well, Douglas Adams has done just that in this little book, and he alone rules this genre of sci-fi comedy. He has weaved together some wild futuristic scenarios using an improbability drive, the Vogons, the planet factory, the mice, and of course the guide - always with unpredictable British dry wit. The contrast of Zaphod (the care-free, figure-head galaxy President), Ford (the partying hitchhiker and reporter), Trillian (the mysterious woman), and Arthur (the bewildered last man on earth) is fantastic! Many sci-fi books have a robot, but how many are depressed and cynical? Guess what, Marvin is. Adams even throws in a some social commentary, which just makes you laugh at the way some things go around here. The fast-paced action and humor will always keep your attention as you learn why the earth was created and the answer to the question of the life, the universe, and everything.This book is a classic in both science fiction and comedy. It's a quick read, and you probably won't put it down. Unless, of course, you find out that the earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass and you've got almost no time get off!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've read Gone with the Wind more times than I can count. I read Charlotte's Web in 1st grade.

My mother and I happened to be in a bookstore recently and I was becoming very ed up with the selections we were going to buy. Then, on my way out, this book caught my eye. 'Douglas Adams,' I thought. 'I know him. He made the great, mind boggling game I have at home. maybe I'll give his book a shot.'Now, it takes alot for me to be impressed by a book, being that I get through them so fast. It frustrated me when I realized that this book wasn't going to be a fast-read, like the usual stuff I read.True, it took me longer than usual, but when you take it slow, you catch these *gems* that make you laugh. I suppose that my being cynical has much to do with my liking towards this book, but I think that if you're impressed with the way that he describes earth, in the begining of the book, than the rest will be a sure ride from there.If not, you can always sell it at a garage sale...but then again, who knows when you'll need a good mind teaser..."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Between his own tilted perspective and his sarcastic puns, I couldn't stop laughing.

Enjoy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the story of an ordinary Englishman (complete with all the nuances and eccentricities that usually accompany) and his extraordinary companions from various other points in the galaxy. It is the story of the destruction of the Earth to make way for a hyper-space expressway. It is the story of the theft of a starship that has the ability to pass through all points in the known and unknown universe simultaneously (talk about the perpetuity for getting lost). It is also the story of the discovery that the goings on on the recently demolished planet Earth held a lot more universal significance than was generally thought by its former inhabitants - which isn't surprising considering that it is also revealed that those who thought they were the most intelligent beings on the planet were actually only the third most intelligent.Douglas Adams has the very unique gift of being able to successfully bend science fiction with British humor. His observations are hilarious, intelligent and are very true to life. He is also has the propensity to be able to show just how silly people can be as well as how dependent they can be on their technology.This book is the first in a trilogy of five books (please don't ask me to explain) including \`The Restaurant at the End of the Universe', \`Life, the Universe and Everything', and \`So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish' and now a fifth book entitled \`Mostly Harmless'. The story of \`The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' is based upon a radio program Douglas Adams originally wrote for the BBC in the early 80's with some changes thrown in to solve some continuity problems as well as some back-story. There are also several books on the original radio scripts that are work checking out as well as condensed versions of the radio show that are available on various media.It's a must read for any fan of science fiction - especially anyone who enjoys British humor. It's one of those books that can be read over and over again without diminishing its freshness. In any incarnation, it is a very enjoyable series and well worth taking the time to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For readers not too enthusiastic about the vision of a futurehumanity trapped in a maze of the ultimate machines, Adams hasan optimistic insight, unusual for a science fiction writer.You can summarize it in a sentence: this ultimate machine,which will do everything and will make us practically dispensable -well, this machine will have a button, and this button won't work. For itwas built by this ridiculous remnant of those old times - Man.Or perhaps the machine will work, but won't do the thingswritten on its package. Or do them, but not exactly. Very not exactly.In a media enchanted with super technology and hyper machinesthere is nothing more refreshing than this basic insight, whichturns and flipps the narrative of the novel to the most unexpected,grotesque and hilarious directions, leading it to an orgyof the destruction of meaning.very funny and optimistic in it's weired way - maybe one of the fewways open to optimism in our all to serious world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Every person who has even the slightest bit of nerd in them has been exposed to references from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. People make references to it damn near constantly. Before reading it, I imagined what a wonderful story I must be missing out on. Finally, I got around to reading it for myself. The story itself is painfully dull and pointless. Adams' writing style is distracting and juvenile; not juvenile in a lighthearted storytelling sort of way way, but juvenile in way like it might literally have been written by someone in middle school. Names like Zaphod Beeblebrox and Slartibartfast for example. I imagine Adams sitting at his type writer trying to think of a name and not coming up with anything so he just starts speaking in tongues letting his mouth move about while doing an impression of Corky from Life Goes On. Eventually the random combination of palatal fricatives and lateral approximants formed these combinations of sounds at which point Adams shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Slatribarfast, good enough'.But it's not the writing style or the non-existent story that makes me hate the book. It's that before when I heard a reference to this book I would imagine the smart witty story that went along with it. I imagined the epic tale that was waiting for me someday when I actually got around to reading it. I looked forward to the day when I would get where the references fit in and smile knowingly along with those people who have read the book. Instead I will now frown when I hear those references. In a sense the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is stunningly hilarious, it's one big twisted joke like the infamous 'Man Eating Chicken.' I imagine that on the last page, of the last book Adams probably delivers the master punchline by revealing that anyone who made it that far is now infinitely aware of the horror that is Vogon poetry."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Oops. Did I just say that here? That can't be a very popular thing to say here, what with about 500 people giving it 5 star reviews. But again: Not That Funny. Well, now you're thinking that this guy just doesn't get it, has no sense of humor, etc. But I don't think that's it. I believe I have a good sense of humor; I think Monty Python and The Holy Grail is hilarious, as well as many other British comedies. I also like Science Fiction. I wanted to like the book; the concept is hilarious and it seems like it would be something I would really enjoy. But it is not done well. The biggest problem is that for the most part the laughs are far apart, and not all that funny. And it just doesn't work as SF without the humor. You should do yourself a favor and, before you buy it, read 5 or 10 pages next time you're at the bookstore. I'd bet that there will be a lot of you that aren't that impressed. If you're still reading this (and I have my doubts) let me recommend an alternative: Doorways In The Sand by Roger Zelazny. This has some similar elements to Hitchhiker's Guide (aliens posing as humans) and is witty, clever and highly readable. Zelazny at his peak. If you like Hitchhikers I promise you will like this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams mixes dry British humor with science fiction to produce an astounding novel satirizing the arrogance of human beings on Earth. This novel is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This novel begins with Arthur Dent trying to stop bulldozers from destroying his home in order to build a new superhighway. He meets a guy named Ford Prefect. Prefect hitches a lift right before the Earth is demolished by alien Vogons. The author satirizes humans' trust in technology and philosophy in this story. He uses quirky phrases that are so stupid and out of this world one has to wonder what he was on while writing this novel. This novel causes me to laugh aloud. I think anyone who enjoys sarcasm and satire will love this book. It's easy to read once the science fiction is gotten past. This a great novel in order to appreciate twisted British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a normal man (Arthur), and an alien man (Ford) in their quest throughout the universe. These two men get swept off earth right before it turns into gravel for a highway. These two men then travel from ship to ship, and from planet to planet in the search to complete a book on everything.My favorite part of this book had to be when the two men where inside of a planet trying to get away from these guards. The guards had come after them because they where trying to protect a wanted man. During this scene though, the two cops where shooting at Ford, Arthur, and Zaphod. During the fire though the two parties where talking about how they shouldn't be shot and how they had to shoot at them. Soon this all stopped when the two cops had been shot in their air supply but something unknown.I would not recommend this book to people with an undeveloped sense of humor. This book includes many jokes for older people and many scenes that don't seemed to be finished. During this book you are reading in Fords' point of view then without realizing it you are now reading in Arthur's viewpoint. These sudden switches lead me to confusion and didn't allow me to see the moral of the story. After reading this book and kind of realizing some of the jokes and meanings, I realized the author has good ideas but i don't think he expresses them well. This caused me to not like the book and discouraged me from wanted to read any more of his books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you've watched the movie, read the book.If you've read the book, don't watch the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can we say about this book? Something that has so thoroughly entered the lexicon and mindset of the people in the late 20th century and early 21st century can only be regarded as a great book. It has had an incalculable effect on the genre of science-fiction. Deep Thought and HAL (of 2001, A Space Odyssey) have completely created the idea of artificial intelligence and a writer can't begin to write a phrase uttered by a computer intelligence without dealing with that reality. If it teaches the genre anything, it teaches it the importance of humor. We have said that some writers are too ugly: M. John Harrison's Light suffers from this; China Mieville's Perdido Street Station and The Scar suffer from this; the classic Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever suffered from this; hundreds of overly-pretentious, read-it-it's-good-for-you-just-like-broccoli books published every year all suffer from this same fact. Laughter is very, very important to the human condition and it can't be ignored successfully. It is wrong to dismiss The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as a flight of fancy but ultimately unimportant; it is, in fact, tremendously instructive.WHO SHOULD READ:Everybody should read this book. Everybody. There really is no audience that it can't appeal to. Children as young as 12 or 13 can enjoy as equally as codgers in their 70's. The institutions that Adams was bashing so many years ago are just as relevant today. It's a slender book, a fast read, and widely respected and, as such, comes with a pedigree. We're not sure if the movie will be anywhere near as good as the books (though we have hopes given the success of the radio series) but to the extent that it inspires more sales of this book, so much the better for our world.WHO SHOULD PASS:There is a certain group of people--a people suffering from a strange psychiatric illness--that have no sense of humor. These are the people most often associated with enforcing political correctness. They are the people claiming offense and injury at all audible and epistolary provocation. They are the people who think children shouldn't run or laugh but sit still and silent until spoken to. They are the tragic wastrels of a life fiercely lived with a clutching, grasping notion of universal justice, imposing order (most often religious), and political retribution. They are the people who leave shopping carts abandoned in the parking lots because \\"those people\\" are paid to put them away. Douglas Adams will be entirely lost on these individuals. They should return to reading whatever hate-inspired literature that teaches them to abhor who they are, where they live, and that people exist at all.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A colleague had a line from the movie made from this book in his signature block at work. I just let it pass, not putting much thought into it.Later a friend and I were discussing books we have read, and wanted to read. He asked me if I had read the 5 books in this trilogy, and when I said no, he said I had to put that at the top of my &quot;to do&quot; list.I ordered the books, and when they arrived I started reading. I enjoyed every page. Douglas Adams took what we know as life, subjected it to his sense of humor, applied it to space travel and life. What resulted was one of the funniest and at times, thought provoking books I have ever read. By letting us see ourselves through Ford's eyes we can see some of the bizarre parts of our lives here on Earth.I would highly recommend this book, and the rest of the series to anyone who enjoys reading. They are sci-fi (which I don't like at all), but that is a very small part of the storyline. If you wished, you could imagine the travelers traveling from country to country on Earth, with a few minor exceptions.The next time I talk to my friend who recommended these books, I will have to thank him very gratefully."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book I read was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams. I am so glad that my english teacher, who shall remain nameless, recommended this book. It was an excellent book. The storyline kept me so hooked that I enjoyed reading every bit of it. The characters were very unique and humorous at the same time. Now Douglas Adams isn't any ordinary writer, Adams had an unusual way of writing conversations. This only made it better though. From what I hear, almost every book has a theme, but I could not find the theme in this book. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in my opinion, was a book writen only to make others laugh, not to teach a lesson. One of my favorite conversations in this book was,\\"You want me,\\" said Prosser, spelling out this new thought to himself, \\"to come and lie there...\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In front of the bulldozer?\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"Instead of Mr. Dent.\\"\\"Yes.\\"\\"In the mud.\\"\\"In, as you say, the mud.\\" -p.17.This conversation went on and on and kept me laughing the entire time. I would have to recommend this book to others for a number of reasons. The most important reason is the fact that this is one of the only books that I have ever read that actually made me laugh. I would definatly have to say that this book is one of my favorite books right now. I used to hate reader so much, that the mere sight of a book got me angry. After reading this book, I probably will never hate reading again. This book makes reading fun. Another reason is that this is a book that my namless english teacher enjoyed reading as well, therefore making it teacher approved. If I ever had, or wanted to read this book again, I would probably enjoy it just as much as the first time, and I am sure you would too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is a wonderfully paced comical satire on ... life the universe and everything. Filled superb writing and quirky storyline this book is short enough to read in one day. Thankfully there are four sequels in this trilogy there is no shortage of adventures and insane situations for Arthur, Zaphod, Ford, Trillian, Marvin and whoever is met page to page. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys rambling humor. While the book is confusing, it only makes you want to turn the pages more. The writing style reminded me of Joseph Heller. I may be one of a handful of people who have ever compared Heller to Adams, but the irreverence and the quick chatter gave me a definite feel of Heller. One of these reviews said that this book was a great work of British comedy, don't let that scare you, it is really a great work of comedy. Also don't let the Science Fiction genre scare you either. This novel is so snappy and &quot;plausible&quot; that you get so caught up in the characters and story that you forget it is science fiction.Thanx for your time.T"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"How can anyone NOT read Douglas Adams and like it? Let me rephrase that. How can anyone NOT read Douglas Adams? The man is the master, and I mean the MASTER of science fiction/comedy literature at it's best. The book, for those of you who desperately need to read this, follows the story of Arthur Dent, a human who, luckily, just barely escapes the destruction of the world. He is saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien who has been stranded on earth for 15 years while trying to write an update to the now outdated Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five. It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2).The best part of this book is being introduced to the wonderful cast of characters that Adams has created, especially Arthur and Marvin. If you have a sense of humor, they will make you laugh. There's not much of a plot to speak of, which is the book's major weakness. However, it is an appropriate setup to the rest of the series, and I would definitely advise everyone to at least read this initial installment before plunging into any of the other installments.My advice: read it. Expect a classic, but don't expect the greatest that Adams has to offer (that, in my humble opinion, would be the fourth book, SLATFATF)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book about a book.

I'm Glad I did beacause if i had seen the movie first it would have ruined the book for me. The one thing that I noticed about this book was it's so great that you read it really fast, and when u finish you wish you hadn't read it as fast as you did.Anyway I've never Read anything like this book and probably never will again.

Why? It mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy and humor of everything in human society, from the ridiculous to the sacred. Examples - the ridiculousness of atheism (Babel fish), inherent human supremacy (dolphins and fiendishly clever mice), ethical conundrums (Lintilla), engineers (Zlarty Bartfast), egomaniacal thieves (Zaphod Beeblebrocks), economists (defoliating the planet to increase the value of the leaf as currency), philosophers (the Babel fish again), inefficiency of governments (the destruction of the Earth), and myriad others. I have gotten more enjoyment from this book than almost anything else I have ever read. It is also worth every cent to purchase the BBC audio adaptation of the story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I re-read this book after far too many years away, but found that it hasn't stood the test of time all that well. The humor and style are still there. I still wish that I could writing as wittily as Douglas Adams. The plot, however, begins to crumple after too many re-examinations. So do the characters. Arthur Dent just isn't that exciting a hero. This book is best considered as a clever satire on sci-fi conventions and on the world at large.Why have I found this beloved book to be wanting? Perhaps it's exposure to some of Adams' later works, where plot plays more of a role and where characters come to life more (I think - next up will be a return to the second HGTG book and to Zaphod's harrowing adventures). Perhaps it's the bitter taste left by the fourth and fifth books in the series, written by someone who didn't care anymore. And perhaps it's exposure to the works of Terry Pratchett, Adams' equivalent in the fantasy genre. Whereas Adams was content in this book to simply have fun making fun, Pratchett develops some of the most intriguing heroes and villains and ordinary people and makes you feel at home on the Discworld, which is really just a good metaphor for our world. Adams doesn't really seem to like people that much, but Pratchett does.Still, any sci-fi fan or fan of Monty Python should give this and its first two sequels a try. Adams is a great wordsmith, and his departure from novels for other pastures is a bit of a loss."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well just wrapped up this book...And unlike other reviewers, I promise I wont write a book report giving every thing away.Any hoots, this book did have some laugh out-loud moments. After the first few though you began to see the setup long before the punch. Some long roads were traveled to get to the 'funny' and at times were a little too predictable.This type of humor has been played out to death since the time of this books writing. So the wit-factor is just not there.At times I got the impression this book had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. Almost as if it was not really thought out and planned but more just banged out and made up as Adams went along.Well all the reviews loving this back can't be wrong either. I guess this book is really more not to my personal taste. Thats my review and I'm sticking to it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"That book could be rewritten as a good 20-page short story. That would be room enough for all the witty comparisons and good ideas it has. Also, the true randomness of the writing would still be interesting as a novelty.As a full-length book, it is a disaster. There's no plot, no characters, the randomness doesn't make any sense. If you shuffle the chapters the book would probably be as readable as it is now. It reminds me of some writing I and my friends did when we were 11 years old, only duller.I don't understand the high praises it has.BTW, I like a lot \\"nonsense\\" humor from people like Monty Python. You might call it nonsense but what they do is precisely crafted."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I saw the many reviews of this first volume in the then trilogy and decided to dig out my first edition and check the notes I had written at the time. As you can see by the score, I was not as entralled by this novel as the more recent readers seem to be.

But overall, I was a teensy-weensy bit disappointed, probably because I'd heard so much praise about it, I really expected to laugh my buttocks off, and I didn't.

I find that the experience of having read it, connects me to so many people in such a variety of backgrounds. High school students, PhD professors, Americans, Norwegians, Buddhists and Muslims. People in Japan, in Egypt -- people in so many walks of life connect with Douglas Adams references.It is such a great experience as a book that the world can gain Douglas Adams references. We describe the inadequacy of the administration systems in our college by talking about how the main character in Hitchhiker's Guide had gone round to see the display department. He finally found the plans in a locked lavatory with a sign that said, &quot;Beware of Leopard.&quot;That's the display department.It was dark.Well the lights had gone.So had the stairs.This book comically captures the world we are living it.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a bit of fresh air from most other Science Fiction. Everything from Existentialism to Asimov's Foundation series is hilariously scrutinized by the metaphysical universe that Adams used for the setting of this story. The humor of this book reminds me most of the story-lines on the Simpsons. The action of this book requires the reader to suspend his disbelief. This book is so grossly absurd that it almost seems to parallel some of the problems of modern life. In the end, this book shows that while most of these problems will never be overcome, there will always be fodder to poke humor at, and that's at least a start."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Absolute genius!

Any shape or form you can use to experience this, do it! Old BBC TV broadcasts, or the radio series - all excellent entertainment. I just re-read the series, upon Mr. Adams' passing, and realized how much it really had changed my perceptions. While not earth-moving, Mr. Adams has succeeded in making me look just a little sideways at any 'scientific certainty'. Its a great book / series, currently reminds me a bit of Scott Adams' Dilbert in comedic sensibility, with Star Trek science (and pseudo-science), tempered with dry British wit."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hitchhiker &quot;trilogy&quot; is a wonderful series, from a wonderful author, one who recently died. His death is truly tragic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of few books that I have enjoyed reading. It is a mixture of humor and science fiction correlated through a strong, but somewhat confusing, plot. Douglas Adams, the famous writer who incorporates humor into sci-fi, is the writer of this fantastically written novel about a character by the name of Arthur Dent and his adventure around the universe. He is miraculously saved from the earth's destruction by one of his friend's. Arthur never knew his friend was an alien until this day. His friend, Ford Perfect, is an alien who has been trapped on earth for fifteen years; originally he came to earth for research, in order to expand The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The story continues and Ford Perfect saves Arthur's life from the destruction of earth. They hitchhike a ride on a Vogon ship; Vogons hate hitchhikers. Ultimately the Vogons throw Arthur and Ford out of their ship. In the mere ten seconds they have, to survive in outer space, the most improbable phenomena occur. The Heart of Gold, a new ship designed with the new Improbability Drive engine, saves Arhur Dent's and Ford Prefect's lives from the vacuum of space. Amazingly, the person in charge of the ship is Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government. In his kindness and generosity, he allows the two hitchhikers to stay on board. The story picks its' pace from this point on. Douglas Adams wrote a book that would not only interest the young and feeble mind, but also the mature and intellectual mind as well. His well-developed characters and great sense of detail throughout the book really makes the reader become part of the novel. The confusion the reader feels towards the storyline of the book is directly proportional to the confusion Arthur Dent has with his surrounding. By making creating a sense of confusion around the reader, Douglas Adams does a wonderful job of presenting Arthur Dent's character. Another well-developed character in the book is Ford Perfect, the researcher of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This character is the \\"know it all\\" type of character. He is the one that guides Arthur to his confusion about everything around him. Whenever Arthur asks Ford a questions, he gets an answer that confuses him, as well as the reader, even more. This sense of confusion and intellectuality between the two central characters is very unique and interesting. In addition to a well-developed character line and plot, the book targets the reader's weak understanding of life and the universe, creating a sense of mystery for which the reader ponders to unravel. The only weakness this book has is its confusing plot. But the reader will get used to this after he/she reads the first couple of chapters. As a teenager, I believe that this book is an excellent choice for any age group. People can have hours of fun reading it. It is full of comedy, action, and suspense. Once you pick it up, you will not want to drop it down. As of the answer to the most fascinating question of all time, the answer to everything, well, you will have to read the book to figure out this one for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's hard to argue that this book isn't painfully funny (unless you happen to be painfully unimaginative), but I found this book to be especially wonderful for it's sharp satire and philisophical statements. I guess you may call them anti-philisophical statements because it makes the reader view life with a new sense of it's intrinsic absurdity. My favorite character is Arthur Dent, and throughout the book he is continually disparaged as some sort of simpleton. However, throughout the course of the series, we are subtley made aware of Arthur's virtues in contrast to the other characters, and in particualr, the Guide. Adams makes them so seemingly complex, that they are in fact utterly ridiculous and nearly pointless. He applies this same logic to life in general. It is chaotic, absurd, and often pointless, so like Arthur, you might as well enjoy a good cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Intriguing! Well-developed characters, understandable plot, this book has it all! It's about hitchhikers traveling through the universe. There are billions of planets and one digital book explains all of them, plus everything else in the universe. The book starts with the Earth blowing up. There is someone named Ford from another planet who is on Earth and he grabs his friend and gets on one of the spaceships that is blowing the earth up. They are thrown into space but Ford's cousin, Zaphod picks them up with the spaceship he stole. Then they continue to travel the universe together with Trillion (an earth woman), Arthur, (Ford's friend) and Marvin, a robot. I loved Douglas Adams' writing style! The descriptions were a little weak, but it is fun to imagine what characters and objects look like. Whether you like science fiction or not I think you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a truly remarkable book.\\" This is a statement repeated many times throughout the book. No, Douglas Adams wasn't commenting on his novel, but the \\"standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom\\" that exists within it. It contains everything from how to mix your own Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, a popular alcoholic drink that gives you the feeling that you're, \\"having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick,\\" to explaining just how useful a towel is to the average hitchhiker. All of this exists within Douglas Adams's The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, an even more remarkable book which is clever, hilarious, and will keep anyone amused for hours.The story unfolded very quickly when it zoomed in on Arthur Dent, a very ordinary man, as he was told by his friend Ford Prefect-who he just found out was an alien-that the world was going to be demolished in roughly twelve minutes. It just keeps getting better from there.Adams created a wide variety of personalities for his characters. Arthur Dent was a normal man that was quite happy with his dull, quiet life on Earth. He never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. Zaphod Beeblebrox, an alien, however, was the joking, impulsive President of the Imperial Galactic Government. He was rather full of himself and didn't tend to worry. To illustrate yet another personality, there is Marvin, the depressed robot. Marvin never had a positive outlook on anything. Ford Prefect was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just guy who liked to \\"go with the flow.\\" These are just a few example of Adams's genius when it comes to creating characters.Douglas Adams had a brilliant imagination. One example of his creativity was in his description of the Vogon poetry. It was the third worst that ever existed, barely passed up by Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent whose poem was entitled, \\"Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning.\\" I can't think of many authors that published something like that.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone. Most of the humor is easy to understand, and everything is appropriate for people of all ages. Even younger children could appreciate the humor and the interesting characters. The novel is great for people with strong imaginations as well. Having an open mind is rather important while reading it, however, since it could be described as strange. It seems to appeal more to \\"geeky\\" people. Despite this, I thought it was a great book; everyone that I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did.Overall, Adams was remarkably successful with his The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters; the storyline was unpredictable and I was constantly being surprised. I savored every minute I spent reading this novel. Anyone who loves reading, and even some who don't, would love this clever, entertaining, and, \\"truly remarkable book.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had put off reading \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" for several years because it was something that many people talked about but that few had read. I assumed that if that were the case, the book couldn't be that good.I now regret the choice not to read the book until now. Not only is the book an engaging, easy read it also is very funny and gives some very good \\"quote lines\\" that you can use in later conversations - as long as the others you are talking to have read the book also.The very first page of the book grabbed me and held me until I was finished with it a few hours later. I knew I would like the book when the author, Douglas Adams, starts out talking about the end of the earth and how a girl had finally figured out how to solve the earth's problems only to tell us it didn't matter because the earth was going to be destroyed. Luckily, he said it in a much funnier way and the rest of the book followed closely with the same humor and great writing.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It is something you should be able to finish at most in a couple of days of reading and is well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a great book. I never would have thought than anyone could blend science fiction and humor. Actually, this book is more of a humor book with science fiction thrown in.This book follows the travels of Arthur Dent, as the world gets destroyed, and he gets miraculously saved and whisked away into an outer space adventure.I really enjoy Douglas Adam's writing style. He never takes himself too seriously. This is much more a story about the journey than the destination.And, if you didn't know, this is British humor. If you're a fan of British humor, you'll love this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When I cracked this book I didn't know what to expect, then as I progressed I fell in love with the compleate imporobability of the whole adventure I found the book somewhat low in details but it made up for it in humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"But seriously.Douglas Adams' books will always have a warm place in my heart. The combination of science fiction (sorta) and irreverent, Pythonesque humor, was a revelation to me when I first picked up this book, and it continues to be a source of enjoyment and pleasure as the years go by.If you don't know the basics of this book by now, I'm surprised. But to recap: first, the Earth is destroyed. Hilarity ensues.And I'm not kidding.This series of books, as they careen through the galaxy, into the past and the far-future, introduce you to paranoid, depressed robots, wacked-out sentient elevators, torture devices hooked up to fairy-cake, and entire planets destroyed because they have exceeded the \\"shoe event horizon,\\" always entertained me; no small feat. The characters are interesting, can be related to and, despite the comedic tone, stick with you like the best characters do. The adventures are ridiculous and riotous, but good clean fun.If you want spaceships that are dank and furnished with old mattresses, or space captains that have baths on the bridge, or aliens that have all the sex appeal of a road accident, this is the book for you. If not, give it a miss, and you're poorer thereby, but it's your life. And above all, of course, don't panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It really depends on who you are whether you would want to panic or not.Hitchhikers, starts off confusing because Adams' writing is , how to put it , insane, to a first time reader, But thats not necessarily a bad thing. You have to keep an open mind about this book, because its not your natural Sci-Fi story.I'll keep it short in saying Hitchhikers is fun, sarcastic,hilarious and astonishing. Its a quick read you'll be sure to read the next four books in this Trilogy of Five(or is it six) and you'll get the ans...err..the question to the Ultimate answer..is....I cant tell you.......Just read the book and see...."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Those of you who have visited Alta Vista's \\"Babel Fish\\" website and wondered \\"what's a Babel Fish?\\" will find the answer in these pages. It's a super mini-translator and a devourer of brain waves. Everyone who roams the universe needs a Babel Fish swimming in their ear. How else can one understand Vogon poetry? Don't break the stratosphere without one.This book is loads of fun. Besides a quick read, it contains some now famous scenes (almost ubiquitous depending on the circles one runs in). The super computer \\"Deep Thought\\" (a tongue in cheek reference if ever one existed) gives its infamous answer to the \\"ultimate question\\" of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\". Earth gets marked for destruction to clear the way for a \\"hyperspatial express route\\" (but not everyone inhabiting earth comes from earth, or are what they seem). The universe has an irresponsible meglomaniac amoral president (Zaphod Beeblebrox). A man named Slatibartfast gets rebuked for creating fjords in the new Africa. A depressed robot lays facedown in the mud dejected after causing a spaceship to commit suicide. A whale spends its final moments before meteoring onto the surface of the legendary planet of Magrathea. The Improbability Drive of a super space ship creates... well... the improbable. And of course the core of the story involves the great \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\"; an intergalactic tour guide, survival text, and social commentary. A \\"Hitchhiker\\" is the equivalent of an interstellar train jumper. Ford Prefect fits this job description perfectly. He found himself stranded on earth as a result of his hitchhiking. Here he meets Arthur Dent, a seemingly average inhabitant of planet earth. Arthur's house stands in the path of a hungry bulldozer, but Ford Prefect tells him not to worry because \\"the world is ending\\" in about twelve minutes. Great characters, scenes, and ingenious plot devices abound as the pages rapidly turn.The book also has a philosophical dimension. It makes our planet seem like a small, insignificant speck in a manner similar to Voltaire's \\"Micromegas\\". Consequently, it also makes the universe seem like a vast, enormous, incomprehensible mass (which it is). Human insignifigance gets handled, as it should be handled, with humor. This probably explains why the book gets quoted in many philosophical texts: these passages can take some of the edge off of a bare examination of the human condition. So all those struggling with the absurdity of it all should look here for solace and a good laugh. Even those seeking just a good laugh should look here. Just read it already!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I found myself smirking and nodding knowingly a lot more than laughing out loud as I read this book. It is in no way an out-and-out humorous story. Instead, Douglas Adams has found himself a solid science-fiction platform from which to write a witty and surprisingly insightful social commentary.You'll recognize all sorts of people from your life in the characters in this book. You'll also find yourself thinking on a regular basis about the insights into our day-to-day existence that Adams manages to capture so cleverly and them turn on their ear.Intelligent, witty, insightful and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"this story is about the worst thursday ever known to man.

With a twistedly awsome plot, great cynical monty python style humor, intelligently funny. I didnt read the summary or hear anything about it until i had started it, so i was expecting a serious storyline, hah, I was pleasently suprised. Events are based on made up physics, so you are no longer bothered by inconsistant ideas that dont fit into the writers idea of reality.

I saw the movie and thought it was mediocre and I just assumed that the book would be likewise. After being urged by a friend to give this book a shot, I finally did and here I am finally reviewing this book which turned out to be a pleasant surprise.By now, most of mankind knows the plot [(although the amusing thing is, there really isn't one :)]. Seconds before the Earth is destroyed, a human named Arthur Dent is plucked off the planet by his friend Ford Prefect. As it turns out, Prefect has been stranded on Earth for over 15 years, posing as an out-of-work actor while doing research for the revised edition of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Dent and Prefect leave earth and begin to go on a intergalactic journey full of twists and turns while being picked up by the Heart of Gold, a ship which houses the might Improbability Drive that naturally helps transport them across galaxies faster than the speed of light. The rest of the characters include a two-headed, three-armed hippie who happens to be the president of the galaxy; Trillian, whom Arthur tried to pick up at a Earth cocktail party; and Marvin, a weary, depressed and highly intelligent robot.As I mentioned earlier, there isn't a particularly deep plot to this book which is what makes it such a unique blend of sci-fi, comedy, and philosophy. Douglas Adams spares no expense in poking fun at science fiction and some of it's clich&eacute;s such as asking the menacing guards on alien ships if they are truly happy with their jobs and if not why don't they just quit and find another profession? Of course, the deep philosophical questions of our existence are not spared by Adams either. Deep Thinker, a supercomputer that takes a total of 7.5 million years to answer Life's greatest questions and then another 2.5 million years for its successor to come up with a question to the original answer, lol.As others have said, you don't even have to be a science-fiction fan to really appreciate this book. Just be prepared for some of the quirkiest and oddball comedy you've ever read!-Travis S"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I put off reading The Hitchhiker's Guide for many, many years, for fear I would not enjoy it. The book only seemed palatable to those who loved sci-fi, or belonged to an older generation. While both of those groups may certainly well like the book, I now realize that my scope was far too narrow, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and regret not having read it sooner.The story follows London native Arthur Dent, a sort of hapless \\"any-man,\\" who, with the help his good friend Ford Prefect, is whisked into space seconds before the demise of planet Earth. Dent and Prefect are taken on a galactic journey across the universe, as life's biggest questions are attempted to be answered.The writing is very witty, with sharp, clever dialog, and fun, well-developed characters. But even more memorable than the book's humor is the prevalent, if not overt, social, political, and religious commentary throughout. It becomes clear Adams has written this novel as a means of showing us ourselves, so as we laugh at the silliness of the plot and characters, the joke is truly on us.Now I will fearlessly delve into the next book of this series, excited to see where the story continues. And maybe I'll declare my joy of sci-fi after all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A most remarkable book, full of humour and wisdom not found in current sci fi novels.I would recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a surprisingly quick and easy read. Douglas Adams' sarcasm, wit, and subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle, but outright ridiculous) humor make for an afternoon's delightful entertainment. On the surface the story seems random and shallow. There is very little character development, if any at all. Basically, how the characters are introduced when they first appear is how they'll stay -- the reluctant, anxious Arthur; the zany Zaphod; the hopelessly depressed and cynical Marvin -- they remain in their molds throughout the story. The plot also appears to be just barely existent. We know that Zaphod is searching for something, but even he doesn't know what it is, and whatever it happens to be, who cares? -- we never find it anyway. The \\"fight scenes\\" in the story seem to be more of a spoof or parody than anything else. \\"We don't want to shoot you!\\" \\"Well, that suits me just fine!\\" Adams also pokes fun at things we hold near and dear to our hearts, such as government (ha!), philosophy (ha ha!), and poetry (wha?).

It goes to show that maybe your planet blowing up isn't so bad after all! Throughout the story I laughed out loud multiple times. It has many hilarious quotes throughout the book but my personal favorite is \\"It says that the effect of drinking a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick.\\" I would recommend this to many people, but if you are very religious, some things might offend you. Overall the book was amazing. I am definately going to buy the other books soon!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not that this is a kid's book. This book is just so engaging and funny and is just perfect for keeping the cynicism of teenagerdom at bay for a bit, that it's a great gift for a difficult to buy for age.I've read it so many times, I sometimes forget that parts of it haven't actually happened to me.My brother and I quote from it liberally; from the whole series, to be fair.Other reviewers have reviewed the text admirably, so I'll only add that I think this book should be required reading in all middle/junior high schools."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This was an interesting read. If you are looking for something decidedly different, this may be worth a look.The story follows the misadventures of Arthur Dent. In the beginning, Arthur loses his house and his world in the same day. The Earth is destroyed by a fleet of bureaucratic Vogons, making way for a galactic freeway. Fortunately for him, Arthur is rescued by his alien friend, Ford Prefect. The two of them then fall into a variety of improbable situations, eventually learning the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything.This book is really short and should take no time for someone to buzz through. The storytelling was vivid, unique, and downright hilarious at times. The manner in which the author narrates is generally when the book is at its funniest, so I now find it odd that they tried to make a movie out of this. People should be aware that the humor is most definitely British.My biggest complaint with the novel is the overabundance of the weird hard-to-pronounce names and the mind-numbing technical jargon (which really isn't technical). Sometimes it appears the author is having so much fun with a particular joke that he forgets to let the audience in on it.All in all, Hitchhiker's Guide was a fun little read. I may just pick up Mr. Adam's second book, but I'm certainly not desperate for it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is a more or less normal English chap who is currently occupied with protesting the imminent destruction of his house for the purpose of constructing a bypass. Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, has still bigger concerns. Unbeknownst to Arthur or anyone else, Ford is actually an alien (albeit a humanoid one) who has been basically stranded on Earth for the last 15 years. Ford's original aim was to spend a couple of weeks gathering information about Earth in order to update the book for which he is a roving researcher. The book in question is, of course, \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, the time for leaving is well-nigh and Ford takes Arthur along thereby saving him from a fate worse than domicile demolition.As they travel throughout space, the duo meets several interesting life forms and learns a variety of shocking facts. For example, Arthur learns that humans were only the third most intelligent form of life on Earth. Eventually, they even learn the answer to the \\"Great question of Life, the Universe and Everything.\\"I had some initial trepidation about reading this novel since its reputation has most certainly preceded it. I find that it's often easy to be disappointed by \\"cult classics.\\" However, this story has reached such a wide audience, that it can no longer really be considered \\"cult.\\" There is indeed a Vonnegut-like quality to much of this novel. Anyone who has read \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" will certainly recognize a stylistic similarity. Early in the book we are introduced to an alien race called the Vogons. We are told that on their planet \\"elegant gazellelike\\" creatures existed that the Vogons would catch and sit upon. It is then explained that \\"They were no use as transport because their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons would sit on them anyway.\\" Aside from some dated cracks about digital watches, this book is leavened with humor that generally stands the test of time. The brevity as well as the fact that it takes neither itself nor science fiction too seriously makes this a book worth reading and accessible to those who wouldn't think of picking up anything written by Arthur C. Clarke or watching a Star Trek re-run."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She was going on a trip.

The general idea of this book is bizzar; mice are running the planet earth, aliens that can write poetry, and spaceships that commit suicide. I don't know where to begin. Well first, structurally the book is terrible. Adams jumps from character to character and finally by page 215 (out of 216 pages) it becomes apparent that this book is just going to end abruptly. (This may actually be the only good thing about the book, is that it is short, and a long ending that makes some sense would simply be tedious to read). Adams obviously wrote these 216 pages to make 5 jokes maybe 2 of which are truly funny. However, to hear these jokes are not worth sacrificing your time to read all the trash encompassing the random stabs at humor. In order to completely \\"understand\\" the complex world which Adams has created, you must read page long \\"history lessons\\" to get the background of different types of aliens, planets, and spaceships.I must admit I was misled from the beginning, I thought that this book was actually \\"The Guide to the Galaxy.\\" However, I was disappointed to find that Adams's book is only referring to a made up book that explains useless knowledge to ficticious characters.

The humor was nothing but bad British wit which the flimsily constructed character's angrily spewes at one another. However, the book was fun to read, so I won't be too harsh.

Now we are reading it together before she goes to bed every night and it is an absolute hoot. Fall-down funny! Seeing and hearing her laughter at the very jokes that still amuse me if one of life's great pleasures.I love the laid-back swinger's voice that Ford Prefect adopts, the twisted logic of his arguments, Dent's continual flusteredness, the digressions, everything about the book.I have to think that Adams himself must have been a great friend and lover of life. Can't say enough good about the book or its author.Reading it now, and this will seem like a stretch, I am reminded of The Lord of the Rings. Many people have commented on Tolkien's ability to make Middle Earth seem like a land steeped in a history and literature of its own by citing scraps of poetry and historical figures without completely explaining them. Adams' digressions have the same effect, in a comic key (a great example of this is the description of Old Janx Spirit at the beginning of the book, and the blues-ish ditty of which it was the subject). This style makes an otherwise simple tale much more absorbing than a bare retelling of the plot would suggest.I envy anyone who is opening this book for the first time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I had high hopes for this book, and it met them all. There is a story in here somewhere, as an undercover alien rescues his buddy just before Earth gets destroyed, then they hitch a ride on a crazy new spaceship, but the plot is not what provides the pleasure in this book. Adams had me laughing out loud multiple times with his nearly-nonsensical asides. For example, there's a tense scene, and all of the characters are transfixed on something Very Important, but one of the minor characters starts humming ironically because he hates everyone else so much. Just one line, never followed up anywhere, but it's a brilliant way to get a laugh while engaging in consistent characterization. There's also a deliciously absurd chapter about how one line of dialogue gets caught up in a space-time wormhole thing and starts a massive galactic war and leads to a charmingly unsuccessful invasion of Earth. This book didn't teach me any Valuable Life Lessons or enrich my view of Life, the Universe, and Everything, but it made me laugh a great deal, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

At the very same time this even occurs, Vogons(aliens) are getting ready to destroy earth for a hyper-drive system. Only seconds from extinction, Arthur's friend, Ford Prefect, grabs on to him, and hitchhikes onto the Vogon ship. This jump to the ship, sets Arthur and Ford, on an amazing journey.

I usually hate those kinds of books, and I'm also not a big fan of Sci-Fi books in general, but this book was quite funny in certain places and I got a kick out of reading it. I particularly liked the part where the police officers discussed how they were really sensitive literary people during their big shoot out.I wouldn't be surprised if I finished the entire Hitchhiker series because the first book is pretty funny as far as written works go, and I would imagine the whole series would move as fast as this book does.

If you are an intellingent person with a taste for both silly and sharp humor, you won't regret the purchase."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's so magical I nearly fainted, but a touch of realism could do, like having the hitchhiker wind up sodomized, murdered and buried in a shallow grave on Uranus"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"For a deeper and more perverse reader. I would say it is a more erratic humor with many crazy tangents that all lead up to something. I just randomly picked up the book and read it and wanted more. I read the entire series and all of Douglas Adams other books. A brilliant writer that captures my own thought sequence on paper. Very good book for people who enjoy funky reading!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read! It is so well written. I usually don't like science fiction, but this book captivated me. I really like Douglas Adams's style of writing. He leads you down a path that seems to go absolutely no where and then BAM! everything suddenly makes sense. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an extremely witty book and will leave you laughing out loud and wanting more."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"the best si-fi comedey I've ever read and a great book in it's own right, be sure to catch the follow ups"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"classic si-fi comedey, a must have for persons who love english humour."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is probabaly the best book I have ever read. It's funny, eeasy to read, but realy captivating, I read the whole thing in only 2 days, that's how captivationg it was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Above is a quote directly from the novel. The book follows Arthur Dent, an Englishman, or former Englishman I should say as the Earth has just been destroyed to create a galactic bypass, and his Betlegeuseian friend Ford Prefect as they traverse the galaxy with their supplies: a towel(the most widely useful object ever to be invented) and of course the fabulous Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, a book in the form of a computer because if it were in regular page form, the carrier would have to lug around seven inconveniently sized buildings full of paper. The pair meet wierd aliens, robots, and other creatures. Don't be confused at first with the names: Zaphod Beeblebrox, for example, is a main character who's name you'll easily catch on to. This book is just flat out hilarious. It's Brazil (the 1984 spoof, not the country) meets Star Wars. Douglas Adams is more or less the master of confusing but hilarious plot as well as dialouge. Now, I'm not just writing this review because I love all sci-fi books. In fact, I read very few, about 20%, sci-fi books, although I still like the genre. So you can see I'm not a Die Hard sci-fi comedy fan. This book is extremely funny. Adults as well as children (teenagers really) will find the material and dialouge side splitting."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams prooves, Mathematically, that NOTHING exists. Any man that can accomplish this is a genius. I tested his math and it works out. Also the book provides many other interesting ideas to bounce around. NOT TO MENTION IT IS THE SECOND FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN, SECOND ONLY TO MONTY PYTHON."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I, personally, am in a constant search for intriguing books, and the Hitchhikers guide series was truly one of the most enjoyable and addictive I have ever read. Douglas Adams does an encredible job of combining off-the-wall science-ficton with an amazing sense of humor. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with. The Hitchhiker's Guide series begins with an amazing twist. The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads. If you are looking for an amazing series that keeps you entranced, then this is without doubt the series for you. Once you start reading the first book, you've got to read them all!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm not usually a fan of sci-fi, but this was a recommendation of a friend (plus I saw the movie). What a fantastic book! It's cleverly written with hysterical commentary on human (and alien) life. Many sci-fi books are written with technical jargon, using words only the most geeky of geeks could understand. Instead, this is written with an everyday tone so even the common man can stowaway for the adventure."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, without a doubt, one of the funniest books I have ever read. Adams' science fiction-humor masterpiece is as imaginitive as it is hilarious. The story begins on the worst Thursday ever as Arthur Dent awakens to find a wrecking crew about to demolish his home in order to make way for a bypass. Arthur is approached by his longtime friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien field researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Ford tells Arthur that the Earth is about to be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. The two hitch a lift aboard a Vogon spacecraft, and there the fun begins. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of five hilarious novels (and one short story) in Douglas Adams highly acclaimed Hitchhiker's series, and it is also the best. I've enjoyed H2G2 in all of its forms so far (books, TV & radio versions, etc.), and I look forward to the Hitchhiker's Guide movie which opens in theaters April 29th. Read the book and laugh your butt off, then go and enjoy the movie!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a unique book all in itself. It is hard to compare it with any other book because there is nothing like it! It is the tale of Arthur Dent as he escapes Earth's destruction with his friend, Ford Prefect. This would not be possible if Ford himself had been born on Earth; he was from somewhere in the vicinity of Beetlejuice. They manage to get on board one of the construction ships that is destroying Earth to make room for an intergalactic superhighway. From there, the adventure just gets more intersting in later books, traveling through time as well as space, from the dawn of man to the end of the universe in a five star resteraunt. Douglas Adams describes every little thing to great detail, making every little oddity worth reading. This first book of the series is in every way one of the best books I have ever read. It even brings about the meaning of life, the universe, and everything; 42. But what is the question? Read the book to find out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This novel is Douglas Adams' best ever. Here is his true wit, his British humor, his, well, hoopiness! The book picks you up, drives you to the movies, and never lets you go! Ford is hilarious with his insane logic. Trillian is a wonderful as the only really sane one on board the Heart of Gold. Marvin is so pathetic that he makes you cry every time you read the book. And through it all, the hapless Arthur Dent just tries to understand what is happening. The plot involves the earth being blow up to make a hyperspace bypass, which everyone should have known about if they had checked the record hall in Alpha Centauri. The plans had been on display for fifty years. Can't complain about it now, can you? Anyway, throw in an ancient race of planet builders, some towels, a stolen space ship, and a restaurant at the end of the universe, and you get the first novel in one of the best sci-fi series ever. A must read for any science fiction fan or fans of British comedy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This little treasure is probably one of the most outrageous and ridiculously hilarious books ever written. With a flawless knack for humor, Douglas Adams brings to life his satire of our own universe, devilishly illustrating how much nonsense we're really surrounded by. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy takes us on a wild ride through the four corners of the final frontier, introducing us to dozens of one-of-a-kind personalities. Among them are Earth civilian Arthur Dent and galactic hitchhiker Ford Prefect, two of the most colorful characters one could ever hope to meet. You'll never forget the time you spend with these guys; it may even bring a tear to your eye to turn that very last page (thank GOD for sequels!). But the experience is worth it. Just be prepared to finish up with a lot of unanswered questions crowding your mind, and don't count on any guarantees that you'll be able to restrain yourself from reading the rest of the saga! Yes, although a very light read, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy boasts a kind of zany &quot;philosophy&quot; that'll keep you perplexed and intrigued and -- more than anything -- totally addicted. I'm telling you I can't wait to get started with the next one! If you think you're finally ready to learn the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, don't hesitate. $5.59 is a petty price to pay for such gleeful enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first pages of this book were pretty stupid, but Adams seems to have the same problem as I do--a little bit of trouble beginning stories. Once it's in full swing, you'll love it. This is one of the few books that I literally didn't want to put down until it was finished. I tore through it in two days--thank goodness for sequels. NOTE: If you aren't a fan of silly humor, you might not like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've read many books in my day, mostly for my own pleasure but never until now have I read a book that made me laugh out loud. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, is a story about Arthur Dent, his friend Ford Prefect, and their adventures in outer space. Ford Prefect, an alien from the planet Betelgeuse V was on earth, in disguise to complete research. Ford is a reporter for the encyclopedia known as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This guide is a giant encyclopedia stored in a small computer that contains important information for intergalactic hitchhikers. When Ford discovers that the Earth will soon be destroyed, he alerts his friend Arthur Dent. Ford urges Arthur to leave Earth with him and they soon hitch a ride on a Vogon spaceship. But as Arthur soon finds out, Vogon's aren't friendly beings, and the captain of the ship wasn't to happy they came aboard. The Vogons tortured the two with horrible poetry and then dumped them into space. Now according to the Hitchhiker's Guide, a person can hold his breath in space for 30 seconds before he dies. 29 seconds later Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent were recued from space. They now found themselves on a ship called the Heart of Gold with the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his friend Trillian. Douglas Adams is a comedic genius and does a wonderful job of satirizing the human race. Humans are considered to be primitive, the third smartest species on Earth, and Earth is considered &quot;mostly harmless\\". Unlike many books I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy kept me interested and wanting to read more. I definitely recommend this book and I will most likely begin reading the other books in this series. If you enjoy science fiction books and have a good sense of humor, you would definitely enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all time favorites books. I was lucky enough to see Douglas Adams speak right before he died. Some SF authors are great speakers, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke come to mind. Barry Maher, the guy who wrote Legend, is an outstanding speaker. Writers like these can really wow an audience in person. Douglas Adams certainly couldn't. He was clearly uncomfortable on stage. For the first 15 minutes, he was one of the worst speakers I've seen. Then he relaxed and inspite of being uncomfortable, his humanity, his weird perspective and his humor took over. It became a wonderful session. Almost as wonderful as the Hitchhiker books. Don't see the movie until you're read the books, all the books. You don't even have to see the movie then."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is brilliant. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy \\"trilogy\\" is Adams' gift to sci-fi fans of all ages and backgrounds. Though not necessarily a direct spoof of any particular sci-fi book or film, this books pokes fun at the many hackneyed cliches of the genre, yet somehow creates something altogehter original AND funny. The brilliance comes from the fact that you do not need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy the story and comedy. This is one of the few books that deserves to be read multiple times--and no matter how many times you read it, you will find yourself laughing out loud. If you enjoyed this book, you must read the rest of the \\"trilogy.\\" My personal favorite is So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, though hard-core Guide fans may tell you it is the weakest of the five book. Though not as funny as the others, it has the best story and character development. So, if you happen to find yourself actually caring about Arthur Dent by the end of this book, you must read So Long... If you like Adams, I also recommend The Great American Novel; Or Random Start, by Eliot Stafford--it's not sci-fi, but displays a similar sense of humor and will keep you laughing for days."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was walking down the hall, being perfectly innocent, when a friend of mine shoved a book in my hands with an exclamation of, \\"You have got to read this!\\" It was entitled The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I was skeptical at first, because I had never been much of a science fiction fan, but by the time I had finished the first chapter, it had become my favorite book of all time. The rest of my week was spent following Ford Prefect, a field researcher from Betelgeuse Five, who accidentally got stuck on Earth for fifteen years, and his friend Arthur Dent, an advertising executive from Islington, as they escape the end of the world by jumping aboard the most highly sophisticated spacecraft ever made, which just so happens to have been stolen by Ford's step-cousin, Zaphod Beeblebrox and his girlfriend Trillian, who Arthur once met at a party.During their travels, these humorous characters must battle evil aliens, interstellar police, and white mice to find out the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. This truly insane tale could only have been thought up by the truly insane Douglas Adams, who came up with the idea while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Spain. Through his eyes, readers are able to laugh at all the things they know are wrong with the world, rather than feel depressed about not being able to fix them. This really is a wonderfully enjoyable book, and I would recommend it to all who enjoy quality entertainment and a touch of wackiness."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A while back I decided I didn't like parody. This was after being disappointed by \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I choose, in fact, not to review that book because I felt that I was simply missing the whole point, and wasn't qualified to have an opinion.However, when I found out Douglas Adam's work was being made into a movie, I decided to try it. I was quickly enthralled. It works in many ways \\"The Color of Magic\\" didn't. For one thing it's one story, not a group of related short-stories about the same characters. For another reason, things are there for a reason. It's true the characters are silly, and unrealistic, but they're humorous characters, not humorous plot devices. All the jokes actally factor in to what's going on, rather than just being there to be funny. When the missiles were being fired at the Heart of Gold it actually managed to produce both humor, and drama, and the thoughts of the whale and bowl of petunias, since they were a way to resolve the problem, were certainly acceptable.Overall, I guess it's just that the jokes worked for me, more than \\"The Color of Magic.\\" I found this book very funny, and am looking forward to the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just needed to leave a review, despite the fact that there are, what, 400 others? I haven't read any of them, but I just need to share my input on the book or I'll explode.This is definately a class in the Science-Fiction genre. There's sarcasm, humor, wit, and everything in life I love and cherish--well, pretty much. I thought it was hilarious."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With Douglas Adams it really doesn't matter if your a miserable old bat who hates fiction or a fun loving freak who loves it; his books can appeal to all. They have a bit of everything in them, a bit of sci-fi, a bit of nature conservation, a little bit of adventure and LOTS of humor. They even have the nice little moral at the end to boost up your spirits when you finish the book.I first found this book years ago and I'm still unable to figure out how i lived without it. the seqeuls and other books that come next in the series are just as fun and Adams has managed to spread his wit evenly out throughout the whole series. any other author would've given up and returned, mentally exhausted, to dry writing after the first page.The characters are original and fun, the scenery and setting ever-changing, the plot dances around and the dialogue will leave you in tears. Marvin the Paranoid Android ended up being one of my favoirte characters, as did the Vogons and psycologists, and their unique outlooks on life and 42 are new.There are only a few things readers attempting to read this book must have:-a sense, however lame it might be, of humor-a large mug of really hot tea-a few packets of peanuts-and, finally, a really comfortable sofa"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitch Hikers Guide is an amazing book; it ensnares the mind and doesn't let go. The book takes you all the way from the last seconds of earth to the end of the universe, and all in a strange and humors way. The book uses backwards logic and at some points makes so little sense that it makes perfect sense. I loved the variety of characters, the detail, and the abstract thoughts. The book takes and explains the secrets of the universe and even better how to travel it. In this book you will find the answer to the meaning of life, how to get a lift from a space ship, and why no hitchhiker should ever be without a towel.I recommend this book to anyone who thinks of the abstract or abnormal, or for that matter anyone who has an inkling of creativity in their minds. Recommended to ages 15 and up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The planet Earth is destroyed by an evil alien race called the Vogons in order to make way for a hyperspacial bypass. Fortunately, one bewildered Earthman named Arthur Dent is rescued from the Earth's destruction at the last possible moment by his friend Ford Prefect, who turns out to be an alien from the planet Betelgeuse. They stow away on a Vogon freighter, and are eventually rescued by the whacked-out Zaphod Beeblebrox &amp; his Earthwoman companion, Trillian, in their absolutely fantastic ship, the Heart Of Gold. From here on out, it's outrageous shenanigans in space, as Arthur and friends discover what the true purpose of the planet Earth was for, that it's always important to know where your towel is, and that the answer to Life, The Universe &amp; Everything is &quot;forty-two&quot;.... It began life as a BBC radio play, and then it spun off into something much bigger, including comedy albums, a TV miniseries, and, of course, the books. &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,&quot; by the late, absolutely great Douglas Adams, is a true comedy classic of the literary world, and is a must-read for all fans of not only science fiction, but off-the-wall British comedy, which Adams gleefully, and cleverly, blends into one. I first read the books as a young teenager some twenty odd years ago, and, re-reading them now, they still make me laugh just as uproariously as they did back then. This book, Part One in the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; saga (five books in all), gets things off to a flying start, with many great, hilarious chapters &amp; characters, not only Arthur, Ford, Zaphod &amp; Trillian but also Marvin the paranoid android, and the old wise man, Slartibartfast. Douglas Adams was a comic genius, gifted with a tremendously clever wit &amp; sharp writing style, which he worked to maximum effect with the &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; books. His wonderful observations &amp; short stories sprinkled throughout about Life in the Universe are also a great treat to read. There's more intergalactic misadventures for Arthur &amp; the gang in Book Two, &quot;The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe,&quot; but &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy&quot; is a marvelous opening book to this legendary sci-fi comedy saga. It is extremely funny, extremely clever, and extremely classic. God bless you, Douglas Adams, wherever you are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the greatest books to me. It starts serious, you can just imagine someone reading aloud, then you get to this sudden, simple line, and you are rolling on the ground. One of the things that really got to me was that I thought of someone reading very well, completely serious, and all the jokes and simple one liners seem like they are completely normal in their world (universe), but they really stick out. It is brilliantly written, and though when you get into the series it is a bit hard to follow, it's worth reading multiple times. It kinda makes you realize that our simple lives could easily get so complicated, or just stop, and you think &quot;God am I glad I'm not him, but that would be so fun&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There's not a lot you can't say about the series of science-fiction/comedy books [and the miniseries] left by the late, great Douglas N. Adams. I think it's this book that really makes me laugh still, the most. The others in the series are fantastic in their own rights, but this book is the one I can go back to, any time, and still laugh at. It's just so absurd that you never get used to it the way you can with some other books in the genre.For example in the Red Dwarf books, you begin to accept the quirks of Lister and Rimmer and the crew, but you really start to laugh at them because it's just SO Rimmer to do whatever or say whatever. It begins to get, in all fairness, a little less funny, and a little old. But DNA's silliness never seems to lose its sharp cutting edge. The characters, too, always feel new, though eventually you start to see all of them, even Vogons, as friends in a way, like you know them a lot, and you like them.This is a book that changed my life, in a number of ways, and has kept me laughing for many years."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book had me hysterically laughing entire time.

Really want to see the movie as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's President on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice and fly at the very dangeous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young readers, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. When I read this book, I didn't understand some advanced jokes, and lingered over challenging wording. I was force to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themselves on The Heart of Gold during the ship's improbable journey. Everything seems random as I realized when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This befuddled me until I found that it came from a saying stating, \\"If 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet.\\" This story may be hilarious, but Douglas Adams' terminology often goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at a level too high for most Junior High/High School students, but for me, the laughs in this book far outweighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less savvy readed. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece. I recommend this book to less skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seaching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they are young. However, it will take an older advanced reader to fully take in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When the planet Earth is destroyed by the Vogon alien race in order to build a new hyperspatial express route, Arthur Dent catches a ride with a passing Vogon ship with his alien friend Ford Prefect and rides off on their first adventure. Ford, as a researcher for making the new Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, now goes to make new additions while traveling. As you go discover new members to this group, soon enough, the crew is full of a whole hilarious genre of characters. From the two headed Zaphod to an always-depressed robot name Marvin, this book will make you laugh with jokes on almost every line! As the first book in the trilogy of four, I personally can't wait to read the next one.This book easily gets 5 stars from me, even just based on its comedy and story line. It's a great science fiction that will have you laughing even when making fun of the stupidity of the human race at times. My favorite part was actually in the beginning when Arthur is stressing about his house being torn down, when the whole world is about to explode within the hour! The author, Douglas Adams, uses a unique kind of writing style that always keeps this book interesting, and the way he describes things will keep you connected in the book. He makes up tons of alien words, but still lets you know what he's talking about through mini Hitchhiker's Guide entries.Overall it's a great book, and you should for sure pick it up as soon as possible. Not only will it entertain you with a creative story, it will start you on an adventure throughout the next three books in the series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first of the four books in Douglas Adams' trilogy, or so he calls it, as well as one of the funnier books that I have read. This comedy is about a man named Arthur Dent who suddenly becomes at risk of being blown up with the rest of the Earth when it is demolished so that there can be room for an interplanetary highway. He is saved by his alien friend, Ford, by way of hitchhiking onto a Vogon, a rather disgusting and apathetic alien, ship. When they're thrown out of the ship they end up on a new ship, The Heart of Gold, they meet the president of the universe, Zaphod Beeblebop, and Trillian McMallan, the only other survivor of the demolition of Earth, only because she left earlier. The four of them go on an adventure to a place that no one really knows much about and find out the surprising secrets of the planet makers; Arthur gets a tour of their factory, as well as the secrets of the financers of Earth. I, personally, loved reading this book. The characters were all important to the story and no one of them took the spotlight for too long, they all shared. I particularly liked the humor of the story, it was simple and quick, and the style of writing; it left much for the imagination, making it all in all a great book, not the best I've ever read, but great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To me, there's certain literary classics like Les Miserables, the books about the Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas and a lot of Shakespeare books where they're often quoted or referenced and on people's classics of all time list yet how many can actually stomach Les Miserables' 1300 pages? Hitchhiker's Guide is like this only it's very short, funny, and really needs the other books to understand the story.Arthur Dent wakes up in the morning and finds a bulldozer wanting to bring down his house so he lies in front of it. A man named Ford Prefect comes up to him and convinces the bulldozer to not demolish his house. However, an announcement says that a galactic highway(or something, lot of science speak in here) needs to be built and Earth's in the way so Ford and Arthur escape just in time.They eventually get aboard the Heart of Gold, a ship carrying Zaphod, a rather smallminded man who just happens to be President of the Galaxy, his science-y partner Trillian, the ship's computer \\"Eddie\\", and Marvin, the depressed robot, also the Paranoid Android(yes this is a Radiohead song). They then find themselves on a legendary planet which does rather cool business and want to know the answer to Life and Everything.One thing that I didn't care much for was as soon as things were starting to get good then woosh, book's over. Unlike Narnia or Harry Potter which are standalone books, this feels like a big book seperated into smaller books. You could even read one of the Lord of the Rings books without even reading the other 2. Here it's like \\"you just read 200 pages, now buy the other books.\\"However, the book is funny and contains interviews with cast members and a foreword and photos(Zooey Deschanel who plays Trillian is sure hot), just be warned that you'll probably end up getting the others as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I love this book!

Everyone who likes sci-fi should read it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Critics call it a \\"romp of cosmic proportions.\\" Many are \\"not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979,\\" and as one clear-minded (and totally spaced-out) Adams' enthusiast points out \\"There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there?\\"What is it about perfectly dry, diaphragm-jiggling British comedy that sets human beings all over the world rocking on their heels with laughter? Its a mystery to me, just like every single one of Douglass Adams' utterly ridiculous topics of sarcasm. I read one review for the book that called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a waste of time, and gave it the most severe form of anti-praise possible by condemning it inferior to the cultured genre of sci-fi novels everywhere. If The Guide made me cry from laughter, then that review made me cry from ignorance. Here is what this sadly unenlightened reader has to say about the book: \\"Total garbage. It didn't make any sense at all. Read the other reviews. Everyone says how wonderful the book is but no one says what the book is about.\\" This guy is obviously a very unappreciative, pea-brained Vogon in disguise, because his sort of poetry is most assuredly not the kind I want to be reading. I wish some practical people could just sit back and enjoy something as marvelous as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, even if their isn't any clear point, if only for its sheer hilarity.While we're in the mood for galactic puns, I will try to be a bit more down-to-earth, as they say, and will concede that there are several points of real relevance in the story. One, Adam's pure sarcasm and mind-bending logic has a gigantic, blaring message: as obnoxious as a bullhorn announcing your impending death by Kill-O-Zap gun for stealing one hell of an expensive government/science project powered by the most improbable form of improbability ever discovered. And that, my friends, is satire. The Universe. It's nothing more than an over-sized and very bizarre perspective of our earth: a whacked-out upside-down kind of microcosm (in reverse)! Throw in a few bureaucratic hyperboles, and you've got a real slap in the face aimed pointedly at many single-minded businessmen. I'd bet you anything that critic was an economist.Just a note on Adams' humor; Be forewarned: don't drink anything before you read it (this is a very dangerous thing to do) and you may want to finalize your will (or your taxes, if you are financially-inclined) before you turn the first page (the one that says \\"for Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst and all other Arlingtonians for tea, sympathy, and a sofa\\") just in case you die of laughter. Also, you may not want to read this book in front of your psychiatrist least they come to believe that their fears have been confirmed and you have indeed gone stark-raving mad (they did predict that was going to happen in the end, after all).Such is the style of the late Mr. Douglas Adams. Oh, he's really a riot (and I say that with all sincerity). Who else could come up with a scenario where two white mice deceive us all and actually control the earth right under our noses? This is how I would define him: A lot of dialogue, a lot of adjectives, and a lot of completely insane British humor. Not only have I closed the book with a zillion new ways to look at our universe, but I've also got a fairly oversized dose of hilarity thrown in the bargain as well (lucky me). If there's someone out there who likes to critique, a sci-fi geek, or a rodent-loving freak who hasn't picked up The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy... jeez. You do not know what you're missing!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams truly is the master of parody. This book is absolutely marvelous.

I have to say that the book was hard to understand in places but was very well thought of.

After reading it, I am very satisfied. It contains a mix of humour and science fiction that I haven't encountered in past novels. It brought up several theories that made me think, including the impossible being the possible. This is a very entertaining book and easy to read. The plot is very easy to follow and the author wrote it in such a way that it is easy for an average joe to understand what is happening in the story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Just came off reading the Dune series &amp; needed a bit of a break.

The story follows a befuddled Englishman named Arthur Dent, and his friends, the alien Ford Prefect, two-headed Zaphod, fellow Eathling Trillan, and poster-child-for-prozac robot Marvin. Basically, ASrthur has to deal with the awful fact that his planet was blown up to make way for an expressway. Lots of wackiness follows.

First, an alien from Betelgeuse disguised as a human saves his humanoid friend, Arthur Dent, from being killed along with all other Earthlings.

Otherwise the story was hilarious, though the book didn't answer all the questions. Also why is the meaning of life \\"42\\"?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Book Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a very intersting and innovating novvel that makes you laugh and think at the same time at the sametime. ITs basically about a simple man, Arthur Dent, who is warned by his alien friend, Ford Perfect, that the world is about to be destroyed. Only for the use of interstellar highway. The rest of the tale is about Arthur traveling around with Ford and discovering new people and new things in the vastness of the universe. The Novel was very intersting becuase the characters were very witty, though very funny at the same time. The book is very enjoyable to read and makes you laugh. This is a book for anyone! Male, female, whether u are intersted in science fiction, comedy, or approach it at a logical angle, this book has it all in one! If you like thinking, laughing and interesting novel about the univerese and its humours happenings with funny characters this is most definitally your book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was everything I expected. I was really looking for a humorous sci-fi action packed trip and I was not disappointed at all. Reading this book was similar to the experience I got from the movie Men In Black. The Guide is similar in the way it depicts the univers as simply a zany place to be, full of action and swashbuckling adventure interspersed with a funny undertone. Ive read books before that followed this sort of humourous angle, but mostly turned out to be silly. The Hitchhiker's Guide may not have the most developed characters, but it has a unique charm that draws you into the action and keeps you there with a laugh and leaves you with a cliffhanger ending. The best time to read this book is right after you've just read something overly serious, epic, boring, or studious. Another book I would recommend that has this same similar sci-fi/humor relationship is a book by Piers Anthony called Prostho Plus. Pick up this book, but consider investing in the novel that encompasses all three books in the trilogy. Surely, if you only read this one, you will want more."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was everything I expected.

This is Alice in Wonderland of the 21st Century. The book is very funny, yet fast paced with plenty of action. I am not going to give you brief content of the plot, read it for yourself. Just take my word for it - the book is awesome. Douglas Adams reads it himself, and he is a wonderful narrator (unlike Stephen King, who is a horrible narrator yet still insists on reading his own books). This was very enjoyable. It's aweful that Douglas Adams died so young. I enjoyed his books so much that I take it as a personal loss."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very funny and interesting. Earth is destroyed, and mice are actually OUR owners. Humans WERE the third most intelligent species on the planet, but the earth was actually a computer designed by mice to give the ultimate question, to which we know the answer- forty-two. Adams keeps you entertained and begging for more with his dry and witty humor. The insane improbabilites are only matched in this world by what will happen next in this entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Have you ever used a pancake flipper to turn a time axis over? By the time this little story is over, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, has probably not only flipped a time axis over, but has probably done so exactly at the moment the thing had the right number of pock marks/wormholes.This is the story of how an Anyman from England goes on a fantastic intergalatic voyage after bureaucratic, fascist-oid aliens commit wholesale planetcide against the Earth in the name of Progress, demolishing it to construct a hyperspace bypass moments before the Earth, one big organic computer, is to render the 10-million year Question. (Kinda makes Arthur's house demolition for similiar reasons at the beginning of the story look like wormmeal by comparison).By confronting robots and computers that should ge given frontal-circuit lobotomies, greedy mice that saw their 10-million year investment sour before it went boxoffice, and various and sundry &quot;whoops&quot; incidents in outerspace, Arthur becomes a Space Novitiate, ready for more space adventures in sequel books, and ready to turn that time axis over with a swift flick of his wrist, as soon as the stuff stops jiggling.Don't pass this book by if you think it is too Trekkie or Sci-Fi-ish from the title, especially if you do happen to like absurd/obscure British humor like Monty Python. As a matter of fact, I even found a refrence in the book to &quot;an elderberry bush full of kippers&quot; which vaguely reminded me of some M.P. skit about herrings and shrubberies."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a very interesting order.For instance,one of the first things that happens is bulldozers flatten the main charactar's house.Then the world blows up.See?It's really cool.It's also brimming with cool guys and girls like Zaphod Beeblebrox.All in all,it is super cool."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never read a book in my life. At least, not all the way through. Sure, I have tried in the past to get interested in a book, but I've never found a book that captured me to the point that I actually finished it. I've graduated high school, and I even have a year of college under my belt, and I somehow managed to do it all without reading any of the required material from any class.Then one day in the summer of 2001, I make my regular visit to Slashdot, to find that an English fellow by the name of Douglas Adams had died. The news post had 600+ comments on it from other Slashdot readers, so I knew this was someone big, but I had never heard of him. Well I did a little bit of searching and found that he almost has a cult following, so I decided to check it out. The thought of trying to read *another* book was definitely unappealing, but so many people had so many great things to say about him and his works, so I decided to go for it.1 month later I had finished all five books in this series, and it remains, to this day, the only book(s) I have finished completely... And I have tried diligently to find other books to capture my imagination like these books did.It's really tough to call these \\"books,\\" because they are so much more than that. They all have a very unique life and soul to them... They're so warm and friendly, so comforting and relaxing... And ever so funny. It's also really hard to explain what's so darn funny about them. Adams doesn't make any punchlines, he just tells the story... But the way things work out, and the way people say things, you find yourself cracking up much more often that you'd think.I know, you're probably thinking, \\"The way they *say* things is funny? This is just text!\\" Well there's a point to that. But the other side of the story is that these characters really become a part of you, and when you're reading, you begin to act everything out in your head... You can see the people, the spaceships, the planets, the wild locations, the facial expressions... And it really starts to turn into a movie inside your head.This series of books has forever changed my life. I look at everything in a new perspective, I have a new appreciation for a lot of things (You start to realize what you've got when you read about a guy who travels through the galaxy with almost nothing except a towel), and I have an almost renewed sense of humor. I can not say enough about this wonderful series, and my only wish is that Douglas Adams were still alive so I could thank him myself for writing such an inspiring work.If you are even remotely considering purchasing this book, I would wholeheartedly urge you to give it a shot. It's only [price] for the greatest piece of literature you could ever hope to own... And if your life isn't somehow changed by this book, or the series that it belongs to, then I think you need to re-evaluate yourself; You could be missing your soul."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This has to be the funniest book I have ever read. Douglas Adams' imagination is truly amazing. The storyline, characters and inconceivable situations makes this a must-read. Every time you think you've read the wackiest thing you could, you find something to top it in the next page.Even if you are not a science fiction fan, you should check out this book. The SF angle is just a back drop for a far-out comedic masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"over all i think that this was a really good book. it was funny and kept you reading. i would recomend it to amyone"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I downloaded the Audible.com version, and listened to it while in bed with the flu. Douglas Adams had me laughing so much. He really lifted my spirits. Listening to Marvin, the manic depressive robot, was especially helpful getting my out of my funk. I had read this book years ago, and it made a huge difference to hear him read it. I love his voice and the way he portrays the various characters. I had forgotten the answer to the great question of the life, the universe, and everything. I was so relieved to hear the answer again! Ah, now I feel so much better. ;-) I was sad to learn that Mr. Adams passed away earlier this year. I'm looking forward to experiencing more of his trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The hook for me, who is no science fiction genre reader, was the bit about the Vogons, the species that tortures its captives by forcing them to listen to bad poetry. Having been promised that, I picked it up and thoroughly enjoyed the high-minded wit and glee that endows THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. That and the book is rather short, making it perfect for when the mood calls for light reading but not junk food. Adams obviously had fun with this, kicking at all matter of conventions, including the genre in which he chooses to phrase his satire. His quintet of travelers are personable, even the self pitying robot. Written some time ago, the book presages some technology that is beginning to appear now; the titular travel guide referenced throughout the book, for which one character is a writer, resembles a Palm Pilot, for instance. My only complaint as an outsider to the genre is that there is no real climax and resolution in the story; after the initial, hilarious exposition, it heads into episodic adventure and just ends en route to another destination. Which means, I have to read the next book. I suppose there are worse punishments out there. This small hardcover edition is quite nice and a bargain. Go for it instead of a paperback."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The absolutely whimsical meanderings of the author make for some delightful reading.

It takes all of the seriousness linked to traditional sci-fi and tosses it out the window. It takes a particular and peculiar mind to take the story of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and the rest in the directions it goes, and thank heavens Douglas Adams had such a mind. I cannot say how many times I have read this volume, along with the rest of the trilogy, because I cannot count that high.It takes a keen wit to devise such characters and situations, but a wit that does not require such strenuous thought to comprehend.

When I finally did I was in for a pleasent surprise. It was actually quite funny and intelligently written. One of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. It actually caused me to laugh out loud several times. Oh and the best part was that I finally learned the meaning of life. It's 42 (who would've known)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I listened to this book on CD; the six CD BBC Radio production. While I certainly found the book amusing, I don't know why people are so excited about it. It seems that Adams pretends to have a plot but really does not want to have one. The tone is too ridiculous to be meaningful and the characters are too flat.The event that starts the novel is the demolition of Earth for a hyperspace bypass. Only one human, Arthur Dent, escapes with an alien taking human form, Ford Prefect. Following this, they meet some other characters and have a random, bizarre romp around the galaxy.There were some interesting ideas here but Adams just didn't pursue them. Super-beings create a computer to determine the answer to the meaning of life (this in itself could have an interesting point; man relies on machines for the most important of tasks etc...) and after millions of years, it reaches the answer. &quot;The answer is 42.&quot; As this made no sense to the super beings, they designed a planet-sized computer called Earth to find the question to the meaning of life. In the novel, the question is never revealed even though one of the characters knows it.The title of the novel is an actual book in the story. It a collection of articles and miscellaneous data about the galaxy, towels, alcohol and all sorts of different topics; this could have formed the basis for an interesting plot. The story could have featured, Ford Prefect, himself a contributor to the guide travel about and write about the places he visits and other such tidbits. It could be some sort of \\"Lonely Planet\\" book for the galaxy.There were other parts of the novel that were just plain weird; the editor of the, &quot;The Hitch hiker's Guide to the Galaxy,&quot; takes an inter-galactic cruise in his office. The main characters travel in a space ship powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive. The characters visit a restaurant that exists at the end of time...I fully admit that the book is funny; it has a sort of British humor that I just love but after that, there's not much of substance here.

This, I believe was the Fiction book I had decided to read for my reading class. After having finally read through it, it turned out unbelievably bad. I'll admit that it sounded interesting to begin with. Or the subject at hand sounded mildly interesting. And the cover kind of drew me in. But it became intolerable to a point. There were too many random things in the book. It was difficult to answer questions about the book, like the hidden meaning behind its entirety. I don't think there was a point to it. But then again, I guess you could call it an &quot;adventure&quot; book more than a &quot;self discovery&quot; book. Although the part that humored me the most was the depressed robot. I guess you can say I'm not a sci-fi fan. As much as I like watching the sci-fi channel, my feelings towards it is just like any other. It was dull and boring. Too much random junk in it, I like books that have plots and so forth. But if this is what you fancy, then so is it. By all means, read the book. But for those who share the same feelings as me will strongly agree that it was terribly made. I personally, don't see how it is considered one of the best books ever. Along with a few other books I've read who to me, weren't quite up to par either. Who judges that anyway? Its randomness not only made me bored out of my mind, but it also made me confused, talking about the &quot;Golden Heart&quot; and whatnot. I hope I don't have to read this book again. The book in a few parts seemed a bit repetitive. What I didn't like the most was when it talked about nothing. Seriously, it said, in a certain part that it had nothing to do with the story, or plot in particular. Which was more than a waste of my time.

Hilariously funny. A mix of creativity and infinite imagination. Highly recommended!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I clearly did not understand this book at all. I read it based on a recommendation of a scientist I work with who said it was an incredible read, but this came out as one lame novel. Maybe it's because it was written for a previous generation of reader, but Adams's novel doesn't really do anything all that exciting. The premise is intersting enough, Arthur Dent being a human being who is saved from the destruction of the Earth because of the need to build an intergalactic highway. Some of the details are also fascinating (and what saves the novel from being 0 stars in my eyes), especially the way religion and technology are described in such a satirical form, but the book iteself is poorly written, choppy, and frankly unentertaining. If someone can tell me what I was supposed to get out of this novel, please pass the information along.I really do think that my negative views towards the book stem from it seeming dated in my eyes and how the humorous and sarcastic tone coming out as something quite standard in today's writing world. Maybe the novel was a breakthrough when it came out for the way it viewed the world and the way Adams pokes fun at almost everything, but none of this can cover up the fact that in my eyes, this seems like a poor, finished product, one that relies on its somewhat interesting satirical moments to cover up its other flaws."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I tried to get into this book years ago when my brother sent me a copy. At the time I had difficulty because it seemed just pointless chatter. Recently I had the opportunity to view the old series on DVD and thoroughly enjoyed them, so I read The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The book is wacky and fun, and has more than a mild amount of social criticism concealed in its pages.Since I'd enjoyed Restaurant, I returned to Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and again found it difficult to get into it. I was well into the tale before it seemed worth the effort. Even then I found patches that were dull.Despite the on-again/off-again interest, I did enjoy it over all, partly because I was familiar with the characters from Restaurant. As a first book, it's not bad, but I'm glad I read Restaurant, or I might again have given up on this book.My favorite character here, as in the second book, was Marvin the depressive robot. Most of us probably know someone just like Marvin; I know I do. In fact I've known several. His poorly disguised attempts to gain sympathy and his unwillingness to take it even when it's offered, lest it decrease the satisfaction of his \\"martyrdom,\\" is very funny precisely because one does know people like him.I didn't care much for Beeblebrox, but I don't think you're intended to. (I've known people like him, too.) He's an extreme, the other end of which seems to be Arthur. Because of this, they're both memorable types. Ford on the other hand, after the brief stir created by his introduction, seems so middle of the road that one either confuses him with Arthur or Bebblebrox, depending upon what he's doing or saying at the time. Trilliam, too, gets lost after her introduction. She's very bright but she's just there. She's not independent as a personality. She's a \\"straight man\\" for Beeblebrox and support for Arthur. If she were removed from the book, I don't think it would make the slightest difference, which is too bad. More could have been made of her character than was."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"...that hasn't already been said?Probably nothing, though it didn't stop all 494 of you from trying.#495"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I WAS EXPECTING THE BOOK TO BE MUCH FUNNIER.

If you're into science fiction humor than this is a good book for you. I will give the author credit for good characterization. He goes into good detail about the different appearances and traits of each of the characters which brings the book alive. Both the setting and the plot were a little confusing however. The setting was constantly changing and the topic of conversation quickly changed from one thing to the next in a random way. This made reading the book a little tedious and frustrating to follow. All in all, it was not worth the time for me to read and understand this book, because it didn't catch enough of my interest."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Perhaps this is just another unfortunate example of the hype exceeding the final product, but despite the ubiquitous praise and, more importantly, the highly entertaining book, I found myself ultimately disappointed with the final experience. Sure, Douglas Adams is a funny guy. Sure he's got an astounding imagination, with a gift for the turn of phrase, not to mention the idiosyncratic character. But the absence of one aspect of the experience truly depleted for me what could have been the grand sci-fi/humor classic that The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy had been portrayed to me as: the lack of an epic feel.Adams quickly throws us into the midst of the absurd, yet entertaining events of his first novel. If any one thing can detract from this book more than another, it is the pace. It moves fast. It moves very fast, and to an extent I can comprehend how this is necessary. Adams needs to take the reader for a ride, from one local to another, one character to another, one hilarious punch line to another. But in the mean time, the flow of the novel is sacrificed, not to mention coherence, character development, and valuable descriptions of what are certainly some of the most imaginative environments. Instead, Adams takes it on faith that we will fill in all of his numerous blanks. It's no surprise that this novel reads more like the radio show from whence it was born.As far as the story goes, Adams must be commended. He notes in the foreword that he only figured out the plot as he went along, and nonetheless, the structure of the plot certainly doesn't feel that way. The ultimately problem resides in the fact that the entire novel seems unfinished--as he states in his foreword, it was. This is not to criticize his strategy to turn the book into a series (or a trilogy of five books, as he prefers to call it), but more a comment on the conclusion of the first book. It is all well and good to prolong a story over several novels, but the way to make up for it is to give each novel its on independent narrative arc, making it more of an episode in a series rather than the first act. Unfortunately, any reader whose interest is remotely piqued will be forced to buy the subsequent novels simply to understand the first.But ultimately, the novel--and hopefully the remaining books in the series--are purely entertaining and fun. Indeed, there is much I can criticize, but nonetheless it is oftentimes overshadowed by the fun and funny style and story presented in the text. At the very least, I can say that Adams has a grand gift. Narrative humor tales are few and far between today, and so The Hitchhiker's Guide takes the tally as certainly one of the better representatives in that genre. The book still possesses all the potential to be a truly great masterwork, even the sci-fi/-humor epic that Adams intended. Comprehensively, however, it fails to encapsulate the image of the galaxy rather than just the style."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As it seems most people love this book, I am a voice of the silent minority, or perhaps majority. Anyways, they are silent so no one really knows. This book did not have much going for it except for the fact that it weighs in at a slight 320 pages. With the Harry Potter books approaching 1000, 320 is slight. The problem with this book lies in the fact that it never ends.Despite a mildly engaging premise, the book quickly lapses into slapstick humor and cheap laughs. The poetry fiasco being the first of many encounters sprinkle throughout this book. My main quarrel with this book is actually in the ending, I would say spoiler alert, but there is no ending to spoil for anybody. The characters simply get back onto their ship and the book is over. I actually found myself turning the page expecting some sort of conclusion.Now, not every book without an ending is bad. Take Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.(spoiler) Even though the main character meets his end on the last page without any sort of fanfare or conclusion, the ending is so well crafted that the reader is not left feeling lost. After all, the world ended, why shouldn't the main character. But in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the characters just continue on as if nothing has happened. The reader is faced with many unanswered questions about what will happen next and why the earth is so unimportant. Call me earthcentric, but I don't know what Douglas Adams has against humans and the earth.I know many people love this book and I am not here to argue with their views, but the other side's views need to be expressed. So, if you open this book with the expectation of it being anything more than a collection of anectdotes without conclusion, I do not recommend this book. Find yourself a nice book that will leave you feeling full."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"the book had that old book smell and the pages were tinged a little yellow, but there were no missing pages or rips, as well as no marks to the cover or pages."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great book for a good laugh.

I know this series has a very loyal following, but I have to say that I think these books are absolute crap! The overall premise is sound...pretty cool in fact, but the books themselves? not so much. The writing is just way below par. This is the sort of book that is based more on gimmicks than story. Things don't have to make sense, because the author will just think of a device to justify them. My favorite (or least favorite) example of this was in the first book (I think) where an invention called \\"improbability drive\\" means that anything can happen, at any time, for absolutly no reason. People can fall out of the sky, time can jump forward, whatever, it doesn't matter. Plot be damned! I dunno...it must have it's merits considering the cult popularity of this book, I just don't see them. It's not that I have no sense of humor, I just think funny things need to make sense too. This book is string of random events stuck together to form a story, and moved along by a cheap plot device. It has it's moments of side-splitting, rolling around on the floor laughter, but they're few and far between.

I like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams carries a way in writing in hime that will keep you wanted more everytime... if you have not read this series I highly recommend you give it a try."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglass Adams' \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is one of the most amusing books I have ever read and if I were just to rate a book on soley humor, this would have probably gotten five stars. The plotline of space travel is unique and fascinating. Tis book also tries to answer life's big questions in a very humorous, light-hearted fashion. One big problem I had with the book was the very abrupt ending that not only caught me by surprise, but was very anti-climatic. Also, there were some fascinating characters that we were superically introduced to that I wish the author had explored a little more. Overall a very enjoyable read, yet had some key elements missing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I only give it less than four stars because it's so short and a bit disjointed. A throughly funny read, however, and well worth picking up, it should be rated four and three quarters or so.I read it again so I could go see the movie with the novel freshly on my mind. The last time I read the story was many years ago, and I have heard it as a book on tape (which was really good too).The humor is definately more clear as an older adult, if you read this book back in the eighties, like I did, and haven't read it since, it's time to pick it up again. It's not long and can be read in a few hours, it's worth a few laughs and at the very least will prepare you to see the movie that just came out.Cheers, and thanks for all the fish."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a very exciting novel about an ordinary man named Arthur Dent who is rescued by his best friend Ford Prefect before Earth is destroyed by the Vogons. Ford Prefect reveals one of his biggest secrets that he is an alien who is from a planet called Betelgeuse. Arthur and Ford then go on an extraordinary adventure in space with their companions Zaphod Beebelbroxe, Trillian, and Marvin. Zaphod is te ignorant president of the Galaxy with a second head and third arm. After stealing the Heart of Gold space ship, he is now a criminal. Trillian is a girl who Arthur once met and fell in love with but ran away with Zaphod. Marvin is a depressed robot with a brain the size of a planet. As you can see, Douglas Adams is very creative in this book and also has a sense of humor. The satire in this book is great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Interesting,enjoyable book. I found it to be quite funny most of the time. It was hard to put it down once I started reading it. I have always enjoyed the \\"Man's sense of anomie, one person trying to fit into the culture of others\\" kind of scenario whether it be in books or movies.Dent is clearly that kind of person in this book. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. The pictures he paints are vivid. The stories are implausible yet enjoyable. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way.To sum up: The book holds your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not formulaic,the story was fresh,and the visuals that he painted were good. All in all a good experience"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is, without a doubt, the most hilarious book I have ever read. It is a perfect sample of the genius of Douglas Adams, and his intense wit. A must own for lovers of sophisticated humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Well actually,i read the first 3 books in the serias about 2 years ago and i really don't remember that much,but i remember the names and the events,and i must say i laughed alot from this one and the other two after him,the serias is a funny Sci-Fi,the people who will enjoy it very much is a people with alot of humor,and Sci-Fi fans that don't really like all the drama Sci-Fi with all the understandable science facts,that is what this book is all about.it has a funny plot,characters and events all over it. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because it's too damn short! i'm used to read books with 300-600 pages! what i'm gonne do now is buy the whole serias (i already got the second one and the third),and read it in a raw like a one book,maybe u should try it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No, fifteen stars, and an aditional two-thumbs-up for extra humor. The other ones by Douglas Adams are great too, just not quite as funny. My E-mail is Soap90@aol.com, I want your opinion!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hi, this is Guy Buick, fellow hitchhiker of the galaxy. I can't believe how accuratey Mr. Adams described the world of a hitchhiker. Ford Prefect and I, yes, Ford is real, thoroughly enjoyed this enlightening tale of the galaxy. So grab a towel, grab a copy, stick out your thumb, and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Try this. Read the reviews by people who rated this book only one or two stars. If your impression of those people isn't that you'd rather kill yourself than sit next to them on a plane, don't read this book. Otherwise, pick up the Guide and find yourself back here and giving it five stars within a week."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It didn't suck, it wasn't in the least bit boring, ball point pens ARE funny, and you're an idiot."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is one of the books you'll never forget you've read. Whether you like it or hate it, you'll be reminded of it everytime you hear about a vogon, or why people on earth think that a digital wrist watch is something to be proud of. The Guide will give its reader a new perspective on a bunch of things. Being a science fiction story, it's as much a scietific story.In the book, we meet Arthur Dent. Arthur is a completely normal Brit living an hour outside London. His life is turned upside down the day when he finds out his beloved earth, his house, the pub is right in the way of the new intergalactic highway. We get to meet Ford Prefect, Arthurs friend since 15 years, who turns out to be much more than just a human being.The Hitchhikers Guide will test your nerves. Douglas Adams seems to be amused of the details surrounding life. I often found myself laughing at things I do everyday but never thought of before. I would say the book degrades mankind a little bit. But I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Overall, an interesting book, especially if you're into dry British humour, science fiction, things which happen for No Obvious Reason, inside jokes, et cetera. But as a story itself, the book gets average reviews...it was originally a radio serial program, and it sometimes shows. Worth a look, though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There is not much left to say about the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - just to thank Douglas Adams for having such a piercing wit and being able to make us laugh at ourselves and everything around us. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction and humour."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Numerologists, time-travellers and sociologists - you will chuck in your profession having read this opus.All ignorant questions ever going to be asked by you are led ad-absurdum by this more than mystic genius, the answer is 42 and geleology! Reading this book was addictive, but the aftershock is extensive. NO book before gave me such a deep impression of real understanding what happens in this curious existence. A new outlook on life- has anyone declared a new philosophy naming Adams as founder? Stephan S."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I loved this book. At first I was skeptical because I'm not really into Sci Fi, But I was hooked from page one. Totally Awesome."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is an impressive work of fiction. It's hard to write a heartwarming and hilarious book that begins with almost total apocalypse. But Adams pulls it off flawlessly.More than anything else, I think the Hitchhikers Guide is all about the absurdities of everyday life. All these things we take for granted, like mice and potted plants and fancy dress parties. What if they weren't normal at all? And what if they had more significance than we ever could imagine? Those are the sorts of questions Adams is asking.Arthur, Trillian, and Zaphod run into some interesting things as they try to determine the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything, but it wasn't what they were expecting. Read this book, you might discover something unexpected as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Do you LOVE British humor, like Monty Python or Black Adder? There is a lot of dry humor in this book, so be prepared. Me personally, I loved reading this again. And because of it's portable size, it's easy to take anywhere, which means if you're afraid of people hearing you laugh hysterically from the bathroom, then don't take it in there. Be sure to look up Ford Prefect on Wikipedia if you don't know what one is. Neologisms abound in this culture-impacting, geek-required, hysterical masterpiece. The movie barely follows this story, and when you read the book, you'll discover just how challenging it would be to make a film as funny as the book and be the same story."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I liked this book -- maybe not as much as I thought I would, but still not bad. It felt like a book your strange friend from high school wrote -- the kid on the stage crew who would never miss an episode of Star Trek and who was designing web pages before most people had e-mail. The funny thing is that Hitchhiker's Guide was one of the first of its kind and had many imitators (like my strange friend).I was actually belly-laughing at some parts -- Adams is very good with humor. How else could you laugh at a book that begins with the needless destruction of planet Earth?!?For all super-intelligent shades of the color blue out there, this book's for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"By the strangest coincidence I left this classic at the office and was stuck at home reading Hemingway short stories. Hemingway writes about drink, and war, and illness. Adams, on the other hand, writes about drink, and war, and illness. One thing's for sure: Hitchhiker's Guide is not science fiction. It is also not science. Probably not fiction either. What it is is really weird, like the front page of the daily newspaper, only more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It has been said that Adams writes in one-liners. This is an unfair criticism (there are, in fact, hardly any one-liners here), but there is an element of truth to it: his writing is rather episodic. He tends to write scenes in not because they logically advance the plot or fit into the story, but simply to harp on some issue. He can also be fairly redundant. A good example of both these points is the unjustifiably lengthy scene with the cops--we get it, Adams, cops are dumb!All of these problems, however, improve significantly in later books in the series. And this book has great virtues also. Adams has a brilliant wit, and his dialogue is particularly excellent. His use of science in the book has been justly praised, though the line is blurry between when he's satirizing the more bizarre theories of science, or when he actually accepts them and just thinks they make for amusing situations.Personally, I actually thought the recent movie version was better than the book, as it preserved its virtues (the witty dialogue, etc.) and strengthened some of its weaker areas (the sketchy plotting, etc.). I know some purists who've been fans of the book for years will think this is blasphemy, and I can understand that, but it's kind of a silly objection for a story that's been through so many permutations in so many different media already."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Let me start by saying that I LOVED the movie. Usually, when you enjoy a movie you are bound to hold to the old cliche \\"the movie was good but the book was better\\". In this case, although the book was okay, I thought the movie was much better.The book was funny in parts and obviously was the inspiration for a hilarious movie, but on the whole, I was disappointed with the book. If you enjoyed the movie, I would recommend the book just for a different slant on the story.Apparently, people have been talking about this book for years. I guess I just don't understand how the book falls so flat with such a great writer. The story, the characters, the imagaination, all was well done, but at the end of the book, I was just left feeling empty. I couldn't believe it. The book just ended abruptly. There was no real climax and no resolution. Maybe you have to read the other \\"Hitchhikers\\" books to get the whole story. I don't know if I will take the time.So, just an average read that was made in to a fantastic movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This has to be one of the funniest books ever written. Why? Because it's filled with absolutely wonderful stream-of-consciousness style humor. And I mean humor! The kind that is legitimately funny. This will make you smile, even laugh. If you like wacky, off-beat, often surreal gags, you have to buy this book.Okay, so if it's so good, why not 5 stars? Why only 4? Because, truth to be told, there isn't that much of a story. It's kind of like a sitcom - the characters are so wonderful and throw out such gloriously funny lines, you barely notice that there's very little actually happening and you don't really care that much. Well, this book is like that. A series of 'incidents' that are really neither here nor there, but presented with a sharp, surreal wit, not least in the narrative, let alone the dialogue. Okay, everthing eventually ties in, but the joy in reading this is not in the world-building and grand storytelling scale of the likes of Lord of the Rings, but in the sheer delight of it's comedic value.It's an old book now, probably given a new boost of life by the recent movie (unfortunately, not that good an adaptation). If you enjoy wacky humor, you won't be disappointed here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far one of my favorite books! It's just so well written and so funny. Great for \\"getaway\\" summer reading!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Many people who haven't yet discovered Douglas Adams' science-fiction comedy series are probably feverishly racing to finish this first novel in time for the movie's opening (as I did). This book has been on my reading list for a long time, and I'm grateful to the movie for giving me a kick in the butt and finally getting me to sit down and read it (which I did in about three days---it's a remarkably fast read). I can't imagine how they're going to adapt it to the screen, as the book is a goofy, surrealist jokefest that never once takes itself at all seriously. You can tell Douglas Adams was making things up as he went along, not pausing along the way to make sure anything makes a whole lot of sense. The story--or at least the book's main premise--is probably familiar to anyone who's reading this comment, so I won't bother with a summary (which I'm not sure I could do anyway). If you sat Woody Allen down and asked him to write a season of Dr. Who, \\"Hitchhiker\\" is what you'd get. I really enjoyed it without really loving it. I'll probably go on to read the other stories, but these books serve the same purpose for me as do P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves\\" series. They're the literary equivalent of junk food---they satisy a craving, but leave me wanting to move on to something a little more substantial."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide was a novel unlike most i have read before. Along with intellectual inferences, came a light mood and un-used setting. How often do you read a comical story that deals with outer space, and the life that may exist out there? Douglas Adams knows his audience, and can appeal to everyone that is able to read. Being older, a reader may have more understanding of the scientific inferences, like the improbability drive for example. However, no matter how old the reader is, anyone can feel relieved when a missile is turned into a whale while in midair. This novel may have been humorous, but at the same time, a more educated reader can come away questioning all the universe really has to offer. Is there more out there? Adams writes this novel as a way to get across his ideas about the universe, and changes it from a science fiction, into a comical, yet throught-provoking literary work. I would reccomend it to anyone who needs a laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I really, really love The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I was sitting here reading the reviews and I decided to write my own review of the book. I think people who said it was too confusing had good reasons for saying it, but I think the confusion is the whole point of the book. Life is confusing, and this book is just a twisted version of life. I think people who said it was &quot;juvenile&quot; didn't really get the book. The point is that the whole world is &quot;juvenile&quot; and insane. Adults in the world don't always behave like sophisticated mature people, some of them behave like little kids or just generally act like idiots. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is just a version of the way Douglas Adams sees the world- an insane, messed up place where you never know what will happen next.I'm not saying The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is deep reading, but people don't need to read deep, thought-provoking books ALL the time. Last year I went on a seven-week trip and The Hitchhiker's &quot;Trilogy&quot; (all five of them) were the only books I brought that weren't &quot;deep&quot;. I don't know why I said that.I can't really judge how good it is as a sci-fi book. It probably isn't the best, but I've hardly read any other sci-fi books so I can't really tell. Will you please recommend some to me if anyone is bored enough to read my review? Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"something is seriousley wrong in adams head.and i love every part of it!!!!!!!!! best book ever!!!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first picked this book up in an English class.

I started laughing on the first sentence and didn't stop till I'd finished the book. I don't mean that I thought it was funney and snickered to myself, I mean that I laughed out loud the whole time (well until I lost my voice). I recomend this book to anyone. Period.

Arthur Dent is an earthling who has had everything go wrong with him. His house is about to get torn down when he sees his old friend Ford Prefect, an alien that has lived on earth for fifteen years doing research on his revised Hitchikers Guide. Prefect comes at no better time because the world is about to end in eleven minutes. Just before the world comes to total anialation, the are picked up and travel around the universe. They arrive in Magrathea, which is just a factory planet for building planets for rich people. The people of Magrathea were woken up to build another earth because the previous earth, our earth, was a giant computer that's program was to find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everthing. Magrathea was going to build another earth because our earth was destroyed just minutes before the answer was questioned. Since everyone wanted to know the question, they decided to re-build another earth to find it out. Once the mice, the secret rulers of earth, find out that there is an earthling alive, they wanted his brain. Arthur runs away and the mice are stuck with nothing. They make up a question and everybody is happy, or are they? This book opens your thoughts to many different questions we have about the universe and that we would like to know. If you want to broaden your horizons and open your mind, then read this book to be thoroughly entertained."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I, personally, am in a constant search for intriguing books, and the Hitchhikers guide series was truly one of the most enjoyable and addictive I have ever read. Douglas Adams does an encredible job of combining off-the-wall science-ficton with an amazing sense of humor. I recommend this book to anybody and everybody I come in contact with. The Hitchhiker's Guide series begins with an amazing twist. The main character, Arthur, comes in contact with an old friend of his, Ford prefect (really an alien form the vicinity of betelgeuse) who hitchhikes him off the planet right before a race of Vogons, (cruel aliens who write bad poetry) blows up the earth to build an intergalactic highway. But it doesn't end there. Arthur and Ford hitch their way, by pure luck, onto the Heart Of Gold- a spaceship with the latest in Alien technology, an amazing device called the &quot;Improbability Drive.&quot; The Improbability Drive, as it's name indicates, makes the improbable probable; and that is how Arthur and Ford end up cruising the galaxy, searching for the question to the Ultimate Answer..... Of Life, the Universe, and Everything....... with an ex-girlfriend and a long lost acquaintance with two heads.

I bought it, and it was one of the best books I have ever invested money in.

This is definitely one of the greatest books of all time."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was so funny that, though it isn't very long, it took me forever to read; every time I laughed so hard I cried, I had to put the book down. It's quirky, it takes unexpected turns, the characters are laws unto themselves, and it makes you start to wonder just what all of this is about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I recommend the first and second books in this series. After that, I lost interest. Maybe it's just me. Anyway, it's a pleasure to read so long as said reader isn't dependent on plots, development, meaning, or other pretentious, out dated literary cliches. Just read it already. For something in the same vein, but with a message, i suggest 'The Sirens of Titan' By Vonnegut; a funny book that makes you THINK."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book in the early 80's when I was in middle school. I just picked it up again for the second time in Jan 1999. I think I even enjoyed it better the 2nd time. This is the Monty Python for galactic travelers. Three things I've learned from this book: 1. A towel is quite a useful tool 2. In the scheme of things, digital watches are NOT that big a deal 3. Have faith. Don't Panic! This book is such a fun and light escape from reality, as are the rest of Douglas Adam's books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A brilliant piece of storytelling, Adams weaves his tale with ease...considering the fact that the book spills over to a complete trilogy (in four parts!). The brickbats, couched in the form of seemingly improbable events, are aimed at those of us who take Life a trifle seriously. The conclusion especially is marvellous!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never in our time has a book of such caliber been written... and sustained such a following.

So grab your towel, sit back and start reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As anyone can tell from looking at the other 500 some reviews here, this is a masterpiece of modern American Literature. Even though it's British. However, there are a few small problems I have wih this edition. Firstly, where's the green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker that adorned the covers of all previous editions? Secondly: well, acutally that's my only comment. However, just this book will leave you wanting more. I suggest the &quot;Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide&quot; which is all 5 in the increasingly inaccurately named &quot;Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot; in one neat little package, complete with green-alien-smiley-faced hitchhiker."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book two years ago and it's been my favorite ever since.

I can tell you, however, that each and every time it is as funny, witty and cathartic as the first time. I constantly discover new things about it as I age, and I never lose interest.Since its initial launch as a radio show on the BBC in 1978, this creation by Douglas Adams has been an instant classic. In the course of its evolution, HGTTG has been a television show, a series of books, a film and a stage play. I like the book the best (with the original radio show a close second) and would recommend it to nearly everybody.This book is a must-read for virtually everyone. Don't forget your towel, and don't forget to read it either."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not often that a book begins with the destruction of this planet we call home, but in this case it's the perfect introduction. It serves to illustrate that we Earthlings have been looking at the universe much too narrowly, and that its quite apparent that we are not the only living beings in the universe, or even the most intelligent.The story begins with the tale of Arthur Dent, a Briton and the only surviving remnant of human life on Earth. He was saved from termination by his old friend Ford Prefect, actually an undercover alien reporter so to speak, who he had always found to be a bit odd. The two find themselves in the bowels of a giant Vogon destroyer once they depart from Earth. As it turns out the Vogons we merely destroying Earth to accommodate the new intergalactic highway they were building. The papers were even filed at town halls if anyone cared to read them. From here it is one harrowing experience to the next with only one most important book as their guide, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.I really enjoyed this novel for its creativity and outlandishness. Some of the ideas are extremely surreal, and it keeps itself from becoming a cheap sci-fi story by incorporating scientific fact and semi-plausible physics."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I bought it as a gift and my 17 year old son loved it and wanted to give it to his friends."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is humorous and a bit advanturous. I can't say anything in comparison to the movie as I never saw it, but the book is nice. If you look you'll see that this author wrote other books, this one is just the first one of many."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Famous fiction books have traditionally contained certain elements; such as underlying meanings, morals, heroes and villians, allusions to previous works, parallels to situations in the world at large, etc, etc... This is even true for many of the early famous science fiction works such as those by Jules Verne, Isaac Isamov, and H. G. Wells. And then we have this book by Douglas Adams. Probably the most famous science fiction book in recent memory, it contains none of these elements. There are main characters, but one really can not categorize them as heroes and villains. There are conflicts, but not like those we think of that deal with the themes of greed, honesty, honor, loyalty, etc... And there are parallels to events that really occur, but they tend to be too obvious for anyone to miss. It is one of these parallels that begin the book; Arthur wakes up to find that his house has been scheduled to be demolished to make room for a new freeway. Before noon, he and the world discover that Earth is about to be demolished to make room for an interstellar highway. From there the story only gets more interesting and nonsensical. The \\"bad guys\\" are more laughable than scary, such as the poetry-reading Vorgons. The \\"heroes\\" Arthur and his Prefect friend are more \\"going along for the ride\\" than really fighting against or for something. And no-one really gets hurt in the story. The overall theme of the book is anyone's guess, though my guess is that there is no theme, much like life in the modern, industrialized world. The book itself is quite funny to read; any tears shed by the reader are those due to laughter. The best way to describe it is a marriage of dry English humor with science fiction and travel writing. Overall, I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book \\"The Hithhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", by the imaginative Douglas Adams, is one of the most famous science-fiction pieces of modern literature. It tells the hilarious and ironic story of the destruction of the Earth, and the cosmic adventure of its only survivor, a regular British man named Arthur Dent, to the dead planet of Magrathea.Arthur escapes the total destruction of his planet, by a fleet of alien spaceships who intended to build a hiper road, thanks to his friend, Ford Prefect, a friendly alien disguised as an unemployed actor on Earth who's acutally a writer for the new edition of the \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". After that, they go through the most improbable things that could ever happen in the whole galaxy, and, most improbably, get out of them alive.That's the strongest aspect of the book: the improbability. Douglas Adams catches the reader through the most absurd scenes, and makes the passage between those scenes very quickly, what makes the plot sound even more absurd. But that's not a bad thing, it makes the reader unable to stop reading the book, always anxious to know what could happen next, and it also adds a lot of humor, which is also very strong (and effective) in the book.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thrillig , exciting and hilarious book, but it is also full os reflections about the meaning of existence, and can really make the reader think. A must have to all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams' first masterpiece, first conceived while he was drunk, forgotten for six years, and then remembered again, broadcast as a radio show, and finally published.Online satire MMORPG Kingdom of Loathing has quite a few references to this hilarious book, such as the \\"awful poetry journal,\\" and using it will cause a reference to the terrible poetry of the Vogons. It goes something like this: \\"You read the awful poetry journal. In a desperate attempt to save humanity, your large intestine attempts to strangle you from inside. You lose 20-24 hit points.\\" It was a funny reference to an already funny Hitchhiker's Guide tidbit. And inside a probably random room of improbability, you just might see a whale and a bowl of petunias. Although having no reference to the number 42 that I have noticed, still it has many more satirical references to satire itself.Arthur Dent is the main character in this story, and his friend Ford Prefect (a humorous reference to a Ford car that many thought was a misspelling of Perfect) warns him of *gasp* impending doom. The Earth is about to be destroyed, so they hitch a ride on a Vogon spacecraft, (thanks to the Dentrassi cooks, the Vogons don't allow any hitchhikers on) but are immediately chucked off by the Vogons after going through hyperspace and listening to \\"An Ode to a Turgid Bee.\\" At least I think that's what it was.Floating in space for 29 seconds, they are \\"improbably\\" rescued by The Heart of Gold, a spaceship recently stolen by Ford Prefect's two-headed friend, Zaphod Beeblebrox. Having many mini-escapades, such as discovering the \\"meaning of live, the universe, and everything,\\" or just trying to find a place to eat, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great, indispensable book that people from age 10 to 100 will like to read. (Although the younger sorts may not get the humor of it.)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is pure fun! It's a great trip. The only problem I had was that at the beginning of the book I kept trying to follow and understand every little detail...which is difficult (if not impossible!). I read the first few pages over and over again trying to figure out what the heck was going on; it was very confusing. For people who are very detail-oriented and get frustrated easily, this is not the book for you. But, if you allow yourself to get lost in Adam's world you will throughly enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a uniquely humorous journey of a normal man, Arthur Dent, who finds himself wandering through space after the world explodes. Arthur and Ford (the man that saved him from the earth) find their lives twisted with coincidence as they travel with the Galaxy's president on the universe's continuously improbable ship, The Heart of Gold. As they discover legendary planets, escape genius mice, and fly at the very dangerous speed of R17, Arthur finds himself rambling through the endless adventure that is the universe.This story is amusing, but sometimes too witty for young reader, like myself, who are just becoming familiar with advanced books such as this one. Confusing phrases are omnipresent throughout this well-told tale, sometimes making reading slow and difficult. I know that when I read this book, I didn't even realize some advanced jokes, but sometimes I had to think about some of the wording and was forced to read on with these troubling terms in the back of my mind. One of these points was when Arthur and Ford first find themsleves on The Heart of Gold when the ship's improbability drive is on. Everything is random as I found out when a group of monkeys asks them if they would read their copy of Hamlet. This saying was troubling me until I found that it came from a saying stating that if 50 monkeys were put in a room, one would produce a writing as brilliant as Hamlet. This story may be hilarious, but sometimes Douglas Adams terminology goes over the heads of less expierienced readers.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is surely one of the most entertaining books I've read, but it is also the most confusing and advanced book by far. The story may be at level too high for most Junior High/ High School Students, but for me, the laughs in this book far out weighed the confusion in it. The characters in the book were exceptional and the setting was incomparable, even for a less- savvy reader like myself. Every day I looked forward to uncovering a new chapter in this masterpiece.I reccomend this book to less-skilled readers looking for challenges, but mainly to clever readers seearching for absurdity and fun. Anyone who is a Monty Python fan will love the book, even if they're young, but it'll take an older advanced reader to fully taken in hidden coincidences, jokes, and metaphors featured in this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i really enjoyed this book. the movie was good so i read the book and i am pleasantly surprised that the book was a good laugh. i love dry humor so this is perfect for me. highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Being a reader who\`s read a lot of thrillers lately, I have spent some time looking for something different.

It definitely consists of that type of weird British humor (e.g. Monty Python, etc.) that I have always been attracted to. It's a great combination of science fiction and dry humor that makes for a very entertaining read. It's also nice to know that the answer to the universal question of Life, The Universe and Everything is...42. Unfortunately, nobody remembers what the question is. This book is a fast and often hilarious trip across the galaxy. So grab your towel and remember...Dont Panic!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The best piece of pop culture of our century. A mix of sci-fi, Monty Python, irony and non-sense. Douglas Adams mixes everything in a way that the result is nothing but a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is one of the funniest, most joyously quirky, quotable novels I've ever read. This dizzying satire takes place just after some outer space bureaucrats seize the Earth through eminent domain and blow it up to make room for an interstellar highway. Two humans survive the wreckage and travel through a Wonderland-like vision of the universe.The characters, situations, dialog and bizarre turns of phrase are all brilliant. I've read it a half-dozen times over the last 30 years and it cracks me up every time.The first two books of the series (\\"Hitchhiker's Guide...\\" and \\"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\") are by far the strongest. I also highly recommend the original BBC radio series from the 1970s that started it all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece of science fiction, fantasy, humor, and just plain brilliance? Not much but I can say that this book will never grow old for me. I've read it countless times, listen to the audio book read by Stephen Fry over and over, and laugh every time at the appropriate parts, and at some of the inappropriate ones. The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book that fans of fiction in general should at least try. I'm sure it's not for everyone though. There are several sections of the book that are confusing to say the least but I love that about this book and the entire series. It is one of my top ten favorite books and I am sure it will always remain there. If you read this and don't like it, at least you can go away with a few interesting facts such as how useful a towel is, how to hitchhike the galaxy for less than thirty Altarian dollars a day, who the smartest beings on Earth actually are, the purpose of Earth, and the answer to life, the universe, and everything. And let's not forget Vogon poetry, the Infinite Improbability Drive, Marvin, Arthur, Ford Prefect, and Thursdays. Just read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I usually don't fall in love with a book so quickly, but this one stole my heart and captured my attention right from the off. Its zany humour and imaginative characters really won me over, so much so that I intend to buy the entire series as soon as I possibly can. I borrowed this one from the library.)Arthur Dent is just your average man living on Earth whose house is about to be demolished. Naturally, he's very upset about this, so his friend Ford Prefect takes him down to the pub to converse and try to cheer him up. Oh, and also to tell him the entire Earth is about to be demolished, so his house is really nothing to worry about.The story then quickly moves into the far reaches of space with Arthur and Ford meeting many delightfully quirky characters when travelling throughout the universe. To name a few, there's Zaphod Beeblebrox, an ex-galactic president with two heads and three arms; Trillian Astra, a human who is well-versed in mathematics and astrophysics; Marvin, a manic-depressive robot; and Slartibartfast, an elderly alien from the planet Magrathea.Interspersed within the chapters are excerpts from the actual 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy', which aims to help wandering intergalactic hitchhiker's with certain rules and tips. These are just as wonderful and hilarious to read as the main story and it never feels as though the focus is being torn away.The pacing of this story is wonderful; it's always exciting and never boring, and if you're anything like me, you'll become so heavily involved in it that you'll find it hard to ever put it down.The only downside is that at just 220 pages, it's rather short, and the story does end rather suddenly -- which is why I'm anxious to get my hands on the next books to finish off the tale.In the end, if those are the only two negative things I can think of, 'Hitchhiker' is easily one of the best novels I've read.*****/*****"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It was one of the most brilliant books I've read, but I wish one more person could give it 1 star!

In no way did it help me to fall alseep, but I loved the story, loved the reader's wonderful voices, and didn't worry about anything in my quest to sleep.The story is this, for those unfamiliar: Arthur Dent is an ape-decended mammal from the planet earth who's house is about to get demolished for a bypass to, well, pass through.

In fact, read the entire series. Everyone should as far as I'm concerned."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a book you should read unless you need a well defined plot and no laughs. The plot is well hidden by the randomness, a description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, an alcoholic drink that it seems the author had the first of on Earth before writing it, the introduction of the Hitchhiker's Guide that begins &quot;Space is big. Very big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind boggling big it is.&quot;, and the theory of where all the ball point pens go. There is also a part where a character turns into a penguin. There is some plot but more randomness. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor. If you are someone who is ready for a laugh grab a towel and get ready for a story that is out of this world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The random details that are found on every page of this book are really what make it THE BEST BOOK EVER!There is a story behind every little detail- and always a funny one. At first, with all of the jumping from galaxy to galaxy, it is hard to follow, but after a while you learn which details you should remember and which are just funny little things you can laugh at and then forget. This is definately the best sci fi book I have ever read! I found it interesting that some of the events made me kind of protective toward the earth, like how you feel patriotic on July 4, but this was pride for the whole planet. Almost every book anyone has ever reccomended to me I've thought was boring, slow, etc... but this one hit the jackpot. I wish somebody had told me about it sooner!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that I believe the reader will enjoy thoroughly. Douglas Adams wrote this book and it contains a sense humor that only Douglas Adams could bring. The humor in this book is somewhat random, yet is highly entertaining. The book has a somewhat hidden plot, but I believe that the theme is: \\"What if it were like this?\\" But even though an ironic book it is, it still keeps the reader turning the pages until it's finished. If you like this book, then read all of the books in the series, except the third one. I did not enjoy the third one as many people have, but found its humor old and boring. But I can tell you now The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy I was informed that it was a laugh-out-loud funny book, which would be impossible to put down. Some of those who recommended it to me said this book was the funniest piece of literature that they ever read. With a report such as this, how could I resist reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when opportunity stuck. And I was disappointed after opening the first page. The book just was not as incredibly funny as I had heard, and could not draw a chuckle. Now, I am not saying that it was not a good book, the satirical elements, while once again, not laugh out loud funny, did portray the ups and downs of human life with impeccable accuracy.The satirical portion of this book made me enjoy it as a discussion of the human condition. In the beginning of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the earth is destroyed to make room for a galactic highway, just as our the protagonist's house on earth is destroyed to make room for a terrestrial highway. After the protagonist leaves earth with a n extra-terrestrial friend, the reader discovers that the universe is a micro, well, macro-chasm for their planet. and thus the satire takes off. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy serves to ridicule everything from the political system on the earth, to natural history, monetary exchange, and the intellectual supremacy of humans in its short two-hundred sixteen pages, while the main characters zip around the galaxy in a starship powered by an \\"infinite probabilities drive.\\" And the action really takes off when our heroes land on the richest planet in the universe, a planet so rich that it would make planets out of pure gold and silver for clients who were wealthy enough. But don't expect me to tell you what happens therecyou'll have to read this book yourself!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is the absolute funniest book that has ever been written. From start to finish, it keeps you laughing. Douglas Adams is an absolute genius for all the hilarious and creative plot lines and scenes that he has written in this satirical novel. Being a high school student, reading is not usually the thing that gets me excited or keeps me entranced, but the sense of humor in this book kept me glued to every word. The fact that the one piece of suspense left in the entire book was whose shoulder was hurt when a missile crashed with a space ship, but all the other events of the book are revealed, is miraculous. Why would anyone ever want to write about what a flower pot was thinking when it was falling from a space ship to the ground? And also why would anyone want to read about it? But the fact that Adams could think of and write about such a random thing is amazing and, oddly enough, hysterical. It's so refreshing to read a book that goes into space and could potentially be complete sci-fi, but is actually pages filled with jokes. It takes your mind off the real world and brings you into the unknown; where Adams completely writes like an insane man, but comes off as a genius. There's no need to look deeper into the satirical writing. You can just take the jokes as they come and literally laugh out loud after every page. The only problem with this book is that it ends. After 200 pages of laughing out loud, the book abruptly ends, but the good news is that it's part of a trilogy and you can continue with the next book, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Adams keeps you wanting more by ending the book so suddenly. But don't let that stop you. If you haven't had a chance to read this book yet, run to the nearest book store and buy it. Actually, buy all three books in the trilogy! Because you definitely won't want to stop after the first."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I absolutely loved this book from the moment I read the first page. Perfect for rainy days or when you are just feeling down. Definately a must read! Probably what I liked the most about it was that it was fun and enjoyable to read, and was not at all a heavy or hard book to read, unlike some other sci-fi books I have read. The characters and the plots are also very funny, and my personal favourite character is definately Ford Prefect. All of the characters are loveable in their own sense. You do not really dislike any of the characters that much, which is, in its own sense, pretty refreshing. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something humourous, refreshing, and fun. Though if you are looking for a serious, hard core, sci-fi book this is not for you. Recommended for Monty Python fans (as I am one)! Terry Jones from Monty Python actually wrote a book based on this, called: &quot;Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic&quot; which is another good read as well."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If, like Douglas Adams, you happen to adamantly disbelieve in God, and if you spend your days and nights brooding on the absurdity of the universe, I suggest that you run immediately to the nearest bookstore and grab a copy of the The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy!!

The very opposite in fact...the Hitchhiker's Guide is a BIG FAT FARCE, a satirical and completely twisted comedy about \\"life, the universe and everything.\\" I am amazed at the extent of Adam's talent...he has a flair for the insane and his entire book is a series of ridiculously whacko adventures in space...a totally nutty must-read!!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is definatly one of the best ever written.

A lot of people gave this book a bad review, and I am warning you now: this book makes NO sense, so if you're the type of person that needs EVERYTHING spelled out for them and EVERYTHING written in black and white, do us all a favor and forget about it! But I loved it! Where do ballpoint pens go when we lose them? Are we truly the most intelligent species on Earth?

These questions and more are answered in The Hitchiker's Guide to the Universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, the first book in the inaccurately named hitchhiker trilogy, is a humorous story about the worst Thursday in the history of the world and the repercussions of that horrible day. But more than that, it is a story about a human being, stranded in the middle of the galaxy, on the most technologically advanced alien starship of the time, The Heart of Gold.Arthur Dent is that human of the Heart of Gold, along with Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the ex-president of the galaxy, and the only other survivor of earth, Tricia McMillian. Nobody on the ship knows where they are headed, except for the most incompetent of them all, Zaphod. Even then, he still has no idea why he is heading there, until he subjects himself to a self administered brain scan, which reveals that there are two initials burned in to his brain, but whose are they? Meanwhile, Arthur Dent is trying to cope with the fact that his planet was blown up by a group of blood thirsty aliens to make way for a hyperspace bypass. But the biggest shocks of them all to Arthur, comes when Ford Prefect reveals that he is not from a city on the outskirts of London, as he once said, but is a field researcher for \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" and is the cousin of Zaphod Beeblebrox, and that Zaphod was the person who flew off with Tricia McMillian at a party in London. Apparently it is a small UNIVERSE after all. But when The Heart of Gold reaches its destination, nobody seems to believe him that it is the legendary planet of Margarathea in which half of the wealth of the universe is supposed to be buried in the underground tunnels of the legendary planed surrounded in myth. But will an ancient defense system keep them from reaching their goal?Everybody on the ship is there for some reason or another. For Arthur, it is the fact that him and Ford hitchhiked onto the alien ship that blew up Earth. For Ford, it is the same reason, but he is enjoying the thrill of being \\"on the road again\\" as he said it. In the case of Trillian (Tricia McMillian), it is the fact that she left the planet a few months earlier with Zaphod at the fancy dress party in London that he crashed. And finally for Zaphod, it was the mysterious orders that were what was burned in his brain to allow him to become president of the galaxy, and steal The Heart of Gold so that Zaphod can fulfill the requirements of the directions that continually pester him.The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, has a very complex plot, in which every lady, gentlemen, and its, make a difference in this story. It provides a good base for the next four books, and is a very entertaining first book in a series. The series has many unique characters that may go away for a while, but always come back in a later book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a book you should read unless you need a well defined plot and no laughs. The plot is well hidden by the randomness, a description of the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, an alcoholic drink that it seems the author had the first of on Earth before writing it, the introduction of the Hitchhiker's Guide that begins \\"Space is big. Very big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind boggling big it is.\\", and the theory of where all the ball point pens go. There is also a part where a character turns into a penguin. There is some plot but more randomness. I would recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor. If you are someone who is ready for a laugh grab a towel and get ready for a story that is out of this world."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of those rare books that actually made me laugh aloud. If you want to have fun reading a book, this is the book to get."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is brilliant! This book is pure escapism in the most positive sense. Read it even though a movie is already out. Much of the witty writing did not carry over into the film. I cannot recommend the books that followed the series though (namely \\"Life, the Universe and Everything, \\"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\"). It fell short of being as captivating and intelligent as this one. Watch out for the Vogons!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read and since it is the first of a quartet, I'm planning to read ALL of the next books!Basically it's the end of the planet Earth, or should I say what we thought was a planet.Because of a stranded alien who just so happens to work for \\"The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", one man named Arthur Dent survives the Earth's annihilation.The improbability of this is massive, but through this book it seems that improbability is on their side.Then alien and human find that they have been transported to a runaway ship where they meet the president of the galaxy, the improbability of which is so high that if it was not for the most advanced spaceship in history, they'd be dead!This is a hilarious book of aliens, the galaxy, and the inferiority of humans. I was hooked from the start and LOVED it!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Over the Memorial Day weekend, I had the good fortune to be invited to Maine to see the fabulous tree house that is the subject of The Treehouse Chronicles. I decided this would be a good chance to listen to a recording of an old favorite that I've never heard in audio form before. Browsing through the library, it was an easy decision to pick this new recording of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.Within minutes, I could tell that I'd made a winning choice as I listened to Stephen Fry brilliantly share his voice to add texture to this intriguing story. Between the accents and the humorous references to irony, I was enthralled. I found myself wishing that the recording was a longer one.When you read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it can come across a little simplistically in places. Those spots work much smoother in this audio version.In fact, if you haven't read the book, I recommend that you listen to this recording instead. I think you'll enjoy and appreciate the book more in its more dramatic version here.If you don't know the story, Arthur Dent finds himself awakening with a hangover determined to save his home. Only problem is, while the demolition crew looms, he's also about to lose his other home, the Earth. Aided by his alien friend, Ford Prefect, Arthur is soon off hitchhiking his way through the galaxy in a most improbable set of circumstances that will amuse and delight you. You'll meet Zaphod Beeblebrox, one of the most memorable aliens in anyone's fiction. Along the way, you'll learn more speculation about wearing digital watches and finding lost ballpoint pens than you ever expected to know.Bravo, Stephen Fry and Douglas Adams!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"By Joe AntonucciDouglas Adams called the book that I have read The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy. This book was about a guy named Arthur and his friend Ford. Arthur was a normal guy, with a normal job, and a normal life. He lived in London in a pretty small house. One of his bosses was trying to bulldoze his house but Arthur staked out in front of his house, to save his home. When Arthur was just sitting there, Ford came up and said that they really needed to talk. Ford made him come to their local pub. When they arrived to the pub, Ford told Arthur that the end of the world was coming. At first Arthur did not believe him, but then he knew that Ford was serious. He got all the stuff that Ford made him bring. Then a giant space ship came and told every one what was happing. People were in chaos and then a beam came. Just before the bean hit, Ford grabbed Arthur and they teleported to a different space ship, that was close to earth. Earth was destroyed. What happened to Ford and Arthur on board this new ship? Will Arthur ever see his family and friends again? Is Ford really an alien? These are some questions that you could only get the answers by reading the book.I really liked this book. I thought this book was very exiting and very funny. I thought it was exiting because with all the conflicts, like almost getting hit by nuclear missiles, keeps you on your toes. I also thought this book was hilarious because Arthur and Ford always had really funny and random conversations. I was able to feel like I was in the book, because the author, Douglas Adams, always showed the characters emotions very easily. He also described the settings very vividly. I thought there really wasn't a main conflict, but there were lots of mini conflicts. I liked the book better with lots of conflicts then just having one main one. It made the book not at all boring. I could never put the book down, because it was so interesting! I thought that Arthur was a very realistic character because he was just a normal guy from London, who just happened to be the only survivor of the destruction of the planet Earth. I thought the books' ending was really good. It left of at a strange place, but Douglas Adams did a really good job of wanting you to read his next book.Douglas Adams hade a happier, more energetic voice through out the book. He always had funny stuff to say, witch made the book really interesting. I thought the author used a pretty large verity of vocabulary. He did not use a lot of super hard words, but he used some words that I have never heard before. I thought he used the right amount of vocabulary words in his writing. I thought the author had a very unique style of writing. His style was a lot more comic and had a lot more humor in his writing. I thought this made the book more interesting and not at all boring. I thought the author used a great amount of dialogue and the perfect amount of description. I liked it how there were more conversations in it, and how the book just doesn't describe the setting for hours and hours on end. I also thought he had the perfect tone through out the book. The author always had a positive attitude about stuff and he never made it ever seem droll and boring. I cannot think of anything this author needs to add to his book, I like it so much that I could not find anything wrong with it! I think this is probably the best book I have ever read!I believe that this was one of my best books, or even the best book I have ever read. It was filled with excitement and it had a lot of funny stuff in it. I believe this book deserves a 10 out of 10 because of how awesome it was. I think that his other books will be just as good, or maybe even better! I think this book is good for both boys and girls, but I think only people who are older then 11 or 12 should read this book, because it could be hard to understand for little kids. I think this is a great book and that every one should read it. If you like funny books and excitement, then this is a good book for you to read!I believe that The Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy was a great book. I truly believe that Douglas Adams did a phenomenal job on this book. I think this book deserves 10 out of 10 stars. There was never a dull moment in the book. It all ways kept you on ur toes at some parts, and at other parts it made you want to laugh out loud! I absolutely, truly believe that this was one of the greatest books I have ever read in my entire life!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"When books are made into movies that means, the book is first-rate. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is no exception. The Hitchhikers Guide starts as Arthur Dent is saved from the destruction of earth by his alien friend posing as an out of work actor. The book really takes off when they are picked up by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The main idea of the story is to find the ultimate answer to the ultimate question. The book does not really have a solid theme that can be identified, it is mostly random facts from the guide that ties into the story, and sometimes not at all. For science fiction fans/Monty Python fans this book is a must read, it is witty and interesting. The only downside of the book is that it is too short but luckily Douglas Adams wrote a series of Hitchhiker books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. One it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it has the words'Don't Panic' written in bold letters on the cover. The story of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of Betelgeuse. They are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the Heart of Gold using the Infinate Improbability Drive. Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.I loved this book for many reasons. One reason is that it is filled with unexpected humor. Another is that it gives a good spin on life. I could always count on this book to cheer me up. Don't just stop with this book there are many others in this series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"From the first page to the last this books sucks you into its strange locales and story. Each character is charming and funny in there own way. Such as Marvin the severly depressed android who is constanly complaining and yet is one of the most memorable charecters in recent memory.

Buy it, Read it, you'll love it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In this introduction to Douglas Adam's unique wit and satire, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, sets off on a rampaging Alice in Wonderland like journey through outer space. Through it all he encounters very strange and farcical creatures and events that reveal the jukebox of the universe, the ebb and flow satire that is life in all its monumental and diminutive creations. A great adventure to the nether regions of outer space."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the first I read that had the edgy, random quality which has become more prevalent in contemporary fiction. Space ships, galaxies, worlds constructed by large companies, petty government officials, petty ALIEN government officials all play their role.As a writer, and an older one at that, I am accustomed to books with a beginning, middle and end. I like to look at character development, story arc, and so on. This book has not so much a story arc as a story serpentine.I thought I might try out this random style of writing and found it is very difficult to achieve. People of my generation seem to want to make order out of chaos. However, chaos is what we have. And, one should at least consider writing about the world one has than about the world one would like.Adams is, I think, a pioneer of this random style.The book is very difficult to put down, once you start reading. It is entirely unpredictable. Yet the writing is polished, the text is well-proofed, and it is all perfectly clear.Now, what are the chances of it becoming the best-seller it became? Slim to none. I'd like to know how that was done."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I heard this book on public radio a long time ago. And I saw the movie.

Avoid the movie though, its not very good."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Let's say 4.5 stars.I reread this book because I am undertaking a novel where I wanted the humor to have a similar tone. This reading would serve as inspiration. Since the last time I read this series was in my teens, I thought it merited a second look.The teenage me loved this series, finding the tone and unfolding of events to be arch and wonky.The older me, well, I can see through some of the narrative tricks and the book sags in places. Now, it's still just such a fine piece of fiction with its humor veering from peacock-strut to ninja-stealth. Adams knows how to turn a phrase and the banter is just so gregarious and winsome.But he is sometimes too hot for tangents. Yes, I know most of the tangents pay off later, but the narrative coherency takes a beating here and there.With the book I'm writing, I want to make sure the main character is not lost in the spectacle of the wit and cosmic nature of the book's trappings. Arthur, sadly doesn't fair so well. He is bland and fades into the background for most of the novel. Yes, I realize the series will eventually evolve him, but it's still disappointing to see such a skeletal character as mere placeholder in such a lofty book.Quick Observations:Including additional information as footnotes is distracting and all could be eliminated without any enjoyment being robbed from the telling.The author really dislikes cheery futuristic doors that whish open and close.A paranoid and depressing robot-golden! More scenes, please!Mice could never be more menacing than here.Button-pushing cracked me up in this tale.For a book about hitchhiking through the interstellar vastness, there was a lack of wonder or variety in the settings. If one is thumbing through the cosmos, I'd expect a space bar, exotic alien jungle, lavishly expensive sets, but this one felt sparse.As I raced to the end, the humor flowed consistently throughout. I struggle with this in my own work as it seems my humor cuts out whenever I approach the climax.As if the apex of the story needs to be all serious and such. Well, this book reminded me that should be an area to focus on.The book did what it was supposed to do, it invigorated my desire to write funny. It also made me wonder what a space opera might read like if I ever stopped writing fantasies and took the interstellar plunge.I can guarantee one thing--it sure as Jupiter would feature a space bar. Maybe even in its opening scene."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think I would have found this wildly funny in college, but reading it at this stage in my life, I found it mostly pointless and silly, with moments of humor.

To start with, the Kindle version seemed to have a few conversion mistakes in it. When there was text in italics, which happens a lot in this book, two words were sometimes joined together. It's like the space would be missing between them. Not a huge deal, but kind of annoying when reading.The story was fantastic. I thought it was really funny at points. I don't think I've read a book before that had as many funny moments as this. I enjoyed the book far more than the movie which I had seen a couple years ago.The story did wrap up very quickly, though, and seems to continue into another book which I haven't read yet. I was expecting the story to continue on, and then it just ended.The end of the book contains a long look at the making of the movie.

It is also one of the easier reads I have read, however it being easy to read doesn't take away from the plot and the overall randomness of the \\"Hitchhiker\\" books (which I strongly recommend you read all of). Douglas Adams has created a masterpiece which will captivate even beginning readers will want to read this book because of the lack of hard words and fast paced plot line full of action and oddities. Here is a brief summary of what the book is about. However, don't be discouraged from reading the book because you think you know all that happened, the summary doesn't give more away then what you learn in the first few chapters.This book depicts Arthur Dent -a normal earthling- going about his morning when he notices a bulldozer in front of his house and lies down in the mud in front of it so it won't demolish his house. Then his friend Ford Prefect -an alien from the Betelgeuse star system- wisks him away from earth (about to be destroyed by the Vogons) by hitchhiking on a Vogon ship. Then he and Arthur travel all around the universe in search of the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything. On the way he meets Zaphod Beeblebrox -the crazy president of the galaxy- and Trillian -Zaphod's girlfriend from earth- who join Ford and Arthur in their quest to find the question for the answer of Life, The Universe, and Everything.If you are intrigued by the brief summary I have just given you, then this book is for you, and if you were not, well then just read it anyway and you will probably find something to laugh at and enjoy. REMEMBER, DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT BEING TOO HARD the words are simple and you should understand all or most of them. So for all of you who like a nice easy read go ahead and dive into the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. For those more sophisticated readers out there you will love the complex themes Douglas Adams weaves into his book (but you beginning readers can just ignore them and still pretty much get what the book is talking about."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was inspired to read the book when I saw the movie. I have not read the book since I was in high school, so I was very interested in seeing what would seem different. I was very, very surprised at the difference. What had been an amusing, but hardly nerve-shatteringly funny, was transformed into a very funny book indeed.The success in Adam's skills in seeing completely normal human life from a totally alien perspective is amazing. It is something that has been exceptionally noticeable the second time around. For example, the way in which mice were conducting experiments on humans and Slartibartfast marvelling at their genius in doing so.The book also takes a keen stab at human nature and our foibles in more than one way. From God \\"vanishing in a puff of logic\\" to \\"pan-dimensional beings\\" trying to find the answer to life, the universe and everything, and then finding that they needed to work out the question to the answer. Confused? So were the \\"pan-dimensional beings\\".All in all, \\"The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a genius in comic, Monty-Pythonesque humour mixed with healthy doses of sci-fi. Even if you have read it before, it will entertain you for another run through it. I loved every part of it, and don't wonder that it is a classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchiker's Guide is hands down the funniest book ever written by an Englishman with the last name of Adams. It is also the most hilarious book I have ever read. I would even go so far to say that it is the most ridiculous book ever to stress the importence of towels. It's wonderful. Read it and see the movie."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This, the most famous book of the late Douglas Adams, is the first book in the five volume Hitchhiker's Trilogy. It is quite possibly among the funniest books ever written.Arthur Dent wakes up one morning to the sound of a bulldozer outside of his residence. His house is to be demolished to make way for a bypass. After a series of events he goes to a bar with his friend Ford Prefect--who reveals that he himself is not human. Ford tells Arthur that he is leaving Earth in order to escape its destruction (it is being destroyed in order to pave the way for an interstellar bypass).So begins the epic that is Adams' magnum opus.One reason I love The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (and the rest of the trilogy) is that it explores the theme of life as a journey towards hidden purposes. At the same time, it manages to show all the chaos along the way.It is within the pages that we first encounter the answer to the meaning of life, the universe and everything--namely 42. The search for the question to the answer is preoccupies much of the trilogy's later stories.After several readings of this first volume, the scene that sticks most in my mind is the internal conflicts that take place within the soul of the English bureaucrat (a direct male-line descendant of Ghengis Khan) sent to destroy Arthur's home. There are few scenes more hilarious in the rest of the series.I give the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy my full recommendation."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,' by Douglas Adams, is a spontaneous comic adventure. To bring out the humorous characters and events, Douglas Adams uses a lot of satire to attract the reader's attention. A scene that brings out much of the satire is at the beginning of the book. Arthur Ford lies in front of bulldozer to stop the demolition of his house so the city can build a bypass. Arthur, having just found out the day before, is annoyed because the plans were buried from the public. To emphasize the satire, Adams destroys Earth to build an intergalactic bypass whose plans were also buried. This is all going on while the construction workers are trying to find a way to get more money out of their union for working with insane people. Adam uses this satire throughout the entire book to give it an added flavor and to persuade changes on earth with certain situations. As Arthur and Ford start hitchhiking their way around the galaxy to find the ultimate answers to life and the universe, they encounter worlds full of trouble.The story starts out with Arthur Dent protesting his house from being torn down for a bypass, when his friend Ford Perfect, an alien who has been posing as an out-of-work actor on earth for the past fifteen years, drags Arthur away to tell him the world is going to be destroyed. He warns his disbelieving friend Arthur that the planet is soon to blow up, and rescues both of them seconds before its destruction by hitching a ride from the Vogons. After Ford and Arthur are tortured by hideous poetry, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy, and Trillia, the only other surviving human being, save them. Together they travel the galaxy to lead to the ultimate answers to life.I would say this book is Random. Sinister. Funny. 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy' covers everything from galactic space monsters to far-off planets no one has ever of. This completely random book has the reader on his toes from the very first page to the last. Totally unpredictable. If you want a joyful, whimsical ride through space, then read 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A classic of absurd British humor in the tradition of Monty Python - mostly zany fun, but sometimes making a political or social point underneath the jokes, like a lot of great comedy of various styles. It also succeeds as unique science fiction."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I very much enjoyed reading the book. I would recommend this as a must read to anyone who links SiFi"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Overall an excellent book. Very funny.

Douglas Adams managed to create a brilliant science fiction parody of life that will have you laughing whether you comprehend the scientific aspects or not.The basic storyline is that while Arthur Dent is trying to save his house from being demolished to make way for a new bypass, Ford Prefect is trying to save himself and his friend Arthur from being killed while the alien species, Vogons, demolish the Earth to create their own hyperspace bypass. Coincidence? In this case, probably. Ironic? Oh, most definitely.Arthur and Ford hitch a ride aboard the Vogon space cruiser, and from there on, begins their incredible, baffling journey in space.Adams writes this story in a way that brilliantly showcases his wit and sarcasm, while simultaneously coating it with underlying somber messages about the human race and life. It seems impossible and chaotic at time, but therein lies its charm. I believe this is one of the reasons the book is still as successful and popular as it is today. Despite the science fiction aspect of it, people get it, they relate to it, and they even find that they can laugh at themselves.The nonsensical situations and coincidences are so extraordinary, that one cannot help but be entertained. This is of course later on explained in the book through the Infinite Improbability Drive. The most compelling method of presenting wacky ideas is without embellishment because only then is the reader hit with the full impact of absurdity. Through a comical story and simplistic writing style, Douglas Adams creates a novel that will coax laughs out of everyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhikers Guide, as well as all the other books by Douglas Adams years ago.

It is pretty short and it never outstays its welcome.It is very original and there is very little filler in it. The inventiveness of it all is astounding.There are some cracking characters in it and Marvin must be the greatest fictional Robot ever!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The title of this review is the next example of Gonzolit. It's perfect. Douglas Adams turns the English language into either the rantings of an existential crackpot -- or pure upside-down damn-the-rules poetry, the kind you find in Kids Say the Darndest Things, or Emma Donoghue's brilliant novel, Room.The only reason this book won't stand the test of time is if our species gets rid of all the digital watches.Okay. So what can be said about a book with 685 five-star reviews?And why would anyone review it now?Reviewers who wish to be seen hovering above the mass of grocery store lit are always peering into the higher shelves in search of something that challenges the general mediocrity of our fiction, a plot that explodes the senses, or a character sufficiently outrageous that the mind reels trying to grasp the nuances and diagnose the sickness of the author.Such a book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is not.Well, all right, the spacy berserkitude of The Guide challenges mediocrity. One might make a case that Adams is an embarrassment to the 21st Century dumbing-down of the imagination. And what this book also does, or did in 1979, was to raise the bar for the acceptably weird. There was a time when weird was Last Exit to Brooklyn, or Ulysses, or One Hundred Years of Solitude, or going way back, Walt Whitman's magnificent and unpublishable Leaves of Grass. These books of course are literature. Douglas Adams would be the first to admit he did not create any literature. But what he did create was altogether nuts.Let's see... somewhere in the Galaxy, people are running a 10-million-year-long experiment in which the Earth is actually a giant computer. Five minutes before the experiment concludes, Vogons blow up the planet because it's in the path of a hyperspace by-pass and must be eliminated. Within days it is revealed that a new technology has superseded the need for the hyperspace by-pass! Wow! You gotta love it!This is my personal literary grail, devoutly to be sought: No Rules. No disbelief to suspend. No irony left unsmelted, no buckle left unswashed. Characters marching mindlessly through the narrative with or without balls or cause. And most crucial to Gonzolit, a sense of the absurd so delicious that no discerning reader can fail to appreciate it.That is why God gave us Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great dealer, great service: fast shiping and the book is in very good condition.

The Hitch Hikers Guide is a classic and no one narrates it lick this original."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was to start by saying this: I have always enjoyed the Hitchhiker's series a great deal. If there's one set of comic-themed scifi books that you ever get a chance to read, it should be this series. The one and only reason why I have rated this Kindle edition of the book so poorly is because they have disabled Text to Speech.I can understand audiobook companies weariness of highly intelligent, well designed text to speech software, but it doesn't excuse their actions. By disabling this software, (audio)book companies are only hurting their fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is my absolute favorite book! Just read the introduction, and you'll be hooked. How can one not like this book? The shear insanity and humour of the book is reason enough to get it. This book's got all the good stuff: comedy, confusion, Vogons, 42, a great story line, many explanations about stuff you'd never think about, and blah, blah, blah! Just a great book, and if you like this one, read the other four! They're great!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're considering buying this book it is worth the investment. The only problem with it is that you will want to read all of the rest of the trilogy. This is probably the best book I've ever read with the possible exception of &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; which is even more bizarre and delightful."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is amazingly funny. It is totally unlike any sci-fi book you've ever read (unless you've already read one of the trilogy), and cannot fail to amuse even the most uniterested of people.It's characters are all interesting in their own right, with the arrogance of Zaphod, the ignorance of Arthur and the know-all-ness of Ford providing a for a totally original revelation in science fiction.It will suit all types of reader, never failing to amuse. Adams' flippant style is allways engaging and no-one can fail to admire his style, as well as the many amusing plot distractions that seem almost unique to his writing.To breifly summurize the plot: a simple Earthman, Arthur Dent, discovers that a good friend of his is actually an alien working for a remarkable guide to the galaxy. This alein friend, Ford Prefect, rescues Arthur from the planet Earth which is demolished and takes him on a highly entertaing, spin around the galaxy in which they are both blown up more times than is healthy, and are almost totally deprived of tea.The first time I read this was in Wales, and this book alone kept me sane during the week I was there. (no offense to Welsh people, I have Welsh blood too [although admitedly I keep it in a small box under my bed][only joking]).I actually compared this book to Red Dwarf by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor for my GCSE (an exam) in English, for which I got a solid B, I've also read the 5 books in the trilogy at least half-a-dozen times, so I'm more than familiar with the book. And it's still funny.Thankyou, goodnight, and hang onto your towels."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you saw the recent movie version of HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY and wondered, \\"What in the name of Zarquon is going on here?\\" it probably means that you've never read the book upon which the movie was (loosely) based. Or, in my case, you've read the book often and you were still mystified by events unfolding onscreen.So, forget the movie. Forget the theater in which you saw the movie and the snacks you had while watching it. Forget the nap you took during the movie, or the couple making out behind you when they thought you were still sleeping.No, forget all of that, and make a point of getting this book and its sequels as soon as possible. To say that the book is better than the movie is like saying the Pangalactic Gargle Blaster is a fairly potent drink.The late, great Douglas Adams created an altogether, wholly remarkable universe where the space-time continuum was so ripped, torn, swirling, rife with eddies, and filled with floatsam and jetsam that it would take me a millinnium of riding a runaway Chesterfield sofa just to contemplate it and explain it to you.Let me just say: the book is laugh out loud funny. Imagine crossing the priceless lyrical wit of P.G. Wodehouse with the scientific imagination of H.G. Wells, and you may begin to approximate the genius of Douglas Adams.Our beleaguered hero, Arthur Dent, endures a series of increasingly improbable journeys that take him from one end of the galaxy to the other. Amazingly, far reaches of the galaxy--exotic though they may be--have many of the same problems that we have here on earth. Namely, too many telemarketers, lawyers, and lemony fresh handi-wipes. And too few places to quaff a decent cup of tea.OK, I give up on describing the book. It's actually harmless. Mostly harmless, anyway. Get it. Read it. Laugh one of your heads off."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is still so funny and original (the film's not too bad either with the guy from The Office off BBC America). I just love Brit humor - it is tops (check out Ben Elton (Stark) and Steve Horsfall ( You Are Here )too)."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that manages to blend in bits of a fantasy sci-fi world in a way that makes it seem realistic and entertaining. Other reviewers who complained about the plot (notice how few there are) miss the value of this book. It is a place to be, a hitchhiker in a detailed and fantastic universe, who, hopefully knows where his towel is. This book is endlessly quotable. There is a rhythm to this book that taints your thinking. It is funny and intelligent.However, I did dock this book 1 star in the review because it is a slow-starter. It takes about a third of the book to get off the planet (literally), and all the real fun is in space. However, once you get past that first hump the rest is smooth sailing except for the abrupt ending. (Douglas Adams had trouble meeting his deadlines and so the manuscript was taken, as is, at a slightly awkward spot.) Be sure to have The Restaurant at the End of the Universe ready to read right afterwards because it really does seem to &quot;finish&quot; this book's plotline.I rarely enjoy reading a book I've already read before but this one and the rest of the series are an easy exception."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The first thing to note is that despite its name this is not a guidebook. Rather, it is an intricate story about a group of people - and a paranoid android - with rather nebulous connections who use, work for, or are otherwise involved with &quot;the Guide&quot;.Although some fans of &quot;hard&quot; science fiction do not have much time for this book, I think that it is a classic. Adams uses everything from subtle irony to blatant sarcasm - plus a fair about of slapstick - to weave this complex and highly improbable story which pokes fun at most professions, many ideas and just about every thing else in the history of time and space.If this book doesn't make you laugh you need a vacation. If it does, the good news is that Adams manages to keep the concepts and jokes fresh throughout most of the 5 book \\"trilogy\\" which is testimony to his skills as an author.And a final note - which has got to be the most compelling reason to buy the book - if you don't know what the number 42, towels, yellow bulldozers, and mice have in common - Don't Panic! - you will once you have read this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm in the seventh grade and wanted to read book for enjoyment. I usually don't but this book was reall great. I am now going to start to read the second book in this excellent series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first read Hitchiker when I was ten, and in the ten years (and hundreds of re-readings) since it has been a source of infinite pleasure and enlightenment. I now have all the books (2 copies each), the radio broadcasts, the original radio scripts, the videos of the TV series and Neil Gaiman's Guide to the Guide (as well as absolutely everything else that the exquisite Mr Adams has ever written). I am currently studying at Oxford University and I take offence at those misguided souls who think that HHGTTG is childish, has no lasting worth or will only be enjoyed by undiscriminating readers. Hitchiker is not only a supremely funny and inventive book - it's also extremely intelligent and full of subtle insights. It works on so many levels that it is accessible to everyone (if they keep an open mind).Vogon poetry, the Babel fish and the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster are surely all the evidence you need of Adams' sublime genius (and there are 4 more books of it).Oh, and Douglas Adams has been hinting that Hitchiker 6 might be on its way (pleeeeaaaase! pleeeeeaase!)Anyway, my heart belongs to Ford Prefect forever. And remember, Hitchiker isn't just a book, it's a way of life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Sorry about my little review below. I just can't understand people who don't like this book. This is the best book by my favorite author. I am an aspiring author and if I could write anything half this good, I could die happy. I'd been trying to write zany space comedies even before I'd even heard of Douglas Adams, but once I read this, I knew I had a long ways to go. Anyway, the rest of the series pales a little in comparison to this book, (especially 'So Long...&quot;) but they're all massively entertaining. If you liked the Hitchhiker's Trilogy, try his Dirk Gently series as well. Also, Douglas wrote 3 excellent stories for Doctor Who, &quot;The Pirate Planet&quot; in season 16, and &quot;City of Death&quot; and &quot;Shada&quot; (unfinished, unfortunately) for season 17, a season in which he also served as the show's script editor.Someone said that this book was a Star Trek wannabe. If anything, it serves to show just how limited Star Trek can be when there's books like Hitchhiker's Guide and shows like Doctor Who and Red Dwarf out there. Those poor trekkies, I feel a little sorry for them actually.Anyway, I've gotten a little off the point here, that being that this is the best humor writing around and anyone who can't appreciate this humor just doesn't get it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"No matter how many times I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and I've read it quite a few times already, it never fails to thrill me and induce bouts of almost uncontrollably hearty laughter. With this novel, Douglas Adams gave life to a phenomenon that will long outlive his tragically short life, delighting millions of readers for untold years to come. I'm not sure if science fiction had ever seen anything like this before 1979. This is science fiction made to laugh at itself while honoring its rich tradition, but it is much more than that. Adams' peculiarly dead-on humor also draws deeply from the well of sociology, philosophy, and of course science. Whenever Adams encountered a sacred cow of any sort, he milked it dry before moving on. Beneath the surface of utter hilarity, Adams actually used his sarcasm and wit to make some rather poignant statements about this silly thing called life and the manner in which we are going about living it. This is one reason the book is so well-suited for multiple readings-a high level of enjoyment is guaranteed each time around, and there are always new insights to be gained from Adams' underlying, oftentimes subtle, ideas and approach.Arthur Dent is your normal human being, and so he naturally is more concerned about his house being knocked down than facing the fact that the world is about to end. His friend Ford Prefect, he comes to learn, is actually a researcher from a planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, but before he can even begin to comprehend this fact, he finds himself zipped up into the confines of the Vogon space cruiser that has just destroyed the planet Earth. Things become even trickier for him when he discovers the great usefulness of sticking a Babel fish into his ear and then meets the singular President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and his shipmate Trillian, both of whom Arthur actually met months before at a party. Such impossible coincidences are explained by the fact that Beeblebrox's ship is powered by the new Infinite Improbability Drive. Dent grows more and more confused during his travels on board the Heart of Gold, and the story eventually culminates with an amazing visit to an astronomically improbable world.Much of the humor here is impossible to describe; this novel must be read to be appreciated. It seems like every single line holds a joke of some kind within it. The characters are also terrific: the unfortunate Arthur Dent, who basically has no idea what is going on; Ford Prefect, Arthur's remarkable friend from Betelgeuse; Zaphod Beeblebrox, with his two heads, three arms, and cavalier attitude; Trillian the lovely Earth girl who basically flies the Heart of Gold; Slartibartfast the planet builder and fjord-make extraordinaire; and my favorite character of all, Marvin the eternally depressed robot. Life-\\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\" is the Paranoid Android's philosophy. One brilliant thing that Adams does is to step away from the action every so often to present interesting facts about the universe as recorded in the Hitchhiker's Guide; here we learn about Vogon poetry, the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal, Trans Galactic Gargle Blasters, and other fascinating tidbits about life in the crazy universe Adams created. He even gives the reader the ultimate answer to the question of Life, the Universe, and Everything in these pages.This novel is just an amazingly hilarious read that will leave you yearning for more; to our great fortune, Adams indeed left us more in the form of four subsequent books in the Hitchhiker's \\"trilogy.\\" If you don't like science fiction, it doesn't matter; read this book just for the laughs. The most amazing thing about Adams' humor is the fact that everyone seems to \\"get\\" it. Adams broke all the rules in writing a novel quite unlike any that had come before it, and he succeeded in spades. This may well be the funniest novel ever written."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Since there are many reviews of the book itself, I thought someone should review the audio versions independently. There are two versions of this title in audio format, the dramatized edition, which is abridged, and the version read by the author, which is unabridged; I have both! I you are a fan of the dramatized versions of books please be sure before you buy which version you are getting. I enjoyed both the dramatized version and the version read by Douglas Adams himself as each has its own pros and cons.The Dramatized version, done by the BBC (or at least the version that I have is), is very well done, as are all of the BBC dramatizations. The cast does a fantastic job as does the special effects team on the sounds. Be aware that dramatized versions are typically abridged, which is not a big problem generaly but some people don't care for it. This version was originally released as a multiple part radio program so if you are familiar with that format you have a good idea of this version. The only drawbacks are the it is in an outmoded format (cassette) and that it is abridged.The unabridged spoken version is read by the author, Douglas Adams, and is very good. This is a special treat since he has passed on. I enjoy the ability to hear the author's concept of how the story should read in his own voice. This version has a permanent home on my iPod so that anytime I need a little boost, I can queue it up. It is easy to listen to and quite enjoyable but if you are used to the dramatized versions of audio books you may find that it takes 5 or 10 minutes to get used to the single voice. It is worth it though!I would recommend either audio version to anyone that commutes or has at least thirty minutes of free time at a stretch. Both versions are well done and are enjoyable to listen to. For anyone who has not experienced audio books before, I would recommend a good tile like this to start off with."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With the passing of Douglas Adams on Friday 5/11/2001, I picked up this book after quite a number of years and gave it a good ol' read....and you know what... this novel will forever be poignant, witty and downright entertaining. I laughed all over again. I mean, I really laughed. I'm going to miss Douglas.Douglas wasn't just at the forefront of comedy-sci-fi....he basically created the genre. My only regret, along with quite a number of fans, is that we shall never again relish in the adventures of Arthur Dent and the gang. No more Vogon poetry. No more Pan Galactic Gargleblasters. No more Babel fish. No more tongue-twisting names. Therein lies the real shame.New readers to Douglas Adams, take heart! Each of the novels that make up this series are all fantastic tales! If you own a copy of Hitchhiker's, you hold in your hands a classic! Cherish it always and read it as it was intended.... as a truly light-hearted romp through the cosmos.Take a look at some of the reviews listed here. Over four hundred people can't be wrong. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is without a doubt one of the greatest books of all time by a quirky and innovative author. (We'll just have to forgive him for wearing a digital watch.)Thank-you Douglas for the fun and adventures. You were one of a kind. May we one day meet at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The first round's one me. I'll bring the towel.A classic. A gem. You must own this novel."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I'm probably treading on thin ice here, talking about a revered piece of pop culture. When I was in college, Douglas Adams had a cult following that knew all the jokes and could quote them to each other.I find myself in a middle ground. I was first exposed to Hitchhiker's Guide when it ran as a BBC radio serial (I heard it on NPR, I think). It got a some laughs out of me, and I enjoyed it, but it didn't inspire in me the kind of devotion that it did in other geeks.Having read the first book, I have to say the radio series is my favorite presentation of this material. Playing as a serial, the gags were front and center, the serial format left the listener with the impression that there was a lot more to come and ensured that Adams didn't overstay his welcome. Read as a novel, the book seems a little pointless. Adams wouldn't know a narrative arc if it hit him.That said, a lot of the jokes are still funny. Adams was a vocal atheist, and at his best he has the satiric touch of a Voltaire. Evenhanded, he enjoys skewering atheists in his book: Oolon Coluphid, the atheist writer that Adams posits as \\"the author of philosophical blockbusters,\\" seems quite pretentious and silly, at least in his choice of book titles.Occasionally, there is a true insight that is nicely played for a joke. My favorite revolves around the babelfish, a fish that is used a universal translator. When a babelfish is placed in one's hear, one can hear and understand the words spoken by another, regardless of the original language spoken. The end of Adams digression on the babelfish ends with the acidly ironic observation that the babelfish is responsible for more wars than any other species in the universe.(John Durham Peters, author of Speaking into the Air: A History of the Idea of Communication, makes the point that we often hold an implicitly utopian view of communication, believing that differences between people will automatically be resolved with better communication, whereas sometimes the truth is the opposite: the better two groups of people understand each other, the less they like each other.)I place Adams in the same category as Kurt Vonnegut. They're both writers that have a special appeal to the young, to high school and college age readers. They both write satirical, absurdist fiction which skewer traditional beliefs and middle class norms. Adams tends to be more detached, more bemused, less pointed, passionate, and angry than Vonnegut. In some ways, that makes him easier to take. On the other hand, I don't think he's as compelling, for the same reason."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It is fitting that this audio adaptation of Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was voiced by actor Stephen Fry. Fry was a close friend of the late Mr. Adams, and he also narrates the new H2G2 movie as the voice of the Book. Fry does a great job of making this classic novel come alive, drawing the listener into the story. This audiobook makes a great tribute to Douglas Adams and the world and characters he created in the H2G2 universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a thoroughly strange book, that at the same time is oddly charming. It starts in a really weird way, with the demolition of Earth (yes, our planet) in order to build a interestellar highway. Only one man survives the end of our world: an Englishman, Arthur Dent. Arthur is saved from sure death by one of his friends, Ford Prefect, that also happened to be an alien doing some research for \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (an electronic book that \\"tells you everything you need to know about anything\\", and that specially highlights the need for a towel).Ford got a lift for them with a Vogon spaceship, where they would soon be subjected to a danger worse than death: Vogon poetry. Anyway, as nothing bad last forever, there were soon ejected into space to suffer certain and painful death, only to be rescued again just in time to begin their adventures.Both Ford and Arthur are interesting characters, but I found Arthur's whining particularly funny. For example, and in his own words to Ford: \\"you are talking about a positive mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog... It is now just after four in the afternoon and I am already being thrown out of an alien spaceship six light-years from the smoking remains of the Earth!\\".There are other characters and things you will find interesting, like an eternally depressed robot (life, \\"loathe it or ignore it, you can't like it\\"), Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the Babel fish (capable of translating any language in the galaxy if you put them in your ear). There are also some scenes that appear out of the blue, but that are quite enchanting. For instance \\"Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. - Is there any tea on this spaceship?-he said\\".On the whole, I highly recommend this book. Its premise is extremely original, and you will have lots of fun reading it. If you can, buy it know, and be ready to meet the mice * :)Belen Alcat (* = you will understand that phrase only after reading this book!!!)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Setting the ultimate questions of life, physics, and digital watches against a backdrop of science fiction, Douglas Adams successfully creates an amusing and thought-provoking story that is considered a must-read by millions. Arthur Dent, the fortunate Earthling who has been miraculously rescued from the destruction of Earth with the help from some friendly Dentrassi cooks, acts as the readers alter ego due to his complete lack of knowledge concerning the universe. Arthur asks the same questions that we would ask, should we be in his position. The majority of the answers about the universe obviously come from Ford Prefect's copy of &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Within this manuel, Douglas Adam's provides the reader with a brilliantly shaped world which lives within his imagination. The most clever aspect, however, is the fact that Adams has a rational explanation for each of the entries in the guide. For instance, he explains for a page and a half why putting a Babel fish in one's ear allows the brain to understand every language in the universe. In addition to his wonderful imagination, Douglas Adams must also be praised for his humorous treatment of the major questions of life. When asked the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything, Deep Thought(the second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space), comes up with the very simple and unexpected answer of &quot;forty-two&quot;. Adams plays off of the reader's inquisitive nature by building up the suspense and finally showing them that in order to know answers, you must understand the questions. This is an amazing journey through philosophical experimentation that the reader will never forget."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The thing that is most improbable about this book is that its critical mass can be contained within 216 slim pages, albeit sandwiched between slightly denser covers, without blasting itself to smithereens of funny matter and dispersing these all over the galaxy.It all begins with Arthur Dent wallowing in the mud to prevent the destruction of his house, while galactic bureaucratic wheels are cranking out much bigger misguided projects.By coincidence, his pal Ford Prefect just happens to be a researcher for the extremely useful book \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and having been stranded on earth for fifteen years, is anxious to hitch a ride on the next passing saucer.Meanwhile, in a galaxy far, far away, Zaphod Beeblebrox, totally powerless figure-head President of the Imperial Galactic Government, is wending his merry way to what will be the most unforgettable launching of a unique spaceship.Discarding and disregarding his prepared speech, he pauses to acknowledge Trillian, a hot chick that he picked up at a party on another planet, thereby irritating the heck out of the attending party hacks, who are obviously unaware of the uncontrollable misbehavior of Presidents when it comes to hot chicks.Arthur and Ford Prefect manage to hitch a ride shortly before ground zero, and after enduring some Vogon poetry (third worst in the Universe), they get chucked out of an airlock with only a lungful of air to fly on.Thanks to Trillian, and Zaphod's amazing technicolor Infinite Improbability Drive, our heroes are rescued from certain doom - or are they? A fugitive, a hot chick and a manic depressive robot do not usually make for happy endings, even with a little improbability thrown in.The adventure continues as they learn the simple answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, only to realize that they don't know the question.Going now to fix me a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, and start the second of the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy. I've already got my massively useful towel packed, and my fish in my ear.

Time warps, charming aliens with two heads, and improbability spaceships are not my usual reading. Yet I loved this book. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is one of the most fantastic, funny, and inconceiveably creative books I've ever read. From the moment Zaphod, a unique character with two heads, steals the most famous spaceship in the galaxy, things happen quickly and with seemingly little connection to any event. That's the beauty of this book though: all events, no matter how random, are tied together in a humorous, deliciously complex way. Every character has its own distinct personality that draws you into the book even more. From Marvin The melancholy Marsian to beautiful and brilliant earthwoman Trillian, this book has everything. Which just goes to explain why it's one of the most sought-after collector's books. If you want to read a deep, romantic, drama this is not the book for you. However, if you're in the mood for a good laugh pick up this book. Even if you don't normally like science fiction, you'll get a kick out of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The entree of a seven course meal must encompass all the qualities of the other seven courses.

Up until this point, I have been tempted by Vonnegut, inhebriated by T. Robbins, shocked by H Thompson, humbled by J Carroll, spiritually lifted by Pirsig, and tricked by Faulkner. The one who combined most of these qualities in my inflated opinion is Douglas Adams.

The hilarous situation and comedic dialogue (sharpened by Adams' ever-present wit) are massively entertaining and serve to make the book a quick, enjoyable romp. You can read this in a day because you won't want to put it down. As light-hearted and funny as it is however, it also has some serious undertones. Some of Adams' comments on the human condition have a dead-on accuracy that shine through the thinly-veiled comedic pretentions. This book is a must-read for all of these reasons.

If you are not a fan of sci-fi,(I'm more along the lines of fantasy and horror myself), this is THE one to get started on. Should you read it, you will have to read the ones that follow. Original, Funny, you will find yourself caught on an exhilirating ride through the cosmos, just don't forget your towel . . ."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A book I have read more times than I can imagine, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book that would probably be considered one of the best American novels ever written if it wasn't for the fact Adams is British. I first read this book sometime in the '80's and every time I reread it I uncover new jewels from the prose.The language is expressive in a way most contemporary fiction simply isn't. The analogies are strange and surprising and wonderful. Instead of merely being words on a page, this book has a such a distinctive, lighthearted voice that it allows a person to almost hear the author speak.To be sure, this is not a science fiction novel in the normal sense. The reader is not expected to wonder at the majesty of fantastic cities reaching to the skies where, within, the reader is fascinated by all manner of wonderful inventions. This is a book of everyday life extrapolated to an entire galaxy. Yes, there are interesting doodads interspersed, but they do not serve the &quot;Wowwee&quot; factor so much as the idea of &quot;Yep, that's what a large corporation would make, all right.&quot; For people who like to believe in benevolent galactic empires and the eventual triumph of logic in all endeavors, the mishmash conglomeration of nonsensical entities and the triumph of bureaucracy over common sense will frustrate their idea of what science fiction is supposed to be. This ain't the Foundation Series.Yes, it is silly, strange, and seemingly inane, but everything follows its own bizarrely congruous logic that allows the reader to suspend their disbelief and enjoyably follow along in a world that makes it own nonsensical sense.I suppose the humor could be called Pythonesque since I have to guess that anybody who does not enjoy Monty Python would not enjoy this book. However, for people who enjoy vivid language, entertaining characters, quick and witty humor and a plot that is truly original, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't know what to say about Douglas Adams except; that cat really knows where his towel is. This book is just plain funny, and it will soothe your science fiction needs as well. After reading so many science fiction stories about what alien life might be like, here is a universe which is not only teaming with alien life, but it turns out that most of that life is every bit as flawed, and often ridiculous, as life here on Earth. Which in a strange way makes you feel OK about the whole thing. In an infinite universe anything is possible; it takes an author like Adams to suggest (as he does in one of the stories) that the natural wind patterns of one planet results in the landscape being eroded over time into nothing but expensive hotels and casinos. ANYthing can happen, not any plausible thing - even if you aren't a science fiction fan, I think you'll still enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for people who not only like science fiction, but like humorous novels too. Douglas Adams throws in a mix of humor and irony in a science fiction setting,and that's what I personally like about the book. For example, you have to laugh at Arthur Dent who is upset that his house is being demolished, when little does he know that his planet will be demolished shortly afterward. The Hitchhiker's Guide also makes comments about the human race that aren't just funny, but also make you think as well. My favorite quote from this book is, &quot;This planet has-or rather had-a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.&quot; I've read it 3 or 4 times this year since I bought it. This book is a definite must read! If you like the Hitchhiker's Guide then I recommend you read the sequels too because the story doesn't end when you finish the book. When I finished the Hitchhiker's Guide for the first time, I had to run out to the book store and buy the next book. Now I'd have to say that that Douglas Adams is my favorite author and I hope other people become fans too."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you're looking for a book with a deep and meaningful plot, lengthy setting or description, or in fact much logic to it at all, keep going. This is not the cult classic that you're looking for.If you're instead in search of incredible humor, a dash of surrealism, characters you'll never forget, and lines that it seems half the country can quote by heart, then you're in the right place. Congratulations. Pull up a chair and down these three pints of bitter quickly, before the world can end.HGTTG does have meaning; it does have messages--but no, the plot isn't really the point. This is a story that starts off strange and stays that way. It's hilariously funny, and its satirical elements are sharply intelligent. It may very well make points that will stay with you. But the reason, I think, that many people read it and like it is that it is simply hysterical in much the same way that Monty Python is hysterical. Adams can't lose as long as he keeps pulling out one zany and unexpected surprise after another... and he does just that throughout.This isn't a book that takes days to read, so I'd recommend that anyone who's in the mood for something off-the-wall and humorous give it a try. Who knows? Maybe you'll join the ranks of those who know just what's so unpleasant about being drunk, what the secret to flying is, and the Ultimate Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Greetings hoopy froods from America-landJust a short correction for you. The Radio series (on BBC Radio 4) came first, then the original books were written from the radio script.For all of those interested, a new radio series is going to be broadcast (again on BBC Radio 4), in September this year. See the BBC web site for details. Also, a film is being made at this momment. Personally, I don't think any film can match the comic genius of Douglas, but hopefully I'll be proved wrong."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A few reviewers have commented on the way the later books, after the first 3 in the &quot;trilogy&quot;, are less funny. I just have to say this -- as hilarious as these books are, I think Douglas Adams is basically a very serious man with important things to say. In his later books, my guess is that he was a little bothered by the way everyone just raves about how funny his stuff is, without talking about the troublesome nature of the very real issues he raises. This stuff is absurd, and is deadly serious, at the same time. You should try to be aware of that, and of the tightrope Douglas Adams was walking here.Also, I personally know one woman who chose to make her life's work one of helping animals, and actually became a veterinarian (which required YEARS, YEARS, YYYEEEAAARRRSSS of poverty and going to school to become one) because of Douglas Adams' book &quot;Last Chance to See&quot;, which is about endangered species.I think Douglas Adams is a good and great man, a really warm philosopher, and it seriously wouldn't surprise me if he was remembered and talked about in pubs long after, say, Bertrand Russell or Alfred North Whitehead are just footnotes in dusty thesises in library archives."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was the wierdest funnniest most bizare delightful book I have ever read!

Douglas Adams is the author. If you are into the \\"Star Trek\\" or just Sci-Fi, then this book's for you.The story is about two men: Arthur Dent who is man in his middle age and who you would say \\"out to space\\" type of guy. Also his friend Ford Prefect who is researching a book called \\"Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy\\". One day Arthur finds that his house is going to be torn down to be turned into a galactic highway. With much frustration, stress, and devastation. Arthur's great friend comes to save the day by taking him to the bar for relief. Minutes after he finds himself with ford in space. Not to give away the whole story. They adventure in space trying to survive by dodging bad guys or making friends.You like adventure, you like excitement, and weird stories. Check out this book and read it. You might not only like it but also get a different view of the universe. Thank you for your time hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I saw the movie first so some the scenes where rememberable but like most books done by British author I do not get all the humor. I found this one harder to grasp at time then say a Terry Pratchett novel.The stuff I found funny was the stuff that I already knew the punchline like the meaning of life answer. When I think about this book now there really isn't much I like about it. The voices of the character in my head feel kinda of annoying.I guess I am just not a fan of British humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy written by Douglas Adams wasn't the best book I've read. This book was very confusing in many ways. Things happen a little to fast and then it gets confusing. Like when all of the sudden the earth blows up. It doesn't really explain why. Also, it has a lot of bizarre names and characters. If you're a person who likes nice simple books that puts everything out for you this isn't the book for you. A lot of things didn't make any sense. There were some real names of things such as McDonald's and London etc. Mostly made up like the Infinite Improbability Drive and the species in the galaxy.The Basic summary of the book is a person from Earth named Arthur Dent is rescued by a weird alien named Ford Prefect. He is rescued because Earth is disinagrating or overheating. They escape on a Vogon ship which they get shot out of an airlock into space. Then the President of the galaxy named Zaphod Beeblebrox, ship rescues them, and the they meet a very depressed robot named Martin. The title comes from a book in the story called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It basically gives them tips along the way. There is some humor in this book. Mostly in the guide. Like Ford has a towel in his satchel all the time for various things. It says it in the guide too.This book wasn't the greatest thing I've read, I give it two stars. I am being a little generous. I am mostly giving this rating because it was confusing, not very exciting, didn't grab my attention, and it wasn't very clear on things. I liked it for the two stars because it kinda reminded me of Star Wars. I don't know why but it did. It was a sci-fi book that's probably why. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Before his death, Doug Adams gave an interview in which, among other things, he mentioned that he was surprised that people wanted more of the hitchhiker stuff because as far as he was concerned it was old hat and not funny. With him I have to agree and one has to be puzzled why people would read such drivel as this. The characters, the plot, the story, the background, the atmosphere, the landscape, the tone etc. is just awful, with little or no redeeming social or artistic value. Doug said as much in the interview, but indicated that he hated the idea of writing more of this stuff, but he needed the money. You'll save your eyes and your time and get more benefits by sleeping than by reading this book-like-object."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the story of Arthur Dent, an man who survives the destruction of the Earth by hitchhiking with his friend Ford Prefect (who turns out to be an alien) onto the spaceship Heart of Gold, which is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Spoilers ahead.The disconnect between the quality of the book and the rave reviews it has on Amazon is bewildering. I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes--it's so hyped that people are afraid to not like it. In reality, it's trite and unfunny, and the author's ego radiates off of every page. The random details that Adams inserts, from the stream of consciousness from the sperm whale to Deep Thought's answer to the question of the meaning of life, remind me of a third-grader writing their first short story and reveling in how how awesomely ~random they are.Douglas Adams tries way, way too hard to come off as nonchalant, pithy and oh-so-subtly thought-provoking. I'm not sure why the 651 reviewers who gave this book five stars can't see how transparent those efforts are. In the end, it's a collection of random thoughts with no greater meaning--and no, I don't think it even points to how meaningless life really is, and how we should live in the moment, etc. I think it points to how meaningful Douglas Adams thinks this book is.The Hitchhiker's Guide is a book for lazy readers. It's easy to swallow and offers a seemingly deep conclusion. If you're interested in psuedo-enlightened theories and don't want to put in more than nominal effort, this is the book for you. If not, try an author like Haruki Murakami, who captures some of the same elements of meaninglessness and consciousness in a much more real way.Enjoying this book isn't a sign of your enlightened open-mindedness and intellectual superiority over others. It's a sign that you're not thinking for yourself."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I decided to read this novel because it is widely acclaimed as a contemporary science fiction classic. Douglas Adams' description of Arthur Dent, who is the lone man to survive the destruction of the planet earth, is consistently humorous and entertaining. Dent is set loose to roam the galaxy, accompanied with an alien friend who is thankfully equipped with the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.As the novel progresses, it becomes evident that despite the superficial whimsical tone, Adams is dealing with deeper themes relating to the meaning and existence of human life. The absurdity created by his imagination is not just a matter of light-hearted sci-fi entertainment, but is a cloak which Adams uses to convey his philosophy of human life and his personal worldview.One needs to recall that this novel was born in the late 1970s, in the hey-day of technology and space travel, a time when there was a great deal of optimism and faith in science as the saviour of mankind. Adams mocks this human arrogance. The arrogance of Bent's fellow-humans in destroying his home, becomes a microcosm for the arrogance of humankind, and when it is applied to man's own home earth, results in man's own destruction. Adams' scorn for scientific arrogance is especially manifest when it appears that the rulers of earth are not scientists, but their own laboratory mice, who were secretly conducting large-scale experiments on their captors all along.Yet this novel achieves much more than a scoffing of scientific arrogance. It becomes painfully evident that something essential is missing from the universe described in the Hitchhiker's Guide: God. When questioned by man about his existence, God &quot;promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.&quot; God's absence from Adams' fictional universe corresponds to God's absence in Adams' personal worldview. The worldview which Adams believes in and portrays is a galaxy without a Creator. Adams is in fact a self-confessed &quot;radical atheist&quot;, and holds this position very seriously.But if Adam's universe is a world without God, this leads to an inevitable question: In such a universe, what is the meaning and purpose of life? Adams toys with this question when he describes the &quot;The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.&quot; After seven and a half million years of calculation, the super computer &quot;Deep Thought&quot; announces that the answer is &quot;Forty-two.&quot; This meaningless answer is incomprehensible, and is apparently so because we don't understand the question properly! Here Adams whimsically propounds his purpose for planet earth: earth is a gigantic experiment, because it is on earth that the question about the meaning and purpose of life is voiced, but never answered! The purpose of earth is to raise the question about its purpose.In Adams' atheistic worldview, the question about the purpose of life cannot be answered, because the existence of the very creator of the universe is denied. Such a question can only be asked, answered, and understood in a Christian worldview where the existence of the Creator is maintained, because apart from Him, creation is indeed purposeless. In this respect, the message of Adams' classic is the same as that of the Bible book of Ecclesiastes: there is no purpose and meaning in a world that rejects God. However, it is eternally unfortunate that Adams does not have the same conclusion as Ecclesiastes, where the premise of practical atheism is reversed, God's existence once again affirmed, and purpose discovered by serving and obeying God the Creator. Present day adherents of practical atheism who share Adams' empty worldview will discover that they will spend their life in the same way as Adams - in life whimsically hitchhiking an empty earth without God, and in death discovering that that God was always there, but that by their rejection of Him in the past, they will spend eternity without Him in the future. But then it will be too late. Because unlike the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, eternity without God has no room for frivolous laughter, but only for sorrow and regret.In portraying the emptiness of an atheistic worldview, Adams is outstanding. In endorsing this worldview, Adams is to be most pitied. May God spare us from echoing his endorsement."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What a huge dissappointment! I found the book extremely boring. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent fantasy/sf I've been reading, but I found the plot very slow moving, and generally uninteresting and uninvolving. I also disliked the extreme amount of humor and satire in this book. I prefer my novels to be more realistic. I like adult situations (complex relationships, betrayal, violence, etc), and I couldn't find any here. It felt as if I was watching one LONG episode of Futurama.There were good things, however. The book was extremely short. I got through it in one sitting (about three hours), and I don't think I've ever done that before. Also, I found the book slightly humorous in parts, which served to barely keep my interest for that 3-hour reading stretch."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I think that this book was one of the oddest I have ever read. I really found no joy in reading it and didn1t see the point of the story line. If I had known that this book was so absurd I wouldn1t have read it. While reading it I had to struggle to comprehend the characters1 bizarre surroundings and conflicts. If I had to give this book a rating I1d give it one out of five stars. I give it one star because there were some rare funny parts in the book. These parts really didn1t pertain to the book at all though."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"So where do I begin? I first tried to read this book many years ago, soon after it was initially released. I managed to get past the first few chapters before tossing the book aside in disgust. I tried again a few years later with the same result. Finally, I thought to myself, \\"Self -- why not force yourself to read it through so you can properly evaluate it.\\" After all, a lot of people like it. And many of them think it's really funny.So that's what I did. I forced myself to read every last chapter of this -- this -- thing. And you know what. It is just as big an abomination as I remembered it to be. It has no proper story line that one can follow and no character development. On top of that, it uses meaningless sentences and meaningless words to create an assault on the human brain and on the ability of humans to \\"reason\\" their way through a problem, all of which that makes me think the author must have been on a very bad acid trip when he wrote this piece of garbage. As for humor, well, in the whole book, I found only two lines that made me laugh. The rest of it made me want to puke. On the more positive side, the chapters are mercifully short, giving the reader many breaks between said assaults.If you like slapstick comedy that has no purpose, you may like this book, but count me out. If you're more into serious SciFi, walk away from this in a big hurry or find yourself screaming just to keep your sanity."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Where I work H2G2 (Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy) is fairly popular and I have been told time and time again that I must read this book. Well, I finally read it. Overall it's not quite as good as I hoped, but still it was an interesting read.H2G2 is about an Earthling named Arthur Dent who is saved right at the last second by his friend from a planet near Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect. Ford convinces Arthur that the Earth is being destroyed and just in time they are saved by accident. This is the beginning of this wild (and I mean wild!) ride. Along this ride you meet some interesting characters including talking mice, a 2-headed, 3-armed ex-hippie president of the galaxy, a depressed robot and others.There's a lot to like about this book, but you have to enjoy this particular genre of comedy. For me the book was fairly interesting throughout, I was always curious about what craziness lurked on the pages that follow, however, oftentimes I was let down a bit and it's because a lot of the scenes in the book are just too crazy and they seem too random.I wont give away anything major but there are scenes such as Ford jamming a fish that translates languages in to Arthurs ear, rockets that turn into a whale and a bowl of petunias just before impact and absolute madness that involves ball-point pens. Douglas Adams is a good writer so he is able to paint these scenes in an interesting way. There are definitely a few scenes in the book that made me smirk, but overall I just didn't find much humor. It's almost as if you had a really good author, gave him a few hits of LSD and told him to write a book before he sobered up. I can see how this style of comedy is interesting to some people, but I guess it's just not my flavor.Perhaps I just don't have a very good sense of humor.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and was able to understand the book with its very teenage appeal. If only we could make the pan galactic garggle blaster, I would like to try it. I would read this book again anytime and reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is awesome! It's an adventure with a joke at every turn! I definately recomend it to anybody who wants a hysterically funny adventure book you can't put down!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I don't even know where to begin. Saying that this was my favorite book ever doesn't really tell you anything unless you know my literary history. I read a lot. I have read most of the classics(I own the easton press library's &quot;100 greatest books ever written&quot; and have read 75% of them) , dozens of sci fi books, every scherlock holmes story ever, mystery novels, detective stories, tragedies comedies, adventure novels... you name it, I have probably read it. But few books have ever motivated me to read them for a second time, even fewer for a third, and the only books I have read 4 times or more are books by Mr. Douglas Adams. In particular the Hitch Hicker's trilogy (all 5 of them). I bought the books on tape, and heve literaly listened to one side of each tape nearly every night for the last 5 years. You may call it sick, I may call it love for the greatest book ever writen (or just the best insomnia cure I have found to date). Whatever it is there is something special about this book. &quot;more popular than the 'celestial homecare omnibus', better selling then ' 53 more things to do in zero gravity', and more contriversial then Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philisophical blockbusters, 'where God went wrong', 'some more of God's greatest mistakes', and 'who is this God person anyways?'. For one of the funniest, smartest, most imaginative books ever written,whith unforgetable characters like Marvin:&quot; a depressed robot with an exeptionaly large mind 'sort of an electronic sulking machine'&quot;; Zaphhod Beeblebrox: &quot;President of the imperial galactic government, who is also adventurer, ex-hippie, good-timer, and, quite possibly, crook&quot;; and of course thhe seris's star Aurther Dent: &quot;for whom the adventure begins on a terrible thursday with the destruction of his house&quot; read &quot;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;! Don't Panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Quite possibly the funniest book ever. Adams' ability to go from mundane to absurd in a heartbeat is incredible. Just when you think poor Arthur Dent has done and seen it all, he falls into another disastor. This book is the sordid tale of a poor beguiled Englishman who just can't get out of his jammies in the morning."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"My book club read this and all four of us agreed it was great. Full of comic irony and random events, every few pages the author turns conventional reality on it's head in increasingly funny, offbeat ways. You'll travel through the galaxy, through time, and through perception looking forward to what comes next. Our group had a great time looking at the absurdities the book raises about human intelligence, politics, and control over events in our lives. This was a rare experience in that it really made me think and also totally cracked me up."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"What can one say about the greatest science fiction comedy ever written, Richard Cowper had a go but this is just ... well ... the Hitchhikers Guide, what can you say. This book so full of creativity is a phenomenon, this book flies &quot;like bricks don't&quot; as Dougkas Adams has been known to say. Such wit and of course the very English sarcasm.The story of Arthur Dent a rather pathetic figure whose house is about to be bulldozed to make way for a new highway bypass and is then rescued by his friend Ford Prefect (named after a car) and then attempts to halt the destruction by lying in the squelching mud in front of the bulldozers, is helped all the way by the bumbling foreman Mr Prosser who is, remarkably enough, a long distant descendant of Ghengis Khan and has a prediliction for litte furry hats and axes over his doorway, although the bravery of the great Khan has not been transmitted. This is how the story starts instantly enveloping the reader in a world of comedic joy with amazing creativity without becoming weak or slapstick in any way. The characters involved vary from the aforementioned Arthur, to Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, the erstwhile president of the galaxy a position of no power at all, Marvin the paranoid android a product of the hopeless Sirius Cybernetics Corporation whose largest department, which occupies the major portion of an entire planet, is its complaints division, the Vogons who like to spout shockingly bad poetry (the 3rd worst in existence) are callous and cruel and a host of other amazing creatures.Not only are the characters fascinating but the situations they get into are as well, eg the rescue of Arthur as Earth is being destroyed by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass is miraculous because it happens as they are dumped unceremoniously by a Vogon guard through the airlock and wisked out of the vacuum by the Improbability drive ship stolen by Zaphod.Only an Englishman could come up with this sort of comedic treasure. Maybe something to do with the stiff upper lip and all that.A book read again and again and again and again ......"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With a whole galaxy to choose from, 5 stars seems too limited!

It has the same kind of strange, warped humor! If you enjoy that kind of humor you will get a kick out of this series.This is a fun, mindless ride. If you expect something halfway serious you will be disappointed, but if you are willing just to be taken on a entertaining ride - hop aboard!The basic storyline is this: Arthur Dent is told by his friend Ford Prefect that he is actually an alien, and that Earth is about to be destroyed to make way for a glactic overpass. Ford Perfect offers Arthur Dent the opportunity to come with him and be safe. Arthur has a hard time believing this but comes along. He discovers that Ford Perfect is an alien and a field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Things get really strange and hillarious from there!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams uses humor and sarcasm against a backdrop of science fiction to create a comic masterpiece. The main character in the book is Arthur Dent. He is miraculously rescued from Earth just moments before it is destroyed to make way for an interstellar bypass. His rescuer is Ford Prefect, a researcher for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy who has been stranded on Earth for the past fifteen years. Unfortunately, the only ship available to escape on belongs to the Vogons who throw out the two hitchhikers when they discover them on the ship only after reciting horrible poetry to them. This should have been the end of these two adventurers, but by an amazingly improbable event, they are rescued by the starship Heart of Gold. This event was caused by the revolutionary propulsion system on the ship called the Infinite Improbability Drive, which makes the improbable probable. The occupants of the ship are Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Imperial Galactic Government who had recently stolen the Heart of Gold, Trillian, a woman originally from Earth and Zaphod's companion, and Marvin, an extremely intelligent and depressed robot. The party travels to the long lost planet of Magrathea where planets were once manufactured for the extremely wealthy. Zaphod believes that inside they will find countless riches, but are surprised to discover that it is still inhabited. Inside, Arthur discoveries many amazing things, such as the answer to life, the universe, and everything is forty-two, and the planet earth was manufactured as a computer to discover what the actual question to the answer is. The characters in the book are well developed. Arthur is the clueless one who is struggling to understand the events which have happened to him. Ford is the accomplished hitchhiker who answers Arthur's questions with responses which are so insane that they more often than not cause more confusion. Zaphod is a two-headed creature in search of adventure and Trillian is an intelligent and capable woman from earth. Through these characters, we learn to take ourselves a little less seriously. Although this book is full of humor, it also contains other aspects. It satirizes such subjects as capitalism, government, large corporations, organized religion, and militarism. The writing is full of irony and biting sarcasm as well. Adams' atheistic worldview is also displayed through his writing. I believe that Douglas Adams managed to write an excellent book which contains many strengths with very few weaknesses. This book is extremely funny and can be enjoyed as long as the reader is not expecting a serious sci-fi epic. The only possible weakness in the book is that the plot can become confusing at times. This, however, helps the reader relate to what Arthur is experiencing and eventually everything becomes clear if the reader pays attention. Overall, this is a fantastic book which is highly entertaining while still making some intelligent comments on life, the universe, and everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the funniest book I have ever read in my entire life.This book contains some of the most entertaining dialogue and gags in a sci-fi book.

But a lot of weird coincidental things have happened in my life that has led on to both good and bad things to come. I have put some of these things into my own Sci-Fi Mystery Series, \\"Mammoth Towers Mysteries\\", because explaining them in real world terms didn't always make civilized sense.And that's what I got most out of Douglas Adams' words. In his willingness to be bigger than life with both his characters and plotting, he allows us to be smacked in the face by a subtext that mirrors our ridicules uncivilized real lives and not have our feelings hurt in the process, yet clears our thoughts and opens our minds to the probability of the truth that we are not really the highest form of life on this planet.At the time of my reading Adams' book I did not know a movie was in the works. But I do remember wondering how a film maker would turn this all into a Hollywood movie. After seeing the film, it improbability worked. And now as those images are beamed out into space, Douglas Adams will live on eternally in both space and Time as one of this galaxy's Infinite Improbability Driven Great Writers. As for Earth, well, we'll see.Karl J. Niemiec Sci-Fi Mystery Writer"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's the weirdest day of the millennia for Arthur Dent. His home is demolished to make way for a bypass; his best friend turns out to be an alien; the earth is destroyed to make way for an interstellar highway; he is thrown out of an extraterrestrial spacecraft into deep space only to be rescued by a criminal politician, who once lured away Arthur's dream girl with the unlikely line, \\"I have my own spaceship.\\" And that's just the beginning.Armed with nothing more than The Hitchhiker's Guide and bath towels, the homeless Arthur and his friend Ford travel the wild universe of Adam's imagination cheating death time and again.Monty Python lovers will surely appreciate Douglas Adams' satirical take the galaxy, where poetry kills, the thugs are bureaucrats and a smart hitchhiker always knows where his towel is.Quick comic prose and quotable one-liners will keep you listening as Adams delightfully skewers politics, religion and the quest for enlightenment.Narrated to hilarious perfection by British actor Stephen Fry, this is a fast fun book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This story of an ordinary earthman and his adventures through the universe with some colorful space guys will have you rolling on the floor laughing, shaking your head in amazement, and flipping pages like there's no tomorrow.

This isn't the end it is the beginning. Don't panic!It is science fiction as parody as science fiction. Although social commentary in science fiction is not new (indeed in my opinion one finds some of our best social critics to be writers of science fiction) Adams has a way of not only making it fun but creating one layer on top of another and the philosophies and barbs become as absurd as some of the polymorphous characters. The book presents a panorama of absurdity.This is book that could have only been written after the whiff of the 60s was still in the air but was not just for aging hippies. Some of it is indeed very silly and some of it bordering on the profound. Sometimes in reading this I was reminded of Lewis Carroll, not so much the Lewis Carroll of Alice in Wonderland but of Jabberwocky as the names and forms of some of the characters are very, well very \\"Jabberwocky\\" ( yes there is even a character in the book named \\"Zaphod Beeblebrox\\").Throughout Dent's travels, which read very much like comedy skits, the author sometimes steps back and explains bit of arcana of the universe which always has some sort of off beat dead pan joke behind it. When this book first came out I remember many of the catch phrases like \\"Don't panic\\" on everyone's lips.You will find Adams to be a great humorist. Even now as I refresh my memory by going over the book I read about 25 years ago I am laughing to myself. Adams is an original. At the time when I first read the book it sometimes seemed so breezy and its catch phrases so easily absorbed by the popular culture I wondered if it was just somewhat of a fad, something that struck a cord in a generation (and only for that generation). My doubts were unfounded.In my opinion the work has stood the test of time. It sounds like hyperbole but who knows it a hundred years this book might be considered a true classic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Written by Douglas Adams, \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" was first published in 1979 and is the first instalment of his legendary five-part trilogy. (Adams apparently attributed this to a poor grasp of arithmetic). The series started life as a radio show, before becoming a book, a television series, a play and a bath towel. After years of trying, it was finally adapted for the big screen in 2005. Douglas Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and died in May 2001, while working on the film's screenplay.Arthur Dent wakes up on a Thursday morning with a raging hangover. Having left London about three years before the book opens, he now lives in England's West Country. That, however, is about to change : the local council has decided to knock down his house to make way for a bypass. Although their plans had officially been place for around nine months, they had somehow 'forgotten' to mention it to Arthur until the previous day - hence, the raging hangover. In a very bad start to the day, his hangover is interrupted by a bulldozer trundling up the garden path.Things aren't about to get any better, either. Arthur's one-man protest is disturbed by Ford Prefect - a very good friend who drags him off to \\"The Horse and Groom\\", with the express intention of drinking several pints of bitter. The pair have been friends for around five or six years. So far as Arthur knows, Ford is an out-of-work actor from Guildford. In fact, he comes from a small planet near Betelgeuse, is a roving reporter from \\"The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" (imagine an interstellar Rough Guide) and has been marooned on Earth for about fifteen years. Unfortunately, it's come to his attention that the world is about to end : the Vogons, on behalf of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council, need to demolish Earth to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Fortunately, Ford has a way out and he plans to bring Arthur with him.After surviving the demolition and some Vogon poetry, the pair are picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox - the two-headed, three-armed, renegade President of the Imperial Galactic Government and an old friend of Ford's. Beeblebrox has managed to 'acquire' a very stylish spaceship called 'The Heart of Gold' - a ship with a very improbable fuel source. The ship's crew is completed by Trillian, a human female, and Marvin, a paranoid android.This is an exceptionally enjoyable, extremely funny and very easily read book - Terry Pratchett fans, in particular, should enjoy this."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Imagine that one day you wake up hung over from the night before and learn the earth, the earth you've lived on for all of your life, is going to be demolished to make way for a new hyperspatial express route for traveling throughout the galaxy. In fact, this is exactly what Arthur Dent, the main character of this book, wakes up and finds out. Along with other characters, Arthur travels, or hitchhikes rather, around the galaxy and encounters numerous obstacles along the way. Most importantly though, not without knowledge from the revised version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to aide him.This book is an excellent read for anybody into science fiction, or even somebody who is not but enjoys humor, because this book is a wonderful, funny, quick read you will never want to put down. Douglas Adams is a terrific writer and his comedy is pure genius. So stop reading reviews of this book and go on a journey hitchhiking through the universe with Arthur and his companions."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I wanted to re-read this before the movie comes out, so I picked it up at the library. I thought I had forgotten a lot of it, since it's been several years since I read it. But, as I read it again, I realized how familiar everything was and I realized that this is one of those books you just don't forget.Anyway, reading it again, I found all the same things that I remembered. A cast of improbable, but great characters, a wonderfully epic plot somehow crammed into a very short book, and lots of laughs along the way. I'll be re-reading the other books in the series shortly, and I look forward to that even more after reading this one again.If you haven't read this, you really should, at least so you will know why people answer 42 to any number of questions that come up.

I am so glad I did! I laughed and was swept away by this extremely funny book. Some parts of it, when they get into all the \\"space talk,\\" were less enjoyable, but not really central to the plot, so its OK if you just skip over some of the made up words. I am so glad I read this book, and I am looking forward to finishing the whole series. It is sort of like Harry Potter for grown ups, a bit spoofy, and magical with a sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious take on popular science fiction, but don't expect much about Earth, as it is destroyed within the first three chapters. This sets the stage for an exciting adventure on a galactic scale. It has a wide and diverse range of imaginative characters ranging from the clueless human Arthur Dent, to the sulking depressed android Marvin. Douglas Adams has a very peculiar style of humor that guarantees a laugh on every page. Science fiction fans that are not afraid to laugh at some common clich&eacute;s will enjoy this book as it takes plenty of jabs at popular Sci-Fi series such as Star Trek and Star Wars. The plot revolves around the misguided adventures of Arthur Dent, who has his house demolished, his planet blown up, and is cast out into deep space all on the same day. Then he takes off with the two-headed president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, to find a long-lost \\"planet\\" that makes customized planets for wealthy clients. There is a dry sense of humor running through the book that relies very heavily on irony to show just how nonsensical science fiction is. Adams has shown here that Science Fiction doesn't always have to take itself seriously, and does it beautifully. This book has spawned almost 6 other books, all with the same characters, but still just as entertaining. I believe the argument of the book is that we should embrace our diversity while noticing each others quirks and habits. Adams shows this throughout the book with his funny descriptions of each characters personality. He is very good at making me laugh, and I recommend this book to humor and science-fiction fans."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Want to know the secrets of the universe?

Arthur Dent is an every day kind of guy; that is until he is saved from earth's demolition and he embarks on the greatest (and probably first) adventure of his life as he hitchhikes across the galaxy. Watch as he learns the Ultimate answer, the meaning of life on Earth, and have some laughs. \\"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" is part of a trilogy so you can have even more fun reading its sequels.

He is at his best when he breaks sci-fi cliches to smithereens, making you snigger or laugh wildly, yet demonstrating a deep feeling of what is the real sense of wonder of space. So, pour example, you have the bickering between cynic Ford Prefect and enthusiast Zaphod about Magrathea...and be caught in awe in the perfectly evocative description of &quot;The fires of dawn! The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm!&quot;. You'll laugh at the quirks of Eddie the Computer, be sympathetic whit poor Marvin, and you'll admire the curious clash of personalities serendipitously reunited...Ford the cynical and resourceful alien that can still be taken aback by an unexpected ruse by the insecure and shellshocked Arthur; the brash bravado of Zaphod,countered by the cool rationality of Trillian. The Planet Building Factory is a very original invention, and Slartibartfast is something of a Doctor Who mingled whit Obi Wan Kenobi...but lacking the self assurance of both. But the best moment of the novel is in the Story of Deep Thought and the Ultimate answer. This is pure Teather of the Absurd, and reminds us of Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan. The message from Tramalfadore could well have been &quot;42!&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you are someone searching for a book with a sturdy plot and a commanding theme or purpose, you have found the opposite in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This loony masterpiece has made for a name for itself in everyway the previously defined book has not, and then some.Though a valid portrayal of the book would tell of an earthman jarred from his home to discover the mysteries of the galaxy, this hardly describes the novel for what it really is. With its chaotic plot and illogical meanderings, you can't help but get addicted to the totally unorthodox writing style of Douglass Adams. As the storyline shifts endlessly, there are innumerable investigations into the underlying truths of our home planet. Things like the fact that dolphins have been warning us of the end of the world for years are common throughout the novel. And with off the wall style comes off the wall humor in a book that will keep you laughing from cover to cover. If you've ever enjoyed a Daniel Pinkwater book you'll fall in love with the Hitchhiker's Guide.On a scale from 1-10, Douglas Adams' inane writing fashion gets a 10 from me. And if you've ever wondered if it's really the lab mice that are performing the experiments or that the answer to the question of life is 42 for some reason, then The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I just finished reading this book after hearing much about it and I think it was fantastic and can't wait to read the sequals.

Now I do for nostalgia's sake, and some of the references no longer hold true (I suppose we can replace our fascinations of digital watches with iPhones now). The thing that makes HGTTG such an extraordinary funny book is the absurdity in the writing, the way that Mr. Adams can turn a phrase and paint the word picture.There are things I wish I would've known before hand that got lost on this American reader when I first got started (like Ford Prefect was named after a car, I don't know why in the American version they just didn't rename him Ford Escort or Ford Crown Victoria), but it didn't detract from my utter enjoyment.If you have some time, read this book, it is truly wonderful.

The antics of Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect are so zany that they have to make you chuckle if not laugh outright. And the perpetually sad robot, Marvin, infuriates the reader as quickly as the other characters in the book. So if you want a break and a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the Universe, this is the best place to start. I'm bound to pick up the rest in this series in order to continue to partake in this dry English humor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Having listened to my brother rave about this book for years, I finally decided to pick it up and read it. I'm glad I did. I laughed out loud a number of times. Each sentence has the reader wondering what the next sentence could possibly say. It has a Monty Pythonesque quality to it, and you can almost hear Eric Idle or John Cleese delivering the punchlines as you read.Arthur Dent's misadventures begin with a yellow bulldozer and don't stop until mice, monkeys, a depressed robot, the number forty-two, and language translating fish all come into play.I'd recommend this book, even if you don't happen to be a fan of science fiction. And now I'm off to the Restaurant at the end of the Universe!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy is truly a masterpiece.

Come and learn the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"A delightful blend of science fiction and humor, this book is possibly the funniest book I have ever read.

From Arthur Dent's charcter to Ford Prefect's to Slartibartfast's to the WORSHIPED Marvin - I've never read such a clever , humoristic writing. You don't even get a break , you read a new joke every sentence. If you want to breath , you'll have to put the book down.And another thing , you won't be able to stop reading , so if you buy the book , make sure you have a couple of days off before you read the first word.I envy those of you who read this review and decided to buy the book , for you are going to read it for the first time - a thing I wish I could do again. Alas , I can only comfort myself in re-reading certain ultra-memmorable passeges.VERY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Be warned, this is not serious science fiction. Not at all. With that said, it's one of my favorite books. It's silly, it's funny, and it's strangely enthralling. The plot is almost irrelevant to the charm of the book. The next two books are just as great, although the last two (&quot;So Long and Thanks for All the Fish&quot; and &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot;) are not as funny.

Never before have I chuckled or laughed out loud so many times at a book. It teaches us not to take ourselves to seriously, and have a good laugh or two. He also teaches us some great quotes to use from time to time. My favorite being &quot;The secret of flying is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.&quot;. That gives an overall feeling of the book, fun, funny, and nice to have. A must buy!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Adams could not have written this while he was sober, because all the perverse logic he sets out (check out his theory on the relationship between the babel fish and the non existence of God)makes perfect sense!

Considering the price of the eBook and the unfortunate quality of the bonus material, it's hard not to feel ripped off.Hopefully Amazon will deal with it and upload an improved version at a later date.For now, apart from the convenience of having it in digital format, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I was a graduate student in philosophy when Hitchhiker first came out. Either because I was overwhelmed with school work, or because I (foolishly) thought I was too brainy for Douglas Adams' little gem, I breezed through about half of it, concluded that it was crap, and tossed it aside. (Shades of Majikthise!)Now, some 30 years later, I've given it the serious read it deserved all along, and discovered why Hitchhiker has so many fans. It's hilarious, of course; Adams' talent for weaving together non sequiturs is unparalleled. It's incredibly imaginative, marrying the best of cosmology with the (intentional) worst of pulp science fiction. Best of all (at least so far as I'm concerned), it's extraordinarily philosophical, chock-full of logical jokes and wonderfully paradoxical arguments. But it makes its philosophical points parabolically, and with such a whimsical and funny touch, that the depth can easily be missed.Some examples: the hilarious logical conundrum involving identity and substitution in which Ford Perfect entwines the bulldozer-happy Mr. Prosser; the famous Babel Fish demonstration of the nonexistence of God; the sly allusion at the end of Chapter 9 to design arguments for the existence of God; the sperm whale's discovery of impermanence in life and personal identity; the parable about searching for undiscoverables that features Veet Voojagig's search for Planet Ballpoint Pen; the ontological nature of a world in which improbabilities become probable; the wrangle between humanists and technicians; and of course Deep Thought's search for the meaning of everything--which, among other issues, invites readers to think more about the propriety of questions than the virtue of answers.Even though it's taken me 30 years, I'm glad I've finally rectified a serious failing in my education by reading Hitchhiker. And now, on to the greatest test of all: using it in the classroom as a text! I can't wait."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Great book, irreverently funny, very interesting, and a fast read.

Afterwards my Dad, pleased with how much I liked the first one, bought me The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, all five books in one. But I still keep my first book and read it over and over and over again, the 25th Anniversary Edition. If you like surprising, funny books, you should read this one!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Two years ago I had the privilege of hosting Douglas Adams at my home in San Francisco for a brainstorming meeting on a game project (which eventually became Starship Titanic). I had heard of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, aka H2G2, but hadn't read it. What I had heard was that it was very funny - Monty Pythonesque humor applied to sci fi. Wanting to get a rise out of Douglas, I made him some tea and served it in a ceramic mug from Japan with a little ceramic frog hiding in the bottom of the cup. Douglas sipped his tea coolly, and when the frog emerged from the depths of the tea Douglas gave a little startled grunt, caught my eye and laughed, and continued to drink his tea. As I expected, unflappable.Now years later, and three years after Douglas' untimely passing, I am finally enjoying what brought Douglas his initial fame. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book in a five book trilogy in which our unsuspecting hero Arthur Dent narrowly escapes the Earth seconds before it is demolished to make way for an interstellar highway. Arthur escapes with his colleague Ford Prefect, who reveals to Arthur that he is actually from another planet and was working on a guidebook to the galaxy before getting stranded on Earth. Catching a lift with the cooking crew of the Vogon ship that destroyed Earth, Arthur and Ford are subjected to the torture of Vogon poetry before being ejected into space, only to be picked up by Zaphod Beeblebrox, the galaxy's BMOC, with his Heart of Gold improbability spaceship.Thus starts the string of ever more unlikely events in this romp through astrophysics and the hilarious imaginings of Douglas Adams' mind. Adams is a master storyteller, rarely letting his readers rest before hitting them with another plot twist or belly-acher. His humor is quintessentially British. One could easily imagine a young John Cleese in the role of Arthur Dent, deadpanning his way through the most absurd of events. Even if you have never read or enjoyed science fiction in your life, if you have any sliver of a sense of humor, you will enjoy this book.Since the combination of a lot of driving, an iPod purchase, and a subscription to audible.com, I've started to listen to more books than I actually read. The Hitchhiker's Guide is one of those books, read outloud and with great fourish by the author himself, Douglas Adams. As I understand it (someone correct me if I'm wrong) H2G2 was originally broadcast by radio. Thus it is ideally suited to be listened to as an audiobook. Adams has perfect comic timing in his delivery, though the book moves so quickly and covers so many diversions and plot twists I may want to listen to it again just to make sure I catch everything.The next book in the H2G2 5 part trilogy is The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. Equally funny and absurd, Dent and his co-horts escape total destruction once again and set off to find this fabled restaurant."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\" Gordon Logan (Scotland) - See all my reviewsThe book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway. He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity\\"Well gordon, this book was published in 1979, before rachel corrie was killed or born. What the death of rachel corrie and \\" The hitchhiker's guide\\" have to do with each other is beyond me. It seem the only thing that \\"descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity\\" is your bizare review of this book!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"First of all, to read this book, one must be willing to do two things: laugh, and enjoy the book for what it is.A warning: This book isn't very plot-heavy. So, if you're the type of person who must always have all loose ends tied up, be prepared for disappointment.Personally, I found this book to be absulutely hilarious. Adams's observations on the overall stupidity of mankind are right on target (Goodbye and thanks for all the fish!) The part that I found to be the most funny was when Adams made fun of philosophers. I actually doubled up with laughter when the man proved to God that He didn't exist. (I think I might have bruised a rib laughing.)And, as a sidenote, the Vogon poetry part is also another favorite of mine.I actually went on to read the rest of the \\"trilogy\\", which, was, to put it simply, mildly disappoiting. Following the example of the first book, the series ends abruptly with too many loose ends to name."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is the first, and undoubtedly the best, of the several books that (somewhat confusingly) make up the Hitchiker's trilogy.Adams has blended a fantastic sense of humor with a brand of philosophical thinking that would have left Socrates tied up in mental knots.There aren't too many books that lead off with the destruction of the earth. After all, where do you go from there? Adams uses this departure point to take us into outer space, where advanced interstellar communication is old news, and the collaboration of alien species is as common as it is in Star Wars. But this tongue-in-cheek universe is a far cry from that straight-laced epic series.The rulers of this universe are often bogged down in the same type of senseless rituals and paperwork requirements that plague the corporate and bueaucratic world here on Earth.Adams throws so many curveballs and insane elements at us at once that it's difficult to know what to expect when you turn each page.There's no sense in trying to explain the impact on the plot of a Vogon construction fleet, a ship powered by an Improbability Drive, or the long sought after answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You just have to read it.This might sound like the book itself is confusing, but that's actually not true. Adams has a way of explaining the inexplicable in a way that makes it, if not completely logical, at least entertaining.I highly recommend this book, especially to a young teen reader who might be looking for some answers that aren't in the rule book. This book might not have the answers either, but at least it raises the questions. Or maybe it doesn't even raise the questions so much as make us laugh about the results.Or something like that.Anyway, this is a must-read. I can only hope that the impending movie does it justice."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One would believe that Earth is a normal planet in a normal otherwise insignificant solar system along with other normal planets with no normal intelligent life. However, Arthur Dent is about to learn much more about Life, the Universe, and Everything than any other Earthling ever will. This is mostly because his planet is soon blown up, his best friend happens to be an alien named Ford Prefect, and he has been living on a planet that was really the most intelligent super computer ever created and was run by mice. Although Arthur gets past the fact that he almost dies on two occasions and has a fish living in his ear, he never gets past the fact that he has no idea what is going to happen next. He and his friend then become \\"hitchhikers\\" and get picked up by a criminal named Zaphod Beeblebrox, who just happens to be Ford's cousin. After all of these incredibly bizarre and improbable things happen, Arthur learns his destiny as part of the genius super computer called the \\"Earth\\" that was created to find the Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. But will he be able to escape the cops, whale and flower missiles, and mad mice that want the Question more than a run on the exercise wheel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not long ago, I read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and i. was pleasantly surprised about how much I enjoyed reading it. Everything from the writing to the concept it embodies had me positively spellbound.This book is about a dispossessed earth-man named Arthur Dent and the tremendous effect he is having on the universe. After narrowly escaping from the destruction of the Earth with his friend Ford Prefect whom he had believed to be from earth but turned out to be from a small planet somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse, they travel around the galaxy together meeting up with a large ensemble of friends along the way. The whole series of books follow Arthur Dent's journeys around the galaxy taking him to many mysterious places such as the ancient planet of Magrathea, and to a very strange planet named Brontital in a synthetic universe in one of the offices of the MegaDodo Publications (the home of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy) on Alpha Centurai. And also to pre-historic earth to see the cavemen wiped out by a bunch of telephone sanitizes.The whole series is completely astounding and to think it all came out of the mind of Douglas Adams; the creator of the television show, the radio show and the author of all five novels. I would firmly advise this book to anyone who enjoys to read science fiction. Even if you do not ordinarily like sci-fi usually, there is a good chance you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read this book because it was a choice for one of those aggravating reports we had to do in 10th grade, and it was the thinnest one on the list.

Yes, we are a &quot;gifted kid&quot; magnet school, but let me tell you... the humor in this book is just astounding! We reference this book at least once a day (and who wouldn't, what with 42 and towel lines right there at our disposal?). As a reader of decidedly more serious sci-fi, I was expecting something along those lines when I picked up this book... imagine how delighted I was to find what I actually held in my hand was one of the best parodies of the genre I've seen. A definite must-read for anyone who considers themself ready for a new experience in reading. Just read... and let the brilliance wash over you. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Douglas Adams is a master. Anyone who hasn't read his Hitchhiker's series needs to prioritize better. Hitchiker's Guide is light enough to never stop being fun, but looks seriously at humans and why we are the way we are. He seems to be able to capture the human condition through farce without becoming shallow or pandering. This book is a necessary element of any serious Sci-Fi reader's library."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If I were to rate all of the books that I have ever read, this one would be the funniest. He takes statements that sound very scientific, draws them out so they sound even more scientific, and then ends them with something so stupid and random that it leaves you wondering why you thought that the sentence sounded so scientific in the first place. An example of this is the first couple of paragraphs of the book, which say this:&quot;Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly 98 million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape- descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.&quot;I recommend this to people who have a British &quot;Monty Python&quot;-like sense of humor, are science fiction fans, or are both."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first read this book in college some 20 years ago, and I still highly recommend it. There's truly nothing else like it. Whole fan clubs are devoted to this series, and with good reason. (Just ask in a chat room some time, &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; Go on! I dare you! I bet at least one person responds &quot;42&quot;!). It's imaginative and very, VERY funny. I've never read anything so unusual in my life. I've recently discovered Terry Pratchett's &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, &amp; while they're funny, they pale in comparison to HHGTHG."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that people just come back to, again and again, and again, compulsively. Not many books are like that -- friends who have read this have all plowed through it at least 5 times. I myself discovered it in the early 80s, and have definitely read it dozens of times by now, no lie. There's just something about it. You can't stop, can't get away -- aaaaaahhh!Seriously, this straddles the line between &quot;funny-odd&quot; and &quot;funny ha ha&quot; more successfully, and more hilariously, than any book I can think of. One thing I should tell a person coming to this for the first time -- Zaphod Beeblebrox actually does start to make sense, during the sequels. Well, not &quot;SENSE&quot;, exactly, but his self-sabotaged brain becomes the key to a lot of cool hijinks. The second half of this book, after Arthur and Ford are picked up by the Improbability Drive, appears TOTALLY random, but actually does make sense in the context of the later books in the series. You should remember that this was originally a radio series, and this book is just the first few installments of it. The cutoff point is sort of arbitrary.As the series continues, Douglas Adams makes some really good philosophical points about getting along with each other. We should thank this guy, I think. The more I think about it, the more I realize what a solid, good person Douglas Adams is, to be able to laugh at the insanity that governs our modern lives. To even be able to SEE that it's insane is good, and to get others to laugh out loud at it all is GREAT. What a guy. Cheers to Douglas Adams, I say. Read his books, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Simply the funiest SF book ever.

The answer to the question being 42 (am I right on that?) and a sulking robot named Marvin not to mention the construction of a highway through space which causes earth to be demolished. This book is definitely not for the &quot;cool&quot;. It's for the geeks and freaks who haven't grown up and are still enjoying life. You'll laugh at every page as you go through the book.

I thought it was funny then, but after many years and many rereadings, I am further convinced that this novel is the work of true genius. As I age and (hopefully) gain wisdom, I see more of the subtle commentary on life that this book provides. Adams' ability to weave such convoluted subplots into a final big picture is absolutely amazing. He has been criticized for this, but I've found these critics often do not have the patience and/or comprehension level to really understand the _point_ Adams' is often trying to get across Regardless, the result of weaving all these microcosmic views of the world together is both a celebration and a criticism of our small human lives on Earth...and we have the priviledge of laughing all the way through it.

So the Visigoths throw out them in to space and Ford's friend Zaphod Beedlebrox who had two heads peaked them up. And Zaphod was with Arthur's friend Trillian. Arthur and Ford where in a room in their ship, and Trillian sent Marvin a depressed robot to get them. They reunited and they went to planet to get an improbability drive. And Zaphod had to give him one of his heads so Zaphod would get him a gun. Zaphod couldn't think with his one head. And on the planet the Visigoths captured Trillian.

And went to a planet called magrotha and on the planet they went to a super computer to find the meaning of life.And on the planet Arthur left behind went Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian went though a portal. So Arthur met a guy were he was. This was a contractor who built planets. So this man took Arthur around the planets they where building. Arthur found out that the built earth. Mice paid for it and designed it. So the man took Arthur to his home. When Arthur walked in the door Ford, Trillion, and Aphid was there. Then they fell a sleep and Arthur was awake and the mice. Started expeofmenting on him so he killed them. They all went outside on the Vogons where out ready to take Zaphod. And Marvin was out there and a gun that in super computer made and wiped out the Vogons. Arthur deseeded to travel space instead of staying on earth. THE ENDThe book wasn't fun and funny as some books I read.It was exicuting to read.It is a good book and has a lot about spaceIt wasn't that good because they spent too much time in one place.They spent a lot of time on earth which made it disappointing."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"WARNING This review may contain information that reveals major plot points. If you do not wish to have those points revealed, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (THGttG) begins innocently enough with the pending destruction of Arthur Dent's home outside of London, England. The only thing keeping the wrecking crew from demolishing the house is his lying in front of their heavy equipment. It seems that the &quot;powers that be&quot; wish to knock down his house to make way for a much needed highway bypass. Arthur's one-man lie-in is interrupted by a visit from his friend Ford Prefect, an out of work actor. Unknown to Arthur, Ford Prefect is actually an alien field researcher for the galactic travelogue &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.&quot; Ford has been accidentally exiled on Earth for the past 15 years.Arthur, with the aid of Ford Prefect, stows away on board the starship sent to destroy the Earth. It seems that our planet is in the right-of-way for the new hyper-spatial bypass. After stowing away, the following bizarre events happen in rapid succession: Ford and Arthur are tortured by bad poetry, they are hurled into the vacuum of space, they are rescued from said vacuum by Zaphod Beeblebrox (the renegade Galactic President) and his sidekick Trillian (the only other surviving Earth human). Needless to say these turn of events lead to some very interesting and very funny reading.I liked THGttG. I didn't love it but I did like it. This is my second reading of the novel in 10 years. THGttG was an enjoyable if not a light almost fluffy read. Adams' light and bouncy writing style made it easy to breeze through the text. I finished the book over a 2-day period. Adams' dialogue and scene descriptions were punchy and witty, much like radio dialogue from which it was taken. The book's humor is definitely British (funny bordering on the absurd). Watchers of British comedies will know what I mean by this assertion. If fact, as I read I would hear John Cleese's (Monty Python, Fawlty Towers) voice in my head doing the narration.Although I enjoyed the book's style and tone, its story was not as enjoyable or at least not as satisfying as it should have been. At a novel's conclusion I expect most if not all questions raised during the narrative to be answered. This didn't happen with THGttG. The book left many important questions unanswered: What happens to Slartibartfast, the caretaker of Magrathea? Do the Authorities ever catch Zaphod and punish him for stealing the Heart of Gold? Why were his brains surgically altered anyway? What is the question for which &quot;42&quot; is the answer? What will the mice do now? I saw the Public Television mini-series (a combination of THGttG and it's sequel The Restaurant at the End of Time) when it came out in the Eighties, so I know the answers to my own questions. But for the readers who have not seen the series not answering these questions is too great a flaw to overlook.All in all, THGttG is an enjoyable book because of its wit and humor but it leaves too much to be desired when it comes to tying up loose ends. If you wish to enjoy the book and understand what everything in it means, read THGttG and The Restaurant at the End of Time in immediate succession. If not, you'll find yourself greatly disappointed. ---------- Mario N.

Full of futuristic gimmicks, some funny and some, well, just plain silly, including Marvin the Paranoid Android, who just by talking to a ship computer causes it to commit suicide is pretty much the humor involved. Although the plot is pretty much nonsense, it is an entertaining read. Things like the meaning of life being the number 42 are what make this book either hilarious or nonsensical. You be the judge."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hichhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a book about two friends. One of these friends is from outer space and the other one does not know it. A spaceship apears and is going to blow up earth, so the friends hitch a ride with the spaceship and travel off into space.My favorite part of the book is in the begining, when the town wants to knock down Arthur's house and the costruction workers are outside his house wating to knock it down. Then his friend Ford comes and tells him that they need to talk but, Arthur does not want to move. So Ford confuses him and gets the head construction worker to take Arthur's spot and lay in the mud in front of the house until they get back. Next Ford brings Arthur to the bar and tells him that the world is going to get blown up by aliens.I don't recommend this book. For any body under the age of 15 or 16 because it was confuising and hard to follow. Most of the jokes I did not get and the ones I did get weren't that funny. The book skipped around a lot with out saying it. In a few years I will read this book again and I might get more of the jokes and understand it more but until then I really don't like this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I rarely meet another sci-fi fan who dislikes this book; everyone seems to love it, but I barely made it through. I did really enjoy the beginning of the book, but as it progressed I found that every time the situation was getting interesting, and about to require some work on the part of the author to figure out the ramifications of whatever new world the characters were in....oops! randomness drive kicks in, and we're off to somewhere else!I ended up frustrated with the author for copping out every time I was getting interested. As a strictly comic book, this might be OK, but don't read it expecting true sci-fi. Your time would be much better spent with Orson Scott Card or Timothy Zahn."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Finally read it again after 10 years to see if my impressions had at all changed. They haven't. Utter nonsensical, drunken silliness. Come on - Adams could not have possibly had any idea where this book was going from the moment he typed his first word. There is no cohesion, no destination and (almost) no point - unless the point is that extra-terrestrial life would be as brainless and stupid as Earthlings are."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book made me laugh; but it left me wondering what on earth the point was! Just laughter? Laughter, with a thin plotline wonven in to help it make any sense at all? Well, OK, that's nice: the world can use a whole lot more laughter overall. So if you're looking for an amusing afternoon read, this book will do nicely. But if you're looking for any kind of plot at all...choose something--anything--else."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very very funny, I will give it that much. It had me laughing out loud almost the entire way through. Adams has a very droll, dry sense of humor, and a great feel for the outlandish. But I was expecting so much more from this book than merely bringing the funny. It was on one 100 Greatest Books of the 20th Century list. The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking, aliens and earthlings adventuring through space. And as for climax...this book ends so suddenly, I wasn't even sure what the whole point was. Nothing was tied up or remedied. Characters didn't change or evolve, more than a few questions went completely unanswered. I guess this book is part of a series. It's best feature...it's short, so I didn't waste much time, and now I can say I've read it, for whatever that's worth. I am sure there is some great sociological theme somewhere in this book, but I can't be bothered.3 stars for the laugh factor."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Not the kind of book to read if you are into thoughtful S.F like Frank Herbert or Asimov. The only good thing I can say the author is totally original and there is now way someone can figure the story line (there isn't one), every page is a surprise."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Maybe the movie ties it together better. Reading this book was a complete disappointment. I will not be reading anymore of this series."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Arthur Dent is your typical Londoner. He has a house, a job, and heads out to the local pub on a regular basis. Ford Prefect, is not your typical Londoner. He is an inter-galactic hitchhiker who stopped off for a quick stop on Earth and found himself stranded there for 15 years. But now he's off again and he's decided that rather then let his friend Arthur blow up with the rest of Earth as it's demolished to make way for a freeway, to take him along for the ride. What happens next is enough to blow Arthur's mind, which he very nearly looses while ldiscovering the Answer to Everything.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an amusing little book but it's not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. The characters lacked any real depth, the plot was practically non-existant, and the conclusion came very abrubtly as if it shouldn't have ended when it did. I seriously have to question it's consideration as one of the best books written or it's inclusion as one of the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die.At 224 pages it should have been a quick diversion, but for me it was anything but. It took me two weeks to complete and a full week to get even 80 pages in. I will likely read the follow-up books eventually as I can't leave a series I've begun uncomplete, but I doubt I'll be doing so anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is about a guy whos planet is destroyed[earth]and how he survives in space.this guy has a freind whos really a alien and him and his alein freind hich a ride. then they meet up with the aliens freind and travel the universe and have really funny adventures.My favriot part in this book was when the two smartest life forms[rats] create a super computer that can answer anything. They ask the computer 'what is the answer to life and everything'then the computer answers'i cant answer this question you must build a smarter computer then me''. The computer gives them the plans on how to build it. Finally after they built it they asked again what is the answer to life and the computer said it needed 200,000 years to think.Wow, now again the great great great great great grand children of those rats came and the computers answer was 42. Everyone was in awe and could not understand it. I was laughing for ever it was so random and funny.This book was very funny to me but it was hard to read, i pesonally loved this book at times and hated it at times. i would recomend this book to people who like nepolean dynamite or monty python. If you like random books that dont have to have a point and are funny then this is for you. But if your looking for more of a serious book with a theme and climax then i would not recomend this book. Also this book has some hard big words in it so i would not recomend it for people in elementry or middle school unless your a really accelerated reader. So like i said before it really depends on what kind of reader you are do you like books with lots of funny moments that make no sense at all. Or a book with a actual point to it if so you will hate this book it will make you bang your head against the wall trying to understand what just happened and why, every page you read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"As the late writer Douglas Adams explains in the introduction \\"A Guide to the Guide\\" (\\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide\\" edition) \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" has appeared in different forms and in different medias -- not two of them are alike. That is very interesting and one more proof of the author's apparently unstoppable creativity. You may not enjoy either his sense of humor, or his ideas, but you can't deny he is smart and creative.I approached \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is suspicion. I have never been very fond of science fiction -- and I never understood all those complicated physical and mathematical stuff--, I have always preferred something more intellectual. And I wasn't sure how comedy would work along with science fiction. To make matters worse, I've never got into books that are published in series, and become a fever, with people who can discuss them as if they were talking about the weather. \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is a nightmare for me. So I decided to read Adam's first book and see what happens.Little did I know that I would fall for it before I reached page 20. In other words, before Earth is destructed. Although I can't recommend the whole series yet, I have to confess that I loved the first book and found it one of the funniest things I've ever read. And, it is not an easy job to make me laugh. Adams is witty and fast. So are his characters -- albeit a little crazy.My favorite character certainly is Marvin, the bipolar robot -- or paranoid android, pick one. He has some of the funniest lines in the novel. At some point, the reader may wonder whether he/she (the reader) is really crazy or Marvin is really involuntarily funny. I'd pick the second. My second favorite character is Ed, the hyperactive computer. These machines are dead funny.One can't expect realism in a science fiction comedy. Since \\"The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\\" is a fantasy, it is not a heresy to find a robot and a computer with more feelings that human beings or talking mice. This is supposed to entertain and, after all, this is food for thought, raising questions about what life is about, what is happening to the Earth and things like that. At some point, why not consider this novel sort of eco friendly?\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is a sort of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" written by \\"Alice in Wonderland\\"'s Lewis Carroll. Strange creatures act as if they were not strange; unusual situations are tackled as if they were usual; and a towel is the most important thing one must carry. What a (wonderful) world!I'll certainly read the following books in the series. I only hope they are as good, as funny, as witty and as fast as \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\". This light book is a good choice to read between to heavy and highbrow books. This is certainly one of the best treats readers any age can have."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"There are books that you should read, re-read, and re-re-read. This, unfortunately, turned out not to be one of those books, at least for me.When I first read this as a teenager, the whimsical English humor, sudden digressions, metafictional interruptions, and probing satirical questions kept me in stitches. This novel (such as it is), held together by a singular smart-assery, profoundly appealed to my own new found sense of adolescent rebellion. Coincidences, meaningful and otherwise, non sequiturs, and bureaucratic balderdash leavened the side-splitting dialogue and made it impossible to put down.Alas, upon re-reading the novel at the conclusion of 2006, I was struck by how much of the writing didn't strike me anymore. To say that the plot of the book is thin would be a compliment, and to call the characters, well, characters, would be a stretch. Most of the jokes just weren't as funny this time around, and the few that did crack me up were tinged with the bittersweet recognition that they would never be groundbreaking again.Because I read the 25th anniversary edition, perhaps it is fitting that it conjured up such mixed emotions. The author, Douglas Adams, had died three years before this edition was published, and so many of the extras in this volume involve tributes from luminaries like Terry Jones and Neil Gaiman. The introductory chapters are also chocked full of reproductions of flyers, book covers, and other such emphemera that will only be important to die-hard fans of the book, radio show, and/or movie.Remember, though, that this review is just my opinion. Whatever you do, Don't Panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It's not really my place to judge a classic that is older than I am, but I didn't find this all too exciting. The story itself was rather dry and predictable and so was the humor. If you like British humor, than this is definitely for you.

Douglas Adams, whose improbable initials were DNA, would have to be regarded as one literature's mischief-makers, and his escapades begin with THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY, a classic that's as much about humor as science fiction.Consider the underlying plot circumstances: the world's most powerful computer has spent seven and a half years determining that The Answer to the great question of \\"life, the universe, and everything\\" is 42, but that same computer admits it cannot determine what the question is. The planet architects of Magrathea are enlisted to design a planet, Earth, that will become the centerpiece of a 10 million year experiment to find the question. Unfortunately, five minutes before the experiment is completed (and the question found by a girl sitting alone in a small caf&eacute; in Rickmansworth), the Vogons demolish the planet Earth (unnecessarily, as it turns out) to clear a path for the hyperspatial express route through the outer reaches of the galaxy.Thus begins the adventures of one Arthur Dent - a perfectly ordinary Earthman and the sole human survivor of the demolition - and his friend Ford Prefect (named after a late 1940's Ford automobile), who turns out to be a field researcher for the indispensable Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Along the way, they meet one Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy who has just become a hunted thief for stealing the Heart of Gold, the most improbably remarkable car in the galaxy powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive.Of course, all this science fiction foolishness is just a cover for Adams's real purpose, to satirize every sacred cow in our culture from religion and philosophy to evolution and technology. Nearly every page contains a droll comment, a cutting remark, or just an offbeat observation about the inherent oddity of life. Most of them will make you smile, and some may even make you laugh. Added to all this, Adams gives us talking white mice, a terminally depressive android named Marvin, a universal language translator in the form of a Babel fish, and a planet builder named Slartibartfast who specializes in fjords and got an award for designing Norway.THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is great fun, sort of a reader's Monty Python. It's a bit like reading a comic book without the pictures, a guilty pleasure that's difficult not to enjoy as a break from more serious work. Then again, Doug Adams's greatest accomplishment may have been being serious without seeming to be, telling us not to take ourselves so seriously. Who else could have had the Earth's population of dolphins escaping the planet just before its destruction, saying goodbye to humanity with the message, \\"Goodbye, and thanks for all the fish.\\"Buy a copy, bring a towel, and \\"Don't Panic!\\" Just like Earth, it's \\"mostly harmless.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"yes sir, this is a jolly good read, from a very creative British mind, the one, the only Douglas Adams.Guaranteed to make you laugh, and also philosophize.

And of course Marvin the Robot is irresistible in his depressing way.

BUT....I am glad I read this book...and although like someone else stated some of the parts I was like \\"huh\\" and other parts I was like why didn't they finish explaining. I enjoyed them. I laughed hard at the beginning and even though not the most exciting book I ever read there was a compassion factor that made me keep reading to find out what happened to Zaphod and Trillian and Ford and Arthur. I actually am starting to read the next book because I want to know what happens with the mice, with the number 42 and what happens to the main characters. It is a quick read I finished it within a week-with work and college and many other things going on. So it is great for that. I am not disappointed that I read it. I actually am glad."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Never had I read a book which made me laugh so. Friends, family, and co-workers all expressed concern for my mental health as I would giggle, quite beyond my ability to control, at random intervals and for painfully long periods of time.The humor in the book is the ultimate in satire, and nothing is spared, religion, history, sociology, psychology, philosophy . . . the list is expansive.The characters are interesting enough and fleshed out enough that the reader develops an interest in them and a slight concern for their well being, although from the moment we are introduced to seemingly any character we must question their sanity. The characters aren't enough to be loved, as that would cause for us to be far too concerned with their well being to the point that we would object to the abuses that they are put to. Think of jesters, give them names, faces, and imagine that they're distant associates, like loopy high school classmates.The galaxy itself is a satire of the galaxy as represented in almost any other popular science fiction. The Hitchhiker's Galaxy is crazy. Physics has apparently taken a rather long coffee break, and many of the characters that you meet will make the main characters appear quite sane. I have yet to identify anything in the galaxy that isn't a joke.The story reads quickly, an afternoon of reading and you should easily cruise through this book, yet you'll experience the pain in your gut from the laughing for days thereafter, or longer if you continue in the series.Great for those who are looking for gratuitous and plentiful humor. If you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for a meaningful and linear series to fall into, this is not the place to look. However, if you're a Trekkie or a Warzie looking for some lighter fare, you've found the right place."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I first heard this story on the radio in England, bought the first two books and watched a cheesy fun BBC TV version. I laughed so hard I about peed my pants! Some of the humor is strictly British, and some of that dated to the late 70's early 80's, and some of it you have to have an understanding of some science to get the jokes. That doesn't matter though because if you read it you will still laugh, and that is the point. So get your towel, and a pack of peanuts, you can even put your head between your knees,(it won't help but you can do it if you like)And open this book and Restaurant at the end of the universe. You will be glad you did. Now the other books have some funny stuff too, but you have to read a lot of not so funny stuff to get to it. The new movie version comes out soon... I can't wait!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"All it was made out to be by reviews I read -- a very very amusing book. One of the few books I have read that made me laugh out loud. The book has the credibility to pick it up and read it without reading an intro/summary to see if you will like it (I thought it was much better reading it without knowing much/anything about it -- this is why I am refraining from saying any specifics).Bottomline, this book is humor at its best. Not a romance and will not cause the slightest amount of stress (it has suspense, but not the kind that stresses the reader). \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" was not written the way most stories are, which makes it so great."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"In a bizarre twisted universe, when one human escapes the planet, what does he do, he goes...... sight seeing. I thought that this book was funny, but odd.The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a hilarious book written by Douglas Adams. It is an excellent story if you like the book that \\"explains\\" why things happen in the universe. Arthur Dent was on earth within seconds before it was destroyed to make a galactic highway. His odd friend that is an alien, named Ford Perfect, mentors him about the universe.While this has happened, the president of the galaxy has just stolen the Heart of Gold, which is a ship with state-of-the-art technology. These two groups somehow intercepted and have a very funny adventure with each other.As I wonder what was going on inside Douglas Adams's head when he made this book I admit that it may be one of my favorites. Over all it is a hilarious book with a surprising and yet, strange, ending."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I originally picked this book up after seeing both my sister and father read it and constantly laughing at it. I can see why they were laughing. The way he makes fun of our normal ways of life, such as \\"the movement of tiny green pieces of paper\\" as he so well put, and he even makes fun of the intelligence of pretty much anybody and everything. Including sperm whales even.Overall i would say that The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy's concept is the funniest part of the book. Earth was destroyed in order to make a path for an intergalactic highway, the plans were in the Alpha Centurai hall for months. And all this happened just as the main character, Arthur Dent, faced a strikingly similar situation with his house.Douglas Adams's writing style and humor is a rarity among books, sometimes a chapter will be nothing more then a few words, or sometimes, only a page long. He will also go off explaining his galaxy through the use of \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" It contains knowledge of just about everything, from the incredible use of towels, to the discription of earth, \\"Mostly Harmless\\". Of course this is before earth is destroyed.All in all, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy remains as one of my favorite books of all time, and as hard as it is to believe, the series of 8 books, gets funnier and funnier as it goes on."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I really liked this book. It's tongue and cheek humor reminded me of Seinfeld, with \\"it's show about nothing attitude\\", except on a galactic scale. Author, Douglas Adams, really showed what day in the life of a universal hitchhiker would be like. Ford, Authur Dent, Zaphod, Trillian and Melvin are all lovably characters and I could relate to them. They reminded me of people I know or who I have met before. Who doesn't know someone who is cronically depressed. I truly wish that I could trade places with Arthur Dent and just spend one day in his shoes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy is the funniest science fiction brief novel I've ever read. Dialogs are funny, descriptions are comic and the argument is hilarius. Most of all, this is a smart novel where the casuality is masterly managed. Actually, nothing that happens in the novel is casual but just very, very improbable. These very improbable events produce a world where, for example, humans are only part of a ten million years long experiment done by the most intelligent species in the universe: mice, of course.I'm looking forward to read the other two parts of the &quot;incresingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy&quot;."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is very well written. It includes action, mystery, and most of all, science fiction. Douglas Adams is a genius in the writing world. This book has astounded me and has tingled my intrest in science fiction novels. Adams has created a masterpiece, something that I would read over, and over again to myself and my children. It would intrest anyone. From grades four(kind of hard for them) to eigth. Anyone who has any kind of an intrest in science fiction, fantasy, or just regular fiction, would be very interested. It is short but sweet, it ends very quickly, but covers a giant time period. In such a short time, Adams has created one of the greatest books I have ever read. My favorite character s an alien from the Beltigeuse Galaxy, who had done a report on Earth. But as time went by, he got stranded on Earth. His Earthian name was Ford Prefect, and he plays a stupid alien( at times), and also a genius to the alien Galaxy. Aurter Dent is the main character, and he goes through a lot of difficulties in the giant Universe. This is one of the greatest books I have ever read, and if you like this book, you should read the whole trilogy by Douglas Adams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is by far the funniest book ever written. Between the action, the characters, and the dialogue, there is hardly a paragraph that dosen't get a laugh. With Ford Prefect (ha) and Arthur Dent in the main spots, a romp across the galaxy is a great form of entertainment. I don't want to give away too much of the rudimentary plot, seeing as there's not that much to give away in the first place, so I'll end the review here."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"If you like science fiction-or even if you don't-you have to read this book. It is hilarious right from the first chapter. I was never really into the whole Aliens-are-taking-over-the-planet thing until I read this. I got all six stories in one album (The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) and tried to read all six books at my average rate, about two weeks for all six. Big mistake. But if you go slowly enough to enjoy it, it is one of the best books ever written!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"wether you like science fiction or not - this book is one of the funniest ever written !"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the first book of a trilogy of four, consisting of five books. The whole series is downright brilliant. Douglas Adams, tragically passed away earlier this year, was a fantastic writer, who could make you laugh, cry, wonder, etc. in just a few pages. The book is a combination of Science, Science Fiction, Humor, Romance and a bit of suspense. It tells the story about a guy, whose house will be destroyed, and at the same time, the Vogons are just above the earth, in order to destroy the earth. Both places must be destroyed, in order to make room for a highway.The choise of words, the similarities, everything gives you a feeling of recognition and believe in all the strange things that happens in the book.Specially for everyone in ICT, like myself: the whole series in mandatory literature !"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing and then some. Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, \`wow, that's big', time. Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here,\\" Douglas Adams writesThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and Life, The Universe, and Everything by Douglas Adams are arranged respectively to create a continuous story about five randomly unique characters plus one more later in the first book, then leaves in the end of the First book, and finally joining again in the third. These novels are one constant adventure through the ENTIRE universe, except at times where there isn't any adventure, which is a very small amount (I'll get to the characters later). Adams creates random but not entirely unrelated thoughts from the ever-famous Hitchhiker's Guide - thoughts like: \\"the knack [of flying] lies learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\\" He creates theories, one that states \\"that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable\\" and \\"another theory which states that this has already happened.\\"Arthur Dent is Adam's central character; basically each novel revolves around his life. Arthur is an earthling who just barely escapes not only the demolition of his house but also the demolition of his planet, thanks to Ford Prefect and a few alcoholic beverages. Ford Prefect works as a \\"researcher for the revised edition of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Just seconds before the earth is destroyed which happens immediately in the first novel, he saves Arthur from near death by hitching a ride on one of the ships that destroyed the earth. Zaphod Beeblebrox is Ford Prefect's cousin. While he is president of the galaxy, he acquires the starship, Heart of Gold, which runs on pure improbability. Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, rides the Heart of Gold with Zaphod after she was plucked of the earth a few years prior to its destruction. Marvin is a persistently depressed robot with intelligence beyond any known race or any race mentioned in the trilogy. Slartibartfast joins the strange crew, then departs, then joins again. This man from planet Magrathea is in the planet making business, which all Magratheans are, or more accurately were. Slartibartfast is very fond of fjords.Together, this crew, equipped with the Heart of Gold, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and eventually the starship Bistromath, explore the Universe for \\"the Question,\\" \\"the Answer,\\" and everything in-between.Adams writes in a sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical manner, showing new ways to perceive concepts formerly thought of as dull. The most hysterical and repetitive example in the three novels is the extreme importance of tea. At one time in the continuous story known as \\"The Hitchhiker's Trilogy,\\" \\"Arthur blinked at the screens [of the Heart of Gold] and felt he was missing something important. Suddenly he realized what it was. \`Is there any tea on this spaceship?' he asked.\\" If you've enjoyed the sarcastic, satirical, random, paradoxical writing of this review, you'll definitely LOVE \\"the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"To put it simply, this book moved me.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy boasts original characters (as well as original physiology), original ideas, plot twists, and fresh humor. Few science fiction novels can joke about themselves as this one does, and even fewer can do it so successfully.

Bring your towel and travel with Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect when they have to hitch a ride with Volgans to get off of Earth before it is demolished for a galaxy bypass. This small Guide to the galaxy, wiht it's reassuring, Don't Panic, is so cool you want it.

I finally got the time to read a novel, so I decided to give it a try, and it turns out that was a great decision. This may be the best piece of fiction I have ever read. The creativity was outstanding. I would not classify this book as humor, although there is quite a bit of it there. I think of the book as more of a mind stetch. The book is not to be taken seriously, and because of this and the humor contained, Adams is capable of creating text that is unlike any other I have read. This book is just pure enjoyment to read, like candy for the lighter side of the brain. I highly recommend starting with this book first, and then continue with the series (many people start with one of the later books).

It'll take seven and a half million years, but yeah, you'll eventually learn the meaning of life too, though you won't like it.

You're having a bad day - and it's going to get worse.As you lay in front of the bulldozer trying to block its path, your best friend, Ford Prefect, who you always thought was an out-of-work actor, pops up and reveals that he really is an undercover alien from the star Betelgeuse. But wait -- things are going to get even worse.Ford tells you that a rocketship conducted by evil aliens called Vorgans are going to blow up Planet Earth in five minutes to make way for a galactic freeway.That's how one terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad Thursday begins for chronic worrier Arthur Dent, a 30-year-old Brit bored with his job at a local radio station. When we meet him in the book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Arthur Dent suddenly has no reason for boredom and every reason to worry.So what does he do? Following the advice of his friend the undercover alien, he sticks his thumb up to hitchhike aboard the spaceship that belongs to the evil, nasty Vorgans. Arthur and Ford are smuggled in by the Vorgans' servants -- but the Vorgans, who hate hitchhikers, find them and throw them off the ship and into probable death in outer space.The two happen to be carrying a copy of a book called the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which warns them that life can only survive 30 seconds in space without air. On the 29th second, they are picked up by another ship -- and there's something special about this ship. It has the magical ability to change your atmosphere, turning illusions into reality - for example, transforming two missiles into daisies.This ship is named The Heart of Gold, and it's been stolen by ex-hippie Zaphod Beeblebrox, who was born on the Star Betelgeuse. He has three arms and two heads and is the spacey president of the galaxy. Also on the ship are his girlfriend Trillian and a chronically depressed robot named Marvin.The ship sails to Planet Magrathea. The planet that created all other planets. There they go through many illusions, being knocked out by walls closing in, jetting at the speed of light down narrow hallways in mini-spaceships, and many other exciting adventures.At the end we find out that mice have run Earth for an experiment and are about to steal Arthur's brain, but they soon defeat them.This book is a cliffhanger that leaves its characters stranded on Planet Magrathea. - a sure way to make readers want to continue reading the sequels in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyI got this book a few weeks ago from my school library and finished the book in about a fortnight around all my school work and playing football, that just shows you how much I loved this book. Douglas Adams is a great author and I want to read more of his books. In the book you go around the Galaxy with Ford Prefect, an alien in human form, and Arthur Dent, a human man and Ford's good Friend. In the book Ford and Arthur are picked up and dropped from ship to ship around the galaxy onto planets they thought were uninhabited! They have to hope ships pick them up before their time is up floating in space before they die after 30 seconds of space. This book is amazing. It is full of suspense, laughter, and joy. I recommend this book to every one who likes Douglas Adams' books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is funny beyond belief. It also is a must read for anyone who thinks about what's outside of Earth."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is a book that has everything! A wonderful sence of humour, explanations to the big questions of life and action, but the best of all is that you can reflect on both details and important parts of the story and look upon yourself, your friends, strangers, politicians, society - the whole world with another pair of eyes. The eyes of a Douglas Adams fan. And remember that the so called 'laws of nature' only are descriptions, and only apply for what we know of. The rest is unexplored and not impossible even though very improbable."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"It all started off so innocently when Arthur Dent woke up that Thursday morning in his home near London, England. everything seemed so ordinary, and then, the earth blew up. The same thing happned to me when I read this book. At first, when I picked it up, I wasn't sure that I would like it. As the book progressed farther and farther on, the better it got. And although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I could barely put Down The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This book was funny, clever, and had some really memorable characters such as Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Ford Prefect. I personally liked when they met Benjy and Frankie Mouse and how mice were said to be the smartest creatures on earth. I also thought it was a great idea of the author to use passages from the supposed original copy of this book. A must read.

If you even know the title it was probably recommended by a friend.

I have just got done reading angels and demons and two of the books in the dune series and this was a nice break. It was a rollercoaster that throws your head into an intoxicated spin of laughter and pure ludicrous adventure, but without the glare of the sun and the long lines. I highly suggest this book for anyone with a few hours to spare, since once you pick this book up you can not stop reading it. For all of you that wish for supposedly \\"cultured\\" and \\"intellectual\\" reading don't read this book please and give an abhorring review as some have done. If you want a book that is \\"intellectual\\" and up to your standards, then I would suggest Niccolo Machiavelli's The Prince."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The trilogy(even though there is five)made me laugh half way to my demise. Only Douglas Adams could make me laugh at astrophysical jokes and satire. His vision is spastic, ridiculous, and fantasticly clever. In this book...the earth is destroyed within the first three chapters to clear a way for an intergallactic space highway that never even ends up happening. One of the last of the two remaining humans happens to hitch a ride on a vogon space ship(the vogans destroyed the earth). It turns out the earth is just a crazy experiment that is meant to find out the question to the ultimate answer which is 42. This book is insane and marvelous. Read this no matter what you like. It is worth it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I picked A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy off of a list of classic novels or something like that, having no idea who Douglas Adams was or how significant the book was. I was pleasantly surprised, and now know where several popular phrases originated.The book begins with humanoid Arthur Dent waking up and finding a bulldozer in his yard about to demolish his house to make room for a highway. Arthur is understandably upset, but this doesn't really matter considering the fact that unbeknownst to the human race, earth is about to be destroyed to make room for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur is rescued from the fate of earth by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out is an alien who knows how to hitch rides on spaceships. With their jump into space, Arthur and Ford are launched into a round of interstellar escapades, accompanied by the egotistical but lovable Zaphod Beeblebrox, his girlfriend Trillian (who happened to have come from earth), and Marvin, the perpetually dismal android with a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot;.A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy makes an interesting combination of two genres- science fiction and comedy- and it works marvelously. The plots moves along quickly, making it an easy read, and also providing opportunities for multiple readings to catch all the humor. A Hitchhiker's Guide is imaginative, witty, and in places downright hilarious. In addition to this, the writing is very intelligent without being overbearing; the book gently prods at several of our own silly social conventions in a comical and lighthearted way. A Hitchhiker's Guide was a delightful read, and I heartily recommend it- to sci-fi lovers and non.One word of advice; don't waste precious mental energy trying to understand how an Infinite Improbabily Drive works, or any of the many other gadgets in the book, because this isn't the sort of book where it matters whether you understand how things work or not. I realized about a quarter of the way through the book that I was taking things much too seriously and that the ludicrous descriptions were placed there mostly for comic effect."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is the first in a five-book trilogy. (Yes, a five book trilogy.) In this book, an average Englishman named Arthur Dent learns of a plan to blow up the Earth to make way for an intergalactic bypass. His friend, who is from Betelgeuse Seven (and not Guildford as he claimed) helps him hitchhike off to the spaceships that destroy Earth. He then goes on a wild series of adventures, which are chronicled in this book.I like this book because it has a very strange sense of humor, and yet it has its own logic, which can be understood if one tries hard enough. It also has a cast of unique and semi-realistic characters. I also like how Adams uses some very strange analogies, such as \\"he felt like a man getting mugged in a meadow.\\" These analogies are not only comical and awkward; they also fit perfectly into the moment. They also perfectly convey the meanings. This book, in conclusion, is a very interesting read for anyone who likes anything related to hitchhiking, space, or any form of comedy whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by the late Douglas Adams is perhaps one of the most indescribable books that I've come across in my readings. Douglas Adams in decidedly brilliant. His droll wit and sense of humor will definitely put a smile on your face.The story is somewhat complex. Without giving much away, human Arthur Dent is rescued from Earth just minutes before it's destruction by his friend Ford Prefect, an alien from somewhere in the area of Betelgeuse VI. Arthur and Ford (after some very funny encounters) come across Zaphod Beeblebrox (the two headed, three armed President of the Galaxy) and Trillian (aka Trisha McMillian, Zaphod's human girlfriend and a girl who Arthur had tried to pick her up at a party on Earth) and Marvin, a manically depressed robot.Adams' humor is more of the ironic sort then the laugh out loud type. Adams will give you a seemingly random excerpt from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (the encyclopedia which, in the novel, is a central component) or a very detailed description of the thoughts of, say, a potted plant, which has seemingly no relevance to the story. But never fear, Adams brings everything together in an exciting and funny climax to the first novel of his increasingly inaccurately named series.From an analytical standpoint, the novel is a satire on the sterotypical british character - dull, complacent, emotionless. Arthur Dent can be classified as any of those. His only true emotional outbreaks come when his life is endanger (which it quite often is). The reader will enjoy watching Arthur's character grow and change. Fortunately, his character does not change too much over the course of the novel (his character is still the well-meaning but accident prone, unemotional hero that you will come to know and love).Again though, it's hard to describe The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. As is said in the book, space is big. Like really big. Like really really mind boggingly big. It's like so big that it's just unimaginable. And so is Douglas Adams novel.I would like to take this moment to thank Douglas Adams for his work and to say &quot;God rest his soul.&quot; We will miss you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I have read The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and I thought it was hilarious. The Guide uses a genius blend of comedy and action to create a great flow of a story. Douglas Adams uses many large and complicated words so the reader has to figure out what these funny words say.

I liked this book was very good and I recomend it for all who love a good laugh."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Adams exposes the truth: &quot;In the beginning, the universe was created.

It gets confusing at times with the whole concept of space travel, but stick with it and it's worth it. It really makes you think and there are few books that can be funny at the same time. And if you like this one, you'll love the other sequels even more. The books get funnier as you go too. Everything about this book is great. Especially the manic depressive robot, Marvin.

Think with all the hype I just didn't want to be disappointed when I actually got to it, but I was surprised to find that it was even better than what I'd heard. It's kind of hard to describe what exactly The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy really is. I tend to agree with some of the criticisms that there's not very much focus on plot development or story here and that mostly it's a collection of really witty, punny, and sarcastic observations about humanity and the universe, but that doesn't really detract anything from how clever it is. Adams wrote this at a time when really there was nothing comparable. It's hard to describe the exact flavor of Adams work, it's certainly unique, but it does echo a lot of things that modern readers should be familiar with. Imagine, if you will, throwing Monty Python, Kurt Vonnegut (specifically Slaughterhouse V), and Chuck Palahniuk in a blender - and that about captures it. In short, by the end, I found myself reading not to find out what happens, but just for the sheer pleasure of listening to Adams.HItchhiker's is funny, light-hearted in spite of the backdrop of the story being the destruction of the Earth, and extremely well-crafted. Adams uses language masterfully, examining nuances and the connotation of words and facts about us that seems like an insanely chaotic metacognitive philosophical treatise with a thread of humor all the way through. To be sure, this book is nerdy and geeky in the extreme - I think a basic knowledge of physics is definitely required to fully appreciate all of the humor in here - even to appreciate all of the scientific creativity. Reading this as late as I have, I was astonished to see just how much of a cultural impact the book has had, from Babel fish to Deep Thought.Will definitely read again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a science fiction novel by Douglas Adams. After Earth is destroyed, Arthur Dent finds himself on a space ship with his Alien friend Ford Prefect, the president of the Galaxy Zaphod Beezlebub, and former Earthling Trillian. They set out to find the mythical planet of Magrathea and have some fun adventures.This book is really amusing. There isn't really much of a plot, but the writing is very clever and humorous. As a science fiction nerd, I found a lot of it hilarious, and the characters are interesting and funny. The plot is interspersed with excerpts from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a literal how-to guide, which give the reader amusement and an idea of the universe they've been thrown in to. I think this is the first book of four, which explains why there isn't really any resolution and many questions are left unanswered.The book spends much of the time focusing on why the universe exists. The second smartest computer in the world decides the answer is 42, but what really is the question? Adams says that humans are actually the third smartest species on Earth, after mice and dolphins. The whole book seems to be saying that you have to find out your reason for existing yourself. Go out there and hitchhike and find something to do with your life. The answer isn't the problem, it's the question. You have to find the right question, and then the answer will make sense."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Because it makes so many \\"best of\\" SF lists, I read it. I actually got a bit more than I expected - Adams's writing is quite good, and I picked up on a number of modern cultural references derived from the book - but as far as humor goes it's a zero.

Is it educational or thought inspiring? Does it have an engaging literary style? What audiences is it or not recommended for? Would I read it again?Is it entertaining?This book is full of creative random, ironic, and cynical humor. If you looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy this book.Is it educational or thought inspiring?For a comedy, it is surprising how educational and thought inspiring it can be. I learned several new words that I had to look up in the dictionary. Douglas Adams humorously targets topics that typically matter to most people; challenging and giving new perspective that can cause one to ponder.Does it have an engaging literary style?Douglas Adams doesn't suspensefully catch attention of the readers where they feel like they can't put the book down. Nor does he go into imaginative detail. Each chapter are short and meant to humor the reader. Two reasons make this book engaging: humor and the easiness to pick up where you left off.What audiences is it or not recommended for?I would recommend this for all general audiences except two: Children, and those who cannot stomach cynical humor, especially with sensitive topics such as religion, which sensitivity is what gives me reason to drop this book to four stars.Would I read it again?Yes.I hope this review helped you, and if you ever want the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, read the book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Stretches your imagination, but never loses its sense of humor. Fans of \\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\\" will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"One of my all-time favorite novels. Adams did some great editing work on early Dr. Who episodes before creating this masterpiece of science fiction humor. No one comes close to his quips! The characters from Zaphod to Marvin are hysterical. There really isn't any other author who even comes close to this style. Appropriate for all ages and a real page turner! This is one you will want to read more than once.NetherWorld"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"\\"There's an infinite number of monkeys outside who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've worked out\\"Arthur Dent wakes up to find a construction crew outside his house, waiting to demolish it for a bypass. Little does he know, a Vogon construction fleet is outside his planet, waiting to demolish it for a hyperspace lane. Fortunately, Arthur's friend, an alien from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford Prefect, lends a hand and the two hitchhike away from Earth moments before its destruction. This is their journey.I Liked:The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a classic, the perfect blend of comedy and scifi fun. Adams is acutely aware of scifi stereotypes and what makes people laugh and has blended them to perfection.Our protagonist/hero, Arthur Dent, is a complete deconstruction of the \\"hero\\", the man who can elbow his way into everything and come out on top with ladies fondling him. Arthur is completely at the whims of chance and his friend, Ford. It's delightfully funny to see his reaction to being the third most intelligent life form on Earth and how positively useless he is to the Heart of Gold.Ford Prefect is a delightful \\"sidekick\\", who ends up being way more helpful and useful than most sidekicks. It is he who saves Arthur Dent, it is he who attempts to find ways out of scrapes, it is he who sticks his neck out on the line.Zaphod Beeblebrox is a kick in the pants to those who are interested even passingly in politics. I find it a riot how his job as president is to focus attention AWAY from those who have power. My absolute favorite line of his is \\"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it caught and shot now.\\"Trillian is your stereotypical damsel in distress/buxom lady, only she isn't either. A passing comment suggest she may be a physicist and a mathematician--far better than Arthur, whose only job is to \\"whine about Earth\\" (my poor attempt to render the book's words) and restate the obvious. She is competent, adventurous, smart, and not another objectified woman (though she certainly wasn't ugly, her beauty is not the primary attribute she has).The story seems rather simplistic, but I found it a riot, which is what I believe was Adams intent (that, and a satire to our world). Arthur worrying about his house being destroyed when Earth is minutes from destruction makes him seem rather petty; seeing Zaphod race after Magrathea for the sole purpose of fame and money shows his shallowness and makes a funny statement to our constant pursuit of the purpose of life. Having mice manipulate humans shows how we are so eager to make ourselves more important than anyone else and our inability to see out of the box of our self-importance.I Didn't Like:The ending is a bit abrupt and kind of hokey. But then, you really can't critique the ending, given what the purpose of the novel is. When I listened to the audiobook, I found it challenging to figure out the Hitchhiker's entries and the story.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Mild profanities.Trillian is Zaphod's girlfriend and travels with him on the Heart of Gold. Arthur attempted to go after her, but Zaphod whisked her away.Earth is destroyed. Vogons torture people with their poetry.Overall:If you want to laugh, if you like British humor, if you have read a lot of cheesy/70's scifi books, you need to read this book. Heck, if you like to laugh and like scifi, you at least need to try this out. It's funny, it knows what it is picking on, and it is clever. I also recommend listening to the audiobook where Douglas Adams himself reads the book. It's a delight to see how the author intends the book to be read.Brought to you by:*C.S.

This is the food your mind is craving, but didn't know what it was. It's not like other books you will find (unless you find a recent book that borrowed ideas and style from this). The style of reading is amazing, and the humor pops in at just the right (which is often unexpected) places. This was originaly a 4-book series, ending with So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, but if you get that far, you should also read the fifth book, Mostly Harmless. The second volume is my favorite, The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which has the alternative meaning that you probably don't expect, and the fourth book, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, is definitely worth the read. The author's works outside of this Hitchhiker's series are considerably different in nature -- maybe you'll like them, maybe not, but it's worth knowing that they are not more of the same. You can see that I'm trying not to give away the content. If you find another Hitchhiker fan, just answer 42 when they ask you a question, tell them not to panic, or ask them why they left their towel at home, and they'll understand completely. This series is a great conversation piece among those who have read it, and they often like to challenge one another's Hitchhiker trivia. You know it's an exceptional book when you love discussing it for many years after you read it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Really enjoyed the book.

The jokes in this book are well executed, and some are the punchline to the whole book. It's pretty short, so if you're a regular reader, you'll finish it in probably less than a week at most, but it's definitely worth its hardcover. Great book."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"i really love this book, adams is the master of wit7 comedy, and sataire in this book. it literally had me laughing out loud. this book iwll not leave you dissapointed in the least.:)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is a perfect combination of science fiction and comedy. If you like these two genres then you are sure to love this book. I sure did."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hilarious and entertaining, Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an enjoying read. Filled with irony and amusing parts, the book is good for relaxing and taking your mind out of reality.Some of the characters in the story are outrageously funny. I especially love the contrast between the average normal human, Arthur Dent, and the rest of the relaxed and carefree characters. Arthur Dent is your average, don't have any idea what in the world is going on type of guy. Then there's Zaphod Beeblebrox. I mean how cool is that name?! Although he is the type of person you want to knock out because he is so idiotic. Even compared to Arthur Dent who does not have a clue what is going on, Beeblebrox appears to be THE loser of the galaxy. Last but not least, there's Marvin- one of the best if not the best character in the book. He steals the whole show away with his depressed mood. The thing he says and does is so ridiculous that I am on the floor laughing half the time. I mean when he plugs himself into another computer and the computer commits suicide- now that is hilarious.Douglas Adams' style is very simple and direct. It is as if he is discussing the story with the reader. While using sarcasm and jokes to make statements about life in general, Adams keeps readers entertained with his simple straightforward language.Filled with dynamic and entertaining characters and species, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is easy to read and one of the funniest science fiction novels I have read in my entire life."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide is indisputably one of the funniest if not the funniest books ever written. While still sticking by science fiction standards Douglas Adams creates scenes of hilarity not only to make us laugh but to give us different perspective about this silly thing we call life.Though the story line is a bit complicated the first time around, this provides for multiple readings of enjoyment. We start with our main character Arthur Dent, who is having his house demolished to make way for a bypass and is then suddenly saved as the world is about to end by his friend Ford Prefect. Sound simple so far, well it's not that simple, in fact it's quite complicated. It turns out that his planet is being destroyed by the poetry-telling Vogons and that his friend Ford Prefect is actually from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. From here Ford and Arthur are thrust into a world of obscurities and random events.With items such as the Babel fish, the Infinite Improbability Drive, and a spaceship named the Heart of Gold it's hard to go wrong. Adam's characters are especially unique. From the clueless Arthur Dent, who really just wants a nice cup of tea, to Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president of the galaxy who has three arms and two head, to Sartibartfast, the planet building man responsible for making the fjords on earth, Adam's presents an all-star lineup. One character not mentioned, but who deserves recognition is Marvin the Paranoid Android whose wholehearted depression makes the story even funnier.The whole story is not in complete narrative format, instead there are random moments in which Adams choose to insert random facts about universe as written in the Hitchhikers Guide, a wonderful book with the words Don't Panic written in nice friendly letters. Here Adam's true comedic genius shines and his style is evident through is humor. He uses short sentences to make understatements \\"space is really big\\" as well as long sentences to go off on tangents on topics such as Vogon poetry or the existence of Magreathea.In Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy not only will you find the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything thing, but you might also find yourself rolling on the ground laughing. And who knows maybe one day you'll get to visit the restaurant at the end of the universe."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is brilliantly witty at every turn. You just never know what to expect next but you know it will be funny. Adams is a master of the dry sense of humor and communicates it in such a way that you can't help but laugh out loud. There is just enough plot and character development to keep things moving, but the real lure here is Adams' sheer gift for humor. I recommend this book highly to all who refuse to take life (or themselves) too seriously--you will be delighted as you laugh your way through this one."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Read the series and then watch the original BBC broadcasts on DVD, or listen to a copy of the radio series. This book is a classic and I suspect that we will never see its like again. Even though the author was given credits in the latest movie of the same name (he died some time ago), I hope that you will see the humor that made this a classic. Read and enjoy, if you do not get it the first time then read it again."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book made me laugh so much. It was great but the only bad thing was it was such a quick read."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"With characters like the liberal cops, the sperm whale, deep thought, the Vogons, the improbability drive and especially Marvin, how can a book go wrong? I have nothing negative to say about this book- it was pure, knee-slapping, laugh-like-a-toddler-being-tickled entertainment. I am not well read by any means, but Douglas Adam's books have made me laugh more than any other book (Joseph Heller's Catch 22 is the only thing I've read that comes close). The comedy genre is a difficult one to be successful in, but this author is clearly talented at using the pen to make people laugh. This book is the first in a series of five, and by far this book is the better of the bunch.I include my review of movie free of charge. It was horrible. Not only did it deviate far from the book (which isn't necessarily bad). But the plot, character development, attempt at humor and acting were terrible. I only finished watching the movie out of respect for my appreciation of the book.One last thing- where can I buy a Babel fish? It would save three or four years of my life (I am a missionary struggling with language study.)"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I've had friends and acquaintances recommending this book to me for years and I finally decided to read it before going off to see the movie version. Though the book might seem a bit disjointed, there is a plot to the events the occur. Arthur Dent is a typical middle-aged British male that awakes to find that his home is in the process of being destroyed to make room for a national interstate. Moments later, Arthur is saved from the planet Earth by his friend, Ford Prefect, just seconds before the planet is destroyed to make room for an intergalactic freeway. Talk about the irony.And that's pretty much how the whole book moves along. There are some wonderful witty lines spoken and keen observations stated about human nature. These are what make up the book's core. However, in all the witty nonsensicalness, don't loose sight of the plot: that this is a movie about a lost man trying to find his place in the universe. So, so long and thanks for all the fishes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Guide is surely one of those books best enjoyed between the ages of 15 and 20, but I still had a great time with it at 25. Douglas Adams' genius is in gently but decisively subverting a genre while staying true to its best and purest roots. Thus, he dispenses with the dorky obsessiveness to which sci-fi is susceptible, using humor and non-stop action,The Guide is a tribute to science fiction and a paean to its great patron saints. Exploring space and time travel in an infinite yet incomprehensible universe, Adams offers a view of the universe without the self-importance and Earth-centered myopia of the human race. Yet just when the Earth is detroyed, we take comfort in the realization that the rest of the galaxy turns out to be populated solely by other creatures very similar to ourselves. No stone is left unturned, no nasty trait of humankind is immune from Adams' sharp, yet not quite caustic, wit.At a rudimentary level, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy appeals to the fantasy-addicted, carefree spirit of our inner child--the mystery and wonder of space and time surrounding us without all the baggage of the adult who has ceased to dream and look into the stars, content to rest on his laurels and in his certainty of death and taxes."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is quite a hilarious look at life, and if you haven't seen the movie yet I would advise you to read the book first - if not only to read the book and not see the movie, reason being that you will miss out on intricate details which are undoubtedly the best parts to the whole story ! If you dont have a good sense of humor, or understand why one would pass out if Mc Donalds was suddenly no more - this book is not for you."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I must admit that I went about this backwards - I saw the recent movie before reading the book. Having done so, I think the movie did an admirable job in portraying the story at heart; but reading the book is an even more enjoyable experience. Douglas Adams' sci-fi satire is a blend of all the best of every world.\\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is the story of Arthur Dent, an earthman who discovers one Thursday (while trying to keep his house from being bulldozed) that his close friend, Ford Prefect, is from another planet, and that in a matter of minutes, Earth will be destroyed. The two hitchhike a ride on the Vogon ship that destroys Arthur's home planet just as said destruction is taking place. What follows afterwards is a wild ride through the universe with the President of the Imperial Galactic Government, Zaphod Beeblebrox, an earthgirl whom Arthur struck out with at a party, and the robot Marvin, who has been given a Genuine People Personality, and is therefore depressed by everything. Their travels bring them to find out who was behind the destruction of Earth, the answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, and just who happened to be the most intelligent being on Earth before it was destroyed.There's no doubt why Adams' classic satire has become such a classic. The story is witty, laugh-out-loud funny and, oddly enough, one that readers can identify with. I look forward to reading the books that follow for more instructions on how to not panic."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book was one of the best I have ever read! The humor and suspense are both very powerfull. It defineately makes you wonder. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Now I know that this book is supposed to be a \\"trilogy in five books\\" but I can't help but feel a little cheated by the way this one ends. There is little in the way of closure and all I got from the ending is speculation. This doesn't mean that I hated the book though. Far from it, I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Douglas Adams really has a knack for writing in a drool manner that I found to be very amusing. The humor is very good and, I suppose, very British. The story shouldn't be taken seriously, but I guess that's where appreciation ends and geekdom officially begins. All I'm saying though is that I didn't get everything I could possibly want in terms of story but that's okay. Because I can't wait to get my hands on the next couple of books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is a great book for all ages. Arthur Dent is about to get his house knocked down, which he is very mad about. Then his friend, Ford Perfect who is from a different planet, tells Arthur that the Earth is going to be destroyed, to make way for a space highway. Ford Perfect is a researcher for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and he wants to update the book to be more up-to-date. Arthur and Ford hitch a ride with the Vogons, rights before the world explodes, and are almost immediately thrown out. They hitch another ride, with the president of the galaxy, who stole the fastest space ship ever made, coincidentally, Arthur finds his friend Trillian aboard too, he had met her one day at a party. After that they go on many journeys and mishaps, which make the book incredibly funny. Every character in this book is great, and adds humor to every page, Arthur who is a regular human, Ford Perfect his friend, and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most interesting characters because he ahs 2 heads, and 3 arms. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a book full of humor, and also a reader who enjoys reading science fiction books."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This book is hilarious! It's about two people who live on Earth named Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect, but Ford Prefect is from a distant planet. Moments before the Earth gets blown up to make way for a galactic freeway, Arthur and Ford hitch a ride from some aliens and escape annihilation. When the aliens dump them into space, they get picked up by another spaceship. That spaceship was called the Heart Of Gold, the most technologically advanced spaceship in the universe. Before Arthur and Ford got pickied up by the Heart of Gold, the ship was stolen by the president of the galaxy who is a two headed, three armed ex-hippie named Zaphod Beeblebrox. On the ship there is a genius but clinically depressed android named Marvin. In my opinion he is the funniest and most memorable charactor in the book. Together, Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Marvin go on a hilarious adventure full of excitment, thrills, and laughter. The ending is something that you would never expect and you will have to read the book to now what it is. This is just the first book in the series of 13 books written by Douglas Addams."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a novel that could be enjoyed by anyone of all ages. I thought this book was exciting and full of energy. I felt it was upbeat and amusing. The characters are realistic in an unrealistic sort of way. I like Adam's unusual sense of humor and his characters. Author Dent was a quiet and normal human living on earth. Author never really adjusted to being a hitchhiker. He was satisfied with the way he existed on earth. Then there was Zaphod Beeblebrox. He was an alien that was a joking, reckless President of the Imperial Galactic Government. Zaphod was rather full of himself and never seemed to have a worry. Another character is Marvin. He is a depressed robot that never had a positive outlook on anything. Also there was Ford Perfect. He was the easygoing semi-cousin to Zaphod. He is just a guy that went with the flow of things.It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. The pictures he painted were vivid and creative. The stories are unlikely yet extremely enjoyable. I loved the jokes about bureaucracy around the galaxy. I have never read a book that had such original ideas and characters. The storyline kept me guessing and I was always pleasantly surprised. It seems, to me, that it appeals to \\"nerdy\\" people. Besides that, I thought the book was outstanding. Everyone I know that has read it loved it just as much as I did. The book grabs on to your attention, it has interesting, funny characters that were not standard, the story was fresh and the visuals that he painted were superior."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy to me that's a long title for a short book of only around 200 pages. If you want a quick read that has comedy try reading this short novel by Douglas Adams.The book puts in the universe threw Douglas Adams imagination. He does this unique style of writing where he uses another books passages and tells them threw the reading. By doing this you start to understand everything going on while your reading.The time that this book was published makes it hard for me to understand some of the jokes. So readers that where around in the early 80's might enjoy the book more than I did. Don't think that every joke is out of date, while I was reading it I was laughing inside. Adams made things obvious seem hilarious!The Flow of the book starts off slow and gains pace which makes you want to read on and never put it down.My overall opinion to this novel is that: it's easy to read, very comical, short, full of excitement, and has a shocking ending! So try reading this book and if you like it theirs a whole series that follow after this one."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Silliness abounds in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which as it turns out is not a guide book for hitchhikers beyond the general advice and rational behind always bringing a towel. Frequently the silliness is true to life in that it is tied to burocracy (The sequel to the Hithchhiker's Guide computer game was titled Burocracy.) and the oddities in modern life. The story starts as Arthur Dent, a normal English man, wakes up one morning to find bulldozers outside his house. His house had been scheduled for demolition for several months and he hadn't realized since the plans were posted at the county office. A few chapters later we find that the entire Earth has similarly been scheduled for demolition by aliens who wish to install an interstellar expressway. So Arthur with no house and soon no planet is taken to outer space by his friend Ford Prefect, who it turns out was an alien. What follows is travel through outer space which turns out to be as absurd as earth. Irony abounds.The book was adapted from a radio show and this yields some awkward results. The pacing is very ADD. Seasons of radio went into the book, so originally this would have been spread out over a longer period of time. However the going stays coherent and jokes are fit to plot not the other way round as can happen.This is a book that you will love or hate. I loved it and I think it would be worth trying out."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is one of the more odd but hilarious and intelligent books I've read. It makes you think about the way we live our lives and how we as people view everything. The book shows the importance of a towel and how the galaxy works in general and it was quite hard to put this book down. The majority of my time reading this book I was literally laughing out loud. The characters in this book are well thought up like the Earthling/main character Arthur Dent who just starts his day trying to save his house from being demolished so there can be a on-ramp built for a freeway. Also Ford Perfect, a researcher, who saves Arthur Dent from being blown up on Earth, since the Earth was in the way for an intergallatic freeway. The two characters go through amazing adventures in the galaxy and meet many other interesting characters such as the president of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Marvin, a robot who is extremely depressed yet very intelligent.

Still fun after all these years and the father of a million bad puns, this satirical sci-fi spoof is nothing but fun. A pity we've lost Douglas Adams, but his priceless sense of humor lives on. The man was as funny as his work - I had the privilege of meeting him at a convention where he was booed only once. He admitted to wearing a digital watch.

Many objects that seem insignificant turn up later, revealing their significance in the big scheme of things. The story, although funny, isn't necessarily an easy read. It reveals many details relating to other points carrying on throughout the novel and the whole series of novels. Douglas Adams take his readers through his points of view about the universe, which often leaves the reader saying, \\"What the crap?\\" However one can't help laughing at how ridiculous the situation is. The book is definitely difficult to put down.All who like science fiction will love Douglas Adam's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. One does need to keep an open mind while reading the novel because Adams makes fun of most aspects of the creation of the universe that are popular to most people. If in general you have no idea what you believe and you do get offended is your own damn problem. After all, it's just science fiction. It's not like he means it! In closing, \\"life, we apologize for the inconvenience.\\""},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"The downside of any audio book is that it does not give you the chance to pause for reflection. However, I fully recommend this book for two reasons: First, you could not pause during the reading of this book if you wanted to; it's that good. Second, Douglas Adams has a wonderful voice. It's a rare treat to hear an author read his own material and it casts a different light on a book than you might get just from reading it. It is an even rarer treat when an author is doubly blessed with a talent for writing and oration. If you enjoy this audio book, consider &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; by David Sedaris, read by the author."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Suddenly a thousand gallon vat of custard upended itself upon them. This is just one of many unconceivable thoughts and events that occur during the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If improbable and uncanny is your type of book I have one right here that you will love.As the first book in a series of unbelievable futuristic books, you are taken on a wild ride as the Earth is destroyed. Just don't forget your towel. As it is stated in the Universal Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, \\"There is a man who really has his towel.\\" Because of this, a person is likely to give a hitchhiker anything you want or need. During this adventure Arthur Dent is an unexpected human who, by chance or luck, is saved just in the nick of time. During his adventures he is taken all over the galaxy and ends up on a planet unknown to everyone, on a ship that was stolen by the President of the Imperial Galactic Government. This man may be the most unintelligent being around. The planet Arthur Dent is on is the planet on which live the makers of extremely expensive private planets. The ending will blow you away.I like the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because it is unpredictable. Just when you thought it was over something completely strange and unbelievable happens and changes the whole story. Douglas Adams is constantly throwing curveballs at me. Strange as this book is, it presents a lot of problems that a person faces in life.If you like entertainment, this book is for you. The wild adventures and the inconceivable events continue to pile up, but don't stop there. As you read you begin to get a feeling of what Arthur Dent is going through. You become entangled with the characters and the plot. You are swept away with the mind-boggling chance occurrences that continue to pop up suddenly as though they were lurking in the dark waiting to pounce.Douglas AdamsThe erratic nature of this book, the immense entertainment value, and the qualifications of the author are my reasons for you to read this book. If that isn't enough, just think of the unbelievable quotes that you can rattle off while walking down the hall. If people didn't already think you were crazy they will now. So I leave you with a question to ponder; when faced with the dilemma of what to do when earth is destroyed, will you have your towel?"},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"This is another one of those books I'd long heard about and meant to get around to reading at some point. Finally I was at the bookstore to get some gifts and decided to just buy the thing and read it. Since my edition was only 215 pages it didn't take very long. This is the kind of book you could read at the airport while waiting for your plane or in an afternoon at the beach, if you aren't too afraid of people judging you harshly for reading a sci-fi book on the beach.Anyway, a concern of mine was that this book would turn out to be too British. By that I mean British humor is often so dry and strange that it's hard for people from other countries to understand it, like when I recently watched \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and it just didn't seem that funny to me. I have to say there probably is some of that stuff I just didn't get, but there was also enough I did get for it to be a hilarious read.In the universe according to Adams, poetry can be used as a weapon, Earth is demolished to make room for a new galactic superhighway, and mankind is only the third most intelligent species behind dolphins and another species I can't reveal without giving too much away.As for the story, Arthur Dent is a typical suburban Britisher whose house is about to be torn down to make room for a new road. This parallels Earth's fate as a race of ugly bureaucratic aliens swoop down to announce Earth is to be demolished to make room for a new galactic highway. (The plans were available in Alpha Centauri for decades. Didn't we get the memo?) Arthur is narrowly saved by his friend Ford Prefect, an out-of-work actor who's actually an alien. At the same time, the president of the galaxy Beetlebrox and his lovely human companion Trillian steal a new ship that runs via the Improbability Drive, which seems to cause highly improbable things to happen whenever it's used. The two storylines become intertwined in the search for the Ultimate Question.The Improbability Drive was the one thing I really didn't fully grasp in this book. The rest of the sci-fi terminology was easy enough to understand if you've ever watched \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or anything like that. So it's not really a challenging read that way. The real challenged as I mentioned is picking up on the subtleties and nuances I'm sure are buried in there. Some scholars out there I'm sure have broken down all the novel's symbolic elements and all that.The only real problem I have with this book is that it's too short. I didn't feel like I got a good enough grasp of the main characters, their conflicts, and relationships. Because the book is only 215 pages it seemed like we only got an overview of Arthur, Ford, Beetlebrox, Trillian, and Marvin without delving any deeper. I suppose that will be for the sequels to delve into. At some point I'll have to read those as well. (I haven't seen the recent film version either because I was afraid it would spoil my eventual reading of the book.)Still, as mentioned this novel is a hilarious read and since it takes so little time to breeze through there's really no excuse to keep putting it off if it's been on your list.That is all."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","review":"I read the Hitchhiker's series for the first time when I was about 14 years old.

THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY is the funniest thing he--or most anyone else this past 100 years--ever wrote. It's highbrow, lowbrow, and ever-so-intellectual silliness that makes the book so entertaining. I'll never forget the dolphins evacuating Earth before its destruction (via a preconceived plan) and leaving behind the message to all the doomed humans: \\"So long, and thanks for all the fish!\\"GUIDE is also a textbook example of books that completely lose all of their power when adapted by high-budget, vacuous Hollywood movie churners.

Not because his verbal wit is matched only by his intelligence. Not because his characters are so oddly interesting.

I cannot count the number of times where I have been trying to describe an abstract concept usually relating to science or philosophy and I have used Adams' work as an explanation. Religion, space travel, time travel, the human body, and even tea have all been meticulously broken down by Adams razor-blade wit.

I wanted to see if this was as good as I rememder it and I can honestly say that I was surprised that this book is just as funny to me now as it was then. I don't think a book exists with funnier asides and narration in the entire corpus of the written word. This book is not about characterization it--if you are looking for that go read Orson Scott Card. This book is about blatant and unabashed mind-boggling creativity that with amaze even the most creative among us. Adama is truly a master at taking seemingly minute and trivial plot details and workign them back into the novel in meaninful and hilarious ways. That is why i like this--it is random, but not for the sake of being random, something I overlooked when I first read it.

After that they leave the pub and and a giant fleet of vogons are coming to demolish the planet, but aurthor and his friend hich a ride on one of the ships and are saved from total annihilation, then their journey begins.My favorite part of the book is when aurthor wakes up in the morning and starts getting ready for the day, and in every mirror there is a bulldozer getting ready to demolish his house. When he finally notices it he is sitting down eating breakfast. Then the next thing you know he is outside lieing down in front of a bulldozer that is getting ready to totally demolish his house.

His buddy Ford prefect, who he thought was human, but turns out to be an alien wisks him off of the earth just in time for an even worse termination.

The man who brought him there happens to be his friend, Ford Prefect, who happens to be an alien himself. Throughout the story he and Arthur travel the Milky Way having ridiculous and idiotic adventures with the President of the Galaxy, his girlfriend, and a depressed robot named Marvin.I found this book hilarious, and, though none of it made too much sense, that was precisely why it was funny. It had plenty of references to actual things, made fun of them, and actually made you think about what was happening to the human race,and that we really aren't quite as smart as we think we are. One of the key points of the book's plot is an amazing spaceship that belongs to the President of the Galaxy, called \\"The Heart of Gold\\". It actually zips around the galaxy using the prospect of \\"Infinite Improbability\\" in which strange and often ridiculous things happen, but return to normal once it's turned off. During one event in the book, The Heart of Gold is being tracked by two missiles, and seconds before impact, Arthur pushes the Infinite Improbability button without turning it off afterwards. The result is that one missile is turned into a sperm whale, the other is turned into a bowl of petunias, and the ship's interior becomes a garden, and is completely unharmed.Overall,I found this book, interesting, quite funny, and something that really makes you stop, look around an think to yourself, \\" What am I really doing here anyway?\\" I would really and truly reccomend this book to anyone who's seen Monty Python, called it stupid, and still laughed at it. I would definetly not reccomend this book to anyone who can't laugh at themself, or gets angry when they're confused. A word of warning to anyone thinking about reading this book: I had to read some parts of this book twice to really get what was going on, and despite this, I would really advise anyone resding the book to keep going if you get confused. The book usually explains what went on after it mentions it. Personally, I believe that if everyone who read this book and some of the ones after it got as much out of them as I did, they could at least be a little smarter about how they live, deal with the government, and think about the environment."},{"Title":"A Churchless Faith - Faith Journeys beyond the Churches","review":"I found this book extremely thought-provoking and encouraging. In particular, it introduced me to the work of James Fowler in modelling spiritual growth as stages of faith. The book challenges the prevailing view about church leavers and I felt has clear messages for both the individual feeling church is no longer for them, and for churches facing the departure of well-known members.From the perspective of someone rethinking their religious faith, the most helpful aspect of the book was the level-voiced and non-judgemental survey work (drawn from Jamieson's doctoral thesis) showing why people stop attending churches. Jamieson develops a model showing why people leave and the summary, surprising to some, is that it's a matter of growth of faith rather than death of faith that makes the majority of leavers go it alone. The key message to the individual? \\"You're not the first to face this, and you're not on your own\\".Like the related book 'The Post-Evangelical', Jamieson discusses the fact that faith systems today exist in the context of a culture completing the transition to a post-modern outlook. His challenge to church leaders is to see leavers not as the fallen but as pioneers. His research finds in the majority of cases individuals with insight into expressing faith in post-modern terms rather than in the modernist terms of the established churches. The key message to the church? \\"Culture is changing, and your leavers are your congregations's pioneers\\".Overall this is a book that should be on every minister's shelf and which could offer relief to long-term church members and leaders suffering 'burn out'."},{"Title":"A Churchless Faith - Faith Journeys beyond the Churches","review":"If you grew up in the church, are bored with or sick of church & shallow evangelicalism this book is awesome. It doesnt try to prescribe any solutions, it only observes why people leave evangelical churches and what happens to them afterwards. Best thing about the book: you know you are not alone and you understand what's going on inside of you."},{"Title":"A Churchless Faith - Faith Journeys beyond the Churches","review":"Alan Jamieson, A Churchless Faith: Faith Journey Beyond the Churches (London: SPCK, 2002)This is a helpful study of why people leave evangelical/ Pentecostal/ charismatic churches, and how to understand and care for them. Jamieson is a pastor and sociologist whose doctoral research was based on interviews of why people leave their church and their journeys of faith outside the church - which contrary to expectations often continue to grow. He investigates reasons people leave, analyses different types of leavers - disillusioned followers, reflective exiles, transitional explorers, and integrated wayfinders - and relates their journeys to Fowler's stages of faith development theory. He says we need not just seeker-sensitive but leaver-sensitive churches, and liminal groups (like some emerging churches) where \`leavers' can explore their questions safely. Jamieson suggests they need to offer space, resources, validation, support, and room for questions and emotions. He celebrates groups like \`Spirited Exchanges' for church leavers that, in common with emerging missional communities, connect with the emerging postmodern culture, offer alternative structures and worship styles, and focus on whole-of-life faith.Originally reviewed in Darren Cronshaw \`The Emerging Church: Spirituality and Worship Reading Guide.' Zadok Papers S159 (Autumn 2008)."},{"Title":"A Churchless Faith - Faith Journeys beyond the Churches","review":"This is the best book that I have read so far on the subject of faith and attending (or not) building based churches. The book is based on research that Alan Jamieson did for his doctoral thesis. It is was a very easy and enjoyable read based on solid research.The book focuses on people who have left what the author calls EPC (Evangelical, Pentecostal, and Charismatic)churches. He makes a case for lumping these types of churches together based on similarities in these groups and that they are growing parts of Christianity worldwide. The data for the book comes from interviews with 108 church leavers and 54 church leaders. Interestingly many of the church leavers had held positions of leadership in the church.The author categorizes the church leavers into seven groups and not only describes the commonalities of people in these groups but relates them back to James Fowler's stages of faith. The main point of the book is that most of the people in his study did not leave the church to reject their faith but as part of its development.The book gives an evenhanded analysis of not just what church leavers feel and think but also the positive and negative consequences of their decision to leave an EPC church."},{"Title":"A Churchless Faith - Faith Journeys beyond the Churches","review":"First, let me express that I was teetering between three and four. Leaning towards four because this book does provide insight as to why some leave EPC churches in Britain, which was doctoral dissertation work. The three is related, as one of the detriments here is that Scripture is not introduced to be the authority in determining who is doing it the Jesus way and who is not. Quantitative and qualitative analysis using sociological, anthropological and other discipline methods, techniques and analysis run much too short of theological examination using biblical exegesis and theological reflection.The more I advanced in reading, the more I became aware that the author leans toward a non-biblical evaluation of the topic. Certainly the matter of why people who were once active and participatory in a congregational setting should be interviewed and talked to as a high concern of church leaders. But the question remains, are the leaving one's concerns and disappointments and frustrations God pleasing? The Bible is recount with doubters and grumblers that did and did not please God, e.g. the related OT examples in 1 Cor. 10 which now apply to NT church as well, and the infamous doubting Thomas in John 20.The author's orientation to corporate expertise and mindset of customer as king he applies to such church leavers. One would have to first prove that such marketing orientation is biblical, which this reviewer is not convinced. If this be true, then this research moves to a very incorrect and dangerous position, of urging the church to give into leavers and orient yourself to seekers. This is just not the case biblically. The church is for believers!What I appreciated about this work is the insights it provides on why and how people do leave church. The question remains however if they can truly remain in saving faith outside believers' assembling together around Christ's Word and Sacraments with His gift of the office of the public ministry? This book answers no; I disagree. It offers no biblical evidence, other than the fine research work accomplished and the opinion of the frustrated leavers. The current contemporary idea that one can be a fine Christian without being churched is just biblically and historically wrong.For sure Jesus states that one of the signs along with earthquakes and wars and rumors of wars is apostasy, falling away from the faith. (Mt. 24:10) Does the church have anything to do with this? This book seems to think not much, even a deterrent, but the Bible speaks otherwise."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"This is the first of three great books by Gerald Massey on the relation between all the world's religions, cultures and languages and the ancient Egyptian that is, in itself, rooted in the lake region of Central Africa at the source of the Nile. In the first volume of this book, Massey discusses the extremely ancient origins of Egypt and then goes into great detail and depth in showing how the British Druidic culture is Egyptian in its origin. Volume two does the same for the ancient Hebrew culture. These books are a gold mine, They are filled with detail upon inspiring detail. See my review of *Natural Genesis.* Massey's books are indespensible for anyone interested in the great African cultures, the British Druidic culture, the origins of the Hebrew culture, the problems of Christianity, the origins of Buddhism, and the origins of all the world's myths, including the biblical legends, and languages; he shows Egyptian words that show up in a very large number of languages including even the American Indian, Maori, Japanese, Chinese, European, African and so on. Massey focuses through his volumes on the British Druidic, Hebrew, and Christian traditions, and explores in extraordinary depth the Egyptian, and its root culture deep in Africa. Anyone who studies the African traditions can easily see the connections of Massey's findings with the African traditions. Egypt goes back hundreds of thousands of years and comes from the same root as all the other African traditions. All of Massey's books are published by BCP (Black Classics Press)."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"This review is for the collective works of Gerald Massey. I discovered this author back in the 1990's when his works were scarce and available mostly through Kessinger Publisher Reprints. With the copyright out of date, I am now able to find his works on line in their entirety. My own personal copies are heavily highlighted.I was impressed with the depth on which Massey wrote, wondering if his facts were correct or if he was making up information as did so many of his contemporaries. The fact is, I still don't know. I found his style of writing difficult to comprehend, finding myself re-reading paragraphs and sentences attempting to figure out what he means.His theories are interesting and perhaps overall have some merit. But when one delves deep into his material, there is much that is incorrect and much more that is speculative. One can find errors in any writing of this type before the onset of modern dating techniques, even in the best of authors.His theory is simple. Man started as a man-ape in sub-Sahara Africa. His original language originated there and then went to the rest of the world. He proposed this idea while man's origins were still being debated. Where Massey's works falls apart in when he compares languages and finds connections between ancient Egyptian and the language in New Zealand. He has a heavy emphasis on Egypt's influence in the world and goes so far as to compare British pub names to Egyptian mythology.Now even if one was to suppose Massey is correct in his theory, there would really be no way to prove his details correct. He believes that any ancient word that has the same three consonant sounds in a row have a common etymology.Massey ascertains the Egyptian hieroglyphs hail from sub-Saharan pictograms. Currently his idea is as good as any out there, although no modern scholar is making that claim. Some learn toward cuneiforms as their source, but nothing is in stone.The theory of Massey that interests me the most and has become a topic of my own book, \\"On Earth as it is in Heaven, The Cosmic Roots of the Bible\\" is that he insists the Bible is composed of cosmic myths and are related to Egyptian mythology. I have found this basic idea to be 100% true, at least in my mind, but Massey fails on many details. He is unable to make a clear concise easy to follow argument . My original intent was to reword his work, but I discovered errors and an overall inability to ascertain his sources. He is poor at listing them.Other modern biblical astrology authors have wholesale copied Massey without doing their homework, perpetrating mistakes, setting back the theory. Massey is correct in that the story of Adam and Eve is the constellations of Virgo and Leo. His idea of Cain and Abel being Draco and Hercules then subsequently being Gemini is incorrect, as is his basic idea of the tree of knowledge.Massey is correct about the Egyptian dung beetle representing barren births in the sign of Cancer, becoming the sign for virgin births. He correctly identifies Sirius as the Star of Bethlehem. Curiously, while Massey identifies the 12 sons of Jacob as being associated with the 12 signs of the zodiac, at no place in his works does he list them all with their corresponding sign, even though many of his predecessors and contemporaries do so. I could go endlessly go on here.While Massey spends much of his time comparing the Bible to Egypt, it was actually Babylonian mythology and history that had the largest influence. I found Sayce's comparisons to be far superior in most instances.I am a big fan of Gerald Massey. Without his works I would have never have authored my own works. If you are planning to write a paper on any ancient topic, I wouldn't quote him. His theories are interesting, his proofs are fallible, and his prose is downright a challenge."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"product was a gift, the person enjoy reading odds books. he was so grateful for the books that i gave him."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"Massey was born in 1828, to give you some idea of how old this book is. He was a self proclaimed Egyptologist, not to mention Chief Druid, at least by some claims.The book is dated and the language stilted, and, much more important, the scholarship it contains is only considered of historical interest since, without a single exception, all Massey's points have been long refuted.Massey's books were part of the 'History of Religions' debate among biblical scholars, which lasted from about 1880-1920. Part of the debate centered on whether or not Christianity had borrowed dogmas from other religions. The debate ended after thousands and thousands of books had been published by various people, and is now considered a dead issue in modern biblical scholarship.It may have taken decades but it was agreed, at last, that early Christianity never borrowed any dogmas.After all, Paul quotes--in just one of his epistles--from the Old Testament 50 times. The number of times he quotes from a Roman or Greek author? Zero.But on to Massey's own silly errors. Here are some books on the subject will will crush all of Massey's statements like a balloon stuck with a pin:From Jonathan Z Smith's famous essay \\"Dying and Rising Gods\\" which you can buy on Amazon today: \\"The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to be largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions.\\"Also, from Nash's \\"The Gospel and the Greeks\\" which you can buy on Amazon today: \\" The tide of scholarly opinion has turned dramatically against attempts to make early Christianity dependent on the so-called dying and rising gods of Hellenistic paganism\\" (p 162).From Gunter Wagner\\"That Paul modeled his Christ 'myth' on the myths about other 'dying and rising gods' is now no more seriously held than is the derivation of the observance of Sunday and of the resurrection on the third day from the mystery cults\\" from \\"Pauline Baptism\\" p 266.For a good background on this subject, there are two books available on Amazon that explain everything in depth. One is \\"The Jesus Legend\\" by Boyd and Eddy, and the other is \\"The Gospel and the Greeks\\" by Nash.All of Massey's claims have been utterly refuted by real scholars.Personally, I love his claim about how Christianity was only one of many religions that had virgin births. The reason the idea was rejected by scholars: because none of those virgins that Jove seduced or raped claimed to be a virgin after they had sex and became pregnant! Hello!!Besides, none were claimed to be in real, historical time, as was the case in Christianity. And let's not forget the hilariously wrong 'virgin birth' claim about Krishna. As any Hindu will tell you, Krishna's mother had had a number of children, perhaps as many as seven, before she conceived Krishna. Pretty hard to claim to a virgin when giving birth to your 8th child.If you are interested enough in the subject to want to read one of the major older books that refuted the claim that the Egyptian religion influenced Christianity, see if you can find a copy of Gunter Wagner's very famous \\"Pauline Baptism and the pagan mysteries\\"."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"I am still on volume one. It is a slow read for me. The paragraphs seem disconnected and anecdotal without a key for the reader to anticipate where he will take them next. If a modern sympathetic writer could write a companion guide it would be of great help. I would like to see how footnotes and the more obscure references have been explored by later experts and illustrations of the hieroglyphs and coats of arms. As he leans pretty heavily on precession of the equinoxes for dating certain traditions so some illustrations of sky and calendar would also be of great benefit. Perhaps a Wiki page could do this important work.When he deals with the feminine he is so modest that I sometimes miss the sexual symbols being discussed. When I realized his modesty I put more weight on those sentences to glean anything he was prevented from saying directly.I love how he refers to festivals and traditions of the British Isles that as far as I know are forgotten. There are english language references that are mostly lost. One word nark I thought was short for narcotics officer and thus meant snitch. My grandfather told me it is an old word that means quit. That school boys being teased or tickled would say \\"nark it!\\". Massey explores a similar etymology. The book is just packed with fascinating english traditions.His reasoning that human kind came out of Africa bears an order and consonance not available to modern linguists. He disputes the notion that sanskrit is source of european languages and that Africa with a focus on Egypt is. I am not qualified to vouch for him but my sentiment is that he is right.Where commonly we believe that language changes rapidly he argues that certain elements of language endure millennia. Listing off multiple languages he makes his case clear. I don't think his ideas ever became popular. I think it is because he leaves his readers something to research rather than a dogma to learn.This book is now one of my most cherished possessions."},{"Title":"A book of the beginnings","review":"I was so happy to know that truth.

It tells the story of Olympia Biddeford, the unusually erudite and well-educated fifteen year old daughter of a Boston Brahmin. One hot and steamy summer in turn of the century New Hampshire, she falls passionately and utterly in love with her father's friend, forty one year old John Haskell, a physician and man of letters, who has a wife and four children. She, captivated by his intelligence and his crusade on behalf of exploited mill workers, and he, drawn to her youth, intelligence and beauty, leave behind all thought of propriety. Breaking every moral and social taboo of the time, they enter into a forbidden, illicit love affair, which is ultimately doomed, with cataclysmic ramifications for all whom the affair touches.The book explores how this young woman copes with the loss of her life in a larger social milieu, once the affair enters into the public domain, through the machinations of another. She and the doctor, as well as their respective families, are tainted with scandal and presented with the fruit of that illicit love. The book explores how Olympia must reconstruct the tatters of her life into one in which she is finally able to expiate her youthful indiscretion within the context of the mores of the time. In doing so, she goes on a voyage of self-discovery. Yet, through it all, she never once renounces her devotion to the man who introduced her to the throes of a passion so deep and profound that she gave herself over to it, body and soul. How these star-crossed lovers finally come to terms with their grand passion is a story that the author seamlessly weaves into a book that will hold the reader in its thrall."},{"Title":"Olympia.","review":"I have read every book written by this author and only one would I not recoomend.But she truly is a gifdted writer.The novel was excellent-very good read."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Successful novelist Reilly Alexander has tried to move on and forget the past, but he's now back in Diablo Springs, Arizona, his hometown and the scene of all his troubles. Although he never planned on returning home, he is intrigued by the psychic claims of an eccentric woman and finds himself strangely drawn back to this place. Many believe Diablo Springs is haunted by its original settlers, but for Reilly the ghosts are much closer to home.Having left her hometown seventeen years ago, Gracie Beck is also unexpectedly called back to Diablo Springs after her daughter is in a mysterious car accident and her grandmother dies on the same night. She finds her daughter safe, and although she'd love to leave and never look back, her grandmother's hotel, now her responsibility, is full of paying guests. One of those guests turns out to be Reilly, a former high school crush which ended horribly wrong. Although there is bad blood between them, Reilly and Gracie are still attracted. Even if they can resolve the issues of their past, there are bigger troubles ahead. There is something sinister happening in this small town! Will the sins of the past haunt them forever? Can they break the curse of Diablo Springs and begin again?Combining contemporary and historical settings, Whispers is a well crafted paranormal romance. Ms. Grady knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat, scared out of your pants, and yet still wanting more! I found both Gracie and Reilly to be interesting people, but wished to learn more of their story. With numerous characters and interwoven plots, their romance was sometimes lost in the shuffle. I had a hard time accepting Gracie's forgiveness of Reilly, and their intimacy felt rushed. However, these are all minor issues and didn't ultimately get in the way of my enjoyment.

Whispers drew me in and I couldn't put the story down.CherylReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"I have been looking forward to reading \\"Whispers\\" since the day I turned the last page of \\"Echoes\\". After reading \\"Echoes\\" I wondered if Erin Grady was as gifted a writer as she appeared to be. Now the reviews are in. Grady has proven that she's the real thing and her readers are the true winners.I finished \\"Whispers\\" in just two nights. It was worth my sleep deprivation to finish this extraordinardy blend of historical fiction, paranormal romance, and modern suspense. Despite my aversion to the paranormal I found myself believing every beautifully written word of this tale. I was drawn the town of Diablo Springs and to the characters, past and present, that populated the skillfully interwoven stories of Ella and Gracie, Sawyer and Reilly, Athena and Chloe.My only regret is that I now have to wait for Grady's next book."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Wow, this was my first taste of Ms Grady, but definitly not my last. Whispers - A haunting tale of generational curses. Erin Grady presents her story in a unique way of telling the past tense in first person, and the present tense in third person. She weaves together a tale of lost love, steamy romance, and generational conflicts all with a supernatural twist. I love how she brought all her characters to life by her descriptive prose and modern analogies. I look forward to reading more by this author.Also recommended: Lisa Miscione, Carla Neggers, and Cynthia Gerard."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Ms Grady has a way with her characters that lets us into their hearts and souls. I felt connected to Gracie from the minute I met her and wanted her to triumph through the clouds of long ago betrayal, mystery and evil. I enjoyed the way the author joined the past and the present in a story that always had me wondering what the next page would bring to the women of Diablo Spring."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"The book was wonderful to read, well written. Full with mystical charm and with a science fiction flavor.Totally powerful and full with romance, drama and intrigue.Absolutely wonderful, a must read."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Gracie Beck's past is shrouded in mystery and painful memories.Reilly Alexander's past was one of torment, and its something he doesn't wish to remember.Both of them have one thing in common- they left Diablo Springs with no intention of ever going back.Until now ...But circumstances out of their control draw them back, and together they inadvertently unravel an ancient mystery, stifle a curse and find undying love.Erin Grady takes us on a journey where past and present collide, where Ghosts, Curses, and outside forces rule the lives of those from Diablo Springs without them knowing it.This book takes us on a chilling journey, which takes many twists and turns and will keep you guessing and turning pages!A wonderful read!!! I give this book **** stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To learn more about Erin Grady and her books, please go to: www.eringrady.com"},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Once again, we are taken by the expert hand of an award-winning storyteller who spins a tale of love, loss, betrayal and murder so intense it defies the obliteration of time and death. Erin Grady not only imbues WHISPERS with dynamic characters and parallel storylines that enrich each other but creates such a haunting setting with Diablo Springs, that the almost-ghost-town becomes a character in its own right-one that's vivid and unforgettable in its stark, dramatic and lonely portrayal that serves as the perfect backdrop to a riveting story of paranormal suspense."},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Lives in the past and present intersect in Diablo Springs. Gracie Beck has returned to solve a family mystery and curse, just as Reilly Alexander re-enters her life. Seventeen years have passed since they saw one another, and now, to break that old curse, the issues between them have to be settled. Long ago, two other lovers met a tragic end, and that fact has haunted Gracie's family ever since. Now, the time has come for that to be changed.** Seesawing back and forth between the two times and first and third person POV, this comes off as an uneven, disjointed effort. Reilly seems to be an interesting character, but is lost in a flat world. **Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"In Los Angeles elderly Chloe LaMonte came to writer Reilly Alexander's book signing to inform the former Badlands musician that she was his guide to his destiny. The next thing he knows she mentions Carolina Beck's spirit calling to her to bring Reilly home. In spite of being skeptical Reilly returns to his hometown, Diablo Springs, Arizona.In San Diego Eddie Rodriguez visits Gracie Beck. Since they have not seen one another in years Gracie is surprised, but Eddie tells her that her grandma has just died and that her high school honor student daughter Analise was in a car accident with a boy named Brendan in Diablo Springs, Gracie's hometown. Bewildered as well as upset Gracie goes home to find her daughter okay and that she has inherited the family owned Diablo Hotel and curse that she believes brought her and Analise here as it has haunted her relatives since 1890. Gracie plans to end the curse so it cannot harm Analise. When she and Reilly see one another for the first time in seventeen years even Analise can see the attraction between them.This is a terrific contemporary romance with mystery and paranormal spins that actually plays out on two parallel time lines with the present being the primary plot, but 1890 serving as a key subplot. The story line is character driven as the key cast members seem genuine including the psychic seemingly whispering with ghosts. Fans will treasure this strong tale that is a one sitting read to simply learn the link between today and yesterday and whether each era's lead couple survives the challenges.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Whispers (Berkley Sensation)","review":"Diablo Springs was once a boomtown of gamblers, outlaws and miners. It had become a tourist town at the turn of the century. Prior to that, it had been a place the Apaches had used for sacred ceremonies. First, the natural hot springs dried up, then so did the town. Now it was just shifting sands which whisper only of torment and loss. It's the place were Gracie was raised, but she never called it home. When she left that place, she never looked back.The book jacket warns: If you listen hard enough, you will hear their whispered warnings. Gracie was lured back when she inherited the Hotel form her grandmother Ella. There is a curse on that place which had haunted her family for a century. She uncovers secrets better left below the surface. She left because of a man, but now he too has returned. This is one of those hot romances like Rosemary Rogers used to write. At least, parts of it are very descriptive. Some things are just meant to be, irregardless of how they turn out. Sometimes, we have to face up to our demons and ghosts to get them out of our system."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"Anagarika Govinda's book The Way of the White Clouds is among the most beautiful travel books ever written. It gives a lyrical picture of Tibet before the destruction of virtually everything by the Chinese. Somewhat melodramatic in its descriptive power, Lama Govinda (1898-1985) and his Persian wife, Li Gotami, wrote, drew, and photographed unknown (and often abandoned) temples, met amazing people, and generally coursed in a mystical reverie during their time there. The reader is magically transported with them back to a time when no one in the West knew much, if anything, about Tibet, Tibetans, or its religion. That he might have got some details wrong isn't the point. This is a seminal work in its field (together with Marco Pallis and Alexandra David-Neel). Govinda's writing, and photographs are better than theirs, however."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"This book is a beautiful introduction to Tibetan culture and landscape and Buddhist beliefs and practices.

I've since bought the author's more recent book, \\"Buddhist Reflections.\\""},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"The author, Lama Anagarika Govinda, is an erudite and sophisticated buddhist who brings to life a land and a people who will hardly exist in their native Tibet much longer. For someone who wants to have a westenerexplain the history, geography, art ,etc. of the \\"roof of the world\\" prior to the Chinese genocide, this is a wonderful guide. Of course there is a terrific description of buddhism in general and the specfic variety practised in Tibet. However, this may not be the best place to start. At least a basic knowledge of Tibet would be helpful, otherwise one could get mired down in so many strange names and concepts."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"This is a wonderful insightful book on Tibet and Buddhism. It opened my mind even more to a different way of thinking and being."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"An exquisite chronicle. It is a story that combines journal, travel log, historical detail, and insights into the religious and spiritual landscape before the Chinese invasion. It is a a grand read. The clarity and integrity of the book also render it a valuable reference."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"Excellent read on pre-Chinese invasion of Tibet. A seeker and a studied dharma student writes of his journeys though Tibet when travel was by foot/horse and pack animals. His encounters with remarkable teachers and documentation of the monasteries are a thing of the past. This is a beautiful story written by a very gentle soul on the country/people and spirit of Tibet."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"This book is a classic. Glad to see it back in print. Last time I looked for a copy I had to buy a used one from Britain.In the Way of the White Clouds, Govinda tells about the ordeal, the excitement, the wonder of traveling through Tibet in the 30s. He found his Guru, had extraordinary experiences, lived through the extremes of Tibetan weather. He also talks about gtummo and lung-go-pa. The former is the ability lamas develop to dry wet sheets thrown over there bodies in the midst of winter and out in the elements. The latter tells about runners covering vast distances barely touching the ground as they bounce over the countryside.I sent this book to a friend for a birthday present. I haven't read it recently. But, it would be a treat for explorers of the outer and inner worlds, especially Buddhist ones."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"I have read many books on Tibet but this one provided new insights from an individual who had a unique vantage point on the country and its rich culture. I am grateful this book was written and remains in print!"},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"Kind of an autobiography, Govinda's recount his travels through Sikkim, Central and Western Tibet, relying heavily on Tibetan Buddhism teachings and traditions. Over half of the book deals with his spirituality and learning from his guru. There are 28 pages describing Kailash and the kora - absolutely excellent! He then travels to Tsaparang, describing his stay and the temples in 31 pages."},{"Title":"The Way of the White Clouds","review":"In my opinion, the book is good for readers who understand buddhism very well.There are so many hidden messages the author wanted to deliver to the readers.I have to read the book at the very slow pace in order to get his messages.For me, it's a good book because I can see Buddhism from the Tibetan point of view."},{"Title":"Dunaliella: Physiology, Biochemistry, and Biotechnology","review":"Dear sirI would like to read content of this bookregards"},{"Title":"Dunaliella: Physiology, Biochemistry, and Biotechnology","review":"Dear sirI would like to read content of this bookregards"},{"Title":"American Ancestors and Cousins of the Princess of Wales","review":"It should come as no surprise that the late Princess Diana had strong American connections through her Spencer heritage and Roberts skillfully outlines the most important and useful links among her estimated 20 million living American relatives.

She actually read it! She said it was a great read, very informative."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"I purchased this book for a 13 year old writer and was very disappointed. While the book may be useful for writers several years younger than her, much of what was covered in its pages is taught in late grade school and early middle school classrooms. Chapters that do hold potential--such as the one on revising--still fall short of what they could provide (particularly if your writer already revises and has others review his or her work). If you are at the point of trying to find guides and writing resources for a budding young writer, the child is probably already beyond most of what this book has to offer. If you are looking for an introduction to the very basics of dilogue, points of view, rising action, and character, this book is probably a good buy."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"Very good and informative, until the last chapter (getting published). It is so discouraging to think all the way when you are reading it \\"I can write, and maybe get a book published!\\" and then get put down. My personal view is that that chapter should be left out. But the other chapters are very good for a child grades 4-7."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"I've used Marion Dane Bauer's WHAT'S YOUR STORY? off and on for 20 years. I'm a children's author, but I've used this book as a classroom teacher, writing teacher, and a teacher of teachers. I have my own set of multiple copies. WHAT'S YOUR STORY is written clearly so intermediate and middle-school students can understand the concepts, but it also has enough material in it to appeal to older writers.My only complaint is that there should have been an updated version by now. If a publisher picked this up today, with the changes we've recently seen in the publishing field, and with so many young people using technology to get their books out there, they might be surprised at how well a new addition would do in the market. Hmmm... Maybe it's time for Marion to revise it and get it out there on her own!"},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"This is a good book to give you some basics and background information to help you get started on writing your book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"What's Your Story by Marion Bauer was written in 1992 and I liked it, thus proving that older guides can have voice and depth. Here's where perhaps I need to take a step back to recognize that those readers who prefer just the facts may find Bauer's personal examples intrusive. Moreover, those readers who seek out abridged books may find themselves annoyed by Bauer's conversational tone, which is broken up only with subheads and only every few pages. However, I like that she uses a light tone and spent a page defining story: \\"Let's try this definition. A story, any story, is about someone struggling....\\" In this same section, Bauer goes on to explain that her definition fits both short and long stories with the difference between stories lying in their complexity and of course length. I felt as if we were chatting, rather than her standing at a podium and giving me a lecture. How fun too that before she even got into the elements of writing, I'd grabbed a pencil and paper to write down all the ideas that were popping into my head from her serious and silly examples. I appreciated that while Bauer does talk about a formula for plot, she also elaborates to explain the reasons for each step and to offer ways to get unstuck at each step; she recognizes that writing is an art. When Bauer talks characters, she focuses on how to create interesting ones and even encouraged contradictions: \\"I am uncomfortable at big parties. Still, I can give a speech to a thousand people without feeling particularly nervous.... Your characters, especially your main character, need some element of contradiction built in too.\\" This proved more useful information to me than being told all the types of characters (protagonist, antagonist, etc.) that might appear in my story. Basically, I liked everything about this guide including the tips in the last few chapters on how to revise, accept criticism, and to polish for publication."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"Often the best way to get a quick overview on a nonfiction subject is to read a few books on that subject written for the middle grades audience. These books usually provide the basic information in an easy-to-grasp manner. \\"What's Your Story?\\" is no exception. It provides a quick and easy-to-grasp guide on how to write fiction. The chapters cover getting a story plan, choosing the best idea, developing characters, focusing your story, developing the plot, choosing point of view, dialogue, and tension. The advice in each chapter is so good and so well explained that, in addition to recommending this book for teens, I also recommend it for adults who want to write fiction. You can help yourself greatly by reading this book and putting the advice into practice."},{"Title":"What's your story?: A young person's guide to writing fiction","review":"so this book was helpful. The author does sound \\"pessimistic\\" that you may not be published, but I think she's just being realistic.

Recommended to me by a friend, I thought at first that it would be just another unoriginal Fantasy book. From the first page I knew that I was wrong. In this book a young woman's struggle to balance what she's been taught and what society has showed her becomes apperant. In this book women are magic, which makes them the warriors, bankers, etc., while the men are slaves or freedmen who have absolutely no rights. If any man touches a hair on a womans head, he could be executed or exiled. This young woman, Xylina, is an orphan who is too powerful for some people in high places to be comfortable. This book is a true gem for any Fantasy fan. 11 out of 10!!!"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This book has an inciting mix of fantasy and reality. Like most of Anthony's books the setting in this book is magical and a fantasy. But don't be fooled by its background, for this books has incorporated in it a serious subjects, including love, loss, and the controversial theme of inter-racial relationships. This has many levels and its easy to appreciate all of them with Anthony's once-you-pick-it-up-you-can't-put-it-down style of writing"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This was one of the best fantasy books i have read in a long time. If you like to read adventure with a little love atory you'll like this book. BEAUTIFUL"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This book is an interesting fantasy adventure but a little bit slow going at times. The young heroine survives many perils including a quest to retrieve a magic shard. This is really like two novels. It takes the first half of the book to create a situation which launches her on the quest, most of the second half to cover the quest, and has a short, after-the-quest ending which can be pretty much anticipated. The authors seem to be a little casual of disposing of various groups of men in the tale, and women would probably like the book better than men."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"That's a good way to discribe how the plot line and character developement went..this book held promise, especially after the reader has discovered Ware's true proposal, but unfortunately, his character begins to lag as soon as Xylina begins to pay attention to him..I was disappointed..he would have been a fun character to follow, with all of his humor and intruiging way of life but then, there's that whole sex thing..in fact, if you think about it, he is a creature who's existance is based entirely on sex, because he seases to exist as soon as someone with whom he's been with does the wild monkey dance with someone else..So, too bad.

Unfortunately, they got together and gave us a mediocre one.Characters do not stay in character. Major plot changes happen near the end of the story. The main character starts as a likable, full character and ends as a wooden, shallow shadow of her earlier self. In fact, most of the main characters start as far more complete individuals than they end as.At the middle of this book, I was almost breathless, wondering what would happen next. By the end, I was almost relieved it was over. It almost appeared that the authors lost interest in it about two-thirds of the way through and simply &quot;wrapped it up&quot; as quickly as possible.This wasn't a bad book. I've read far worse. Fans of either author will find parts of it that they enjoy. If this had been a first novel by a new author, I would not have been disappointed. Unfortunately, with the names Piers Anthony and Mercedes Lackey on the cover, I really expected more."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This 1994 collaboration came to me used, via a friend, which I read primarily because it was available when I needed a book in hand quickly (can't be caught without reading material, now can we?). Much as I like Mercedes Lackey, this is not a book I would have bought, due to the Piers Anthony influence. I found the characters superficial, with a cumbersome and contrived sexual situation, more typical of Anthony than Lackey. I have ceased reading Anthony over the years, feeling that he has been almost a caricature of himself and extremely formulaic. I was not too surprised to discover that Lackey developed an idea/outline of Anthony's, which he then edited and added 10,000 words. I suspect I know the pages he added: there's a lot of telling, not showing, of characters' thoughts and emotions. The world is not uninteresting, and might make an intriguing role-playing game, but that's not enough to carry the book. There's lots more good fantasy out there; pass this one by."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I first read this book when I was somewhere around eight or nine, and read it off and on again a half dozen times over the next several years. I loved it! You really get a feel for who the characters are, except for the Queen, whose main personality trait seems to be evil ambition. I've read several readers' comments on how helpless and out-of-it Xylina is, but come on guys, let's not forget the girl's barely sixteen! Girls this age are not supposed to have the leadership skills and street smarts of an experienced adult. Chill out, folks! What sophomore in high school would be able to manage her own finances, dodge a politician's murder attempts, operate her own home business, and then lead an expedition across several countries, and not make a few brainless mistakes? Personally I think these characteristics of Xylina show reality ... not a lack of talent on behalf of the authors. I also liked how clear they drew the descriptions of the surroundings, i.e., Ware's home, the forest, etc. A few bad points, though; Faro seemed to warm to Xylina much too quickly, going from raw hatred to pity and compassion in what, less than a day? I was also disappointed on how sterotypically gorgeous they had to make Xylina, even if she isn't considered &quot;pretty&quot; by society's standards in the book. Why must it all be about big-breasted blondes? People need to get out more! Nevertheless, it's a general fun book with interesting characters and imaginitive surroundings. This is one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I like Piers Anthony unactively, and Mercedes Lackey little at all (though I enjoyed her \\"Black Swan\\"), but this book was fun, entertaining, and a very in-depth fast read.I'm more of a pleasure-reader than anything -- if something makes me think and cry, I'll never read it again. If something makes me smile and laugh and daydream -- and still think in the meantime -- then it's entirely worth my time.I read to get away from the world -- and as a female, this book struck me as a terrific blend of girl-power, social issues, and romance. ^_^;; It's not as in-depth on the social issues as some more serious readers may like, it's not feminist in the sense that men are degraded, and it's not sickeningly sex-full.No, indeed, it's a terrific girl-book for readers that like something light and entertaining."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"When I first read this, I'd never heard of Piers Anthony. Later, when I reread it, I'd read a lot of his stuff. I usually enjoy both his work and Lackey's. This collaberation, however, was not that good a choice, however.The theme and setting for the book were great, as I expected (One star). The character development, while not wonderful, was still better than many books I've read (Another star). The plot was pretty decent (A third star). Until the end. The ending of the book was one of the biggest let-downs I've ever come accross. When I picked this book up to re-read it, I remembered that I didn't like it, but not why. 4/5 of the way though the book, I still hadn't figured out why I didn't like it the first time. Then, I hit the ending. And once again, I was let down.Considering the possibilites that this book has, I would have expected a better ending. But as it stands, it feels like someone wanted to tie a bow on the book, but was running out of space, so hurredly wrapped up all the loose ends in a great big anti-climax."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I love Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar and Piers Anthonys Xanth Series, but this book was not up to those standards. It started out all right in an interesting new setting, but even ideas that could have been breath taking suffered from the lack of personal involvement of me the reader of the book. Personally in retrorespect I think that those two authors are incompatible."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"As a huge fan of Mercedes Lackey, and a one-time fan of Piers Anthony, I was eager to read this collaboration. Having read and reread many of each authors work, I was easily able to pick out the lines where each had his or her say.Character development, I attribute to Lackey--when it did. Day to day concerns and worries, all of the little intangibles that make you believe in a character, I lay at her very accomplished feet.References to large breasts and a trip through a suspiciously Xanth-like forest, I lay to Anthony.Xylina is the protagonist of the story, a woman who just doesn't fit society's mold, which is fine. She alternates between being just a person (obviously Lackey's doing) and a helpless, idiotic bimbette (Anthony).Ware is probably the most potentially interesting character, because of what he is and how he deals with it, but the character just withered away after he acchieved his goal.All in all, I enjoyed this book, but that is only because of Lackey's mitigating effects on Anthony's bombastic writing. I may have cut my reading teeth on Anthony when I was nine, but I outgrew him but the time I was fourteen, Lackey, however, I can still look forward to."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"Guess I'm a minority here as well, I recently pulled the book down for my 4th or 5th read through, I can't remember exactly when I first bought it but it's been years. I know nothing about either author, so can't judge this against their other works. I just know I really like this book, yeah maybe storyline isn't perfect but it's a fast and enjoyable read for me and after so many times it's like visiting old friends. It is probably a bit on the light side but not all books have to be \\"Lord of the Rings\\" depth. Wish I was better with words so I could defend the book from the more articulate negative reviews. I would recommend this book to people looking for a fast, enjoyable but not to deep fantasy tale."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This book was recommended to me by someone who saw I liked Wen Spencer's A Brother's Price, as having a similar setting. In Spencer's fantasy novel women lead the society, women are the soldiers and farmers, it is matrifocal, while men raise the children. Men are rare and highly valued, as a result. Spencer's book is light and fun and the oldest brother, who is about ready to be married off, has adventures. READ THAT BOOK!!!This one one has a 16 year old girl Xylina, a magic user as the narrator. Faro (or Ware)would have been better choices. It's better storytelling to read the POV of the underdog than the Alpha Dog. Especially when the Alpha Dog whines as much as this one does. And goes through nonsensical changes."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I thought Anthony went down hill with the Fractal mode books and here he puts it into overdrive. Perhaps the authors have too different of styles. Perhaps the first part is too whiny. Perhaps the second part is too boring. But it all adds up to a waste of time and effort."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I have read several books by both authors, and have enjoyed their fare. I love Ms. Lackey's Elemental Masters series and Mr. Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, and this book is a decent collaborative effort between the two. It's not the best that either of them have written, but is still a fun and decent read, I rate it at 3.5/5 stars (too bad you can't give half-stars when you're asked to choose how many stars)The premise is entertaining, and this society certainly is interesting, but I found the idea of other societies with different rules to be a bit out of place here, due to the magical rules, which just felt conflicting and contrived to me. If the rules of this world had been tweaked a bit and more better thought out, the story would have been more believable. If you like Piers Anthony or Mercedes Lackey, you may enjoy this book - just don't have *grand* expectations."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I read this for the first time almost fifteen years ago, when I was a teenager, and it is one of my favorite books. Everytime I pull it down to reread, I still like it. I'm not sure if that's nostalga, or something else, but I really love the creative fantasy in this book. I love the quest - the changing landscape as they travel. I loved the beginning when the character was helpless, and the end, where she found power.The only thing I disliked, in fact, was the love story aspect. When I first read the book, I thought Faro would be the love interest. Then when someone else becomes her object of affection, I thought she would still come back to Faro in the end. I was disappointed.Reading the book again, a few years later, I felt differently. I saw that Faro held no romantic interest for her, and also saw other aspects in a more mature light. I really liked the book. I see similarities to Anthony's Fractual Mode books, which I liked as a teenager. As far as Lackey goes, my favorite book of hers is Elvenbane, (also something I read as a teen).As an adult, I'm not a huge fan of Lackey or Anthony, so I definately recommend this to their younger fans. I've spoken to several people who have outgrown their work, but going back to reread things I liked when I was younger is still enjoyable to me."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. I enjoyed this book. Of course, I was seventeen when I read it, but I enjoyed it. Having read both Anthony and Lackey and not really enjoying either author consistently, this book came as a surprise. I could easily recognize both Anthony's &quot;punny&quot; sense of humor and Lackey's tendency towards either big/dumb/brawny or gifted/gay/enslaved male characters. That the demon Ware was really neither charmed me. Although there were some plot discrepancies, and the ending left much to be desired, I enjoyed this book. But be warned: there isn't much character development here. Xylina goes from being the original Gabrielle to Xena right back to the original Gabrielle at the end of the book. Ware in essence doesn't change, and Faro stays the same obedience-of-a-well-trained-dog slave. Like I said, it was an enjoyable read-when I was seventeen and less discerning."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"Two of my favorite authors have teamed up to do it again. Onceagain Anthony and Lackey write a book of fantastic worlds with astrong female lead that has a sense of morals. This sense of morals is what helps set the book ahead as the lead finds herself in a major problem with great sub plots. Don't miss the puns from Anthony, they help spice the book up."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"So, I read the back of a potentially good book co-written by an author I was fond of (Until I read Fractal Mode, anyway). Great! Then I read it. It started off so well. Descriptive and successful at portraying a different society, a different world. The Demon was even interesting to me as a part of the plot, until the relationships went into this odd three-way. Stupid plot twist, just irritating. Couldn't they make up their minds? What's it got to do with the story? But that's not why I didn't like the book. By the time it GOT to that plot point, I was already bored and completely unsympathetic with the characters. Don't waste your time, just go read Dune again, but if you have to have sex, Piers Anthony goes out of his way to have nubile pre-teens go after it with adult men. Guy's got problems."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I am a Misty fan from way back and a Piers fan from even further back. This book was ok, since I bought it used. If I had paid full price I would have been disappointed. The plot starts out good, but then just gets silly. And it is obvious which writer has hold of the pen. It feels like reading several different versions of the same tale instead of one. Overall, if you are familiar with the work of either of these two you might be disappointed."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This book by two well-known fantasy writers is a light, fun read. Anthony's moralistic touch (not to mention his puns) are evident throughout the book. At times, I found the book a little too didactic, but the plot twists were surprising and unexpected, especially the very last"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I'm not an avid reader, I must be very interested in the book I'm reading... and this book is a winner. I'm a fan of Mercedes Lackey and Piers Anthony... and this book is so great considering it's a collaberation of the two. I hope to find more books like this in the future."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"This book kept me on my toes. It, as usual, is a terrific book and I hope there will be more as a series. I seem to be one of the only Anthony fans at my school. (I'm in high school) I found myself in Xylina's shoes, having traveled in them countless times before. I get caught in the spells and wonder if something of the like happened here so long ago. I look forward to my next chance of reading a Piers Anthony book not already read by me. I am a read aholic and have read almost all possible books in the house. This was a treat to read and the next ( if there is one) should surpass all the past boundaries set by this terrific book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"Although I thought the beginning was interesting and even wrenching at times, with a refreshing new idea for a setting and story line, the middle and end were vastly dissapointing. I think Ms. Lackey can do bettter than this writing even in collaboration with other writers such as in &quot;Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright&quot; but this book was such a huge dissapointment that I could not even stand to keep it on my shelf"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I like this book very much but it was obvious to me that the two authors have very different styles. Mercedes Lackey is the one to write a tale that is true to Pier's original _Arabian Nights_ source. She understands desire and its physical and spiritual interactions on many complex levels (she reminds me of Anais Nin...very real and very profound). Piers understands romance and conventional heterosexual relationships. I read his novels when I want simplicity and hopeful positive feelings. I think his style is what slowed down this particular book. I wish there were a sequel written entirely by Mercedes Lackey that deals with the tri-being relationship, the shard and the babies that will result from that relationship! and that Piers Anthony would write another great Xanth novel ..oh with maybe Electra on a quest where she gets to be an adult for a change."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I'm not a big fan of collaborations - they never seem to be as good as what either author can do by him/herself. And this book is no exception. I've seen much better from both Lackey and Anthony. OK, I agree, I have read much worse fantasy than this, but I expected better from authors of their caliber. I also found Anthony's Author's Note particularly obnoxious - he describes how he basically had Lackey write a book on his idea, then finished it off by adding a beginning and ending and polishing it to his usual standards. But it's NOT up to his usual standards. Stick with either author by him/herself, you'll enjoy the reading a lot more."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"If I Pay Thee Not In Gold by dynamic authors Piers Anthony and Mercedes Lackey is a wonderful read with many well formed characters and a storyline that will keep you reading. I have read some other reviews and have not found as much support as this book merits. Although this book is just shy of the normal structure of the average fantasy book, it makes up for it by taking the reader through a spectrum of emotions with the help of rounded characters and inspired wording. I have read and re-read this book many times and have not found it to be lacking in storyline or enjoyability. For any fans of the authors this book is a must read. You wont regret it."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"Since this is my &quot;maiden voyage&quot; with the Anthony-Lackey collaboration, I will not bash the authors. I will say that I have read better. That's why I did not give it 5 stars.I really got turned off by Xylina's &quot;poor pitiful me&quot; attitude both before her woman-trial and afterwards, I mean her constant whining about how life dealt her a terrible blow was sickening to say the least.Ware never faced any true consequences for playing both sides of the fence, first as the Queen's agent at court then as Xylina's advisor-lover. She could have destroyed him by kissing the Prince in the cave, but his advice was invaluable to her. Even her slave, Faro seemed to have more horse sense than Xylina.Queen Adria grossly overplayed her hand as queen by breaking the rules she set aside for her people by mercilessly attacking Xylina burning her home and sending those thugs after Faro. She realized after Xylina's woman-trial, that she had some serious competition for the throne. By sending Xylina off to retrieve the shard and guaranteeing her debt, the queen thought the girl would either die trying to attain her goal or naively turn over the shard. This is where I have to give Ware and Faro credit for having the horse sense that they had. Queen Adria was already a tyrant in search of more power. Having the shard would make all those guarantees null and void, costing Xylina her life anyway. Like I said, kill or be killed. Also, the queen underestimated how battle-hardened Xylina would get on this quest. Again my hat goes off to Ware, Faro, and Xantippe for their forsight.One thing that bothered me was that, of the thirty men that Xylina took on this quest for the shard, only one man and a dog perished before they had to fight the spiders in the fourth realm and face the sorcerists storm, which gave Xylina and Pattee a severe headache. I'm sorry to say this, but that was an obvious plot-hole to me. After the challenge was over, I had expected Faro to want his freedom at least.Xylina did have enough sense to realize that the shard would eventually corrupt her as Queen Adria had been. By returning to her home, and resuming the role as queen, the shard would be too close to the main part of the crystal jeopardizing her life and those of her people. If it were joined, changes would occur in all magic realms.I was looking for something different and that's what I got. Even though I expected a lot more out of these two authors in plot and development, I am not deterred from exploring more from these authors seperately."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"While this book started out promising it managed to lower my high esteem of the two authors by a notch. The book takes place in a world where women rule through illusion. One of the women risks everything for a man. The book has the makings of a intriguing story, with both inner and outer conflict. Unfourtunatly everything ends suddenly with an unsatisfactory plop. It appears that the authors became tired of their project and so wrapped it up quickly hoping the reader wouldn't notice."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"If it were possible to give this book three and a half stars, this is probably what I'd do.Piers Anthony and Mercedes Lackey are two of my favorite authors. Many of Lackey's books grace my shelves, and I was a big reader of Anthony's Xanth series for years. This seemed to be a match made in heaven, and I was quite eager to read it.First off, whoever wrote the summary on the back of the book needs to be fired. It makes it sound like a humorous feminist fantasy romp and only covers the first 30 pages of the book's plot. Lackey has had this problem before, so I don't know if this is a problem at Baen books or something else.Overall, I like this book. It paints a vivid picture of the matriarchal society of Mazonia, its customs, architecture, laws, and rules, as well as the lands outside it. Our heroine, Xylina, is put through the wringer in several of the great classic plots. The first half of the book has woman versus herself and woman versus woman, while the second half contains a classic quest and a woman against the outside world plot.In the first half, we are introduced to Xylina, a sixteen-year-old woman in the magical fantasy society of Mazonia. Here, women rule by the power of their magical conjurations, and all men are slaves. In order to become a citizen, a woman must fight a man in the arena, usually to the death, using her magic. This is where we pick up the tale, with Xylina, poor and alone, about to embark upon this savage rite of passage.From there, Xylina and the slave Faro (her arena opponent she both defeated and spared) must contend with trying to struggle to prosperity amidst the rumors of her family curse and violent attacks against her. In a culmination of trying to save herself from bankruptcy and exile, the demon Ware steps in with a peculiar proposition that eventually propels her on a quest across the face of her world to find a powerful magical artifact.The second half of the book, the quest half, shows some really lovely originality in how this fantasy world works. Instead of just walking from one land to the next, barriers of mist separate each land from the next, and the transition can be startling. You can be in the plains on one side of the barrier, and by the sea the next. And where the realms are in relation to each other can apparently change frequently. You may go through one realm, only to turn back and discover there's a whole new place behind you. The descriptions of the strange places of wild magic are delightful and original, as is the character's easy acceptance with such a bizarre kind of geography.Xylina's growth from uncertain girl to more mature woman is fairly well done, as is her growth into love during her quest. The two halves of the book allow for easy growth in these two different areas. The quest half was ideal for allowing her to discover love, being out of the constraints of her own society. A very nice touch there.There were several things that bugged me about the book though. I think this is both a consequence of there being two authors, and a very sloppy editing process. For example, in one place Xylina conjures water, and \\"made sure it was icy, not hot.\\" Later, it is specifically spelled out that she can only conjure things at their ambient temperature. The laws governing ex-arena slave Faro seem inconsistent. At first they say if Xylina dies, Faro will be executed, unless he had been sold or traded. But in several cases, it Xylina despairs that she cannot run or take the easy way out without Faro dying, conveniently forgetting about being able to sell him to keep him from her own fate.Another time is where she encounters a man outside Mazonia, one who had never been a slave. It's been clear, from the given descriptions of Xylina's childhood, that her mother (whom she idolized) never treated her slaves poorly. Xylina herself never seems to perceive slaves as faceless individuals, and aside from self-defense, never harms or slights a slave. Yet when she meets a man who meets her gaze squarely (something she had been encouraging in the slaves around her during her quest) she had to stifle an automatic impulse to punish him for insolence.Excuse me? When have we ever seen Xylina punish anyone for insolence? By the given standards of Mazonia, and her friendship with her slave Faro, all the slaves around her should be equally as guilty of such \\"insolent\\" behavior. All this does is set up an extra edge of tension in an already awkward situation.A fourth example is with a character called Patt&eacute;e, a foreign woman who acts as a camp servant and follower to the men on Xylina's quest. When first introduced, it's said specifically that she cannot talk. (\\"Only in animal sounds.\\") Later, she makes a perfectly intelligible comment to Xylina regarding one of the disasters on the trip.This kind of contradictions, clearly one of the hazards of having two people write the same book, should have been caught before sending the book to print. While some of it was apparently a disagreement about how magic works in this world, others was for plot purposes that can only be laid at the feet of the authors.I think this is an interesting and unique book unfortunately flawed by its very birth as a duel-authored story. That and the editor needed more time to go over it properly. People, don't be intimidated by the author even if he/she is one of your big sellers. If you think they're full of bull honkey, please don't be afraid to say so!Give this book a read, as I think it a great piece of escapist fantasy despite some problems."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"A huge fan of Misty's books, I snatched this one off the shelf when I saw it. I was disappointed, though. _If I Pay Thee_ is definitley not up to the standard that I've come to expect from Ms. Lackey or Mr. Anthony. It began good, with a refreshing setting that could have really gone somewhere. But, it didn't. The characters were underdeveloped and resisted the reader's sympathy, and the storyline was sluggish. I keep my faith in Misty's books, though. This was definitley out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I know a lot of people criticize this novel but I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it as a nice break from long series and serious reading. I first read it in High School and loved it then. I lost my copy in college some time ago, and in recent times found myself wanting to read it again, so went hunting a copy online. The story is light, and characters likable, and the setting interesting. It's no Game of Thrones or Black Jewels trilogy but it's fun and light."},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"I wouldn't say this is an instant classic or even one of the top books of the genre, but for what it is, it is definitely entertaining, thoughtful, and on rare occasion even provocative. Like one reviewer said, if you're a fan of either of them, get it. This is more on the line of Anthony's more serious works (On a Pale Horse, Isle of Woman, etc) and it isn't a bubbly read like his well known Xanth series. It is, however, quite easy to follow and understand without being childish, and it's good in that aspect for an average 10 or 11 year old to a senior citizen! The somewhat mature themes would be good for a somewhat mature 13 year old and I'd also be bold enough to say this book would be good reading for any boy who's just beginning puberty and starting to notice women as more than friends, just as a reminder that all people can share all qualities, masculine and feminine. Skim the book first as you should do with all content you give to an early teen and younger, and if your child requires guidance read it along with them! I'd imagine that anyone, young to old, who was interested in the study, practical application, and possible array of diversity of gender roles (including some vague transgender issues) would be interested in reading this. Also, the phenomenon of culture clash is touched on somewhat in this book. I have a social sciences background and I found it interesting to look at it through many different lenses. It's easy to see how cultural relativism can dead end when you're allowing all cultures (not just the weaker ones) to do what suits them! Lastly, anyone who just enjoys pulp fantasy would probably enjoy this. It's certainly more intelligent than a lot of pulp fantasy I've had the (mis)fortune of reading.Please excuse my rambling! I saw this book talked badly of on Amazon and I wanted to see it get the good credit it justly deserves! Mercedes Lackey and Piers Anthony both did excellent jobs on this!"},{"Title":"IF I PAY THEE NOT IN GOLD","review":"the book was in good condition as advertised. and the story was even better than i remember. thank you."},{"Title":"What is Creativity?","review":"This audiobook consists of four selections on creativity drawn from different authors. The tone is academic, so a good bit of concentration is required by the listener. Overall, I found the presentations interesting, but the content isn't integrated across the four selections and much of it is speculative.Perhaps the take-home message is that, despite considerable academic research, creativity remains largely mysterious but not completely impenetrable. Beyond that, I didn't come away from this audiobook with a lot of clear insights, so I'm tempted to give it 3 stars, but I'll go with 4 stars since I know of no other comparable resources in audio format.I can recommend this audiobook to people who have a strong interest in creativity and are looking for an academic treatment in audio format. However, I think that comprehensive and cohesive books on the topic are generally a better choice."},{"Title":"What is Creativity?","review":"What is creativity? I owe an apology to Audio Scholar for my first review. I should have finished listening to the whole whole audio novel before saying anything the whole work. My first review only pertains to essay 1 on tape 1. After abandoning the first tape because of unpredicted content I continued with tape 2 and was pleasently surprised with an engaging discussion on the philisophical nature of creativity and the human condition. One of my favorite readers, Jeff Riggenbach, read the last of the four essays. I would still like the audio book redeveloped to have more emphasis like the content contained in essay's 3 and 4.

In short it needs to be redevloped to be somewhat more creatively entertaining. When I purchased this audio book I thought I was going to be getting an imaginative fun philosiphical look at the human condition for being able to be creative. What I received was a series of four essays which sounded like they were read by a robot. Too analytical and definitely NOT VERY CREATIVE or interesting. (Special note I've only made it through the first one.) By looking at the copy right date its easy to tell that this is one of Audio Scholars first audio novels so I can't be too critical. They're later ones are much much better especially, T-Rex and the Crater of Doom, which takes a palentology scientific discovery and turns into a really fun adventure of science and discovery. I would really like to see this particular product redeveloped into a fun imaginative philosiphical look at the human condition for being able to be creative, similar to the T-Rex mention above. Leave the analytical discussions of paintings out as they are too specific and I found them oh so boring. It's alright to create an audio lecture on the history of art, but that's the history of art and not creativity and the human condition per say. I would tell listeners to avoid this audio novel and wait for it to be redeveloped properly.

The Princeton series, for those not familiar with it, is the definitive edition of the writings, with exhaustively researched texts and detailed textual introductions and notes, in this case for each of the essays included in this volume. \\"Excursions\\" is a welcome addition to the series.

Robert senior struggles to bring the estate back to financial health after it was run into the ground by his mother's notorious lover, Owain Bryn-Davies. Robert is raised with distant cousin Ginevra (Ginette) and the two maintain a strong bond of friendship that eventually blossoms into love - at least for Robert although he must wait until he's old enough to declare his feelings - but *something* happens that sends his plans spiraling and Ginette suddenly elopes with another man. The pair eventually meet again years later when Ginette is widowed, but can their love and friendship overcome the horrible secret that caused Ginette to flee Oxmoon in the first place?The story continues with that of Robert's younger brother John, the stalwart of the family who always does the \\"done\\" thing - that is until the just-barely-widowed John meets the very married and terribly unsuitable (common!) Bronwen and falls head over heels in love. Even when she is free Bronwen is not a suitable wife for John and he marries another heiress instead. Will he make a choice for true happiness or continue doing the \\"done thing\\"? The last third of the book carries to the next generation with the conflicts between cousins Christopher (Kester) and Harry. Kester is Robert's son and heir to Oxmoon, but John's son Harry thinks John should have been the heir and the battle between the two cousins eventually ignites with deadly consequences. The very last section is Hal's story (Harry's son) as he returns to Oxmoon to try to find out what really happened between the two at their final confrontation on The Worm's Head (do Google that and look at the photos - awesome).Of course there's a whole lot more to the story than that but I am not into book reports. I found this to be a grand ride taking me from the early 1900's on through the 1960's, and Howatch's method of using alternating narratives of the main characters is awesome (PG and Weir you should take lessons from her). I loved seeing the relationship between Robert and Ginette from both perspectives, and I adored John's story as he struggles to do the right thing even when his heart is pulled into another direction. As for the stormy love-hate relationship between Kester and Harry - wow, just wow. The very last with Hal I didn't care for as much and I almost wished Howatch had left off after Harry's story, but she ended up pulling a couple of excellent twists that I was not expecting.One final note and that is the twist on this book, is that the Godwin's story parallels that of England's Plantagenets - Edward III, Edward The Black Prince, Joan the Fair Maid of Kent, John of Gaunt (yes, there is a Katherine), Richard II, Henry Bolingbroke (Henry IV) and Henry V. For readers who like bit fat meaty sagas with a healthy dose of soap opera angst and anguish this just might be the book for you. 5/5 stars and highly recommended along with her two books that precede this, Penmarric and Cashelmara."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"This book had so much depth. Susan Howatch kept you spinning. Each chapter, you would get a different viewpoint of a different character that was completely believable. It gave you the impression that you weren't reading a book but you were living in a three dimensional world. Each of them, as well, had a moral dilemma, and each of them was strong in their own way. They were solid, real people, and more than that, they were people that you could like. Anyways, my favorite character was Harry."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Astonishing! At over 1100 pages long, I couldn't put thisnovel down. The many characters all were mesmerizing.

Her device of using theGodwin family as a parallel to a past Royal family is simplyingenius.

Truly mesmerizing...I love the way Ms. Howatch tends to write from many character's points of view and her transitions are brilliance! She takes the climatic situation and just as the main character is stunned into silence the next phase begins at just that point with the newest lead taking over. Imagine knowing what everybody is thinking all the time! That's what you realize at the end of the book, you knew what everyone thought of each situation! I cannot praise this one enough! Just Read it!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I have read this book over 15 times over the last 10 yeas and am on my 6th copy. It is familiar and yet always better. Robert comes to us a pompous chauvenist yet you begin to sympathize with his steeley yet romantic nature. I think Julie hit that when explaining to Kester the true essance of his parents' struggle. Gnevra was the type of woman whom I loved with her scheming to hide things from Robert and her down to earth attitude in realizing her short comings. The way Ms.Howatch wrote the incredibly complex nature of the relationship between Harry and Kester was brilliant. And the downfall of Harry made me feel for him. Margaret was an old battleaxe but she was softened once the history of her life was revealed. John was complicated and pompous but redeemed by his inner self once he allowe it to show and he became a quiet hero trying to do the right thing after he realized his ways. But the best character for me was Bronwen. Struggling hard to fit into a society that was not about to let her in.(I, as an Ameircan engaged to a Hindu straight from India could absolutely relate) Overall this was the most entertaining and turn the page book I have read out of thousands. You really do not want it to end, even after 1171 pages. I missed them all This shoud be turned into mini-series wtih each character narrating certian parts describing theirthougts along with thier performances. Maybe I could play Bronwen! I have also read almost all of her other books and each was brilliant also. But this one stands out as the bets for me.Thanks Susan!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"The muse of sheer genius must've inspired this book. Howatch re-created the John of Gaunt/Katherine Swynford Era so wonderfully, but transported it to the early 20th century so believably! Wheel of Fortune is absorbing, touching, as interesting as a detective story -- a thoroughly excellent novel. And, as do all memorable novels, this book has that &#34;certain something,&#34; which makes memorable novels...memorable. I imagine I'll remember it for awhile, and long to re-read it -- and almost certainly will. Wheel of Fortune rekindled my interest in Howatch's novels, so I'm musing over the next one I'd like to tackle. And one most definitely does tackle Howatch's books -- or the books tackle the reader. Either way, Wheel of Fortune is a truly breath-taking family saga that will leave the reader sated, but with that all-too-familiar, mournful...&#34;That's it? I want more!&#34; feeling when the last page pops into view."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Susan Howatch published several family sagas during the seventies and eighties when sweeping popular epics such as the Thorn Birds and The Shell Seekers were all the rage, but Wheel of Fortune rises above the genre with its character portraits, depth of analysis and shifting, multifaceted narrative that gives different points of view on the same situation while simultaneously moving the narrative forward.Oxmoon is the grand manor house of the Godwin family, tucked in a beautiful if remote corner of Wales and the family fortunes have risen and fallen and risen again over the centuries. Oxmoon is the desire of all of the children of Robert Godwin, but only the eldest son can inherit and this causes friction in each generation. The curse of history also comes calling in this tiny corner of Wales in the form of WWI, WWII, mechanization and industrialization and women's rights to name a few. Indeed, Wheel of Fortune is a study not only of a family and its dynamics, but of this history of the twentieth century on individuals. Wheel of Fortune follows five generations of Godwins as they navigate love, family strife, family secrets and dysfunction, ambition, greed, compassion and every possible human emotion and situation. Howatch astonishes with her gift of making every character's motives understandable, genuine and human, even when they aren't admirable. Another thing that endeared the book to me was Howatch's treatment of family secrets and their effects on subsequent generations, even secrets not known or only partially understood. I have often thought that we carry the burdens of our forbears whether we completely understand the situation or not and Howatch agrees with me and better yet, shows this theory in action over several generations. It is a masterful performance.I consider Wheel of Fortune to be Howatch's best stand alone novel. The Starbridge series is considered her masterpiece, but that is nine linked novels and Howatch has the tendency to degenerate into melodrama from time to time over the course of that series. In Wheel of Fortune Howatch has her considerable plotting and characterization skills perfectly in her control. There is always something interesting happening, but the narrative never shifts into the realm of the unbelievable. For students of human nature and lovers of a good story, Wheel of Fortune has it all: characters, plot, writing and setting. Don't dismiss it as a product of its time or the dictates of past literary fashion, Wheel of Fortune stands the test of time and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I love Susan Howatch's writing, and this one is no disappointment. I love the way she tells the story from different characters' viewpoints, giving you different views of the plot itself."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"This was a fun read. Enjoyed the story but had some problems with a couple of things:1. My Gawd... I was so distracted in the chapters of Kester and Harry with the overused phrase of \\"to do the done thing\\". I was sick of reading it. Howatch could have reduced them in half and it would still have been too much.2. I skipped right through the last chapter \\" Hal\\". It got a little boring. As far as I was concerned, the story ended with \\"Harry\\".But all in all a good read."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"This novel was the Absolute Best! It was so packed with Emotion and Passion that I was hopelessly addicted to it. I loved Ginevra and Kester the best though. Howatch writes a suspenseful intricate story of the most Fascinating Family Ever! This was just so complex and deep and emotional that I cried throughout it, and I cried when it was finished. I just wanted it to go on and on...."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"As you'll see below from the many positive reviews, they don't publish fiction like this anymore. If you're in search of one of the finest sagas of recent years, this book is full of every emotion, plot line and fight you could think of, and frankly, there is no finer novel on this green earth. Kudos to Ms. Howatch. I hope to see you around again very soon (the Church series is equally wonderful)! I've been a devoted reader of Ms. Howatch since the early 70s (when she wrote those wonderfully wicked romatic suspense novels). Hope she'll get back to the days of the multi-character single novels (six books at $16-25 each gets a bit costly...)."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I first read this book when I was 14 and I have read it more than 10 times since then. I am actually reading it again as I write this. Susan's wonderful use of adjectives and descriptive writing is exeptional. The plot is intensely intriguing....this book is just unputdownable. You have to read it to believe it. Thanks for another classic Susan!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I just finished this book last night, and all I can say is, Wow! I loved the complexities of the plot(s), the development of the characters, the English/Welsh setting, and, most importantly, the multiple viewpoints, which gave the book so much depth. The fact that it's based on an historical premise makes Susan Howatch's achievement even more impressive. This is the first book of hers I've read aside from the Church of England series, and I was a little nervous because everyone says that series is her best work, but I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I'm still reeling!"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Ms. Howatch's style of writing through the voices of her main characters is very effective. It could be a disasterous for a less able writer. Her stories are intricate without being impossible to follow. They are not predictable--I'm always a little surprised at the endings. The only predictable thing is a message of hope. Howatch's stories plumb the depths of human fraility and emotion without leaving the reader feeling that life is hopeless in the end. This is the 10th novel of Ms. Howatch's that I have read. I intend to read them all."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I have been reading Howatch lately, enjoying some old friends and finding new ones. The lady can really, really write. I particularly enjoy her writing different sections of the book from the perspective of different key characters, which truly helps to define and to illuminate the character. \\"The Wheel of Fortune\\" may be my favorite. I never felt the tedium that some of her other novels (notably the Church of England series) produced. This is a satisfying book for a reader starved for literature."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Wheel of Fortune is an enjoyable read. I was aware of pretty much of the books condition, it had wear afor a book that isnd tear to the front cover, I did not think the cover would be a little bit torn, but not bad for a book that is almost twenty six years old. The seller sent the product on a very timely fashion. Would do business with them again."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"My podiatrist saw me reading a long book that takes place in England, so he assumed I would like this one and loaned it to me. I was reading Dickens' \\"Bleak House\\". This book pales in comparison.I have two reasons for calling it a soap opera. First, there sure is an awful lot of messed up people! Nobody is normal in any way. Everybody is having sex with people they're not supposed to, falling in love with the wrong person, dying suddenly and dramatically by murder or just keeling over. (I've been waiting for the coma scene, but so far there is just a character suffering tragically from MS.) Everybody is totally upset and confused over something all the time. Just when you think something good has happened to a character, like a marriage, it turns instantly dramatic and traumatic.My second reason for calling it a soap opera is the way the characters are handled. I have spent only about 5 hours in my life watching soap operas, but it seems like this is the way they operate - you want to stop reading/watching right after this one thing gets resolved. But of course by that time there are a few other things brewing in the kettle of their miserable lives and it makes you stay on longer.A confession: I read everything up through the second section (page 271). Then I skimmed through until about page 450. So I almost made it halfway through. Many of the other reviewers liked the way everything gets wrapped up in the end, which is why I tried to wade through it. I can count on one hand the number of books I've left unfinished, but I was frankly bored and sick of everybody's heads reeling with confusion and horror. The word \\"horror\\" was probably used about 100 times by page 450.If you like soap operas, you'll like this book. It's not terribly written, but it's not a masterpiece either like Dreiser or Dickens or Galsworthy or even Jane Austen. All of those could be labeled \\"soap operas\\" because of the emotional drama, too, but they are so much better. If you prefer extremely well written literature where every sentence begs to be lingered over, you might not like this book."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"In Penmarric, Susan Howatch mirrors the lives of King Henry II, Eleanor of Acquitaine and their sons.

Does The Wheel of Fortune reflect a historical family? If so, which one?

And if I had to choose a favourite Susan Howatch novel, it would have to be the Wheel of Fortune. This sumptuous novel drew me in from the very first page and soon I was lost in richness, following the drama of the Godwin family and living their lives with them in their fabulous Welsh estate, Oxmoon.As in all of the Howatch family sagas which precede it, The Wheel of Fortune is written through a multiple third-person perspective, a structure which Howatch has mastered to perfection. Thus she leads us through the story by allowing us to identify first with one character and then with another, each time forcing us to rectify the opinions we have already formed on each indivual in turn. It's as if we move around each character, seeing him or her from a multitude of aspects, from the inside and the outside, and thus gain insight into the whole personality.While reading Howatch I often felt that this is perhaps her way of showing her readers the necessity for compassion and understanding in our lives, for she whips away our prejudices and preconceptions about her characters simply by switching perspectives. For me this happened in the Wheel of Fortune with the character of Kester, who first appears as a thoroughly unlikeable, spoiled child, a misfit who never failed to exasperate those around him - and of course the reader. The moment Kester himself was allowed to speak, however, and I saw the situation through his viewpoint, he became my favourite character and I could identify with him completely, and appreciate him as the creative genius he is.Then there is Robert Godwin, the personification of male chauvinism, an uptight London barrister who takes leave of all his senses when he falls for his cousin Ginevra. Ginevra herself is at first rather silly and self-absorbed, but as she grows in depth and self-esteem she develops into a warm, strong, well-rounded personality and a driving force in the novel. John Godwin is the epitome of good upbringing: his motto is &quot;Here I have my standards, and here I draw the line!&quot;; but then he meets Bronwen, a lower class Welshwoman who embodies the passion and mysticism that is simmering just beneath the surface of John's own consciousness, and John throws caution to the wind. Finally there is Harry, Kester's nemesis and greatest rival, the perfect public school boy . It's the rivalry between Kester and Harry, both of whom seem to mirror each other, each one having what the other most desires, rising and sinking on opposite sides of the Wheel of Fortune, which provides the foundation for this wonderful story.Last but not least there is Oxmoon itself, their home; fabulous, haunting, living, Oxmoon: the orchestra playing the Blue Danube in its grand hall while the dancers dance beneath the glittering chandeliers. The magical atmosphere which pervades this wonderful story and draws us into the wonderful world teeming with rounded, living, breathing, characters we feel we have known all our lives."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I love English history and I love historical novels, so I adore Susan Howatch's books, and The Wheel of Fortune is my favorite. The only thing to add to the overwhelmingly positive reviews written before me is to answer the question in the first review: the book is a continuation of the story told in Cashelmara, recast with a different family. Cashelmara is based on the story of Edward I, Edward II, and Edward III, ending as Edward III overthrows his mother's lover and claims the throne as his own. The Wheel of Fortune picks up the same story about half way through Edward III's life (he is now Bobby Godwin), and follows the story through the life of his sons Edward The Black Prince (Robert), John (John of Gaunt) and Thomas (Thomas of Woodstock), his grandsons Kester (Richard II) and Harry (Henry IV), and his great grandson Henry V (Hal)."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I've just finished Wheel of Fortune by Susan Howatch. (1171 pages in 5 days it was so good!) What a fascinating book. The book starts with one person's point of view and then the story picks up at the end of that section with someone else's point of view. When they reflect back on something you already know about it gives you another perspective. I don't think I've ever read a book written like this one. What is so interesting about it is that it shows that what is seen by others is not the reality in the mind of the person being looked at. What we perceive to be an ideal situation is really not so ideal at all if we knew the truth of the matter. Behavior that seems dreadful from the outside makes perfect sense when we can look inside and see why someone behaved the way they did. If we knew what others really think of us we would probably be shocked at how far off the mark they are from what we think of ourselves. It's remarkable how things from past generations that we may not even know about effect us in ways that we are not even aware of.Another interesting thing is the idea of time. That time is not a straight line leading forward and behind us. But instead it is a circle and we can hear echos of the past and the future across the circle of time. I like books that make me sit back and say, \\"Hmmm\\" after I have read them and this one had that effect on me. The whole time I was reading the book I thought it a work of fiction. I was somewhat surprised to get to the end and read the author's note that it is a re-creation in a modern dimension of a true story involving King Richard II, King Henry IV, and King Henry V. Amazing. Wish I had read the author's note first. Oh well, I think my mind will be chewing on some of the concepts of this book for at least a few days. How well do we really ever know someone else that we think we know? Fascinating question."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Susan Howatch is probably the closest approximation we have to a modern day Anthony Trollope in her character driven style of writing, and plot development. Howatch, like Trollope, is fascinated by the moral choices people make, and the reasons for making them (eg. religious belief, guilt, envy, etc.). However, where Trollope tends to use more wry sarcasm, Howatch relies on (often deceptively) romantic scenes, and generational bonds.\\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" 1171 pages long, revolves around the idea that people are tied to the mis-deeds committed by past generations, and, unless great effort is applied to break the destructive cycle, are usually condemned to repeat history. Most of the story takes place at an historic mansion known as Oxmoon in early twentieth century Wales on the Gower Peninsula. The main characters are frequently obsessed with \\"doing the done thing,\\" \\"drawing the line,\\" and generally keeping up appearances, often with tragic results.The book is divided up into six parts, each of which is told from the perspective of a different character, and which, in total, spans over 60 years. Robert Godwin, the narrator of Part One, is the oldest son and heir to Oxmoon. Outwardly, he's a hard man, completely rational and highly intelligent. His obsession is his slightly older cousin Genevra, and the greatest moment of his life was waltzing with her, as a teenager, under the Oxmoon crystal chandeliers to the \\"Blue Danube,\\" though Ginervra loves another. Howatch repeats this romantic scene over and over again, usually as a metaphor that things aren't as grand as they appear to be (anyone who reads \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" as a romantic novel needs to read it again). Through Ginevra's section (Part Two), we learn how vulnerable Robert really is, in more ways than one.Parts One and Two of \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" are mere preludes to the heart of the book. In Part Three, Robert's younger brother John, who becomes the head of the family, narrates. John excels at drawing everyone's \\"line\\" except his own. The love of his life, Bronwen, is several stations below John, but John finds he can love no one else. John acts as sort of the family referee, especially between the greatest rivals of the story, Harry and Kester.Parts Four and Five (repectively Robert's son, Kester [who in adulthood, bears some unsettling resemblance to Michael Jackson], and John's son, Harry) turn the book into a page turner, and make \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" into a terrific read. The relationship between Kester and Harry (and their rivalry with respect to Oxmoon) is always intriguing, and takes some unexpected twists and turns, to say the least. Their destinies intertwine, usually in a destructive manner, and both ultimately pay for their hatred of the other.Howatch could have ended the book with a final struggle between Kester and Harry, but chose to look into the future with Hal, Harry's son, (but emotionally closer to his uncle, Kester) in a spell-binding part Six, where Hal attempts to unravel the last great family mystery. There is always hope and redemption, the author seems to say, and we are not necessarily condemned to repeat the past.All-in-all, I found \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" to be engrossing and memorable. I didn't give it 5 stars, because I think Howatch can be heavy-handed and repetitious with romantic metaphor and pithy speeches. How many times do we need to hear about that waltz under the chandeliers to the \\"Blue Danube?\\" Do the characters necessarily have to say that they are \\"drawing the line\\" or \\"doing the done thing\\" on every other page?Another quibble has to do with the character Bronwen (John's true love). Although many of the Welsh names and towns sound like they come from \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (perhaps the British Tolkien was influenced by this), does Bronwen really have to talk like the immortal queen of the Elves, or Yoda from Star Wars? Every time Bronwen would open her mouth and spout some celtic mysticism, I would almost groan out loud.I also cannot accept how young children get over the death of a parent so quickly, and visa versa. I think I understand the stiff-upper-lip attitude of this culture, but the death of a mother to a young child surely would affect him more than, for example, a rivalry with a cousin over a piece of property.Even so, I highly enjoyed \\"Wheel of Fortune,\\" and recommend it, even given its length. If you like Susan Howatch, may I also recommend Gail Godwin, and Stuart O'Nan's \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" And, of course, the master himself, Anthony Trollope."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" and frankly I am exhausted. I literally couldn't put it down and by the time I was finished I felt emotionally drained. The best book I've read in many a moon.Anyway, I read Wheel of Fortune in hardcover, two volumes. On the last inside page, S. H. says in Author's notes \\"The Wheel of Fortune is a re-creation in a modern dimension in which the following people play leading parts:Edward of Woodstock, 1330-1376, The Black PrinceHis wife and cousin, Joan of KentJohn of Gaunt, his brotherHis younger son, later King Richard 11John of Gaunt's legitimate son Henry of Bolingbroke, later King Henry 1V who restored England to her former military glory and completed the full circle of the Plantagenet family's wheel of fortune.I didn't know all this when I was reading--- I just read it as a family saga that kept me engrossed from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"This is the BEST book I have ever read. I know that many people place Gone With The Wind at the top of the list (and rightly so) but I consider this book the &quot;English Version&quot; of Gone with the Wind.Instead of Scarlett and the Tara Plantation, you get to meet the Goodwins and their magical home Oxmoon. This book is divided into six chapters with each chapter being told by a different character. By doing this, the author gives the readers a chance to see other characters from different points of view. She also ends each chapter with a bang and the next character picks it up where the last character left off.If you are looking for a book filled with love, hate, envy, greed, murder and so forth, you don't need to look any further. The book is over a 1000 pages long but it moves right along. I found myself wishing that it had been 2000 pages long. I did not want the book to end. Lucky for me, this author has other great novels.PLEASE GET THIS BOOK AND READ THE FIRST CHAPTER, YOU WILL BE HOOKED!!!!!I would go on but I don't want to bore any readers and anyways I am starting on another Susan Howatch book.If anyone has read this book and knows of another great author such as Susan Howatch (I doubt it), please email me at mitzibilly@yahoo.com."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"This novel has it all---a grand old family, the Godwins, with many more than their fair share of eccentricities; the beauty and poetry of early 20th century Wales; the glitter of the same-period London political arena; unrequited love; family jealousies and secrets galore; and finely-drawn characters whom you'll come to love and actually miss once you're finished with the book---what a read! Oh, and don't forget the brilliant use of that most romantic of all romantic waltzes, &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;, as a literary device which instantly transports you into the characters' frame of reference. &quot;Take me back to Oxmoon---the Oxmoon of my childhood!&quot; is another recurring refrain, and the reader can almost reach out and touch the weathered stone of the old Godwin family mansion every time this line is spoken (and spoken it most definitely is, by many characters over a span of many years). There is Robert Godwin, the epitome of male chauvinism and veddy proper London barrister who turns into an insanely passionate and romantic-bordering-on-crazed lover when he falls for his cousin Ginevra. There is Ginevra herself---a silly, self-absorbed twit who develops into a woman of steel and substance and boundless compassion. There is John, whose deeply ingrained morality (&quot;Here I have my standards, and HERE I DRAW THE LINE!&quot;) is challenged and vanquished when he meets Bronwen, the lower class Welsh mystic who taps into John's own mystical Welsh heritage and creates havoc in his orderly, moral world. Kester is perhaps the most enigmatic and surprising character, growing from a spoiled little boy into a creative genius with a propensity for intrigue; his nemesis, Harry, grows from a public school boy who seems to have it all---money, the &quot;right&quot; education, and later, a gorgeous, seductive wife--- into a frightened, paranoid, confused and very unhappy adult. Hal is the final generation of the Godwins, and it is his character who brings this huge, elaborately-plotted story full circle to its satisfying conclusion. There is plenty of romance (&quot;Grand passion, darling!&quot;) in Ginevra's words, dual murder mysteries (one from the distant past, one in the current time frame), tragic illnesses and unexpected deaths, and wonderfully-drawn characters whose problems become ours and whose rides on the Wheel of Fortune we cheer and curse as if they were our own"},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"Why oh why aren't more sagas like this written. Only once in too great a while do I come across a book that consumes me. It is interesting, well-written and has all the ingredients a novel of this size needs to keep the attention of an avid reader."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I read almost exclusively historical fiction set in pre-1600s Europe. For that reason, when I discovered that this book begins in England at the turn of the 20th Century, I almost decided out of hand not to read it. That would have been a terrible mistake as to miss out on this engrossing, beautifully crafted work would have been a sore loss. As it turns out, this novel actually does pertain to a medieval royal family, namely Edward III and his many sons, including the legendary Black Prince and romantic John of Gaunt and his famous love affair with lowborn Kathryn Swynford. To my delight, these people are all here, only updated and relocated to turn of the century England and Wales. Howatch has managed to capture even small details of the \\"original\\" family members' lives in her updating to the modern Godwins. To cite just a few of the very many examples: Richard II's (Kester here) marriage to a foreign born, essentially outcast, wife who begs on her knees for his old tutor Simon; or Henry IV Bolingbroke's (Harry) skin condition (then, leprosy; now, eczema); and of course the passionate, scandalous affair between the dashing Duke of Lancaster (Johnny) and dazzling Kathryn(Bronwen). I am fairly familiar with many particulars pertaining to the lives of the historical Plantagenets which made spotting the modern day parallels drawn by the author exciting and fun to recognize. Not only does Howatch brilliantly succeed in retelling this most fascinating - and lurid! - family history, but she also adds an entirely new level of psychology with her thesis of how the current family's veddy British obsession with \\"drawing the line\\" and \\"doing the done thing\\" results only in the perpetuation of misery and psychic captivity from generation to generation. This is a very long novel, but it kept my interest from start to finish. I am quite amazed at the scope of what the author has attempted here, but even moreso by her slamming success."},{"Title":"The Wheel of Fortune","review":"I was astonished to find myself reading this book for a second time. There's only one other book of this length that has merited a second reading for me (James Clavell's \\"Shogun\\".) Very few authors can sustain a story for 1,171 pages without running out of steam or becoming repetitious. Susan Howatch doesn't quite manage it, but she comes very close.Recently I read a few reviews here and realized that, although I originally read this in 1984, I still remembered the opening pages, and the plot of the first two sections. I picked it up second-hand to glance at it and to my surprise, not only read it all but enjoyed it much more the second time around.I also remembered being bored by the final segment, and had rapidly skimmed through the last 200 pages. I read more closely this time, but it was still hard to keep from skimming. Part Five ends with a cliffhanger mystery, and Part Six features a character from the next generation who returns to resolve the mystery. There is little suspense as Hal interviews one surviving witness after another, repeating information that is mostly known to the reader. I kept wanting to shout, \\"OK! OK! Can't you just tell me what happens?\\" The last 200 pages seem much longer than the first 1,000 pages.Still, those first 1,000 pages are gripping, if soap-operatic. The characters are brilliantly drawn, the writing is very fine, and Howatch maintains a crisp, snappy pace that only flags when we enter the dire Part VI. Perhaps if she'd trimmed the final section a bit it might have been more effective for me; but the bottom line is that I actually read this book twice, and more attentively the second time. This is a great addition to your summer reading list, or anytime you want a long, engrossing, dishy novel that's genuinely well written and intelligent."},{"Title":"Turn-Around: When Your Life is in Crisis","review":"Turn-Around certainly turned my life around.

The research, that's what. In showing both good and bad graphic design, Tufte has examples from as far back as 1686, and many examples from the 18th,19th &amp; 20th centuries and from many different countries.Good graphic design, he argues, reveals the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space. Interestingly, some of the best examples of this come from the pre-computer era, when graphics had to be drawn by hand (and therefore more thought had to go into their design, rather than the author just calling up the Bar Graph template on the desktop.) For example, that picture you can see on the front cover of the book is actually a train timetable that packs a whole list of arrivals and departures at many different stations into a single little picture. A better example (and the &quot;best statistical graphic ever drawn&quot;) shows Napoleon's route through Europe. It shows a) the map b) where he went c) how many people were in his army at each point and d) the temperature on the way back that killed off his army. At a glance you can see the factors that led to his army losing. AND it was drawn by hand in 1885 and is little more than a line drawing!He also gives examples of really bad design, (including \\"the worst graphic ever to make it to print\\"), and shows what makes it so bad. His examples prove that information-less, counter-intuitive graphics can still look dazzlingly pretty, even though they're useless. In some examples, he shows how small changes can make the difference between an awful graphic and a really good one. My favourite example of this is how he drew the inter-quartile ranges on the x and y axes of a scatterplot, thus adding more information to the graphic without cluttering it up.In summary, there's a lot more to good graphic design than being an Adobe guru. Reading this book made me feel like a more discerning viewer of graphics!"},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This book, and the two companion volumes (&quot;Envisioning Information&quot; and &quot;Visual Explanations&quot;) are must-haves for anyone who is in the business or producing or interpretingstatistical information.Tufte starts with a simple proposition: graphs and graphicsthat represent statistical data should tell the truth.

He's gone."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This was the first of three books written by Tufte on graphical displays. This book has been heralded by famous statisticians and average readers as an eloquent description of the how to and how not to make graphs. Now in its sixteenth printing, this is still a classic and the pictures tell the story along with the prose."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is a rather dry title for what turns out to be a supremely interesting and innovative study of how graphics can explain quantitative information.Tufte is the pre-eminent scholar of graphical representation and this book is a clear example of why. The book outlines Tufte's theories for better displaying data in graphical forms. According to Tufte's well-argued point of view, simpler is often better--good graphics are able to convey multiple levels of information with minimal ink. He rails against unnecessary &quot;chartjunk&quot; which merely takes up space without conveying any information and he is quick to note that &quot;pretty&quot; graphics are often the least informative. Tufte's theories for achieving graphical success are presented in a straightforward manner and are always highlighted by examples. Some of the most interesting sections of the book show how Tufte would transform an otherwise ordinary graphic into a more powerful one--these sections clearly illustrate Tufte's theories and enable the reader to learn from the mistakes of other designers.Tufte's book is extremely well researched and he consistently uses graphics from various time periods to highlight the points of his argument and to illustrate the good and bad of graphic design. He writes quite passionately about his &quot;favorite&quot; graphic (Charles Minard's time series map of Napoleon's march into Russia) and is equally passionate about exposing the lack of data within bad graphics (he calls one &quot;the worst graphic ever to find its way into print&quot;).Tufte is a clear and compact writer and is very good at explaining complex ideas both in words and in graphical form. While the book sounds very academic, it is certainly accessible to the general reader. This is a must read for graphic designers and those who seek to present quantitative information successfully (e.g. scientists, statisticians, students, businesspeople, etc.). Tufte's ideas are simple and broad enough to translate into a wide range of graphical areas--readers will be able to conceptualize and present data much more effectively after reading this book. Readers will also have a much sharper eye when viewing other's graphics. In a time when computer programs have largely automated graph-making (usually with bad results), Tufte's book is a helpful guide to making graphs and charts as effective and informative as they can be."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Instead I give this book regularly to my students &amp; wish to goodness that more of my colleagues had copies. From the opening pages -where Tufte gives us 4 data sets that are statistically indistinguishable but graphicly at different points of the compass- through the beautifully rendered examples of classical and modern examples of meaningful graphics &amp; &quot;chartjunk&quot; Tufte serves as a wry, witty, and informative guide to the perils &amp; joys of informing or confusing an audience with charts and graphs.Although in some ways a polemic against the misuse of graphical techniques, Tufte never loses his sense of humor &amp; gives us plenty of really GOOD examples as well as a harsh deconstruction of some truly horrendous images. While this, the first in what has become a series, predates the muddy dawn of computer graphical &quot;presentations&quot; the basic principles outlined in its pages are every bit as applicable to the PowerPoint generation as they were to transparencies &amp; posters. Buy it. read it Use it."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"I have heard this book described as a really good coffee-table book. It's content, while often technical and very much focused on the theory of graphs and diagrams and data and information, very practically demonstrates the impact of how quantitative information is visually presented, and shows many alternatives that are quantum improvements on the originals. It's easy to draw out the principles that Tufte demonstrates, and to apply them to your own work.The book's examples are drawn from many interesting areas such as the New York State Budget, train schedule graphs, irrigation maps of 1972, heights of college students, the price of crude oil and the thermal conductivity of tungsten. Through these case studies, Tufte makes conscious for the reader the way in which humans read visual information and how poorly the majority of our visual information is designed in respect of this.It has greatly influenced the work I do in helping people design reports of organisational performance information, how they choose and format charts in particular. I enthusiastically recommend this book to anyone who regularly reports or presents data and information to others to assist their decision making."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"The title makes this sound like a specialist monograph. it is not; it will change the way you think about presenting informnation and ideas. If that is part of your life -- teacher, academic, manager, web site developer -- this book will open your eyes. The best part of the book is all the wonderful imaginative examples Tufte quotes. He draws some general conclusions from some examples, which is useful, but mostly he just looks at what works, and contrasts with what doesn't. Tufte's next twoo books are also excellent, but this one is the best -- simply a msterpiece"},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"the examples are incredible. this book is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read both for its content and execution. The advice Tufte gives with regard to the presentation of information will only become more important in the future. Whether reading the newspaper or writing a technical report, the proper display of quantitative information is an invaluable skill. this book helps you to think clearly and concisely. one of the best books of all time."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"The review of good and bad designs is useful. But Tufte's &quot;theory&quot; of good design seems to boil down to one thing only: use less ink. Using this single-minded technique, he &quot;improves&quot; several designs, which look worse to me, not better. Similarly with his new design ideas, most of which didn't look like improvements over existing ideas."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"The book is good, the contents is beautiful. This is a quality book, and obviously you have to pay the price for that. Many people should read this book, especially if involved in web stuff, it would make the web better."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This book is beautifully produced but it lacks any &quot;how-to&quot; information for designers. The author totally misses his own presumed mission for the book. For example, he rips apart a graph used in a popular magazine as not effectice, etc yet his own book is a mess and a how-to for not designing and conveying informtion. Case in point: All of his diagrams or illustrations are never labeled. So you just have illos all over and no reference to the text. YOU have to figure it out yourself. Pretentious artsy rubbish. If you want to waste your money on something &quot;interesting,&quot; then blow your wad on this book. But if you want clear, concise, relevant design info or even about the history of design, forget this book. I have it and I don't read it. Like I said, it's pretentious artsy nonsense at its worst. The only thing interesting about the book is its sparse and obscure layout and interesting historical examples of information design which are excellent but I can't help but feel that there are tons of examples like that out there and most likely an hopefully in better books."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Good graphics but not cutting edge"},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This is one of the finest reference works I have read. It is lucid, elegant and beautifully presented. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Whether it is presentation slides or internet sites, the concepts provided in Tufte's books will give you insight and skill that will improve your output 1000%.There is some overlap between the books, but just looking at the pictures and his explanations and concepts will make you say &quot;AHA!&quot; and improve your next design."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"If you need to present graphic information in an elegant and professional style, this book is a valuable source of instruction and ideas. It is definitely NOT for the hyper-glitz crowd. This kind of presentation could go a long way toward restoring civility to communication."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"and anyone else who creates interfaces, graphs or any other utilitarian visuals.

Just buy and read it, you won't regret"},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"I heard a lot of good things about Edward Tufte's books, and was told he was THE expert on graphics. When I was asked to read this book for work, I eagerly agreed and ordered it straight away. Now I'm sorry I wasted my time.The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is poorly organized, and Tufte contradicts himself in many places. He includes a quote from E. B. White recommending that writers trust in their readers' intelligence, yet he does not. Everything is broken down bit by bit so that the intelligent reader must skim over half the content of the book to avoid wasting his or her time. While the ideas behind the book are good, the voice is condescending and irritating. In addition, the bizarre layout of the book is heavily unbalanced; some pages have several inches of white space all the way down the right hand side of the page, while others are so full of text and graphics that it is difficult to tell to what the citations refer, giving the page a jumbled, disorganized appearance. This is disappointing; Tufte says in the introduction that he controlled the book's layout, yet he, an expert in the art of visual display, produces an unblanced and jumbled display? I am sorry I bothered reading this book, and would urge others to avoid it."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"i have bought copies to give away to friends. a great lesson in presentation of information"},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"I've been working in marketing research for over 20 years and am constantly challenged to present complex information to managers -- quickly, efficiently, accurately, ...and visually.This book completely reoriented my approach to this task, and ranks among maybe half a dozen that have had such an influence on my worldview. My graphs now communicate huge amounts of information very simply. Managers can &quot;get it&quot; within a few minutes at most. I write less text because I can convey so much visually. My reports are shorter, more concise, more reader friendly, and my value to clients has gone up.Others in my company come to me to review their graphs too, and I can almost always find something to recommend, based on Tufte's principles.This book is well written and illustrated. It seems nothing was spared to make it useful and visually appealing. It is well worth the investment."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Rarely can you claim a book to be so wonderful, so beautiful and so perfect. Even more rarely can such a description be placed on a book of a technical subject such as we see here. The Visual Display Of Quantitative Information is fewer than 200 pages and yet you'll get so much out of it. Tufte writes with an amazing precision; no word is superfluous. You can sense Tufte's commitment to his work; his passion and quality. The book is crafted with the design principles he set forth. It's a stunning masterpiece and you'll savor every word."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Tufte's first two books concentrated on the print medium, where he is comfortable and knowledgable. This book steps into the computer graphics domain, where his knowledge is only partially applicable.He fully recognizes the problems related to the limited pixel resolution of the computer screen, but he doesn't know what to do about it. In his example screens for the Museum kiosk, his vision is clear but impractical. He knows what should be done if more screen resolution were available, but fails to show how his vision can be embodied in the computer screens we really have available.I hope Tufte will rethink the subject and figure out how to properly apply the high temporal resolution of the screen to make up for its low spatial resolution."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This wonderful book has earned a very special space on my professional bookshelf. Tufte's work was immediately put to use in reducing &quot;chart junk&quot; in a very important presentation I was preparing. This book can help anyone seeking to communicate complex information to nearly any audience. The graphic of Napoleon's march to Moscow is intense and focused - and sparked several conversations around the office."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This is the first of Edward Tufte's brilliant trilogy on how information should be displayed. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information is about pictures of numbers. Envisioning Information is about picturing nouns. Visual Explanations is about picturing verbs.

With the growth of the Web, this book, and it's companion &quot;Visual Explanations&quot; have become seminal, like McLuhan's work became.Modern commerce and entertainment is now being forced into a matrix of 800 * 600 pixels: even more constraining than the constraints of a printed page. Tufte urges us on to get the the core of our intent, to separate the wheat from the chaff, at a time when media is reinventing itself faster than artists can keep up.No professional or technologist can afford not to read Tufte's work. As Tufte ends the book &quot;Design is Choice&quot;. Choices must be informed."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"This book is an excellent style guide on how to presentdata in graphical format. Every idea is clearly explainedand backed up with excellent visual examples. Tufteemphasizes the use of graphics as a tool that acceleratesthe flow of information to the reader instead of anornamental attachment. Latest advances in personalcomputing and world-wide web has made this point evenmore important - just think about the amount of junk weget to see on a typical web page. Tufte criticizes theincreasingly familiar case of graphical data distortionin publications with striking examples and offers basicguidelines for avoiding this problem.The book is overall very well written and designed. Iconsider &quot;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information&quot;required reading for anybody who needs to present or usedata in graphical form."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"I was greatly pleased with the book except that it was a little thin.

I know that some people who work with graphics find these books less than useful, but I think that if you think about and create figures, these books are brilliant. This is also a physically beautiful book. If you've heard of Tufte, but never remember what's in each look, The Paris train schedule example is here, plus Napoleon's march on Moscow and a very striking example of how a table fails to show information that a set of plots does. There is much here on distortion, and how the mind understands visual information before reading the text around it; reasons to improve the data/ink ratio in graphics, and ways to do this. Tufte's nomination for \`Worst graphic of all time' is here, too. Useful if you are willling to think. Maybe less useful if you want cookie-cutter solutions to design problems, but that's NOT me."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"If you need to exalt form over content, this is not the book for you. But if you want to communicate numbers clearly and effectively, here is a trove of ideas.Tufte shows dozens of examples of both terrific and horrible design, and gives sensible criteria for assessing our numerical tables, charts, and diagrams. I find myself instinctively applying his rules whenever I look at a newspaper graph, and shuddering whenever a spreadsheet automatically generates his despised &quot;chartjunk."},{"Title":"The Visual Display of Quantitative Information","review":"Everyone producing tons of fancy, colourful charts for management meetings (including the tons of consultans) must read this book. It helps you to impress people with graphics telling a story not by showing your deep knowledge of every goodie your tool provides.

This, his first book, is really the foundation for understanding the principles he puts forth in the next two, and present a clear template on how to do the best possible job when presenting data visually. This book explains how to clearly and elegantly design data for presentation in order to maximize its efficiency. While there are several fields where this is directly applicable, web design, finance and any other area requiring significant quantiative analysis, it is difficult to envision any field which would not benefit from Mr. Tufte's very insightful and educational opinions.This book is divided into two parts, a history and guide to &quot;Graphical Practice&quot; and a section describing the &quot;Theory of Data Graphics.&quot; In the first, the author describes what makes for good visual data and outlines the history of the visual presentation of data. In the second part the author discusses many specific techniques for evaluating the efficiency of graphics and methods for ensuring that graphics are created in an intelligent and thoughtful manner. The whole of the book is full of wonderful historical examples of good and bad graphics. Every page has a graphic, and every graphic has been thoughtfully chosen and tells a wonderful story. If you were to purchase this book and merely look at the charts and figures it would be a worthwhile purchase, if you take the time to read the back up text the book truly is a masterpiece. The author does an exceptional job of clearly presenting his points at the conclusion of the chapters and provides a large number of well selected examples of his points.Mr. Tufte's theories are clear, (1) charts are not just a way of livening up 'boring' data, (2) no chart can overcome poor content, (3) charts should contain as much relevant data as possible, and (4) charts should not be livenend up with 'chartjunk' just for the sake of displaying nifty graphics capabilities.

Compared to sloppier works, this book takes extra care to include references, including the work of other reputable genealogists and the full text of numerous wills (which researchers LOVE!). The author tackles apparent discrepancies head-on and helps to clear up confusion with similar and evolving names. Although the book includes the obligatory endless names and dates for reference purposes, the discussions have an unusual amount of charm. For the genre of amateur genealogies, it stands out for thoroughness, readability, and lots of good references.

The story is not a simple &quot;adventure&quot; story, as some summaries have purported; the plot is strikingly complex.The characters, so true to life, are struggling with the echoing words of their grandmother, as they try to escape the Japanese invasion of their village. Their physical challenges are compounded by a profound questioning of ethics. What should they do when they find an unconscious, Japanese soldier? Is their freedom more valuable than their humanity?For teachers, this story is a fine centerpiece to an interdisciplinary unit on the tundra, providing an accurate look at our generous, sensitive, and courageous neighbors to the north. A must for any teacher serious about providing his/her students with a critical and inspiring education."},{"Title":"Wind Is Not a River","review":"This is a story of the invasion of Attu by the Japanese during World War II. It is told about two Native children who are not in the village when it is captured, but who try to save their people, and learn to live off the land like their ancestors did. They learn to respect the old ways, and also help to save a young Japanese soldier. They learn that the soldiers aren't any different from their own people, just fighting for the \\"other side\\".

But instead of being thanked, they were threatened, \\"Tell them to keep off my property. One or more is stealing from me.\\" So, odd things are always happening in this book.

His latest is no exception. The Culver family is one you wish you knew --- loving, wise, and irrepressible. Told by 15 year old, Russell, the story begins in August with the death of Myrt Arbuckle, the Hominy Ridge School teacher. When older sister Tansy gets the job, Russell knows that life will change. He plans to go to the Dakota Territory to find excitement. He finds it in Parke County, Indiana during 1904. You will laugh and cry at the stories and you will come to love the characters. This is a must for any teacher in Indiana to have on his/her classroom shelf. And if you can get that Central Indiana accent going, it will make a terrific read aloud."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"This book written in a young man's voice is a hilarious story about a one room school house and the students that attend it. Although it is written for a juvinelle audience, my husband and I loved reading it because it reminds us of little boys who hate school and how they challenged teachers."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"That's what this latest book by Richard Peck left me thinking. Peck writes in vivid detail what life in rural Indiana in 1904 was like for the Culver family. One such incident is the clash between the family wagon and a new motor car on the way back from the title event, The Teacher's Funeral.All these details and descriptions add to the main story line, unfolding the story of a young boy's life that is changed by the sudden passing of the town's school teacher. Little does Russell Culver know, but Miss Myrt's passing will lead him through a school year like he's never experienced.As readers, we get to be witness to all sorts of comical happenings. Not to mention all the memorable characters that are sprinkled throughout the book, making the story more realistic and interesting. Like the time Russell and his friend Charlie set the boys' privy (and nearly the entire school) on fire. Or when Russell helps the new school teacher recruit students at the Tarbox family farm. And then there's the time the kids have to come out of the school house to hoist Aunt Fanny Hamline out of the ditch!Russell's plans for the future are changed in the story by the things that happen to him over that school year. Peck neatly sums up the course of events in a way that leaves the reader(at least this one) feeling that things turned out the way they should have. I really enjoyed discovering how the characters' lives turned out."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"As a fifth grade teacher, this is by far my favorite book. I love the theme, the dialogue, the ending. It kept my kids engaged and was accessible to various levels and interests. Would recommend for a book report idea or for adults looking for a quick, fun read. It has something for everyone!"},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"I am a college student and read The Teacher's Funeral for a class on young adult literature. I really enjoyed the book and don't see why others would not - it is wonderfully written.I also want to say that this book can be seen as one about teachers, not just one about a boy who lived long ago in Indiana. If you look at the difference between Tansy's style of teaching and Ms. Myrt's way, there is definately something to be said about what is effective in the classroom and what is not.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a teacher, or to anyone who loves a read about the good old days and country living."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"Book Review Mike LandeFor my readers workshop book I read The Teacher's Funeral by Richard Peck. It's about a boy who wishes his teacher was dead. Let me just say, be happy whit what you have. This book made me feel laughter, enjoyment and suspense. This book made me laugh because it is based on a funny subject; teachers dieing, I'm only kidding. This book was not just one of those books that you read only because you have to; I actually had fun with this book. I learned a lesson from this book; it's to be happy with what you have because something worse could come along. I enjoyed reading this book and I can't wait to read another one. You would like this book if you'd ever had a bad teacher or if you like comedies.The plot of this book was very interesting. It's about a boy named Russell Culver , who is tired of his bland, small town Indiana. He wants to shut down the school so he can move out to the city to find another one. The only way to do that is if his bland, mean teacher dies. Having teachers like this in the past, I feel his pain. This teacher is awful and he is convinced she hates him. One day he wishes his teacher dead, and what do you know? She's dead. He thinks everything is well but then, the unthinkable happened. Let me just say \\"be careful what you wish for\\".This book made me feel several feelings. It was funny and carefree. It had a clear conflict and a resolution. This definitely goes in my top eight of reader's workshop books. Although, considering I've only read 5 books for reader's workshop, it's not saying much. If you liked the book Surviving The Applewhites by Stephanie S. Tolan, then you'll love this because it is also very ridicules and descriptive. I think this book is great for all ages. I know you'll love it if you read it because I sure did."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"I really liked this book because I can mainly relate to everything happening in it. I absolutley despise school (I'm being honest.) And I always have a crush on someone. Russel seems like he would be such a great kid. I didn't live way back when you had to go out to the privy to go to the bathroom,which I'm glad of, but when I go camping I have to use an outhouse. When I read about the privy starting on fire I swear I could smell the privy smoke. Eww, gross. But overall this was a really great book."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"I am a pretty big Richard Peck fan and this book did not disappoint me. It's not his very best -I think that would be A Long Way From Chicago- but Peck's humor and knack for charming a reader with small town flair is very present. This story is quite predictable but then again it is a simple tale. You won't find a mystery or intrigue, just a good yarn. Over all this is worth your time and money. As a teacher I'd recommend it for fifth or sixth graders who enjoy Americana themes."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"Great book for the upper elementary/middle school age group. Told in true Richard Peck fashion.

But as I read the book and it came tougher there was no side splitting funny parts. Aside from the point it was a good book and kept me reading but a little misleading in the title."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"I am a very big fan of Peck's \\"A Long Way From Chicago\\" and \\"A Year Down Yonder\\", and this effort is in that same style. There is a strong sympathetic narrator, a reliable parent, and all kinds and varieties of interesting and appealing characters. Nothing much happens, or an awful lot happens, depending on how you feel about cheerful shaggy dog type stories. I think because we don't have a compelling character like Grandma Dowdel, (from the other two books), this one seems just a bit unfocused and a little repetitive. That was fine by me, but I could see how a young reader could find this book a bit too aimless to hold attention. On the other hand, the focus on school and schooling might be especially interesting and amusing to a young reader. Either way, this will answer the call if you've missed Peck's touch. (And I have to tell you, the last two pages of each Peck book always get me.)"},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"This product was in great shape when I recieved it. The book itself is a great read for middle school age kids. Loved using it in my classroom.The Teacher's Funeral : A Comedy in Three Parts"},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"My little brother who is 13 years old had to read this book for school. At first, he did not like it, but once my mother and I started reading it, he really became interested in the story line. The humor can sometimes be overlooked if you are speeding through the book which I think is why my brother didn't like it originally, but we ended up reading the whole book in a day. The three of us sat around and read aloud by taking turns. We laughed and learned new words. Its set in a time that agriculture was prominent I suppose, but there was an emphasis on the importance of education and not allowing others to decide for you whether or not you should like learning and do certain things. The author did a wonderful job of making you feel as if you were there with the characters. When Tansy would get after her brothers, you were apprehensive for them. When Aunt Fanny fell into the ditch, you were there trying not to laugh and help them haul up the big woman. When Tansy was being tested for her teacher's certificate and the children were questioned on what they were learned, you were worried with the characters and rooting for them to do well. When Russell and Glenn burned their eyebrows off, you could see their ashen faces and the dread that poured over them when they realized what they had done to the school room. The last chapter is what really tied the whole book together, and it was a great ending! It is a great family read! You can't but help identify people in your family with the characters in the book. My brother kept on saying when Tansy would do certain things, \\"That is you sis!\\" It was an enjoyable day of reading. The book is educational (lots of new vocabulary), has many good role models, and has positive messages on education and being role models for others."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"Don't miss this one. I purchased all of Richard Peck's books after reading \\"A Long Way from Chicago\\".

He truly transported me back to the early 1900's and what it was like to farm and live back then.

If this sounds daunting, be assured it isn't. I haven't laughed so hard, and at a funeral, in years. There's a reason it's called \\"a comedy in three parts.\\"I'd recommend the book for anyone age 8 to 108."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"This book has a great story and it is awesome the way your find out what happens to them all in the end.

It was halarious and was a fast read- I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"In the mold of Tom Sawyer, Russell Culver is the type of character with who a young reader can identify. He hates school and enjoys mischief. His goal of quitting school seems within grasp when the school's teacher dies. But when his sister Tansy takes the teaching position, Russell's plans are altered.While stills dreaming of leaving for the Dakotas, Russell's father pressures him to do well in school. Yet even Russell is aware of his improved education as the days pass. Along the way, Richard Peck paints a rich landscape of characters that seem to fit naturally into the early 20th century plot with an understanding of the pitfalls of teaching. Particularly the Tarbox family and the salesman Eugene Hammond stand out as vivid images of a by-gone era. Hammond is quite taken by Tansy after their initial meeting which creates some humorous conflicts.While some reviews suggest that this is not Peck's best work, I would be interested in reading his other works based on the cast of characters in this book. Peck is a gifted writer with a keen eye on the Indiana landscape. While this is a children's book, there is no reason an adult can not appreciate it."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"This book disappointed me a lot. I thought it would be a lot funnier since part of the title is \\"A comedy in three parts.\\" Plus the main characters pull the worst pranks. In addition to that one character in the book wants to go to Montana for no good reason and the ending is horrible.I would highly suggest that you not pick this book."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"The vernacular, lifestyle, and setting of rural Hoosier-land a century ago along with Richard Peck's flourish with hyperbole makes Russell Culver's reminiscences as an adolescent simply irresistable. I'm a sucker for these American heartland tales of yesteryear. Peck's use of history and artifacts of the period are mesmirizing (e.g. Karo Syrup cans for lunchpails); his description of the countryside, vivid. The reader sees, smells, tastes, and hears everthing as Russell and his brother Lloyd walk down Hog Scald Road. The book stuck like flypaper in my hands--I could scarcely put it down in 2 days of reading.The humor is uproarious--you'll find yourself spontaneously erupting into loud guffaws! The storytelling is so well-crafted--so seamless; the writing, graceful and balanced. It will be savored by avid children's literature readers. Interpersed in the hilarity with poignancy is the low-key, loving guidance of Russell's father as well as his sister Tansy's high expectation and insistance that he achieve versus allow his foibles to become an excuse in the future for failure by his little brother. You will experience tears from laughter; tears from being moved by goodness and love.And the ending--it's as fine a one as is in N. Babbit's Tuck Everlasting. ...the highest praise by me--it's just superb!Whatever will the Newberry Committee do next year? Do they dare recognize Mr. Peck yet a 3rd time for his empassioned flair for writing these wise yarns about our country's rural life in 1st half of the 20th century? If not, then Mr. Peck earns my vote to join the late Scott O'Dell as a recipient of the Hans Christian Anderson Author Medal. He is past due.Mr. Peck has dedicated The Teacher's Funeral to the memory of his parents. I can only begin to appreciate how heartfelt and profound the legacy of their lives have been for him; yet, by the end of the story, I know for certain how proud they would be!Thank you, Mr. Peck, for all those immemorable characters like Aunt Fanny Hemline and the Tarboxes.* page 40, \\"A Mess of Bad Puppies,\\" The Teacher's Funeral, by Richard Peck"},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"Here is a story told to me secondhand. Once at an official gathering of hoity-toity children's authors and the cream of the librarian crop, Mr. Richard Peck was seated at the table of a young enthusiastic librarian of young adults. Mr. Peck (whose curse in life is to be mistaken for fellow children's writer Robert Newton Peck everywhere he goes) was under the distinct impression that his books were read by reluctant readers everywhere. The librarian (who knew exactly who Mr. Richard Peck was) took great pains to explain to the author that, in fact, reluctant readers tend to avoid titles like, \\"The River Between Us\\" and \\"Fair Weather\\". Peck was astounded by that news. After all, he was the author of the wonderful \\"A Long Was From Chicago\\" and \\"A Year Down Yonder\\". Funny novels that take place in America's heartland and leave the audience wanting more. But do kids really read these books? Well, we're about to find out. With \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\", Peck has returned to what he does best. Tell amusing stories from a kid's perspective in what some might call a \\"simpler time\\". Even if you can't stand the author's dour forays into historical fiction, you'll have to admit that titles like this one really show off Peck's funny side.As first sentences go, it's hard to beat this one: \\"If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time of year for it\\". And we're off! When Russell and Lloyd find out in August of 1904 that mean old Miss Myrt Arbuckle is pushing up the daisies and not about to start another year in their ramshackle old schoolhouse, they are nearly beside themselves with joy. Surely the school board will be unable to find a proper substitute in time, right? Surely that means that Russell can fulfill his dream of running away to the Dakotas to work on their gorgeous steel threshing machines, right? Not so much. Enter Tansy. She's Lloyd and Russell's older sister who's been doling out their meals and whoppings ever since their mother died. She's rough and tough and before you know it she's gotten herself hired as the new teacher. Leaving, I might add, Russell and Lloyd in agony. They are LIVING with their teacher now. So Russell schemes to escape his fate, the students of the class learn far more than they'd expect, and not one but three suitors all start vying for Tansy's hand. It's a year that turns out to be anything but dull.Peck's grasp of Indiana turn-of-the-century vernacular is unbeatable. In \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\" he's really at the top of his form. Adeptly, the author combines a couple mysteries here and there with humor, suspense, and a whole heaping helpful of historical facts. Want to know what a 1904 racing car looked like? Or where most Indiana residents got their toilet paper? It's all here, baby. In fact, the historical notes in this book are so slyly worked in that kids may often find themselves scratching their heads in confusion. Russell mentions that if Tansy got married then she would have to quit teaching. There isn't any debate about this or even a challenge to it. And here I was, a 26-year-old reader, wondering why it was the case. It took me an embarrasingly long time to remember that married women once did not work, under any circumstances.Will kids like this puppy, though? I think so. But only some. Really, I suspect that \\"The Teacher's Funeral\\" is one of those books that would work best if it's read aloud to a class of kids, one chapter a day. As for those kids that are assigned it, I doubt they'll hate it on the same level that they come to hate \\"Shabanu\\" or \\"Kira-Kira\\". Still, this is pleasurable reading. Not something that should be assigned. In short, some kids will definitely enjoy the practical jokes and lovable characters that pop up in this puppy. For others, it may strike them as a deadly dull affair. But I liked it and I've little doubt that you'll like it too. I represents a fine frolicksome novel that'll have a cadre of fans cheering for it as the years go by. A winner."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"Richard Peck treats us with another down-home tale from the midwest. This one takes place exactly one century ago, in 1904 Indiana, \\"when automobiles began to burn up the rural byways. The year airships like boxkites began to darken the skies, though they hadn't found our patch of sky yet.\\"Russell Culver's sentiments run from ecstasy to despair when he learns that dreadful Miss Myrt, the schoolteacher, has succumbed to a sudden heart attack just before the beginning of the school year. No sooner is Miss Myrt laid to rest in the Balm of Gilead Cemetary than it becomes clear that her successor is going to be Russell's seventeen-year-old sister, Tansy, and all hope for closing the \\"Jailhouse of School\\" is dashed.Miss Tansy proves to be a formidible and adept new schoolmarm, and Russell's dreams of escaping to the wheatfields of the Dakotas are the only thing that keep him sane. She is determined to prove herself worthy of a preliminary teaching credential and tolerates none of the hijinks that her brother and his pals might attempt to put in her way.There is no shortage of suitors for the pert young teacher in these rural parts. Most promising is Eugene Hammond, a city slicker from Terra Haute who makes his entrance into town crashing his eight-cylinder \\"Bullet No. 2\\" racing car with the Culver family's buggy, sending the spinster Aunt Maud into a ditch. Mr. Hammond subsequently showers lavish gifts for the classroom upon Miss Tansy, all of which are inscribed, \\"Compliments of The Overland Automobile Company; Terra Haute--Indianapolis.\\"In the backdrop of this hilarious saga is the understated wisdom of O.C. Culver, Russell's Dad, a widower, who always seems to have a greater understanding of what is going on than his fifteen-year-old son had ever suspected. His warmth and depth of character is reminiscent of Atticus Finch in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"This is a warm and refreshing read that will make you laugh out loud. Richard Peck is such a thorough researcher of the time period about which he writes that you can be assured that all the details, sentiments and nuances are authentic."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"The title alone (\\"A Teacher's Funeral\\") may induce a number of school-weary kids to pick this book up, what with the demise of teachers being a subject of schoolyard songs even when I was a kid. The book is, however, the opposite of mean-spirited: it is a sympathetic, almost hymn-like story of rural Indiana at the turn of the 20th century. The plot is simple: after the switch-happy Miss Myrt shuffles off this mortal coil, Tansy (the narrator Russell's older sister) becomes teacher to a rag-tag bunch of kids. Oh the horror! My own 11-year-old's eyes grew wide at the idea of being under the thumb of a sibling all day long. To buoy up the narrative there are a lot of what you might call \\"hijinks\\" - setting the school privy on fire, a buggy accident in which an old maid aunt ends up with her skirts around her head, that sort of thing.I thought at first this might all be too mild for my adventure and action-seeking son. But we read it out loud to each other, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Richard Peck goes for a kind of Mark Twain vibe - folksy, humorous, and above all affectionate. He really likes his characters, even when he is making light of them. Peck's genius as a writer comes not from a screenplay-like imagination (he's not all plot twists and peril) but from his ability to convey strong and interesting characters. Everyone - even old Aunt Maud - turns out to have hidden depths, even though the book is really very very funny (!).Sorta makes me wish Peck would try his hand at something for the over-30 crowd. He's a wonderful writer and the book is a great addition to the recent literature for older kids."},{"Title":"The Teacher's Funeral: A Comedy in Three Parts","review":"I ordered this one back in July, and have been on the edge of my library seat wating for it!

Russell's dreams of quitting school are dashed when his older sister, Tansy, takes over as teacher. With the required eight students enrolled, Tansy takes her new role seriously. Faced with vandalism, snakes, fires in the privy, and stolen supplies, Tansy not only manages to keep the school open, but also manages to change the direction of Russell's life.

When the old schoolteacher Miss Myrt dies, Russell and his little brother Lloyd hope that the school board will decide to close the school, but to his horror, his older sister Tansy becomes the new schoolmarm. The novel is punctuated by the yearly cycle of harvest and pig slaughter, the arrival of steel threshers, and the newfangled automobile. Peck lovingly captures life in the country, close to nature. There are some truly hilarious turns of speech, such as \\"the water wasn't crotch-deep on a dwarf,\\" and \\"you could've heard a bee belch.\\" This should be a hit with young readers (9-12), who will identify with the boys' longing for a school-free year and their attempts to keep it that way.

Then you got the news that your teacher died last night in her sleep. Well, it happens in this book, The Teacher's Funeral A Comedy in Three Parts by Richard Peck.The setting of the book is in a small country town located in southern Indiana. It all takes place either in a small country school house or on their farm sort of place.In the book Miss Myrt Arbuckle dies. The school will be postponed. Russell, Lloyd, and Charlie Parr are happy. Tansy is not. She thinks every one should have a right to learn. So she goes to the state and makes a complaint. She says that she will be the teacher. They say no, so she has to fight for it. Russell and Lloyd are not happy about it. Finally the state decides to let her be the teacher. No one likes it at first, but they all decide that they need a teacher and Tansy is their only hope.It all turned out for the best. Tansy was the teacher (that was still in high school). She juggled going to high school and being a teacher. \\"Tansy was great,\\" Russell had said.The characters personalities are like... Tansy (the older sister) is always nagging, but for the best. Russell (the older brother, but younger than Tansy) is outgoing, funny, fun, and likes to prank people. Lloyd is the youngest. He is outgoing, fun, and gets scared very easy. The father is funny, and very manly. He likes to work out on his farm from dawn to dusk. Now their mother's sister is a different story. She is lady like and can't cook. I like this book because it is funny, and it kept me interested but I didn't like it because it started out so slow and boring, but it eventually got better.This book was very realistic. It seemed like I was there all along. Tell me... Do you like this quote? \\"If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time for it.\\" This quote returns to the summary above. What about, \\"The days were growing shorter along with Tansy's temper.\\" This is about the middle of the year and her temper is running short along with the days.Now, if I were recommending this book to anyone it would be someone who likes to read fiction.

Hey, that's music to my ears!\\"Now we were walking up from the lot when we heard music, of all things.\\"It stopped us cold. We'd never heard music hanging like haze over the blue evening. I recalled the calliope on the Case Special, trilling down the track. But we were miles from the railroad, and this was a full orchestra, with violins.\\"Back when I was a kid, we bought our music on vinyl and played it on phonographs. As long as I can remember, I've always had an ear tuned to the newest songs on the radio, and there were hundreds of tunes with which I passionately fell in love. I would hop on my Huffy banana bike and pedal down to the store so that I could add to my stacks of 45s. (They had one song on each side.)In contrast to someone's absolutely exquisite single--say Junior Walker's \\"What Does it Take to Win Your Love For Me\\" or (more recently) The Church's \\"Under the Milky Way\\"--it was rare to discover whole albums, or even whole sides of albums, that were consistently exceptional.As would make sense, I can say that the artists who created those albums that I loved all the way from one end to the other became my favorite bands. That's what The Beatles' LPs always did for me. It was the same with the Moody Blues. Bowie did it with Ziggy Stardust, Zappa with We're Only in it for the Money, Kantner with Blows Against the Empire, Todd Rundgren with Another Live. (I still savor sitting up front at his Wollman Rink show when he was recording it.) The Dead did it over and over and over again. (This is fun!) How about More Songs about Buildings and Food or My Aim is True? Queen did it with A Night at the Opera, Suzanne Vega with Solitude Standing, Ani with Not A Pretty Girl.Those are the thoughts that come to mind as I write, yet again, about the work of Richard Peck. This time it is in regard to his fifth straight novel set entirely or partly around the earlier portions of the 20th century. And what I think is this: Putting those five books together would sure make one heck of an LP.\\"On one of the Fridays, Little Britches said she'd learned a poem by heart and wanted to give it as her party piece for Elocution. So Tansy let her, and we all settled back to listen as Little Britches sashayed to the center of the rostrum, gathered her hands, and elocuted in a high voice that rang like a little bell:Adder in the desk drawer,Aunt Fanny in the ditch;Life here at Hominy RidgeSurely is a---\\"With an almighty thwack, Tansy brought her pointer down on the desk. Little Britches jumped.\\" 'Who taught you that so-called verse?'\\"Little Britches pointed me out and said, 'Russell Culver.' \\"In 1904 Russell Culver is a fifteen-year-old farm boy living in rural Indiana, and is one of a half-dozen or so students readying for another year at Hominy Ridge School, when their mean, old teacher Miss Myrt Arbuckle up and dies.\\"If your teacher has to die, August isn't a bad time of year for it. You know August. The corn is earring. The tomatoes are ripening on the vine. The clover's in full bloom. There's a little less evening now, and that's a warning. You want to live every day twice over because you'll be back in the jailhouse of school before the end of the month.\\"Hoping that perhaps they'll just close the school down, dreaming and scheming about taking off and riding the rails to Nebraska for the fall harvest in October, the last thing Russell expects to happen is for his big sister, Tansy, to not go away for her last year of high school as planned but, instead, to become their new teacher.\\"The thought of Tansy having a look at my orthography brought me near to tears. It was almost the last thing you'd want a sister looking at.\\"THE TEACHER'S FUNERAL gives readers a look at the dawn of the automobile age. There's a noticeable difference in the America of Russell Culver from that--just twelve years later--of Howard Leland Hutchings, the fifteen-year-old we encounter in Richard Peck's last novel, the award-winning THE RIVER BETWEEN US.But on the other hand, THE TEACHER'S FUNERAL has got a groove that fits right in with Peck's previous four novels: the humor, the chores, the vittles, the multigenerational cast of the good, the bad, and the ornery. And there's something about the way Richard Peck portrays his rural settings that makes me want to go stand outside in my goat pasture and breathe deeply.\\"Me and Lloyd were up ahead of the chickens. We worked a seven-day week anyway, even in this quiet season. As Dad said, the only man who got his work done by Friday was Robinson Crusoe. And we were a corn, wheat, hay, and hogs farm in a never-ending round of chores, plus the milking.\\"You know how when a great old song comes on, and the first notes take you right back to when you were there experiencing it for the first time? Well, Richard Peck is always doing the same thing to me, and I wasn't even there in the first place!Plenty of kids will relate to Russell's dilemma of suddenly having a bossy older sibling become a legitimate figure of authority. And readers will similarly identify with one or more of Russell's classmates, because there are so many things about being a student that just don't change.\\" 'That howling only means but one thing,' Charlie remarked, 'and you know what.\\"It means that children's publishing's \\"The King\\" has done it once again."},{"Title":"Felo de se?","review":"I should have answered my question with a qualified, \\"yes, of course\\", for about three-quarters of the book, as one and then another narrator described the action from his own viewpoint. Somewhat stilted in language for a contemporary reader (Freeman-1862-1943) but nothing that would interfere with one's enjoyment.A puzzling mystery was set out, the Legal Forensics Specialist (as he would be called in today's book of similar type) called in to resolve certain aspects of the crime, he questioned, poked around, collected evidence with his trusty helpmates, analyzed in his laboratory, spoke scientific to his associate, and cogitated. Then he began to unveil his solution, at considerable length and in considerable detail. That is the point at which I decided to leave the question mark in the title of the review. For some readers, I know, the detailed analysis will be chocolate ice cream with marshmallow and whipped cream on top. Others will have their eyes glaze over. I fell more into the latter than the former category; however, I could not understand how the elaborate unraveling of symbolism in the DaVinci Code could hold readers, who, like I, surely wanted the author to get ahead with his story and stop all that jabbering. For some reason, nevertheless, for a sufficient numbers of readers to make the author a millionaire, I don't know how many times over, all that jabbering was fascinating.Go figure.At any rate, despite my misgivings, I can give it qualified approval, it is a well conceived, and mostly well-written story, for some it will be first rate, for others it will be an eye-closer. Since it is available as an ebook online free of charge, with kindle downloading Freeman books (I did not check whether it has this one) for a buck a batch (and similar devices probably doing something about the same), I would urge the average reader, for whom the price of this edition gives pause (as it did me save for a bargain rate,) to take the appropriate alternative way to start with an author, who, if he pleases you, is available inexpensively in increasing numbers of books."},{"Title":"Felo de se?","review":"An attractive, cultured young man from Australia squanders his fortune on reckless gambling. When his bank account is empty, he commits suicide. Blackmail letters are found in his desk. This looks like yet another explanation for why this once well-to-do man lost his money and his will to live. His cousin from Australia wants the blood of the blackmailers. Dr. Thorndyke is retained to investigate.I had to look up the meaning of \\"felo de se.\\" It's an archaic legal term for suicide, Latin for \\"felon of himself.\\" Suicide figures large in this story. The reader is treated to two unusual and suspicious suicides.Thorndyke senses something \\"abnormal\\" in the situation before him. Never too quick to accept appearances, he collects all sorts of unlikely evidence and information that seems quite irrelevant to his somewhat dim sidekick Dr. Jarvis. Thorndyke's findings are a total surprise to everyone (me included).The crime at the heart of this novel is, to quote Thorndyke, \\"the boldest and most skillful that I have ever known.\\" It's a pleasure to watch the wily doctor connect far-flung dots of circumstantial evidence.Freeman is especially good at portraying British eccentrics. The standout in this novel is Mr. Weech, custodian of Clifford Inn, scene of the Australian gentleman's suicide. This old relic of the Victorian era wears a frock coat, always carries an umbrella and loves to spout Latin quotes, which he invariably mispronounces.The novel is devoid of any romantic subplot. The single-minded focus is on Thorndyke's abstruse scientific methods and extraordinary powers of deduction - and the considerable complexities of the mystery.Some readers might consider the Thorndyke mysteries a bit dated. But for me, the vintage flavor of these books is their great appeal. The deeper I go into the Dr. Thorndyke series, the more I feel that Freeman is my favorite mystery writer from the Golden Age of detective fiction."},{"Title":"Adventures With a Hand Lens","review":"It has always annoyed me that toy shops are full of cheap microscopes but few good magnifiers. Children are more interested in that range of things which are a bit too small to see by eye alone, but too big to put on a microscope slide. Mr. Headstrom here provides a set of 50 &quot;adventures&quot; using an ordinary magnifying glass or hand lens to examine many of Nature's small wonders. It is a brief but detailled guide to the study of insects, flowers, and seeds, with occasional visits to the slimy side of nature; snails, leeches, and the like. Some of the adventures are for the shoreline, others merely to the backyard or nearby pond, but all are fruitful, well-described, and illustrated with line drawings. The book is a reprint of the 1962 edition, but is only charmingly dated. The language is a bit stiff for younger readers, but it would be an excellent guide for the parent/child team of explorers."},{"Title":"Adventures With a Hand Lens","review":"Great little book.

Instead of following each one of the four intriguing cases to its conclusion, Horn divides the cases between several chapters. The large number of names becomes confusing and readers may find themselves flipping back to previous chapters about a particular case to refresh their memories about who was who in the 1951 Sanseverino case, the 1988 Diefenbach case, the 1977 Stapleton case, or the 1996 Leon/Martinez case. The book is wonderfully \\"real\\" and informative, but I will recommend skipping chapters, reading about one case in its entirety first before moving to another one. I think that will make for a smoother reading experience."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"I mean that literally. Horn's book was one of those where I'm in bed reading, it's way past my bedtime, and I keep thinking \\"Just one more page...\\"Here's what you get between the covers: real, sometimes flawed heroes, and heartbreakingly real vicitims, and the very real and therefore sometimes flawed process by which the murderers are tracked down and brought to justice. There are a number of unsolved murder stories that loop back and forth and over and through each other, and the book's structure makes that work. It's a page turner that defies expectations.Or, put simply: an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"A disclaimer: Horn is gripping for reasons already noted on this page: her aptitude for getting deep under the skin of her subjects, and bringing that depth deep under the skin of her readers. Her captivating voice and yen for the finer details of procedure, of files, of inventory. Her compassion for the dead and use of the book as a eulogy for them.Et cetera.But: here's what's absolutely remarkable about it. Walking around the streets of Brooklyn (and though The Restless Sleep is local to New York, these stories can be dropped onto any city, really), you feel you've been treated to a history lesson, a detailed reminder of the ghosts in the buildings, under the streets, in the waters around you. This morbid niche of history helps comprise the breathing pulse of a city, and this is the moral lesson here.And: what matters most-- it's simply a great read."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

The reality of big city police administrations and big city police egos as they impact the investigative process were excellently presented, explained and documented within this book. I would certainly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"\\"The Restless Sleep,\\" Stacy Horn's new book about new York City's Cold Case Squad is unique among recent true crime books or police procedurals. This is mostly due to Horn's own obsessions (chronicled in two previous non-crime-related books) with death, loss and the ephemeral nature of life and human relationships. It may seem to make her an odd match for a book about a police work, but it's actually a perfect choice.After deploying all of her considerable charms (and baking skills) to befriend the cops, Horn uses the stories of the Cold Case squad as a window through which she allows the reader to experience the relentless and genuinely heartbreaking way criminal cases get under the skin of cops, victims, survivors and perpetrators alike and never let go, even after decades have passed. And along the way you get some novel insights into NYC Police Dept politics pre-and post-9/11, an vivid recreation of 1950s Brooklyn (and the tragic effects the big town can have on dreamy small town girls), a sad look at the threadbare seediness of the mob today, and countless details about procedure -- from booking to paperwork to how the \\"lab\\" we hear so much about on tv really works -- that give an authentic picture of day-to-day police life. And all of this is recounted without a lot of put-on authorial mannerisms. Horn is \\"there\\" with the reader, she writes like someone you might actually know telling you about this fascinating stuff she's been getting into lately. And that's part of the book's charm: it's Horn's story too, told in a voice that's always personal, often plaintive and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.I have now given or recommended Restless Sleep to many people. One recipient was, like me, a big fan of \\"Waiting For My Cats to Die\\" (Horn's previous book). This recipient protested that she had no interest in cops or crime, but after she read the Restless Sleep she said she realized that it didn't matter. That it was Horn's voice, her point of view and her underlying obsessions that made the book so moving and compelling. (Though I think we both have a newfound appreciation for police work.)"},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"As a retired S.F. police detective I found the language, the description, the feel of it all, right on the money. Ms. Horn has given readers of police procedurals a gift. I was left wondering how she got those New York detectives to open up so clearly, but she obviously did. A great read."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"I wanted to like The Restless Sleep. The Preface gave me signs of what I thought was going to be a fast-paced read. I thus waded in to learn about how the NYPD attempts to resolve cold cases.Soon though I was bogged down in constantly breaking trains of thought, much irrelevant detail and seemingly aimless crisscrossing, and quick about-faces that had no obvious connection to the supposed main thread of the book; I often got lost.One of the toughest jobs of nonfiction writing about police investigation is to take command of the mountains of tidbits of information that form the main stream of evidence required to get a conviction, not to mention the personalities involved in the process: officers, criminals, witnesses, family members, bystanders, seemingly unconnected people who turn up to be key figures in the case, and so much else.This is the huge flood of material that would drown even the most organized, expert author unless he/she establishes from the outset a \\"battle plan\\" of how to organize and present all these mounts of information into a piece of streamlined narrative, especially if the work is addressed to the vast audience of non-specialists.Stacy Horn most obviously did not have such a \\"battle plan.\\" Throw in what I felt was an understated, but still apparent, effort to make the language sound \\"street tough\\" and you have a recipe that won't turn out good. And breaking the stories of the individual cold cases across separate chapters contributed keenly to the confusion the reader faces from the beginning pages of the book.I rarely, if ever, put down a book before I finish it. With The Restless Sleep I was tempted. This was a pity because from a technical point of view the pursuit of cold cases is extremely interesting and a subject that can draw the undivided attention of even \\"general readers.\\" The Restless Sleep though fails to make the grade -- completely."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. While I was reading it was able to place myself in the book which is good cause I am able to catch the stories better as I read. The only thing that I didn't like was that I was kept in suspense cause not all the cases were solved."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"My interest in cold case squads and non-fiction crime books was nil until I read Stacy Horn's eminently readable and educative book about the New York cold case squad. Becoming acquainted with the men who spend their working hours trying to clear up the most difficult cases has made me aware of the job they do as no other book has done. The personalities come alive as their focus on clearing up these sad cases is made vibrant by Horn's personal style and extensive research. I would recommend this book to anyone, even those who think they are not interested in true crime stories."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"\\"Right now you have an almost 50% chance of getting with murder in New York; 49.3% of the murders committed in 2003 remain unsolved. That figure of the murders committed in 2003 remain unsolved. That figure will drop in 2004, but not by much. An unsolved murder has up to 5 to 10% chance of being cleared within one year after it goes cold. After two years, that chance decreases to less than 1 percent . If you murdered someone in 2000 and you're not in jail already, you're in the clear. You got away with it. Congratulations.\\"Let us begin, now with the extraneous out of the way, with one iron clad rule as concerns this book: it is not for the faint of heart.By that, I mean that the reader should be dedicated to understanding the details, a genuine True Crime afficiando and one who reads to understand the nuances and enjoy a depth of minutiae that would intimidate a more timid reader.This is, as indicated, a story of a cold case unit. Along with the details, trails, evidence, alibis and other investigative information of the crimes chosen to be illustrative of a cold case in this book, there is also the intriguing political and corporate process involved in setting up, financing, supervising and in general, running a cold case unit.Fascinating stuff. But again, not for the faint of heart.To a reader devoted to the convoluted stories of the sad crimes left unpunished and unresolved, this is a compelling read. The author did a fantastic job with the detail, the presentation of the details, and with how the book was written.The author chose several unsolved crimes that were being investigated by the NY cold case unit. The crimes were varied enough to provide the reader with the many sorts of crimes that are part of the cold case unit and the many difficulties, the heartbreaks, the differences in who was killed, those left behind and, of course, the investigation of them all so many years after the fact. The author tells the story of individual investigations, not all at once, but in \\"chapters\\" of the cold case investigation. She'll give details of the crime, the assignment of the cold case, the background of the investigating detective, the research involved, the search for long forgotten witnesses. Just when a major climax is reached in the investigation, the author moved onto another cold case. After a few more introductions of other cold case investigations, the author returns to the original cold case. And so on like so throughout the book. This method kept this reader spellbound for the entire story.Linda Leon and Esteban Martinez were drug dealers. They were also parents of three small children. These children were in the home when their parents were so brutally murdered. It's a compelling story of the investigation, the lies, the travel, the sorry lives of those who committed the crime.The murderer of Jean Sanseverino had yet to be brought to justice. Someone strangled Sanseverino and defecated all over her dead body. The reader follows the investigation of this case, over twenty years past at the time of the book's writing. The reader too tries to deduce which of Jean's many lovers might have been so angry with her to do such an awful thing or wait, could it have been Jean's estranged husband? There's hints of another possible perp but for whatever reason, he was never investigated, his alibi never fully verified.Christine Diefenbach was just 14 years old when she was murdered, so brutally beaten that her ears were torn off. The reader silently roots for the investigating detective to find the monster who took such a young girl's life. Christine would have been 28 years old when I read this book. She should be married or in love, maybe with children of her own. Yet someone murdered her and no one knows why. Her parents suffer her loss every day of their lives.It's these stories and more, mob hits, cruel deaths, that remain unsolved. Cold case units receive more funds today with the advances of DNA evidence. In this book, like the reality of cold case units, some of the cases are solved, some have the perps brought to justice, some remain unsolved. Some times the murderers get caught, many years long after they thought they'd gotten away with it. Often they don't.In every case it's a fascinating story as investigators re-trace history, lost evidence, dead witnesses and find one murderer all warm and happy after leaving the innocents behind that they killed and it's all worth the effort, time and money.True Crime afficiandos of the strongest and most devoted will absolutely love this book.================http://fishbookreviews.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"Finally read The Restless Sleep, and wish I had read it earlier. It was a window into both the cold case investigations and, as compelling, the culture and politics of New York law enforcement.

No technical razzle-dazzle was involved in solving the two cases that were solved - just a lot of shoe leather. In the first case the key was rethinking assumptions and then going in another direction. The second case got underway when an individual arrested for still another crime wanted to give information on the 20+ year-old case in return for leniency. The detectives' ability to elicit cooperation was important in both cases.One of the two unresolved cases was over 50 years old when turned over to the Cold Case Squad. While the detective did have a strong hunch as to the killer's identify, he was unable to prove it or obtain a confession before the individual died. Why the case was even taken up or featured in the book is beyond me. The other unsolved case was largely frustrated by lost evidence.The book also reviews the history of the NYPD Cold Case Squad and associated interdepartmental politics - neither of any interest to me."},{"Title":"The Restless Sleep: Inside New York City's Cold Case Squad","review":"Disorganized.

This story follows two separate yet similar threads. Firstly, a world war 2 cargo ship sinks to bottom of ocean and its 5 remaining inhabitants miraculously manage to find a way to survive in their very limited ecosystem. (OK, this does require some suspension of disbelief but it's amazing what you can do with a few bean plants, a dynamo for light, and a very large stock of canned food!) As two of the inhabitants are female nature follows its course and we end up following the lives of generations to whom the surface above has become a myth.Meanwhile, an exodus of spaceships fleeing a dying planet faces its own problems. The crew was to spend most of the centuries long journey in cryosleep, with periodic awakenings to check controls etc. Unfortunately the freezing process is discovered to cause brain damage if repeated too often, so the only solution is for a small number of crew to remain permanently awake, over many generations.As with his Sector General novels, some of the main protagonists are the ships' doctors, and the interactions within the two communities are sympathetically and engagingly plotted. I'm not going to say any more about the plot, as it's fairly easy to guess where the aliens will end up! As a stand alone book, I prefer this to the Sector General series, and I am very glad it has received a well-deserved reprint.

This is how they met.'The five humans are struck by torpedoes in 1938 and their ship is partially submerged. They must eek out a living with very limited resources including generators, oxygen tanks, beans, and canned food. Even surviving for one year on these materials would have been beyond belief but White pens the story through numerous generations, which falls into the realm of oh-come-on! By grudgingly putting believability aside, the story can read pretty well. In parallel to this is the more believable alien exodus. These hydro-origin beings are on a course to a star many years away so they must put themselves into a cryo-sleep to wait out the trip. One flaw: it doesn't seem to work right in space and successive periods of sleep render the awoken less and less intelligent. Solution: an impromptu generation ship to guide the fleet to the star.Reading the paralleling stories is gripping, something which cannot be said for White's Lifeboat novel which features human passengers fleeing from a destroyed space liner. Putting believability aside and reading about the similar plights between the alien planet-escaping exodus and the human struggle to survive though dim in prospect.It was all a great read until, \`This is how they met.' It was pretty much downhill in the last 15% of the book when earth's military becomes involved and distracts the continuity of the parallel stories. The concept of the analogous stories is the key feature (again, putting aside the oh-come-on feeling). White is also tongue in cheek about the characters attitude towards the possibility of having to stay in the sunken ship for generations and the pair-bonding they will have to do. Unlike many authors of the same era, White skirts the issue with conversation-studded \`umms' and \`ers' and \`wells' without losing traction from the plot flow."},{"Title":"The Watch Below","review":"I stumbled across James White when I was a young teen and I adored his sci fi titles. He brings alien cultures and personalities to life, and his writing is full of conflict, crisis, action, logic, and problem solving that is hallmark of any good sci fi novel.I discovered my love for scifi in the late nineties so I read all the greats at around the same time with fresh eyes. I was always surprised that James White wasn't as well known and well read because to me his work is just as entertaining as Heinlein and Asimov - different, don't flame me, I'm not comparing him to them - but very entertaining and readable."},{"Title":"The Watch Below","review":"James White, famous for his Sector General series, spins a disturbing tale of two isolated and decaying societies -- one alien, one human. Without doubt the work demands a certain suspension of disbelief. The isolated human society half of the premise comes off as highly artificial/improbably/impossible (and, well, bluntly put, hokey). I found the alien half of the story line a more \\"realistic\\" situation but less emotionally involving as the human half. White has difficultly meshing the trans-generational nature of both story lines -- and the inevitable intersection at the end is predictable, anti-climactic, and dents the great appeal of the central portion of the work.Lest this dissuade you, White's dark vision is a transfixing take on the generation ship (literally) -- how would a society descended from five individuals evolve for a hundred years trapped in the hull of a vessel deep underwater with only a memory game, the groans of the hull, a flicking garden light, piles of dried food, a generator, and intense cold to keep them occupied? \\"The Game had become so much a part of their lives that it would have been harder to stop playing it than it would have been to stop breathing\\" (116).Brief Plot Summary (some spoilers)In the year 1942 German submarine sinks a special anti-submarine cargo ship. Thankfully the vessel contains huge stores of food and supplies and a special re-enforced hull. The three men and two women (one wounded) trapped below expect to be rescued at any moment but soon realize that it's not probable. This is by far the least interesting section of the novel detailing how they figure out how keep at each others throats, couple-off discretely, and survive (they keep the air clean with a garden, set up a generator, huddle under sacks to keep warm, try to calm the hysterical women, have children, etc.). And set up The Game... To remain sane each person recalls the smallest details of books (C. S. Forester's Hornblower Series, the Bible, pulp sci-fi, etc), childhood events events (birthdays, etc), everything... It evolves into more than an obsession - the only source of knowledge accessable for the future generations.After the descendants of the first generation enter the fray, White enters disturbing (and fascinating) territory. Not only have the descendants never been outside but their entire world view is premised on the information passed down by the Game -- i.e. what tidbits their parents happened to remember. Eventually some question the veracity of the information in the Game at all. And of course, at least one member of each generation dreams of escape -- and tries. All the while the windows cloud over with algae, diseases ravish their malnourished bodies, the hull rusts, the lights run out (and the generator slowly stops working), and the cold grows more and more oppressive...The parallel story line chronicles the generations of an ocean dwelling alien species (who generally act like humans). The oceans on the aliens' world were evaporating due to the growing temperature of their sun -- desperate measures are taken. The aliens pour all their resources into the construction of gigantic generation ships. The passengers of the ships are cryogenically frozen and expect to be woken up in cycles to operate the vessels... However, they soon discover that repeated thawing has a detrimental effect on the mind. Another plan is hatched -- a small group of aliens on the flagship will remain unfrozen and create a society to maintain the ship on its journey to a new ocean world.The new ocean world is Earth!Final ThoughtsWhite purposefully inflicts the same forces on both the isolated alien and human societies - genetic degradation (diseases, compromised intelligence, etc) and societal changes due to the ship becoming \\"the world.\\" However, I never felt like the aliens were sufficiently alien -- which I surmise is White's point. All sentient life will respond similarly when presented with desperate situations.Despite the inherently ridiculous situation of humans living for a hundred years underwater in a \\"special\\" cargo ship, I found their story line (especially The Game) fascinating and emotionally involving -- there's a scene where the descendants listen to the helmet of a boy trying to escape scrapping along the bottom of the vessel which gave me the chills. When the story lines intersect White is too hasty tying up all the strings -- 189 pages for a trans-generational and trans-species narrative is not enough!Recommended."},{"Title":"The Watch Below","review":"This book was one my brother had that I read many years ago. I found my old copy and it was pretty shot. Glad to have found and good copy and throughly enjoyed reading it again. It is an incredible story."},{"Title":"I, Michelangelo, sculptor; an autobiography through letters","review":"A wonderful book. By reading his actual letters he sent and received, you get a very good understanding of how hard his life was."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"It is our weakness to blame the messenger. James Randi, a professional magician, extremely intelligent and honest writer, and an extremely cinical skeptic, is usually the target of &quot;believers&quot; of the paranormal (as you will notice on the &quot;reviews&quot; of his books). Clearly, it is hard to accept that at some time or another, our leg has been pulled, and Randi is the first to let you know, in the most blunt way possible.This book is not really about demonstrating that Geller is a fraud. Randi simply demonstrate that all the paranormal feats of the famous psychic can be duplicated (Randi himself has done them in TV and personal appearances). That people decide to believe the most fantastical explanation is another different issue.Another thing worth mentioning is that this book includes excerpts from articles from magazines and newspaper, which shows that Randi was not alone in his skepticism.A final notice is that if you enjoy this book, you will find more information on &quot;Flim-Flam!&quot;, by the same author. There he presents new information, including his meeting with one of Geller's helpers, who confesses to having participated in the tricks, sometimes throwing things for apparent &quot;materializations&quot;.But, if you feel comfortable with &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, and don't want to be confronted with facts and more credible alternate explanations, then don't try Randi."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Personally I found this book very interesting and it's also interesting to read through all the reviews here also. I am amazed at the number of people who willingly believe in such phenomenon as spoon-bending or ESP despite the fact that evidence to the contrary might exist! Can't you have an open mind either way? (I admit now that I lean towards skepticism - but I am always willing to listen to both sides providing accurate evidence exists.)I also find it preposterous that so many people think that Randi is jealous of Geller or anything like that. If you've read this book and have that attitude then you've missed one of the key points of the book completely. Randi doesn't object to Geller's tricks - just his attitude in doing them. Magicians do tricks - and admit that they're tricks even if they don't reveal exactly how they're done. But when a man like Geller performs tricks, claims they're genuine and in doing this, deceives right-minded and otherwise right-thinking people, then this gives cause for concern. By all means, Geller can be (and is!) a showman - but there's no need to lie to people in that manner. That helps nobody and that is all Randi really objects to."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"...promotes magical thinking. And Randi is not in need of work ...he has a thriving second career helping people understand how to keep from being flummoxed - which in this day and age is sorely needed. This is vintage skepticism, by a crack charlatan himself (I mean that in a good way). I have hosted a live TV appearance by Randi, and he has made my jaw drop from some of the very same things Geller claims are done by psychic powers. My wonder is in the ability of some to manipulate the perceptions of others. The difference is that James is trying to draw a line which people can use to distinguish the truly marvelous from the merely farcical. Uri should aspire to so much. If he has such powers as he claims - why would he squander them on the wanton destruction of flatware? On it goes, to others' claims of increased crop yields, to telepathy (so go make a fortune at the poker table!)... I would be deliriously happy to find someone who could read my students' minds - it would shave YEARS off the education process alone &lt;grin&gt;. But alas, we are left with wholly unremarkable examples of allegedly earth-shattering powers. And it makes people think that magic will change or save them. It is magical thinking that degrades individuals' trust in their own true abilities, and it was magical thinking (unabashed finger-crossing) that killed seven brave astronauts in 1986. Enough is enough, Bravo Randi - and touche' Geller. Read it, then decide. *JP*"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Skepticism, it seems to me, should be at the core of every intelligent person's thinking processes. The history of mankind illustrates quite clearly that the world is full of frauds who will promise anything that will part people from their money, or reel them into a destructive belief system. That is how cults come to be. Scepticism is our only defense in such a world.Unfortunately, many, and it often seems, most, people are so hungry for \\"meaning\\" that they put their critical thinking processes on hold. They forget that they are taking things on faith and come to feel that they are believing in bedrock truth.That's where science comes in. Science provides the rigor that helps prevent us from succumbing to frauds and even our own delusions. It exposes Korean doctors who have made extraordinary claims about genetic research. And it exposes frauds who claim psychic abilities but can only deliver them when they aren't under scrutiny.I'd like to remind you of a couple scientific principles.First: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. If I claim to do something psychically that thousands of magicians can do through sleight of hand, I should be expected to prove it.Second: Occam's razor, one of the oldest principles in science, which states that in the presence of alternative explanations for a phenomenon, give preference to the simplest. It's simpler to believe that if a magician can do the trick, rather than requiring psychic powers. This isn't an infallible rule. Einstein isn't simpler than Newton. But Einstein has been subjected to rigorous testing, and Einstein explains things Newton doesn't. Uri Geller can make no such claims.It's telling that not a single replicated scientific study has entered the literature. And it's telling that none of the many lucrative prizes awaiting the first person to demonstrate true psychic ability has ever been claimed.James Randi has performed a valuable service over the years. It's unfortunate that frauds still find a ready market for their wares. Still, we owe him a vote of thanks."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"It's always interesting to analyze the patterns involving timing, word selection, writing style, and (of course) ANONYMITY that accompanies many (or most) reviews that try either to entirely praise a given book (or movie, etc.) or completely criticize another one.Here, for instance, are just some of the patterns involving the 35 previously submitted reviews of James Randi's The Truth About Uri Geller -- which were submitted between 2 Feb 1997 and 29 Aug 2005:On being ANONYMOUS:1) 1-Star -- 9 of 10 (90%)2) 2-Star -- There were none.3) 3-Star -- 1 of 3 (33%)4) 4-Star -- 3 of 3 (100%)5) 5-Star -- 4 of 19 (21%)On Timing of Submission:1) 8 of the 10 (80%) 1-Star reviews were submitted between 2 Aug 1998 and 3 Sep 2000.2) 7 of the 10 (70%) 1-Star reviews were submitted between 2 Aug 1998 and 8 Feb 1999.On Word Selection and Writing Style:The 1-Star reviews overwhelmingly revert to either ad hominem verbal attacks against Randi or flat-out putdowns of his book -- rather than attempting to \\"prove\\" Geller's abilities or disprove Randi's findings. Examples include, \\"[the book is] a joke,\\" \\"useless and ridiculous,\\" \\"[Randi is] a SAD SAD man,\\" \\"a BITTER and AWFUL book,\\" \\"unreadable,\\" \\"RANDI IS A JEALOUS NASTY UNHAPPY MAN,\\" \\"narrow-mindedness, \\"The book is claptrap,\\" and \\"Appalling\\".When reading the 1-Star (lowest possible at Amazon) reviews, I was impressed by the remarkable similarity in writing style and tone that most of them displayed.CONCLUSION:I would venture that Uri Geller wrote between 7-9 of the 9 ANONYMOUS 1-Star reviews -- in an early effort to dissuade Amazon customers from buying or reading this book. This is not an unknown phenomenon at Amazon: case in point is a movie entitled \\"H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds,\\" which was apparently timed for DVD release and sale (Jun 2005) just as Spielberg's WOTW was hitting (or soon to hit) the movie theaters. Several very credible Amazon reviewers noted the amazing similarity of the large number and percentage of POSITIVE reviews for this poorly produced movie -- speculating that the backers of this \\"rip-off\\" movie were simply trying to counterbalance the overwheming negative reviews of the DVD. If you have the time, check it out -- as it makes for some interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Anyone who denies Randi's logic or disputes his facts hasn't fully read or fully understood the book. Randi expresses a great respect for Geller's methods as a magician even calling himself one of Geller's &quot;greatest fans&quot;.

Rather than add to the noise,I shall point out my favorite chapter: the response to Randi's exposeby other magicians, who knew exactly what Geller was doing and howhe did it. Some of them were outraged by the apparent breaking ofthe magician's code, which prohibits one from explaining another'stricks. Other practitioners defended Randi, on the grounds thatGeller did claim his tricks were evidence of supernatural powers,and encouraged a dangerous guilibilty in mass audiences. A letterfrom an Indian describing how a \\"holy man\\" in his country was usingsimple slight of hand to manipulate his followers was particularlymemorable.If you are a true believer who wants to continue to believe, don'tread this book; but if you have an open mind, and want both apowerful debunking and a really fun story, give it a try. I preferredthe original title: \\"The Magic of Uri Geller.\\""},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"I remember Uri Geller appearing on the TV many years ago around 1974. I was only 8 years old at the time. We were told that this man could bend spoons and make watches start, even if they were put in front of the TV! My brother and I were so scared, we hid all the spoons in the house before to show started. So, Uri Geller spooked a couple of kids in Australia. The point is, we did not know better. It's a pity that he was able to the same to adults would really should know better. He's still out there, bending spoons.... Thank you Mr. Randi for a great book. Time for an update?"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Are there people out there who still believe that Uri Geller - the famous Israeli spoon-bender and mindreader - possesses some sort of paranormal abilities and that the entire scientific community is flabbergasted each time he performs some of his trademark oddities?Well, unfortunately yes. Because, apparently, not all have had the pleasure of reading James Randi's book The Truth About Uri Geller. Because after you've done that you don't have too many reasons left to believe Geller is some sort of paranormal guru. Now this is not the first book I've read written by a skeptic and published by Prometheus Books, but I doubt that I've ever read a book that more efficiently exposes so-called paranormal claims. Randi, a professional magician and illusionist, shows just as effectively as humorously (yes, he has a great sense of humor, especially when he turns sarcastic) how Geller isn't any different from traditional magicians and illusionists, except that he claims to do it the paranormal way. In other words, whatever Geller does has been done before, and the bending of spoons and reading of minds happens every day for your average magician. The difference is that Geller refuses to change his mind about his paranormal abilities. Randi willingly admits that there's nothing paranormal at all in his work, and he's able to duplicate every single act that Geller does.Geller is very skilled at his trade, no question about it, and if tens of thousands of people all over the world are amused by his performances, then why criticize him? Well, just like Randi says again and again, there's a huge difference between being an ordinary magician and perform mysterious - but honest - feats and making large sums of money by claiming to be something you're not. Magic, as done by Randi et.al, is all about fooling people, that's true, but what Geller does is exploiting peoples' gullibility to the extreme. And there's nothing honest in fooling people into believing things that have proven to be untrue.One of the highlights of the book comes on page 151, where an article from Hebrew magazine Haloam Hazeh is published in its entirety. This article, which has never before been available in English, clearly shows how Geller has been a hoaxer from the start. It's a real eye-opener.It's quite fascinating to see how the phenomenon Uri Geller has been treated by the media, especially in the West. Randi gives numerous examples of how magazines have refused to publish negative and exposing articles about Geller, and it's clearly shown how people think and act in a certain way that confirms their already made up minds. People have a tendency to see what they want and expect to see, and rarely has this been demonstrated better than in The Truth About Uri Geller.The only negative thing about the book is the truly worthless quality of the photographs. This is extremely unfortunate, since they are there to demonstrate how Geller performs his so-called \\"paranormal\\" feats. It boggles my mind that not more effort was put into this."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"If you are thinking of buying this book. DON'T BOTHER. It is useless and ridiculous, so don't waste your money. James Randi is clearly JEALOUS of URI GELLER because Uri has the power to do good in this world, where as Randi has only the power to put others down. What a SAD SAD man. I have never read such a BITTER and AWFUL book in my life as this.RANDI, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED. You are evil on earth."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"The Truth About Uri Geller needs to be included in the discussion regarding whether Mr. Geller is a fraud or a geniune 'sensitive.' Clearly, one must look at his feats critically and determine whether they could be performed using simple or sophisticated magic tricks. James Randi does this. Randi makes us look at Geller more carefully. Geller is a showman and might resort to trickery at times. However, this isn't the WHOLE story. While some of his feats can be performed by a magician, there are many published accounts of Geller performing under circumstances where trickery seems unlikely-if not impossible. These are reports from well-respected researchers and magicians alike. If you want a more complete look at Geller, read The Geller Papers. (They are online.) Randi may think he has fully debunked Geller and anyone who still considers the alternative is gullible and childish, needing something desperately to give their life meaning. The evidence, however, indicates that sometimes bizarre events occur around Geller that magicians simply can't reproduce. I would also like to note that Randi's discussion of the Targe &amp; Putoff experiments are inaccurate. He makes significant claims that others directly involved refute. These people are skeptical themselves so it isn't bias that motivates them."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Reading this book is almost impossible. It is poorly written, and mostly boring. In some parts, the ones in which the author attempts to explain how Geller supposedly cheated on some of his scientific test, the book reads like a Tom Clancy novel - without the suspense.

Randi's book about Uri Geller is riddeled and loaded with lies and errors and it is totally one sided. It's my opinion that Randi is utterly obsessed with Geller. From newspaper articles I have learned that James Randi lost a major libel suit and was found guilty by a jury in a court of law in Baltimore, MD for lying maliciously. So why should anyone believe anything he says or writes."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Okay so what is the truth about Uri Geller? Well I'm afraid that even after reading this book you still won't know the truth about Uri Geller... well that's the title of this book dealt with already! The rest of the pages between the covers can be dealt with just as simply and efficiently. Sure, you might get a rough idea about how the famous &quot;Psychic-&quot;Superstar&quot; does what he does - very rough idea - but it is it really the &quot;truth&quot; as this book promises? After reading James Randi's book, I can promise that it'll leave a bitter taste - the taste of a hatchet job which at times almost appears to be a personal attack. I find that this book begs the question why someone of James Randi's calibre as a magician should be so obsessed with writing a tome simply to disparage someone else... isn't Mr. Randi getting enough work in his own line of entertainment? The feeling one gets from this book is that James Randi would really like to know how Uri Geller does what he does... and as Mr. Randi can't really figure out the real mechanics behind Uri Geller's effects he sets out simply to give his own invented versions. It has been said that &quot;attacking is the best form of defence...&quot; and therefore I wonder what Mr. Randi is defending himself against? Could it be that it is far easier to attack someone else rather than concentrate upon his career? I'm sure that he could come up with a couple of effects which no-one could ever reveal as to how they were done... or could he? I also wonder why James Randi hasn't worked through all the other entertainers who are closer to his own line of entertainment? After all, does David Copperfield really fly? Do Seigfried and Roy really manifest lions and tigers from thin air? You could go on to other fields such as: How exactly does a surgeon save a life when the patient is suffering from a fatal disease that should really have killed them? How the heck did Michealangelo produce such beautiful works of art? How could someone like Mother Theresa have such a profound effect on the world? ... and how exactly did a quiet unassuming woman like Rosa Parks summon up such immense courage? Now these really are magic... and not the &quot;pulling a rabbit from a top hat&quot; or &quot;a silk from a thumb tip&quot; type variety. Whether Uri Geller produces his effects by trickery is neither here nor there. You believe what you believe and millions of people do... it's their choice! It's also YOUR choice to believe what YOU believe! The fact that Uri Geller constantly encourages a positive frame of mind can't be that bad... can it? Finally I leave you with these questions. Would you read a book by Richard Clayderman denouncing Liberace as a second-rate pianist perhaps because he might not have used the correct fingering when playing minor chords? Or how about a book by Tom Jones damning Elvis Presley as a third rate singer... come to think of it, that book has already been done! Remember Albert Goldman's book? No? Not many people do... and those that do simply remember it as yet another hatchet job... ... just like this one!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Seldom have I read a book that is so filled with garbage that purports to be &quot;facts&quot;.

Uri Geller and others are incidental.All of his books are biased - the only things that he has printed in them is forcing his point of view, whatever he chooses to believe as the \\"truth\\".His books have nothing to do with any scientific research or proofs - they seem to come from an adolescent rebel. His entire attitude is \\"I dare you to show me the proof, but I'll make sure to get you to see only what I want you to see, because I don't care to be objective - I only care to prove that I am right - even I'm wrong. And any evidence to the contrary, I'll find the way to delete.\\"The only thing that Randi seems to delight in disseminating is anger - not information. There is some deep unhappiness in Randi, and that has nothing to do with Uri Geller - it has to do with Randi being pissed with his own little limited world, because there's more to this world than meets the eye, but Randi doesn't know how to get it so it thrills him to deny even the possibility of such pleasure to everyone else.Randi is hiding his own dark secrets that he is terrified to face and just as magicians and illusionists use distraction to get your attention elsewhere, so is he so badly attempting to distract both himself and others from what truly ails me. Now Uri Geller and others are supposed to serve as scapegoats for Randi's feeings of unhappiness and lack of self-worth, because now that he has happily managed to put others down - he's bound to feel million times better about himself. Now, finally he can perceive himself as a saint - or at least fake it as long as he can.As for the rest, before you do judge Uri Geller, or whomever else Randi is pointing his finger at - get to know those people personally with an open-mind.

Good book!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Randi does a good job exposing Geller. The only problem is that sometimes Randi doesn't go all the way and reveal the magic trick for fear of giving away magician's secrets. This book is out of print, since no one pays attention to Geller anymore (partly due to Randi's efforts).Having said that, I would also like to point out that Randi isn't always fair in his tests of psychics. I'm not endorsing psychics mind you, I just think Randi should give credit when it's due. For instance, when Randi was on the \\"Ron and Ron\\" radio show on WYNF in 1995(?), he asked psychic Gary Spivey what he would be doing on Wed. night. Spivey correctly guessed Randi would be flying on an airplane, to which Randi, who was obviously flustered, spat and sputtered and finally said \\"Well, anyone could have guessed that!\\" Later, host Ron Bennington pointed out, if \\"anyone\\" could have guessed, why did Randi ask it in the first place? Randi should have just laughed it off and said \\"OK, let's see you do that again!\\"So, how do I know Randi is right about Geller? When faced with the alternative of Uri Geller being given psychic powers by aliens or using magic tricks, I would take magic tricks as an eplanation."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"The title of my review must say it all.

I must say this is a Five Star book!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"The FACT that Geller had used deception EVER indicates that Geller is a fraud. It is simple logic - Randi doesn't have to prove that Geller deceived in EVERY instance, just some.And that he does.Geller fans should just get over it. Your boy lied. Randi caught on. Why else would a \\"Real Pychic\\" need to EVER use deception?"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"I find it hard to understand, that if what Uri Geller is telling us, about that he wishes that we could all have special powers like him. why is it that he beats about the bush, when he caims to want to tell us how he uses his so called powers. i sent Uri Geller a letter asking him if he could try to explain his powers in depth and he sent me back an autographed photo and a message telling me that if i wanted to understand his powers, i should buy his latest book! what a cheek! if you ask me its all a publisity stunt!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"I always thought Geller was a fraud.

Good show!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Uri Geller was hounded from his home country of Israel and then from his adopted country of America. This book was written near the start of his rise to fame in the early and mid-70s, but Geller hasn't changed his tricks so it's as relevant now as it was then.Geller claims to bend metal and read minds using psychic powers given to him by aliens. He says he never cheats. Randi's book boils down to this question: if any \\"psychic\\" feat can be convincingly replicated by a magician, should we believe someone who says he can do the same thing by psychic powers?How you answer the question depends on your worldview. If you care about the scientific method as the best way to determine truth about the world, you will find there is no evidence that Geller has psychic powers.As with all psychics who have undergone rigorous testing, Geller's powers fail to work when simple controls are put in place. These days most investigators are a little more savvy about how to deal with testing psychics, but in the 70s the psychics ran the show. Geller's so-called scientific testing at Sanford Research Institute was a joke, and Randi picks it apart piece by piece giving us all a sound lesson in experimental set-up in the process.Randi also reveals the techniques behind a few of Geller's tricks - not all, because Randi was a professional magician and it's bad form to give the game away. Randi also describes a few incidents where he replicated Geller's tricks and then revealed the trickery, in order to try and convince people to be more skeptical about the claims of psychics.Geller has learned to fool others. The important lesson from this book is that believers fool themselves. If paranormal abilities can't be demonstrated under controlled conditions, we are free to believe anything we like, ignoring the evidence that magicians can replicate the same feats. And believing anything on wishful thinking never gets us nearer the truth."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"This book is not a new book, but it still is very informative about how Uri Geller uses simple magic tricks and EXCELLENT misdirection and theatrical techniques to dupe/fool/entertain those that follow after him.James Randi has done other exposure books, but this one is very to the point, and leaves no doubt as to Uri's ability to fool and entertain.It is the first book I give to folks that mention about spoon bending and other supposed psychic powers."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Sorry, folks, Randi CANNOT prove that Geller is a fraud and does not have psychic powers.Randi gives in his book many occasions that show how Geller was caught cheating numerous times. But doesn't Mr. Randi *know* that it is *possible* that Mr. Geller only cheated in those instances where he was caught, and on all other occasions he was using psychic powers?Hey, it's *possible*.Sure, Randi also gives in his book a detailed analysis of all of Geller's psychic feats, and shows in detail how there isn't *one* reliable case of Geller doing something that cannot be duplicated by any moderately-talented stage magician. But doesn't Mr. Randi *know* that it is *possible* that, for some mysterious reason unknown to all the rest of manking, the universe had endowed Mr. Geller with psychic powers that just *happen* to *only* have effects that can be easily duplicated by using magic tricks?Hey, it's *possible*.Finally, Randi further notes in his book many incredibly tall tales Mr. Geller told people about himself. But that is not proof he is a liar, now is it? Doesn't Mr. Randi *know* it is quite *possible* that when Mr. Geller told a friend of his in Chappaqua, NY, that he (Geller) just teleported himself from Grand central terminal in NYC, Geller *might have been* telling the truth? Maybe Geller *didn't* simply take one of the dozen or so trains that run from Grand Central to Upstate NY every hour and stop in Chappaqua. Were you there, Mr. Randi? huh? were you!Hey, it's *possible*.So take *that*, you bad, bad skeptics! How *dare* you doubt the truth of Uri Geller's psychic power, just because he was lying and cheating numerous times and cannot really do anything that magicians cannot do by trickery. Perhaps he really is psychic. But Mr. Randi convinced me of one thing, and I quote: &quot;If Mr. Geller is bending spoons with psychic powers, he is doing it the hard way.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"As anyone with passing knowledge of logic can attest, you can't prove a negative. That is why our courts are set up so that the prosecutor has to prove a POSITIVE (e.g. that a crime was committed by the accused). Failure to prove a positive leads to the conclusion that the NEGATIVE must be the case. This means that it isn't up to Randi to prove that Geller is a fraud (that is well established by the many other illusionist who replicate his \\"feats\\", including Penn & Teller who do it much more entertainingly) but rather for Geller to prove that he has divine powers as he claims. Of course, he has not, and cannot prove the positive (e.g. that he has divine powers) and thus he is nothing more than a debunked magician. Indeed, in every case, at all times, in every place, when Geller exhibits \\"divine\\" powers, all the props are supplied by Geller himself. And in every case, at all times, in every place when others supplied the props, Geller has failed (as he did spectacularly on the Tonight Show when his props were replaced by common store-bought ones). The truly amazing thing to me is why so many folks are so eager to suspend common sense and pay money to a performer who demeans their intelligence. He's an illusionist folks!!"},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"It's suprising how many people I meet who still believe in Uri Geller. I can only hope for a future time when a little more skepticism prompts people to read more books like this one."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"Randi's book is an excellent an informative read for an aspiring magician, but it is too biased and non-objective to be taken very seriously. He never considers that Geller's alleged powers may be genuine -- he simply takes it for granted that they are and proceeds to explain how he would do the same tricks. Coming from someone who makes his living by trickery, this is not unexpected. Anyone who reads this book will be convinced that Geller is a charlatan -- whether he is or not. Randi is not a man who is skeptical here -- he is a man who is positive about things that he CANNOT know in an almost religious manner. His intentions are well, but he will only succeed in alienating the people who have the most to gain from reading this book, because of his apparent disrespect for logic and fair-play which he claims are so important to him. Even so, people who are inclined to believe that Geller's powers are real without questioning them are in for a rude awakening."},{"Title":"The Truth About Uri Geller","review":"NOW LOOK HERE!Believe me.I love James Randi. I REALLY do!.But,and this is quite a large \\"but\\", his real genius lies in being able (knowingly obviously) to frustrate us (the humble, admiring reading public) beyond measure!I've no doubt whatsoever that Mr Randi is able to replicate Geller's \\"tricks\\" in EXACTLY the same / unique way that \\"the world-famous spoon bender\\" does. I have Messrs Penn & Teller's word for that and that's good enough for me.Dont get me wrong , the book is definitely well researched .....or is it?How do we know it is?

Clarke stepped in and showed him his error -- Clarke, the inventor of the communications satellite, showed that Randi had erred in his analysis -- the probability against the dowsers achieving the score they did was roughly one-hundred to one. How seriously can you take such a man? Even when experiments do show evidence for the paranormal they are ignored. This book is very informative and entertaining, but should not be taken too seriously before weighing all of the facts on BOTH sides of the argument. The biggest putoff is that Randi seems to be so positive of himself -- there is never the slightest doubt that he could be mistaken about anything he does.

Set just before World War II, Van Loon and his dear friend Frits invite historical persons to Saturday night dinner in the charming little Dutch town of Veere by placing a slip of paper under the lions guarding the town hall. Their guests range from Erasmus (who takes a Sabbatical in Veere) to Emily Dickinson, Confucius to Leonardo da Vinci, Dante to Mozart, Ben Franklin to Cervantes. In the interests of \\"fairness\\", they also invite some less-appealing characters: Robespierre, Napoleon, Torquemada, Peter the Great, and the Bishops of Bithynia and Cyrenacia. Each chapter includes short, chatty biographies of the guests, a discussion of the food and wine served, and an account of the dinner. The book is engaging and makes history fun. But it is a serious work nonetheless: Van Loon warns urgently against the emerging threat of Nazi Germany and encourages us to value and protect the integrity of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Van Loon's Lives,: Being a true and faithful account of a number of highly interesting meetings with certain historical personages, from Confucius and ... to us as our dinner guests in a bygone year","review":"It's so simple. This is a GREAT book.This is a book that charms and enchants. It should be as well-known as the Narnia Tales, if Fate were fair. Join the central character of Erasmus, who is a regular visitor, and spend winter evenings with some the most interesting, fascinating, truly good and truly evil characters from history. You can read it cognizant of its WWII origins; or ignore that point and follow a dream . . . . that never ends. Step on the road, join in the evenings, and find refreshment and a deep understanding of human nature.I read it as teenager, and it draws me in still, to a past, a present, and a future of delight and wonder. There is no book like it in all literature. If you explore it, read about the author's life as well: it will enlarge your understanding and love for this almost forgotten yet great masterpiece.This book is a gift, an unexpected treasure, to match Montaigne's Essays, William James' Psychology, and so much that G. K. Chesterton wrote. An unexpected, deeply personal and lovely gift to us all. Lose yourself in its wonder, and find both quiet and laughter.

The truth is, that it is the ONLY book of its type. The only possible exception to that would be M. Segal's book from Oxford in 1927, but that book is out of date and was written only as a comprehensive reference grammar and not as a textbook.On the other hand, this book, (which, incidently, was first published in Spanish in 1992) is an lesson-by-lesson textbook designed to introduce you to Rabbinic Hebrew (i. e. of the Mishnah, Tosefta, etc.) and its culture and literature. It provides practice passages for reading and other exercises. So, besides, being an excellent (and so far the only) update to Segal's reference grammar, it is (as far as I know) the only _textbook_ of Rabbinic Hebrew ever written. So, if you interested in this subject, you have little choice but to buy this book."},{"Title":"An Introductory Grammar of Rabbinic Hebrew","review":"The only thing I can think to add to the previous review is that one does have to have a reasonable competence in Biblical (or perhaps Modern) Hebrew in order to use this book, tho' someone would be very unlikely to want to use it without first knowing biblical Hebrew. A copy of Segal's Mishnaic Hebrew grammar would be useful as a supplimentary reference, and a Biblical grammar too as this book is not strong on morphology. But syntax and idiom are very well handled and it is these that make the Mishnah so impenetrable.As to the \\"reasonable price\\", sadly this volume in paperback is at a typically exhorbitant Brill price. And the hardback is ridiculously costly. Still, there IS a paperback, so Brill are moving in the right direction!"},{"Title":"An Introductory Grammar of Rabbinic Hebrew","review":"Simply the best grammar ever published for rabbinic hebrew -- now that it's available at a reasonable price in paperback, go for it!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)","review":"The topics and concepts in this book are exceptionally well organized. After reading it from cover to cover, I could easily see how all the ideas and concepts fit into place. I have two main criticisms. First, the notation is sometimes non-standard, e.g. the r vector is used to denote the label vector and superscripts are used sometimes as subscripts. Second, the explanations are sometimes too brief. For example, when deriving the solution for Least Squares Regression with Quadratic Discriminants, Vandermode matrices are used but the author fails to identify them as such, or to explain why they are useful. If the author were to write an extra sentence on every other page, the explanations would be perfect!"},{"Title":"Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)","review":"I would like to congratulate the author on writing this book, which is crisp and covers whole range of topics. What I liked the most is a systematic disucssion on a wide variety of areas in machine learning with a certain degree of details.But at the same time, I will also say that the book at some places,(for eg the treatment of Multi Dimensional scaling and Linear discriminants analysis,) lacks depth in its derivations. Also if some explanatory examples are put,it would help the reader, who is doing a first time reading, in understanding the concepts.At the same time, I think the book achieves it's target of introducing to the reader, a whole gamet of techniques, at a fairly reasonable level. The book is no doubt, a nice and one-stop quick reference for many topics, as such. A commendable thing is an up to date errata maintained by the author, with latest editions made. I would recommend the book for a quick introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)","review":"I bought this for use as a reference book rather than a textbook.

Compared to 'Pattern Classification by Duda, Hart, and Stork', this book has a good balance between providing equations and explaining the idea behind the method. One thing that I like is that the author usually derives the equations. For example, I used the book to implement Hidden Markov Models algorithm in Java for classification. Especially, if you need a good source to learn Support Vector Machines, 'Chapter 10 Linear Discrimination' and 'Chapter 13 Kernel Machines' are the best of their kinds in the Machine Learning literature. Furthermore, examples shown in the figures are unique and very helpful to understand the topic. The author covers some methods that you usually see in the papers but not in the textbooks. Therefore, the book is also a good survey of Machine Learning techniques.

To bring myself up to speed, I picked up this book. Having had only minimal exposure to the algorithms that underlie machine learning, I found this introduction to be very useful. It starts with a concise, but by no means terse review of basic statistics which lays the foundation for the rest of the book. If you struggle to get through this review, or if it is new material, this may not be the book for you. I should say that the author does not shy away from using equations, but does not use them gratuitously either. He also does a reasonable job of not only explaining the steps that may not be intuitive as well as giving some motivation for what the equations actually mean.After reading this book, I can actually say that I have a much deeper understanding of many the algorithms discussed. I found the exposition on principle component analysis (PCA) to be very enlightening (I have come across PCA in my work and had not previously found an explanation that I could understand) and the whole chapter on dimensionality reduction fascinating. The chapters that discuss clustering and kernel methods were also good. Also, the way that each chapter, which roughly corresponds to a single method, first focuses on the way the algorithm can be used for classification and then the more general case of regression was well thought out.This book does have some drawbacks though. For instance, there are many careless typos in some chapters, making you wonder if they just forgot to proofread these chapters. Even more infuriating, I am fairly certain that I came across at least one equation that was misprinted. After just one wrong equation, you start to question the veracity of every one which you do not fully comprehend. Also, I must say that I still only vaguely understand how a multilayer percetron works even though it is a major focus of the book. Also, the chapter on Bayesian estimation was hard to follow.All in all, I think this book is well worth the price and that if you devote the time needed to read it you will learn a lot."},{"Title":"Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)","review":"I had a bachelor degree in computer science and now I am a student transportation.

One reason could be that a lot of people are not aware of the existence of this book.This is a top textbook for learning ML in an accessible way. ML is a lot of statistics mind you, so you certainly will have to supplement your readings with a Stats textbook (All of Statistics by Wasserman, would be a good companion to this book), but what this book does very nicely is to simplify the concepts considerably and make them more \\"assimilatable\\".Notations can be non-standard and sometimes you feel that the concepts are being watered down, but really take what you can from this book and then move to Tibshirani and Bishop's books - neither of these should be your first book if you are not a Stats major already.My only major grouse with this book is the (lack of sufficient quality/quantity) of exercises. The author just throws some exercises (at the end of chapters) in there just as a formality, and you get the feeling that he really is not interested in including them. Working out problems is an integral part of learning a field like ML well. And there are no solutions or even answers to problems available.So all in all, I would say it's an excellent first book to learn ML from. This will help you move on confidently to Tibshirani's and Bishop's books (both are an absolute must if you are a serious ML/Data researcher)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Machine Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning)","review":"This is a very good introduction to Machine Learning, but very terse at times.

While reading the book it is like you're right there as Mary King describes every detail and leaves a vivid picture in your mind! I would highly recommend picking up this book, both for the \\"able bodied\\" reader to better educate as well as the disabled reader to give hope and let all of us disabed people to know yes there are alternatives and yes you CAN do it!"},{"Title":"Stolen Shadows","review":"I am an orthopedist in Budapest, Hungary. My wife is a neurosurgeon and we are parents of two boys, one of them has a disability.This great series, the McFadden Family Series opens with the book Stolen Shadows. In the center are two young medical professionals, who take in abandoned boys, many with serious disabilities.Dr. Lauren McFadden is a very well rounded figure. In addition to being devoted to her professiona nd patients she maintains a healthy marriage and finds the time to nurish and use her musical talent. She is a great inspiration for any doctor in today's rushed consumerist world.The other characters are also very interesting. Actually the major strength of this novel is the way the characters are written. Another very important part is the well researched medical situations. Ms. King portraits them accurately and in a way that is hardly seen on television or in novels."},{"Title":"Stolen Shadows","review":"I suppose I am the lone voice of dissent here, but I did not think this is the best book ever written on disability. For starters, it's just not well written. It is self-published, put out by a vanity press, and the lack of editing really shows, not only in little ways, like typos and misuse of language, but in big ways as well. The story takes forever to get going (it's more than halfway through before they even build the house), and there are dozens of characters whose stories are told like little vignettes, but many of them don't go anywhere. There's just no structure to any of it, and the first volume ends very abruptly.In spite of many realistic touches, the story is told like a mixture of a romance novel, true crime, and medical drama. The two main characters are impossibly beautiful, talented and wealthy. For instance, the doctor is not only gorgeous and at the very top of her field, but she's also a math whiz AND a musical genius who performs with a symphony orchestra. Also she and her partner are only in their late 20s. The descriptions of both of them are straight out of the cheeziest romance novel, which detracts mightily from the realism.The descriptions of spinal cord injury are extremely detailed and realistic, which I appreciate; there are not enough novels that have this level of realism. However, there's something kind of creepy about the way it's discussed. Bowel and bladder issues are a part of SCI, but the author really dwells on those details excessively. By about the 10th description of enemas, catheters, and messy accidents, it crosses the line from realistic detail to voyeuristic obsession. There's a scene near the beginning where the doctor teaches a very reluctant teenage girl how to catheterize herself, and she comforts her by saying that in a few years she won't even think twice about it, she'll have a wonderful life and will have gotten past the shame and pain to focus on more positive aspects of her life, which is a very good point. However, the novel itself never does that. As soon as a character starts to adjust, he or she disappears, and we are left with an endless parade of trauma. I suppose that reflects more on the doctor's point of view, but the other creepy thing about the book is that every single character, even the doctors and their acquaintances, at some point suffers some horrible tragedy, from severe injuries to horrific childhood sexual abuse, and several characters suffer both. Any one of these characters might have made a compelling novel, but with so many of them crammed into one book, it starts to read like an anthology of Reader's Digest \\"Drama in Real Life\\" stories. Except even with those, we aren't expected to believe that all the people live together.Disability and rehabilitation are very important topics deserving of realistic treatment in fiction, but unfortunately this book just isn't that good."},{"Title":"The Birth of Dirt: Origins of Mountain Biking","review":"As a keen mountain biker of old I thoroughly enjoyed this book.I could not put it down.I will pass this book to friends for them to learn the info.Great book."},{"Title":"The Birth of Dirt: Origins of Mountain Biking","review":"A wonderfully quixotic and quirky read. A ramshackle recollection that skews closer to oral history than an academic tome, which makes it perfect for the subject at hand.In the pantheon of sport (which is an awful phrase to heap on any activity that's supposed to be fun, evoking dusty accounts of Marquess of Queensberry rules for boxing and textbook synopses of the first Olympiads held in Athens...although, for those matches where the victor got the laurel wreath and the losers got, umm, death, those certainly stirred the blood and raised the bar), mountain biking is still a newbie. Most of the MB founders are not only still alive...they're still bombing down the single-track trails and tweaking their rides. Although nowadays, there's a bike company attached to their name and when they tweak, a new product rolls off the line six months later.The Birth of Dirt resembles a rock-n-roll history, although these characters are certainly healthier than the Stones, The Who and their peers. And when blood's involved, it's because of an unplanned skid, not some transfusion that's needed in order to go on stage. But like the music, it was created for the most part by the counter-culture, ok, let's call them hippies, who rode in skinny jeans and T-shirts. Helmets occasionally.MTB essentially started by taking forgotten Schwinns out of the garage and seeing if they'd stay in one piece while trying to make it to the bottom of the hill. The sport grew as the equipment was improved by the racers. Like Yvon Chouinard at Patagonia, these soon-to-be manufacturing legends would ride and race all weekend, then hole up in their shop during the week, welding this, hammering that. They'd then try out their improvements the following weekend at the test lab better known as Mt. Tam.A couple examples that handily reflect the humble origins of MTB: the first regular race was called the Repack, because if you were lucky enough to make it to the finish line, you'd probably have to disassemble your hub and re-grease the bearings that were smoked en route. Also, one of the main guys was named Joe Breeze, and his bikes were called Breezers - how cool is that?It's a quick read, a light read (certainly lighter than those original clunkers), and reading it will point you to a hill when you're done, as it should be - the birth of dirt might be in the Bay Area, but now it lives on the thousands of trails around the country.Perhaps my favorite quote sums it up best: \\"Nobody started out to change the bicycling world. It just worked out that way.\\""},{"Title":"The Birth of Dirt: Origins of Mountain Biking","review":"The Birth of Dirt is a quick, fun read, and offers a quite thorough review of origins of the mountain bike, with numerous contemporary photos and drawings. Berto, formerly the technical editor of Bicycling magazine, has a fine command of the technical issues of bicycle design. But the book holds its good share of entertaining stories as well. Berto has the advantage of living in Marin County, California, where the mountain bike originated, and of knowing and having interviewed most of the pioneers in its development. They are a lively cast of characters, and Berto is a personable and engaging writer.Berto has gone to considerable lengths with his research, yet I found a few minor errors of fact: for example, what is described as an Atom drum brake on page 28 is a Maxicar brake; Berto also locates the home of the late John Finley Scott in Davis, California rather than in nearby Dixon. Though this book is nearly definitive, the last word in such histories always lurks somewhere in the future."}]`),j={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"card-container"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},S={key:1};function B(s,e,n,c,r,i){const y=m("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",D,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(y,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",S,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",E,"See more"))],8,q)):p("",!0)])}const F=u(j,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-fcf90b18"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/59.md","filePath":"guide/59.md"}'),M={name:"guide/59.md"},O=Object.assign(M,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[k(F)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
