Essential to the suppression of gay people in the West was the denial that they contributed positively to history; that history came very close to being effaced altogether. Just as the first gay historians after Stonewall began to reclaim that history, gay French philosopher Michel Foucault mischievously denied that homosexuality existed at all before the term was coined in the 1890s. This academic fashion caused many to refuse to consider fascinating new same-sex testimony from the past just as it appeared--a skepticism heteros would never dream of applying to their own sexual history. Crompton is post-theory, post-faction: instead of denying gay men had a history, he says, just read the first-person accounts from different times and places and respect what they plainly say. He does just that in this elegant, readable journey through Christian, Islamic, and Asian same-sex history.But Crompton also makes two landmark contributions well beyond the requirements of survey. First, he fingers the one person who actually invented Western homophobia: Philo Judeus. Jewish philosopher in Alexandria and contemporary of Christ, this titanic figure is at least as important to history as St. Augustine, and like Augustine, presents both light and dark sides. On the good side, he created the template for Christianity. Responding to the mounting fashion for monotheism in the ancient world, and to the deep respect Romans had for the Jewish equation of law with divinity, Philo sought to reinvent Judaism as a Gentile-friendly universal religion released from its tribal particularity. He was blocked in this effort by purists in Jerusalem who insisted on circumcision (meaning, for the convert, adult circumcision without anaesthetic) and obeisance to the Temple, which on high holy days turned into the largest assembly-line slaughterhouse in the world. Both requirements were deal-breakers for pagans. But Philo's student St. Paul successfully applied this template to the new cult of Christianity. On the negative side, it was Philo who first interpreted the Biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah as punishing homosexuality, which no one else, including Jesus, thought it was. His interpretation became, to this day, the key rationale for the persecution of gay people in Christendom. Thanks to Crompton, now we know who did it.Crompton's second great contribution is to extend same-sex history, virtually for the first time, to China and Japan. Gay men often ask, what kind of society would result if there were no taboos, if men could love whomever they want? For two thousand years, until the 19th century, this answer could be found in China and Japan. As long as a man did his dynastic duty siring children, he could do anything else he wanted sexually. The result was a broad middle area of opportunistic bisexuality flanked by strong purist traditions of hetero and homo sex. All three had their own philosophy and literature, and Crompton quotes extensively from an enormous, unsuppressed gay literature which the West has yet to sample.This book is the single finest one-volume survey of same-sex history on the market and deserves a wide audience."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Homosexuality has always been a natural variation of human nature: this has been aacknowledged universally, till a misjudged analogy (homosexuality equals idolatry of foreign gods) has been transfonded in a monstruously erroneous condemnation. This history shows that no moral one can rationally propound can be advance to condemn something that doesnt'do anyone any harm, so paranoid haters had to fabricate those reasons, basing them in entirely erroneous readings of biblical hepisodes. After the religion that Our Saviour founded, a religion He intended based on Love and Understanding, not on hatred, the montrous lies against homosexuals resulted in horrendous hate crimes justified by religious motives and sacred zeal. So sad are the chapter where homophobic racism, like antisemithic racism, was unleashed wit demonic gusto un innocent people.Then came Enlightenment, and homophobia began to be questioned, legislations began to be reformed.A book I recommend!"},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Louis Crompton has set out to provide us with an overview of homosexuality through history, no small task, but an admirable one, for homosexuality has typically been excluded from discussion, particularly in Western culture. Crompton basically covers from the time of the ancient Greeks, who revered male-male relationships, through the end of the 18th century, by which time Judeo-Christian beliefs had subjected homosexuals to centuries of persecutions. In addition, chapters on homosexuality in China and Japan help to provide a counterpoint to European traditions. This book, along with Graham Robb's Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century, brings us up to the 20th century, when the historical record is more complete.Crompton is a good writer, and good at pulling information together. His critiques of other writers, like John Boswell, are always supported by facts. And if I wish the book did more than simply allude to the presence of positive same-sex relationships in Africa, amid Native Americans, and in parts of Southern Asia, you can't have everything. I do, however, note that failure to discuss the importance of Filippo Brunelleschi in the chapter on the Italian Renaissance seems to me an unfortunate omission. By simply beginning with Donatello (who was, by most accounts, Brunelleschi's \\"boyfriend\\" and apprentice), we miss the chance to see that homosexuality was a major personality trait in the man perhaps most responsible for sparking the Italian Renaissance as a whole. Perhaps Crompton could have left out one or the other account of servants being jailed or burned to note that. But overall, this book provides a solid, readable overview of homosexuals over the course of the last 2500 years, and I'm grateful to have read it."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"I read the original hard cover edition of 2003. It has 640 pages, some 100 color pictures and some 450 regular text pages.It covers Greece, Judea, the Roman Empire, Western Europe (mainly Italy, Spain [Christian and Muslim], France, England, the Netherlands and Prussia [historic part of Germany]), as well as China and Japan. That seems to be Crompton's (or the publisher's) definition of civilization. Considering that once the biggest cities were located in (sub-Saharan) Africa, that there were urban societies in the pre-Columbian Americas and that civilization's early roots are located in countries such as Babylon, Persia and Egypt, virtually all of which with known homosexualities, this book is not as exhaustive as its page number suggests. Did I mention EASTERN Europe? Maybe it's just an ill-advised title.The book sheds light on the various forms of persecutions and shares one and the other surprise. For example the most deadly persecution before Hitler having occurred in today's model country, the Netherlands. Today's most homophobic state of Germany, Bavaria, adopting Prussia's anti-homosexual laws not before the German unification of 1871 and Japan of all the places (i.e. the somewhat un-colonized ones) across the globe doing the same two years later. Of course, more positive episodes of the last some 25 hundred years are covered also. It would have been much more positive, if earlier times would have been included, such as ancient Egypt. Please be aware that Greek-Egyptian Cleopatra is closer to the Space Shuttle than the erection of the pyramids, i.e. that a lot of civilization isn't only lost in this book geographically, but also on the timeline.Overall, this book is a very good introduction into the issue. Just don't think it's exhaustive, just because you can outweigh your local phone book with it. You may be interested inColonialism and Homosexuality,Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature,Boy-Wives and Female Husbands: Studies of African Homosexualities, and \\"leaving civilization\\", in the myriad concepts of love life inRitualized Homosexuality in Melanesia (Studies in Melanesian Anthropology). Louis Crompton criticizes John Boswell's classicChristianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century, yet in principle, I find it worth to read nevertheless. You may attempt to outweigh Crompton's book withBiological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity (Stonewall Inn Editions)."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Louis Crompton has written a magisterial, eloquent, and exhaustive history of gay and lesbian history in his 2003 book, \\"Homosexuality and Civilization.\\" The book traces the history of attitudes towards gay men and women from antiquity to the Enlightenment (its only shortcoming was the lack of anything past the nineteenth century). This book is a real toud d'force, covering literature, philosophy, history, and artefacts throughout the ages. Crompton is at complete odds with Boswell's two tomes on homosexuality, clearly laying the blame for most homophobia on the doorsteps of Christianity. Not until Augustine of Hippo, Clement of Alexandria, and John Chrysostom does homosexuality become a perversion that is meeted with some harsh, even lethal, opposition -- all because of the Story of Sodom and Gommorah, which ironically has nothing to do with homosexuality, but which the early Church Fathers decided was the lynchpin of God's wrath toward the unrighteous homosexual -- indeed, not just the homosexual, but any society that countenanced it. The Catholic Inquisition was matched only by the Protestant Reformation in its zeal to liquidate any form of same-sex love by a misreading of the Sodom story, and by a single verse from Leviticus -- a Code which most Christians reject or ignore categorically, yet from a single verse comes some of the most perverse reprisals against the gay community.Crompton's book is more like a textbook of all things homosexual prior to the 20th century than it is a thesis about a particular worldview of homosexuality. Homosexuals in almost all societies have enjoyed some of the most insightful and keen minds, beginning with ancient Greece and persisting throughout the modern era. But for all the accomplishments of gay men and women, the gay person has always been at the forefront of progroms to purge society of God's ire. Gays have always been blamed for anything that has gone wrong in almost every society -- except in ancient Greece, where same sex love facilitated military heroism. Retracing same-sex love from the \\"Iliad\\" through Plutarch, one sees a tolerant attitude convert to antipathy in the writings of the Christian Church Fathers -- almost always citing Leviticus 20:13, and starting with the adoption of the Christian faith as the national religion of medieval Rome in A.D. 390.There have been many an outstanding book on the topic of homosexuality, including John Boswell's two tomes, Dover's \\"Greek Homosexuality,\\" and David Greenberg's \\"The Construction of Homosexuality.\\" But none of these other works compares in eloqution, spectrum, or detail of Crompton's excellent survey. This is a book for every gay person's and historican's library; an exellent reference point for many of the people who have borne reproach for same-sex affinity; and a world view largely of Christianity's hostility. For all its wealth of information and eloquence, this book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"Published in 2003, \\"Homosexuality and Civilization\\" has become the standard text on homosexuality through the ages.The author, Louis Crompton, professor of English, Emeritus, at the University of Nebraska, offers an exhaustive list and description of homosexuality from early Greece to the end of the 19th century when homosexual behavior in Europe ceased to be a capital offense. Unfortunately, many anti-sodomy laws remain on the books today although rarely if ever enforced.As I wrote in my own book on the subject, \\"Invisible People: History's Homosexuals Unhidden,\\" too many historians seem squeamish or embarrassed to write about famous people of the past who happened to have been gay or lesbian.In Robert K. Massie's Pulitzer-Prize winning biography of Peter the Great, the author (in a footnote!) briefly mentions that the Russian tsar promoted his stable boy, Peter Menshikov, to governor of Moscow and made him a prince of the empire. The tsar also took naps with his friend, often laying his head on the youth's belly while they slept.And yet Massie seems to be in denial when he writes that the tsar's unusual sleeping arrangements, so reminiscent of Michael Jackson's sleepovers with prepubescent children, did not make Peter the Great homosexual or bisexual. (The Russian emperor had two wives and fathered several children.)Other historians shove important historical figures into a closet they never occupied in their lifetime. In Nancy Mitford's biography of Frederick the Great, she barely mentions the King of Prussia's overt homosexuality and his court, which consisted mostly of gay men and no women. Frederick kept his wife in a separate palace and only visited her once a year. The couple never had children.Frank Sanelloauthor of \\"Victims and Victimizers: Gays and Lesbians in the Third Reich\\""},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"I don't know why it took me so long to find this book, but now that I have it, it has become the crowning jewel of my collection. It was so therapeutic for me that I cried and cried while reading what I had always suspected about the cruelties religions have perpetrated in the name of God. I am forever grateful to Professor Louis Crompton."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"I'm glad I read this book; it presented me with much interesting information with which I was previously unfamiliar. It is a shame that, by and large, it will be read by people who are already inclined to agree with the author's position on acceptance of homosexuality, and not by people who do not. Granted, not everyone who disagrees with that position does so out of ignorance, but I suspect that many do, and of that many, some would become more tolerant if they were to read this book. But for the most part, they won't, so for the most part, the author is \\"preaching to the choir\\".There are a couple of reasons, though, why I only give this book three stars: for one thing, the writing gets a bit ponderous at times; this author makes the mistake of many historians, which is to confuse \\"a neutral tone\\" with removing all traces of personality or style from the writing. Those few historians who understand that it is possible to write about history objectively without doing so dully are a rare treasure; this author is not one of them. (As a side issue, and a minor one: there are a few more places where this book clearly needed a more competent proofreader than it had than I care for in a scholarly work, although fewer of them than I would accept as tolerable in a mass-market paperback novel without a quibble; phrases like \\"...the patrons was businessmen,...\\" show up periodically, and are distracting to the reader's inner grammarian.) Secondly, The author concentrates far more heavily than I care for on the Western European cultures that were psychotically homophobic; granted, he begins with ancient Greece & Rome, has a chapter on Japan & China, and mentions briefly that one of the things that condemned the native Americans in the eyes of the Europeans was their acceptance of homosexuality, but I would dearly have liked to have seen more about non-Western attitudes toward the subject; it was not news that the European Christian civilizations rabidly condemned it. What I found fascinating was the little information that WAS provided about contrasting attitudes.It's definitely worth reading this book, if for no better reason than to be reminded of where we do NOT want society to return in its attitudes & behaviors, but there was just as definitely much room for improvement."},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"While I agree with some other reviewers that this book's discussion of Asian countries is not profound, one really could hardly expect otherwise (because Western scholarship is just beginning to deal with Asia and its sexual attitudes) --- and one looks in vain for a book which does a better job.In its areas of strength (Christendom) the book is simply unrivaled --- there is no significant competition.

I am a bit of a history buff, but I am no academician. So when I come across a book that is historical and an enjoyable read, I am thrilled.

This book was just that thorough (and yet not tedious in any way). My one disappointment is that it did not address homosexuality in India.

This is my kind of book, scholarly, logical, thoughtful, articulate, and thorough. But could have been a bit more sexy.I must add a few suggestions to round out the text. These additions along with some cuts would not expand the work very much. Perhaps for the second paperback edition?The events in the first third are undistiguished and repetitive despite the vast time and subjects covered. Poems, punishment, etc. I kept wanting to know what were dinner parties like, dating, conversation, style changes, were there makeout sections in the theaters and foxholes, and did parents punish or pimp their children, or both? The pederasty is almost unrelenting, and not being a fan I worked my way through the early material but it was rarely sexy. The lesser characters and stories could be trimmeed. I'm a fan of ancient histoy and I felt for readers unfamiliar with the glossed-over details of these worlds. Differences in historical settings and characters should be brought alive. If you've ever read Mary Renault's novels or \\"Julian\\" by Gore Vidal you'll know what I mean.The author gives little sense of who's writing the book aside from the introduction and conclusion, which is balanced about christianity's influences and should perhaps be read first (this from an art-loving agnostic). I'd like anecdotes about the author's adventures researching, traveling, meeting people, and comparing texts unique to this project and subject..Subtitles! This isn't a request to make scholarship seem juvenile but I'm a fan of frequent chapter breaks, section headings, and subtitles when the topic changes ---- which happens in this book sometimes within a paragraph. They help the reader find and remember things easier.And there were fifty typos too many.Like I alluded to above, I'd like more adult-to-adult examples among the pederastic societies. Being of the modern western world, I always assumed that pederasty and Kinsey-6 homosexuals were each about 5-10% of men, and almost 100% scorned, but the idea of a huge percentage of paired-off ancient army buddies makes my head spin with confusion and delight!"},{"Title":"Homosexuality and Civilization","review":"This is not a bad book, but the near-hysterical enthusiasm of other reviewers needs to be balanced by a few critical comments, which I am happy to supply.First, credit where credit is due: Crompton writes well and makes at least some effort to treat historical facts with due respect. Among other things, he gets high marks for dumping on John Boswell, originator of the absurd claim that early Christianity accepted homosexuality.But, contrary to other reviewers, there is nothing \\"definitive\\" about this book. Its coverage of China, to take an example, is little more than a preliminary once-over-lightly.Crompton's survey does illustrate the truism that Judaism, Christianity and Islam have always condemned homosexuality - though the enforcement of this fundamental attitude has varied from time to time.Objectively speaking, no amount of history demonstrates that the billions of people who have accepted the Biblical approach are \\"wrong\\", while the relatively minuscule number who think otherwise are \\"right\\". All that history enables us to say is this: Attitudes toward homosexuality have varied through time. In general, people living in the West - the Greeks partially excepted - have condemned it.As for homosexuality in China: The Chinese attitude toward homosexuality ranged from tolerance (as long as it didn't interfere with familial duties) to legal prohibition, as under the much-revered Kang-xi Emperor. At no time did Chinese society accept homosexuality as an exclusive sexual orientation.It need hardly be said that no society in recorded history has ever seriously considered allowing homosexuals to \\"marry\\", or encouraged its members to develop a singleminded homosexual identity.That gay sex has, in every period and in every society, been \\"part of the human scene\\" - is undeniable. But it must also be said that the impulse to condemn, prohibit, restrict or disapprove of gay sex is also a part of the human scene and in fact has always been the dominant trend. Crompton plainly opposes that approach, but nothing in his book begins to prove it wrong.Broadminded people, including gays who are willing to look objectively at the entire human scene, rather than their little corner of it, will ask themselves what history suggests about human sexuality and the apparent need to confine it within a framework of norms and expectations. The notion that sexual norms that have been duplicated, with minor variations, in thousands of separate cultures around the world - can be dismissed as \\"irrational prejudice\\" - is arrogant and ridiculous. Though truth is elusive, it seems likely that societies have acted on the notion that gay sex threatened the success and integrity of the family, and the propagation of enough offspring to guarantee continuity. These are not petty or antiquarian concerns, especially in view of Europe's ongoing demographic suicide. One should be honest enough to ask: Can a healthy and vibrant society be based on philosophy that rejects all traditional values and institutions and, among other things, believes there is no moral distinction between a perverse and necessarily sterile sexuality and the sexuality that propagates the species and makes life possible?"},{"Title":"Assistive Technology: Essential Human Factors","review":"This book provides guidelines to follow when working with clients who use assistive technology.

A black board or a pencil is very similar to a computer. What they miss is how those tools changed education. Changes in pedagogy did not happen because educators wanted to change education. They happened because humans interacted differently with their environment because of these tools. Assistive Technology: Essential Human Factors, particularly chapters five and nine, helps educators assess how to evaluate the effectiveness of assistive technology and computers. Before you create your lesson plan or schedule an IEP meeting, you should know what an assessment of human factors would tell you about your educational plans.And if , by chance, you think this is the responsibility of your school district educational technologists, just ask them what they know about the human factors involved in using technology.This is an excellent book to begin to explore why some assistive technology works and some fails."},{"Title":"Assistive Technology: Essential Human Factors","review":"I made some use of this book for my doctoral research on errors in the design process for assistive technology (AT - by which I mean here the modifications to the built environment made to accommodate the needs of disabled people). For a short book (269 pages including glossary, excluding references), King crams a lot of useful guidance between the covers. I liked the fact that he discusses AT from an ergonomics perspective, which is my own specialty, and there was much here with which I was familiar. At the same time, King avoided writing a dull book by providing enough fresh perspective and personal opinion to make it an interesting read.Each of the nine chapters includes study questions, and there are plenty of useful photographs and drawings used to illustrate and clarify the text. King wrote this with \\"senior-level undergraduate students and beginning-level graduate students in a variety of rehabilitation, education, and medical fields\\" in mind, as well as \\"working professionals, AT users, and their families\\" (page xi). The work is written and organized in a way that reflects these aims, and it does so very well. King writes plainly and avoids unnecessary jargon, while managing to convey complex notions in a highly readable style.I am pleased that, unlike so many in this AT field, King does not over-emphasize the use of electronics. He avoids equating \\"AT\\" with \\"Computers,\\" and differentiates between \\"No-Tech,\\" \\"Low-Tech,\\" and \\"High-Tech\\" solutions. This is as it should be; I have worked as a rehabilitation ergonomist for almost twenty years, and I can attest that most enablement is achieved by non-electronic AT. While electronic AT has its uses, of course, enabling the completion of tasks that non-electronic AT could not enable, it is useless when the power is out, and for that reason, is limited in its applications, especially where safety in an emergency is involved. Far too often these days we hear only about the computing side of AT, which accounts for a much smaller proportion of AT than the countless physical modifications made to our environment which improve access for people - things like ramps, differentially-textured surfaces, improved handles/grips, wheelchair accessible counters and desks, hand controls in vehicles, reaching devices, walking aids, manual wheelchairs, magnifying glasses, and so on. These non-computer modifications continue to be the mainstay of enablement, although one would hardly gather this this when scanning the titles of workshops at AT conferences!One major problem of including electronic AT in a textbook is that by the time it goes to press, the AT is out of date, and perhaps even unavailable. Fortunately, King provides enough human factors information for the AT professional to make informed decisions regarding the usability of new assistive technology, so the chapters in this book on controls and displays are still very useful.No single book can convey all aspects of ergonomics (human factors) relating to AT, and of course there are omissions, but there are enough inclusions to make this a worthwhile purchase. Originally I borrowed it from my university's library and liked it enough to buy my own copy for future reference, and also to incorporate some of it into my own teaching of AT ergonomics to AT professionals and students.Why only four stars? I would have liked to see King address how modifying the environment for person A can inadvertently make the environment less usable for person B. There is an assumption that AT creates a more usable, accessible world, but this is not always or inevitably the case. My research identified people who shared a modified task with the disabled worker, and suffered injury as a consequence, because the AT was only designed with the disabled user in mind.Still, this does not deny King's intention is quite proper - until we have a routine \\"inclusive\\" approach to design that mirrors the natural variation in human functional capacity, we will be forced to adapt poorly designed environments and objects to enable all people to participate equally in society.Also, any book that gets five stars would need to be \\"perfect,\\" and King, like any honest author, knows that perfect text books simply do not exist, and will never exist! So four stars it is, with a very high commendation for anyone involved in disability issues to buy it and to read it."},{"Title":"THE PROMISE OF THE FATHER","review":"Phoebe Palmer's 1859 421-page book \\"The Promise of the Father\\" (lithographed by Old Paths Tract Society in 1981) is the mid 19th century prototype for later 20th century feminist theology. Although not published recently Mrs. Palmer's text is a classic from the holiness movement that speaks to women's rights and responsibilities in a modern society.As a determined Christian, Palmer (a wealthy heiress who lived palatially in New York City through the 19th century) was a an early Holiness Movement leader, a patron of Methodism, a hymn writer, and a home preacher. She worked diligently across the class structures to offer Christ to believers and would be converts.Beginning the book by presenting her basic theology (\\"to prophesy is to preach\\", page 42), Palmer next offers various vignettes of biblical and historical females (Mrs. John Fletcher, Anne Gilbert, Mary Magdalene, and several more) suggesting their contributions to faith. Unfortunately, as with many pre 20th century sources, she does not source information- making additional research problematic.Perhaps the best portion of this great book steps forth from chapter 17 to define the promise of the Father (God). \\"The pentecostal fire will descend... [affirming that] God is true\\" (page354). \\"Diversified and endless responsibilities, weighty as the worth of the soul, and solemn as eternity, will be the result of the knowledge which these truths impart\\" (page 355).Palmer formulates a two-part full-baptism: 1st- conversion with water baptism begins belief in Christ, and, 2nd- completion of conversion occurs with fire-baptism by the Holy Spirit. Believer's baptism, as a result of this complete conversion, portents the faithful's societal and personal privileges and duties. This type of spirituality influenced later generations' developments of holiness and pentecostal theology that continue to influence today..Palmer is somewhat arcane by contemporary literary standards, but she is worth a careful read. \\"The Promise of the Father\\" is recommended to everyone interested in 19th century primary religious sources, the early Holiness Movement, students of American religious history, and feminist theologians.Happy 200th Birthday of Abraham Lincoln!"},{"Title":"Washing Machine Repair (Cheap and Easy)","review":"This book covers the main parts of the wahing machine and shows pictures of the parts so that you can identify them.

Part of the charm of this novel is that even though the dialogue needs work, the actions of the characters rang true.Rasha is a country girl from Louisiana living in New York City. She is an accountant but to make extra money she is a server for a catering company in the evenings. One evening at a very fancy dinner she meets super rich young architect Grant Reeves and is instantly smitten with him. Grant finds Rasha beautiful and worth the chase.Rasha works for Grant's international Architectural firm and together these two have what amounts to a whirlwind relationship. Grant is protective and treats Rasha like his former girlfriends, shower them with gifts and keep it unemotional. Rasha on the other hand, does not want his money but his heart.Together they have to work out their romance with the backdrop of New York City life and Rasha's optimistic view which is counterpoint to Grant's more jaded view of the world.As stated earlier, the dialogue just feels unnatural at times, especially when Grant is doing the talking with his buddies and even with his family. Rasha's dialogue is more fluid and when the leads speak to each other, their words flow a little more smoothly with little hitches here and there.The story however is good and I truly enjoyed Rasha's world view; she still believes in the basic goodness of people. Also her character was well developed with enough background material to understand her present day actions. Grant's could have been a little more fleshed out. Overall this book is a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Priceless","review":"Woderful! Bright! Smart!

He has developed a fondness for and an appreciation offemales and he mentally documents all he learns for futurereference. His poems align him as one of those rare men whorespects the sacredness of womanhood.You might ask who these women are? They are everyone: family andfriends, who have battled emotional and physical abuse, terminalillness, and vanished husbands, but who have remained strongenough to leave an indelible imprint on this author. Each poemis a tribute, almost a testimony to how his life has beenimpacted by women.Poetry is a growing genre in the literary arena and each poet hastheir own distinctive flow. Nathan Lewis's poetry flows likespring water rushing from a snow capped mountain, it made meinternalize, made me wonder how he might immortalize me.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Poems Written for Women I Love(d)","review":"Poems Written for Women I Love(d) are intimate and romantic poems from a male perspective. It is clear Mr. Nathan A. Lewis is a student of femininity and is not ashamed to express his true feelings. The introduction adds depth as it chronicles how these poems were created and provides the approval of his queen, Alesia Lewis. The poems are a tribute to all women who have flowed in and out of his life- wives, mothers, aunts, friends, ex-lovers and grandmothers. Men should take notes on how Lewis conveys the messages of respect, honor, beauty, pain and death as it concerns women.Finally a man that is not afraid to share his feelings and speak his mind. I would recommend Poems Written for Women I Love(d) to anyone who wishes to express their intimate feelings but might not know how. I would like to see more poems, as the book is short and left me wanting more. The book made me ask my husband what he thought about the female friends who make up our extended family.Reviewed by M.

Black-and-white line drawings illustrate a story of political controversies, environmental struggles, and the enduring strength of the wolf itself.

However, his experiences go far beyond those of most others, helped by being able to track wolves by light aircraft and radio telemetry thus getting a bird's eye view of the scene. A good example of the Scientific Method on the hoof, so to speak. The book does not glamorize the profession of wildlife biology; it tells it like it is, including the governmental bureaucracy, physical hardships, bad weather, and long hours, occasionally punctuated with incredible encounters with the wolves that refused to be excluded from Wisconsin. The book teaches people what to expect when wolves share your living space. And what a great ending ... it brings the reader right up to date and sets the stage for proper management decisions in the future. A great humorous book which will entertain you as well as educate. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Wolves: The Early Years of Wolf Recovery in Wisconsin","review":"Good friends presented us this book as a Christmas gift, knowing that we are very interested in all forms of appearance of the nature, inanimate and alive.It is of great interest for us since just in this years the wolves also return to the forests of our Eastgerman country.It is wonderful written, understandable also for the laymen and rich in nice figures.Most important for us is however, that this book is written by a man who obviously feels responsible for the life on our so endangered earth, who understand that human life is tightly connected with all the other appearances of life and that the good evolution of one kind of life is the necessary precondition for the healthy existence of all another creatures.Men like Richard Thiel give us the hope that life has a chance to survive at our planet."},{"Title":"Keepers of the Wolves: The Early Years of Wolf Recovery in Wisconsin","review":"This book is a labor of love and committment, the author rocks and provides insights into what it takes to assure that today's actions ensure one's goals/ideals, i.e. wolf recovery, survive into the next generation.

AFter all, everyone has something bad or controversial to say about the biennials, so lets skip that, and focus on the fact that a book like this, or other museum catalogs serve to give the reader a good sense of a particular slice of art history at any given time. Even if that history is slanted, biased, etc., you still get to see art work that is good."},{"Title":"Whitney Biennial 2002 : 2002 Biennial Exhibition (Whitney Biennial)","review":"Walking away from the 2002 Whitney Biennial, I had mixed feelings of the state of contemporary art. The Whitney has resigned to classifying it in a catch-all \\"pluralism\\" in which there simply is so many voices out there under so many disciplines and influences that it cannot be herded into an umbrella term. Fair enough, but the show is probably an ideal example of how problematic such resignation can be.The cross-over of disciplines fairly common among artists made for an interesting mix of pieces ranging from collective installations to delicate sculptural pieces to a mix of mainly urban \\"house-like\\" soundworks. Indeed the transition from Tracie Morris' stuttering and beautiful soundworks to Chris Ware's highly-detailed agnst-ridden comic panels to Destroy All Monsters' urban, almost adolescent painted tributes to Detroit was a fairly smooth one.The mood of the exhibition, though often felt artifical and sometimes contrived. In an age of an overabundance of market imagery, pondering over the various aspects of mosh-pits and extreme sports had the impact of a cola commercial. Artists as spiritual conduits; spiritual leaders as artists; channeling the spirits of dead artists. This all seems interesting but were they in the appropriate forum? Which leads to the questions has the Biennial outlived its usefulness as a forum? Has contemporary art outgrown museums as a result of market/academic/visual oversaturation?"},{"Title":"Excursions into mathematics","review":"Now fully updated and expanded, this New Millennium edition of Excursions Into Mathematics takes the reader on short &quot;excursions&quot; into several specific disciplines in the field of mathematics and explains mathematical concepts in such an easy, &quot;user friendly&quot; manner as to make them interesting and accessible to the non-specialist general reader.

Besides all the wild sex, these are a couple of very well thought out and constructed short stories. 'Hormone Pirates of Xenobia' features Antony, who ends up being a sort of sperm doner on a space colony. He has sex with an alien, falls in love with another man and ends up having to escape the clutches of the owner, Zschado. The second story, 'Dream Studs of Kama Loka', features a student, Ted, that voulunteers for a dream research experiment for the professor, Dr. Wunder. We are taken through several adventurous dreams in Kama Loka. This story is a bit more on the S&M side. If you enjoy erotic porn with a story, then this is not a bad short read. Not really my cup of tea, and I would have given it less stars, but storywise, it was entertaining."},{"Title":"Hormone Pirates of Xenobia and Dream Studs of Kama","review":"There's a dearth in gay oriented science fiction, and this book sadly wasn't worth reading. It makes sense that in this type of book, the erotic aspect would come before the science fiction theme, but the book didn't strike me as erotic either. Perhaps it's me, but when the body fluids you're describing are vomit and blood, I don't see how that's a turn on. In my opinion, John Preston's work might be preferable or for gay science fiction, perhaps consider Kyle Stone's The Initiation of PB 500 and it's sequel The Citadel."},{"Title":"Hormone Pirates of Xenobia and Dream Studs of Kama","review":"Having just finished this book, I can't resist giving my 2c on it. While it's no classic (exactly what is the canon of gay erotic sf anyway?), it does get the job done. The author exploits a variety of situations that extend the usual sexual fantasy into more speculative realms. The &quot;hormone pirates&quot; of the first story enable the main character to produce sperm like a cow does milk. The aliens wanting the supply use it to experience the universe in a unique way. As their representative, the Vronk, puts it, &quot;We do not need it to zzurvive, but we find it to be an aezzthetic exzzpereienzze.&quot; Wild stuff. The main plot is a love story between two men who escape together. The second story, which I think is a bit better, is a virtual fantasy in which a college student is sent into a series of different fantasy dream situations in &quot;Kama Loka&quot; involving an Academy of Masturbatory Arts (its syllabus is quite a read!), a redneck rodeo with a unique bucking bronco, and an attempt to prolong unendurable pleasure (it involves powdered cinnamon and ants). By the end, a wide variety of scenarios have been knitted together to help the student to destroy his internal guilt over his desires. Posey possesses the one thing that effective writers of erotica must: a creative dirty mind. Let's hope this isn't his last book."},{"Title":"Pennsylvania Almanac","review":"Data Freaks-in or near Pennsylvania, this is a must-have volume.

The prose is fluid, the data beautifully presented--the author loves his subject and you will too when you have finished it."},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT, 10th Edition","review":"Most of this book is incredible. In math, for example, the author has 101 very technical questions, to pinpoint what you need to learn in material, and then covers the techniques of the questions, which is what the SAT tests, mostly. I have no trouble believing that his book will actually raise your IQ. His section on the critical reading section is also great, with him including important lating and greek roots, prefixes and suffixes in addition to a long list of english words, an idea which is so brilliant that I wonder why nobody else does that.I'm only giving it 3 stars, however, due to two major flaws. One is that the writing section is obviously tacked on to the rest of the book. His 14 questions that are supposedly the elite questions for determining if you can get into top colleges (basically, questions with a trick to them, without which they're extremely hard), consist of 7 math and 7 critical reading. Writing appears almost solely in the five full practice tests, and in a handful of questions in the chapter on the writing test (questions which effectively comprise the writing test chapter).Furthermore, the questions are easy. I got 14/14 on the elite questions - this whilst doing them in my head. Flipping through the practice tests, I could do the toughest math questions in my end easily."},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT, 10th Edition","review":"I knew that the Gruber SAT books for the old SAT were great, so I purchased this book when I saw it in the bookstore. I haven't gone through it in depth, but it seems to be one of the best SAT books for the new version. It has a lot of helpful features like the \\"101 Most Important Math Questions You Need to Know How to Solve\\" and a very thorough \\"Math Refresher\\" that will definitely raise your score. The word list is great, as the definitions are very concise and easy to remember. The 5 practice tests seem to be very realistic. The grammar review is phenomenal. It goes over basically all the grammar one could possibly need to know for the SAT, and it also seems to contain some extraneous information that will be very helpful for a high school English class. For some reason, my high school teaches no grammar, so I need all the practice that I can get for the writing section. This is probably one of the best SAT books for actually learning the material. The Kaplan and Princeton Review books won't help you learn a lot, though they will provide you with a lot of practice. The three best books for the new SAT are, in my opinion, McGraw Hill's SAT I, Barron's How to Prepare for the New SAT, and this one. They are also quite thorough, and you don't need to purchase more than 1 or possibly 2 of the 3 to be well-prepared for the test. Good luck :)"},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT, 10th Edition","review":"It's all you need. Not cluttered like Barrons. Not vague and inaccurate like Princeton. Not full of typos and errors like Kaplan. It's nice and concise, and if you decide to study many months before the SAT, it has a comprehensive list of vocab words. The lessons are easy to understand. Watch out for the occasional typos though, like any other book. It has good practice too. My advice: PRACTICE!! Whatever you get wrong on the practice tests, check the answer explanation and learn from that. If you're still confused, go back to the lessons because they're pretty good on Grubers. Out of the books I've seen, I think Gruber's is the most dependable. Was recommended by a friend who got 1590 on old SAT."},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT, 10th Edition","review":"This is not the kind of book that is mainly about strategies to get you through the test (Princeton Review's \\"Joe Bloggs\\" comes to mind, here...), so it's not recommended for last minute studying. However, when it comes to actually teaching the things that you need to know, Gruber's is really, really good.I've had problems in the past with textbooks that are riddled with careless errors that caused significant confusion, but I can't say that I found any major errors in the book, or even any typos. What's also nice about this book is that it gives approximately equal emphasis to each of the sections- I've had books that completely ignore verbal while focusing on math, and vice versa, but Gruber's gives you a thorough grounding in everything.1) The diagnostic section was great. The book opens with a short math and verbal diagnostic, but also had a section about \\"the 101 math questions that you most need to know how to solve\\", which was great for pinpointing lingering issues that I had.2) Regarding the math section: It's quite thorough, with lots of handy practice questions interspersed throughout the lessons. One caveat: I didn't use this section all that much, because I had separate books that were entirely devoted to the math portion. However, I still found it to be extremely helpful when I did use it.3) The verbal section is fine. It focuses mainly on the vocabulary portion of it, which I personally feel is unnecessary- the SAT only has a few vocab questions, and it's not really worth the time to spend hours and hours improving your vocab for a couple points. They did cover it thoroughly, though, with sample questions. I would really like to see some more sample reading passages in the next edition, but they do have tips for reading long passages in the \\"Strategies\\" section.4) The grammatical section is the best I've seen- I haven't come across any other textbook that comes close. It's also the section that I needed most, especially since I (and most people I know) haven't been taught proper grammar since... never, really. What's nice about it is that it actually teaches you grammatical rules, including those about misplaced modifiers, dangling adjectives, etc., instead of mostly expecting you to wing it. In fact, I think that the grammar they taught in the book was actually more difficult than what the SAT required: I shed tears over the grammar section when cramming, but I breezed through the writing portion when I took the actual test, so I think the level of difficulty is a good thing. The only problem I had was that in the part about the essay, it didn't thoroughly emphasize the fact that you need clear examples in your essays, either from history, literature, current events, or personal experience. Otherwise, it helped my score to no end.The practice tests at the end were really nice, and there were a lot of them, with thorough explanations for each answer. Two thumbs up.I recommend it unreservedly, if only for the grammar section alone."},{"Title":"Gruber's Complete Preparation for the New SAT, 10th Edition","review":"I am a teacher at a private high school and had used Gruber's New SAT book for a four week SAT preparation course with 28 students.

The two groups plan a friendly battle to determine which boat crew is better, and a daring plan is hatched.Although a rather old and somewhat dated novel, this story was compelling and interesting. I really liked the way the siblings got along with each other and were able to work together toward their goals. I also liked the interaction of the kids with the adults in the story, from the Swallows' mother, to the farmers who provide their milk, to the Amazons' uncle toward the end of the book.I sometimes got lost in the sailing terminology, as I am not a sailor, but the plot of the story was enough to keep me going through the unfamiliar words."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Excellent and as the gift was for my grandson I am writing for him who says he loves it and can't wait for more!!

These fortunate children, with whom the reader immediately identifies, are allowed to sail the English lakes alone and to enjoy the carefree and innocent adventures that were possible in this world. The only writer who comss close to Ransome in my experience is the late Iris Murdoch, but of course Ransome is a children's writer and in that he cannot be surpassed.

Another series in which, as an American boy fascinated by warplanes during the Worl War II era - I went on to become an aerospace engineer - I was enthralled, was \\"A Yank in the RAF\\", which I don't think would translate to the 21st Century very well. But the series that made the most impact on me was Ransome's Swallow family. As with Hugh Lofting's Doolittle, the author's drawings enhanced the books.I have not visited there yet but I plan on touring Britain's Lake District (I don't think I was cognizant of where the tales took place, except I knew the children were British. They liked to drink ginger beer; in the US we had a ginger ale drink, but not ginger beer and I was curious to have some.) I have long wanted to live somewhere that would allow me to experience the thrill of mastering the small sailing boats of the story. The closest I came was living near the Pacific in California and near the Potomac River. But the boats in those regions were larger and not terribly accessible. I did go sailing with friends and tried to sail on my own in a marina with a rented boat (a too narrow and crowded venue for a novice just learning to tack and unfamiliar with how to dump wind from the sail when being carried in the wrong direction.) I have gotten to taste ginger beer. I have also used the children's means of including coded messages in their letters in the form of dancing stick figures around the page's margin (the secret was to ignore other parts of the figures and concentrate on the positions of the arms, which were standard semaphore code.) I introduced the code to one of my daughters when we were in the \\"Indian Princesses\\" organization. (Is the name and programs of that organization offensive to American Indians? I'm sure its founders weren't sensitive to the fact that American Indians still existed.)I will introduce this series to my precocius 6 year old grand daughter when I think she is ready."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"When I was a young lad of about 10 or 11 years I was introducedto the collection of books by Arthur Ransome featuring the Swallows&amp; Amazons. The title book was the first I read and since then I keep returning to this and the others in this series still enjoying them today as I did then. The most remarkable thing about all this is that the person who orginally introduced me to this book was the late Ben Lexen,designer of the Americas'Cup yacht Australia,another person who adored all these books."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I came to SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS as an adult reader and just loved it. As a children's librarian, I read loads of kids' books and was delighted to find this story where the kids have so much integrity and autonomy. I also really enjoyed the strong female characters, which was a bit of a surprise in an older title. I think that booksellers and librarians will have to \\"hand sell\\" these titles as the covers are not as compelling as other books (like it or not, the cover sells the book!). On a personal note, this book reminded me of the long days I spent on the river and in the meadow as a child. My siblings and our friends would head out of the house at first light and stay out until my mother called us back for lunch using a boat horn. Then back out again until dinner. Whatever did we do all day? I don't remember, but I am sure it was fun!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This story is about a different time and a different place. A family whose father is away are on an idyllic holiday in the Lake District for two weeks and the group of children are allowed to spend all of it camping on an island and sailing. They pretend to be grownups and meet another couple of kids who are pretending to be pirates. Reading this now as an adult was enjoyable enough for me to know I would have loved it when I was a kid. The book made me feel a bit sad in that I don't think this world exists anymore though perhaps it could if kids had the right parents. There's no TV, no personal hi-fi's with their sexual innuendo-filled songs etc. It also shows that kids can, with a little help from the parents, get by for long periods on their own. I don't think parents would allow this nowadays but maybe I'm wrong. A fun read, I'd advise you to get it for your kids then go camping!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"When I was eight, I was a book worm. I am ashamed to say, however, that I wasn't reading exaclty the most edifying books around. My library consisted mostly of RL Stein, Hardy Boys and the likes. (Which I'm nto trying to put down, but to be honest, they're not that well written and they have very little plot.) So one weekend, my mother and I went to visit my aunt, and she noticed what I was reading. She was less than impressed and kept trying to intrest me in some of the different books she had. (She has a fabulous collection of children's books, I might add.) I turned down every one, either saying they looked boring or too young for me. So finally on the eve of our last night there, she convinces me to read this old tattered book. (You guessed it, it was Swallows and Amazons. The origeonal Johnathan Cape Edition, something you just can't find any more...) Being int he middle of &quot;The Secret of the Old Mill&quot; (For the third time) I put it off until I had finished. I assumed I'd read a chapter, not like it and then go to bed. Needless to say I got no sleep that night. By the time I got to the last page and put the book down it was well into the morning. After that I had to get the book for myself, and my (very patient) mother and I scoured the bookstores for it until finally we found one that could order a copy. I counted the days until that book came (One of the Penguin Press Editions, god knows where they exhumed an old edition like that from). When it came I had to read it again and again. The worst part though, was this little listing at the end of the book. It was a listing of all the other books in the Swallows and Amazons serries. It was horible because here were all these tantalizing titles and little blurbs about these books and I couldn't find them anywhere. In a heroic feat of book-shopping, my mother was actually able to find most of them (Thi was before the Goodine edition, so they were out of print), though she had to special order from England and Canada for a few of them. When they came, I don't think I did anything except read until I had read them all. It was horibel, though because some of them refered to event that happened in the books I hadn't read. Finally, however they were re-published and I was able to make my collection complete.After reading these books, I became enchanted with the sea and sailing. My library has becaome a lot more nautically oriented, and I take partial credit for my local book-store stocking the S&amp;A serries. =) Even today, I still will read them occasionally... Just to allown myself to forget about the present and be drawn into the most wonderful past imaginable. These are a must for any young reader, I have yet to find one that hates these books, and wonderful for adults, too. All I can say is buy them, you won't be disapointed. I just wish Ransome had written more."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Recently I've started going back and re-reading some of the books I loved as a child - something insprired by Francis Spufford's wonderful \\"The Child That books Built\\".One of my favorite series from my childhood was the Swallows & Amazons series. How I loved the idea of sailing off with the Walker and Blackett children; I had the biggest crush on Nancy that I've ever had for a fictional character!So, here I am re-reading them and they are truly as marvellous as they ever were. If you have any interest in sailing, camping, the lake district or just plain good story telling, read these books.The first in the series, Swallows & Amazons, is also, arguably, the best of the bunch. This is the tale at it's purest and before more and more characters come in to dilute the stories a little. Don't get me wrong - a number of the other books are also five star candidates but there will always be a special place in my heart for the one that started it all.For children today, I think these tales will still give something. For their time the girls in the stories were very strong characters - in particular Nancy Blackett holds her own with any of the boys. And where we do find some rather ... examples (the girls cook while the boys mend sails) I think we can easily put it in the context of the time, and use it as a touchpoint for how far equality has come (or perhaps to use examples of families where it really hasn't changed much).Arthur Ransome is very detailed about the specifics of sailing; for me that was part of the beauty of the books. I never did learn to sail but I always thought I could after reading his novels! But, if that's not your cup of tea, feel free to skip those parts - you won't lose much by doing so."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This famous telegram starts off the best sailing-hiking-camping books of all time. It is the regret of my life that I didn't discover them till I was in my 20s. Camping on an island without grownups! Sailing, exploring, &quot;war to the death&quot; with the best friends anyone could have! Stolen treasure! False accusations! Good sportsmanship! Walking the plank! These are especially good books for girls, because not only do the girls outnumber the boys, they frequently outdo them. When the Amazons suggest a war, Captain of the winning boat to be admiral of the fleet, Captain John doesn't give Captain Nancy any guff about &quot;girls can't be admirals.&quot; The formidable Nancy and Mate Peggy have a fair shot of beating his crew of four, and well he knows it! Nor does he use his authority as captain to boss his younger siblings around, as certain big brothers I could name would have; rather, he relies heavily on the judgement of Mate Susan, whose skills as cook! and quartermaster get plenty of respect. These kids are not duffers and will not drown, but man oh man, will they have a good time. So will you."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I read these books when I was a kid, and they were far-and-away myfavorites. My daughter picked up the first book in the series and she'shooked too. They're great teachers of self-reliance, creativity, fun, and the joy of adventure."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Believe all the great things you hear about this whole series...they are truly wonderful books. I read Swallows and Amazons a few years ago when I was about 33 and have since read the whole series....and now my husband is hooked! Don't hesitate to buy."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is a must for any personal library. The antics and mischief these six children get up to is hilarious. For instance, when Nancy and Peggy threw the lit Roman candle into the asleep Captian Flint's cabin window but showed no remorse. Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Excellent children's book, enjoyed also by many adult devotees. Very practical and concrete about sailing and camping, with a strong sense of place on a large lake. In the children's imaginative world they are explorers encountering new peoples in distant lands, which adds a sense of wonder."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This delightful book was first published in 1930 and, logically reflects the ethos and morals of the time.The story is set in the Lake District of Northern England and relates the adventures of two groups of children; John, Susan Titty and Roger, who are on holiday there, make up the Swallows, while Nancy and Peggy, who live there, are the Amazons.I first read this story when I was about twelve years old and have read the series of books several times in the last sixty years.As the introduction says, this book is about sailing, camping, fishing, swimming and piratical exploits on an uncharted lake (which bears a striking resemblance to Lake Windermere). The freshness of the early mornings on Wild Cat Island, the long days of sunshine, the challenge of lighting the camp fire and the unbridled pleasure of &#34;Messing around in boats&#34; totally enthralled me as a reader and gave me a life-long interest in sailing boats and camping.A delightful first book in an enthralling series. I higly recommend it to you.Steve Aldridge"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"It's dated, twee and (like all kids' books from that era) it's sometimes cringe-inducingly gender stereotyped. But I grew up with my heart and dreams afloat on Lake Windemere, sharing the kids' gentle adventures. And now that I revisit it as an adult, I see that Ransome also has a deft insight into a child's imaginary life.In addition as a child from this series I gained a love of, and learned a great deal about, sailing small boats.If only Kindle's awful low-res graphics did justice to his elegant and deceptively simple illustrations. But don't let that put you off, this is a tremendous series for any age."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Though the series of books are intended as children's stories, I read them as an adult and was delighted. They would be wonderful for reading aloud."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"a a true readers book.look at childhood in an earlier era while still displaying the adventures of ageless needs of children."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"sailing, camping, exploring, mining, all without adult supervision. What's not to love? My father grew up on these books, and I did as well. Then we gave them no a niece, and her family loved the books so much they planned a trip to England around the books."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is one of the best book series for young people and adults, too. It has been a favorite in England since it was published in the 1920's. There is also a Swallows and Amazon Society for those who do not want the fun it to end."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"The Swallows and Amazons series was one of my favorites when I was a child. The story, set in the Lake District of England where Wordsworth and other great poets grew up, is a gentle adventure tale about children camping out on an island and rigging a little sailboat. It is slower paced than children are used to today. But I think a sensitive boy or girl would find it reassuring that the children solve their own problems of navigation etc.While it didn't bother me as a child that the language was distinctly British, as I'd been prepared by the Winnie the Pooh stories, and Wind in the Willows, I would recommend Swallows and Amazons as a bedtime story to be read aloud by an adult reader. The reader could then explain the language. A map of the UK would help too, as the story is set in the Lake District.An adult storyteller might be interested in a biography of the series author, Arthur Ransome, who led an adventurous life - including work in the Soviet Union and marriage to a Russian woman."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Love this book! I read it for the first time this summer at age 43. I can't wait to finish our current read-aloud and start it. My freedom craving boy will love it! Still, with a pre-teen boy could they have found a better name for the child than \\"T*&ty\\" ?? I'll try to see if I can change it to cut down the giggles............. Outstanding adventure and so cool that the parents could let the kids do that!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Although written in the 1930s, the 'Swallows and Amazons' books are just as timeless now. The childrens adventures are fun and believable, and best of all, these books are refreshingly non-sexist. When you realise that Arthur Ransome was writing this series around the same time as Enid Blyton was writing the sexist and racist Famous 5 series, it becomes obvious just how little these books have dated and just how much fun they are to read today."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"EnchantingIt's hard to explain what makes this book so charming: The writing, the way the children and their relationships with each other are shown so clearly and believably, the very real adventures they have, the sense of place....but listing those traits doesn't do the book justice. It's also really funny in places! Ransome creates a world that is clearer and lighter and more enchanting than the one most of us live in -- but he's also written a realistic book. The Lake District DOES look the way he describes it, and there could be children like the Swallows and their friends the Amazon pirates.The books are for all ages, and I think they are also inspiring and a good influence! They make me want to have adventures -- and they encourage parents by example to let their children have them. The parents in the books are responsible, teach their children well -- and allow them to adventure on their own. They can do that because they've taught the children to have good judgment and be responsible.Arthur Ransome's own favorite in the series was WINTER HOLIDAY, which I also loved. Once the original characters leave the series, it loses its interest (for me, anyway) -- children who enjoyed the first books will also probably like Blow Out the Moon by Libby Koponen and all the E.Nesbit books."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is the first book in a wonderful series of adventure stories about ordinary children doing fairly ordinary things that make wonderful reading. The children are creative and imaginative, but in ways you can relate to and feel that you could be doing these fun things too.I could say a great deal more -- I have read all the stories multiple times, and my children have worn out several copies of them -- but I'll leave it at this: if you know a child from about 8 on up, get them these books and watch them turn into passionate readers."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I first read these books in the late fifties, when I was about ten. My family was living overseas and these were among the few children's books available. I loved them from the first page, read every one, and as an adult I have collected all of them--some in old editions, much harder to find 20+ years ago. I tried reading them to my children in the 1980s, and they didn't care for them--vocabulary unfamiliar, old-fashioned, and British. But I still love them. They do indeed remind us of a much simpler time--pre WWII-Britain. Unlike \\"Five Children and It\\" and other books of the same vintage, or today's Harry Potter books, there is no \\"magic\\" in these books. The magic takes place in the real earth, water, and people world. Adventures are invented and carried out by the children themselves. Adults are a presence and affect the plots, but they stay in the background. When not feeling well, or in a nostalgic mood, I pick these up again."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I cannot do any more justice to Swallows and Amazons then the excellent reviewers above.If this book proves a little difficult with sailing terminolgy (which in no way affects the story) try to get your mittens on a radio dramatisation from the BBC or even an abridged audio book: Adults- do not deprive yourself; Children- scream till Mum or Dad buys it, they will thank you for it soon!!A heart warming story of adventure and imagination and camping out in more innocent times.Then get addicted to the series. . ."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Arthur Ransome's holiday series, beginning with \\"Swallows and Amazons\\" are essential reads, namely because of their literary importance as the first children's books to fall into the \\"holiday adventure\\" genre. But of course, they're so much more than that. Ransome's books are a valuable glimpse back into an age that no longer exists, in which children were trusted to use their imagination in providing entertainment for themselves, and their common sense in keeping themselves safe. There were no qualms about sending children out from under the watchful eyes of grown-ups, entrusting them with the upkeep of a small yacht, and allowing them an extraordinary amount of freedom in their adventures and explorations.In today's world of cell-phones, day-care, babysitters, stranger-danger, organized fun and parental supervision, all designed to keep children safe, young readers will be bursting with envy when vicariously joining in on the Walker children's fun.There are four Walker children: responsible John, motherly Susan, dreamy Titty (short for Letitia) and energetic Roger. Each have distinct personalities, but each are enraptured with the sight of an island offshore from the holiday home in the Lake District where they're staying with their mother and baby sister. All eagerly await permission from their father to camp out on the island, and when the good news finally comes, it doesn't take long before they're packed and sailing aboard the \\"Swallow\\" out to the island.The story itself can hardly be described as a \\"story\\" per say, as the length of the book simply follows their adventures out on the island and the lake, chronicling how the children find new friends, cook their own dinners, make their own campsite, handle their boat, map out their locations and the other one hundred little things that encompass childhood life.Of course, a few things do stand out, such as their meeting with the wild Nancy and Peggy Blackett, the owners of the \\"Amazon\\", with whom the Walkers engage in playful warfare, first with each other, and then with the Blackett's Uncle Jim (dubbed Captain Flint). After starting off on the wrong foot with Captain Flint, the houseboat dwelling Uncle soon becomes privy to the games of the children, joining in to a much larger extent than any other adult in the text. And soon the Walker children (especially Titty) find a way to be of great use to Captain Flint, who suffers a loss when his houseboat is robbed.Each child brings a different viewpoint to the story: John the eldest is taking the first steps toward being a man, and looking after the younger siblings, not just by attending to their physical needs and dealing with the \\"natives\\" when need be, but by instructing them on practical skills, such as swimming and sailing. It's hard not to get the warm-fuzzies when he teaches Roger how to swim, or when he comforts him when he gets nervous during a midnight foray into enemy waters.Susan (bearing a striking resemblance to C.S. Lewis's Susan inThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (The Chronicles of Narnia)) plays second-in-command to John, and despite the fact that she's a bit more domesticated than John (being in charge of the cooking and cleaning in the campsite) she's just as apt as he as at sailing, and treated as an equal by her older brother.Titty is the bookworm of the group, constantly referring their adventures to her favourite booksTreasure Island (Enriched Classics Series)andRobinson Crusoe (Modern Library Classics)(in fact, it may help if you have a vague knowledge of these books, given that they're referred to so often by Titty). Determined and dreamy, she's the ringleader in terms of the imaginative fancies of the children, insisting on illusions of pirates, treasure and danger even when the others are ready to concentrate on reality.Finally, Roger is the youngest, liable to be a bit troublesome at times, but cared for by the two eldest, and the most likely to get carried away by Titty's stories. Plus, he can be pretty adorable at times. After a night-long boat ride, he: \\"yawned, pulled himself up by the gunwale to look over the side, had one look, and then, without saying anything, settled down to sleep again.\\"Drawing on his own experiences as a child, Ransome is extremely sympathetic toward a child's point of view. For example, the children refer to all adults as \\"natives\\" throughout their adventures on the island, and the text itself follows their lead by joining in and also using the term \`native' in the place of \`adult'. Whenever the children get caught up in their imaginative wonderings, the text is more than happy to play along with them, referring to the children as Captain, Able-Seaman, Mate and Ship's Boy, pulling the reader not just into the atmosphere of the Lake District, but into the minds of the children themselves.Within the context of the story, the pretending becomes as real as the children believe it to be - Ransome never goes overboard, but certainly keeps up the pretence whilst the game lasts. This would be a great book to lend to a person who has forgotten what it's like to think like a child, and any child will instantly recognize the way in which the Walkers go about their business.And it contains the rarest thing of all to be found in children's literature: sympathetic parents. Although the Walker father is not to be seen in this installment, it is his telegram that gives the children leave to camp out on the island, with the words: \\"Better drowned than duffers. If not duffers, won't drown.\\" There's an entire philosophy as to how to raise children found in that simple passage. Furthermore, their mother (often called \\"the friendly native\\") is more than happy to play along with some of their games, providing them with the supplies they need whilst respecting their desire for independence.The novel portrays a delicate picture of adult/child relations, in which the adults are constantly aware of what the children are up to, but reluctant to impinge upon the children's first taste of independence. Sometimes they can't help themselves of course, as the children are constantly surprised at just how much the adults are aware of what they're up to: \\"They all held together, a huge network of gossip and scouting, through the meshes of which it was difficult for explorers and pirates to slip.\\" There is a delicately constructed tension between the inner child's world and the outer adult world, one that is never negatively portrayed, but with a sense of reassurance and frustration in the minds of the child that is surely familiar to everyone.Uninitiated readers may be put off by the lack of drive in the narrative - as I've mentioned, there is little in the way of story here, but those that know what to expect (and stick with it, as admittedly, it does start a little slowly) will soon find themselves caught up in the day-to-day adventures of six likeable, fun-loving, sensible children. This is a nostalgic look back at a world that possibly no longer exists; where children were trusted to look after themselves, expected to do the right thing, and had the entire world (or at least an island, which is just as good) to explore all by themselves."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"When I first read these books in the 70's, the last vestiges of the \\"exploring lifestyle\\" of American childhood were fading. Swallows and Amazons (and the rest of the series) is a wonderful childhood fantasy in which adults melt into their proper background and a couple of sailboats become sources of high adventure. Of course, there was no chance of replicating the imaginative travels of the kids in these books - but they were fulfilling nonetheless.Now that even twilight hide-n-go-seek and firefly hunts are threatened by the ever encroaching world, the stories of Swallows & Amazons seem even more remote - and become more beautiful in their portrait of a childhood that will never be again, and perhaps never really was."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"In a lifetime of reading, I don't believe I have ever found a book that I loved as much as I did (and do) SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS and the other books of Arthur Ransome. Set in The English Lake district between the wars, the books tell of the adventures of a group of children unbound by parental restrictions, something totally unheard of in my world. These fortunate children, with whom the reader immediately identifies, are allowed to sail the English lakes alone and to enjoy the carefree and innocent adventures that were possible in this world. The only writer who comss close to Ransome in my experience is the late Iris Murdoch, but of course Ransome is a children's writer and in that he cannot be surpassed. I discovered the books at about 10 years of age but was grown before I realized that other people had read them too and loved them as much as I had.

That sounds like a hard sell for a modern reader. It probably is. But. There is a reasonable chance that the book might catch a middle grade reader's fancy. It is straight forward old time adventure. Made up, imaginative, on vacation, creative play adventure. No magic and no fantasy. No murders or mysteries. Just a bunch of kids having fun, role playing, and getting into mild mischief.Lots of reviews are way over the top. \\"Silvery present and golden retrospect\\". Really? The book is a throwback to the childhoods made up of unsupervised all-day playing, with only the admonition to \\"be home by dark\\". I gather that that kind of play is supposed to be becoming more and more rare. If so, maybe some kids will be inspired by this book. Or, they will at least enjoy that aspect of childhood vicariously through the Swallows and Amazons. Or, they may just turn up their noses at it in favor of their own way of playing and making fun. But however it works out, this seems to be a good book to have available to try out."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This was my dad's favorite book.

Their adventures are similar to what I haveoften dreamed of - getting a boat and having adventures onand around an island!But their adventures are not limited tothe island, they evenvisit &quot;the natives&quot; back home. What'sbest about their adventures is that all of them are possible!They don't do impossible things like ride on drangons orbecome invisible. Their adventures really could happen! Iloved this book from the start, and have read it again andagain. I would also reccomend the other books in this series.They are all super, and will become treasures to pass on tolater generations. Thank you, Mr. Ransome, for writing sucha wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I didn't discover Ransome's series until I was in my 20s, but I picked the first one up out of curiosity and was hooked.As a child, I was a great explorer, going all over the local landscape, giving names to the different topographical features. I loved to camp and ramble. I loved boating, although I never sailed, and a picnic on an island in the river nearby (and a chance to explore said island on my own while everyone else was fishing) was a joy I'll never forget.This book, and the others in the series, recapture those happy days for me. This one is very innocent, with no real violence or menace, but full of joyful adventure. The children are great role models; they're feisty and independent, yet still respectful of their elders. They're imaginative but know when to set aside their fantasies and deal with realities.The book also conveys the joy of adventure and the great outdoors, and also shows that everyone has something important to contribute. Sure, one member of the group might be more interested in cooking and provisions, but that's necessary.The adults take a back seat in these books, generally, but they're there. This one, especially, can be seen as a test by the parents to see how responsible their children are, and it's implicit that the kids are doing their best to prove themselves to their parents. The parents don't neglect them, they're there if they're needed, and check up on them regularly, but they also give them space to ramble and have an adventure.Today it may seem as if these parents are letting their kids run wild; but I think families today could use books like this. When you have kids who are shuttled back and forth to band practice and swim team and heaven knows what else, they need the time to just relax and let things happen. When kids live in front of the TV and play video and computer games all day, they need to be reminded that there is all sorts of adventure outside. When kids are smothered by overprotective or controlling parents, they need space to be independent and prove themselves.The only caveat I can give this book is sometimes the language can be confusing. The accumulation of sailing terms can bog a novice down, and there are some Britishisms that may puzzle some American readers, like referring to something called \\"bunloaf\\" and calling dessert \\"pudding.\\" But heck, that's only minor, and ideally will inspire readers to do some research.I highly recommend this for older readers, for children who enjoy the great outdoors or for children who have the opportunities and need to be inspired to take them. Adults, like me, who have happy memories of exploring will enjoy this as well, and it may inspire more adventures! These books may inspire you to buy more camping equipment, so beware! :)"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"Arthur Ransome's &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; is the first in a classic series of children's stories that will appeal to readers of all ages. The book is set in the English Lake District in the period between the two World Wars, (where the author was living at the time). It tells of a time when a healthy imagination (and the freedom to take advantage of it) was enough to keep most youngsters both amused and out of mischief. The world was a safer and simpler place back then and this book does much to make us realise just how much has been irretrievably lost since.Not that this was ever Ransome's intention, of course. He was simply drawing upon his own boyhood experiences (from a yet earlier time) as well as contemporary ones of the children of a family friend. He used these to weave an enchanting tale that would remind those same children (by then returned \`home' to the deserts of the Middle East) of a happy summer spent sailing in England.The story's strong basis in reality (albeit several separate realities, as it were), tempered with Ransome's love of sailing (and his knowledge of Lake District life), imbue the book with a strong sense of authority. Both the text and the author's own pen-and-ink illustrations also have an endearing charm that comes across even now, some 70 years after the book was first published. One of the great things about this book (and indeed, the whole series of books that was to follow) is that Ransome avoids most of the stereotypical treatments of children's roles that his contemporaries (as well as later authors) continually espoused. He always manages to treat (nearly!) all of his characters as equal partners in their activities, whatever their age, gender or background. The children are also afforded a greater respect and rather more freedom by the adults than is common these days, too.And while the children's \`adventures' are nothing fantastical or extra-ordinary when viewed from an absolute perspective, Ransome manages to convey so much of the children's own excitement at their activities that the reader can't help being drawn into their world and so come to share some of that same excitement. All in all, this a delightful book and should be on everybody's essential reading list, regardless of their age!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I discovered SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS as a child of twelve and was thoroughly delighted. I cannot imagine why this classic series has not achieved the same status in the United States. This first volume in the series follows the children of the Swallow family as they summer in the English lake country. The story charts their adventures as they sail, camp, discover nature around them interact with each other and two girls from a houseboat (the Amazons). It is a lovely wistful book that evokes the grandeur of childhood games in nature. In the background of the story is a faint hint of the World War (the Swallows' father is in the Navy) but the sense that the children are being sheltered from adult concerns but that only heightens the loveliness of their childhood lives.Budding anglophile children who love the English details of the Harry Potter books or the Narnia Chronicles should love the depiction of these children. (Although there is no magic in Ransome's series of books other than the ordinary magic of childhood.) It would also be an excellent choice for children who love nature or are learning to sail. I imagine it would be equally well-loved by both boys and girls. The illustrations are charming and in some of the books the diagrams of boats are quite detailed."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 37 and loved it so much I took to the sea and had adventures of my own. It's a wonderful, wonderful book for anyone who has ever dreamed of being on a boat -- or even for anyone who hasn't. Pemmican, bunloaf and chocolate have become staples of my diet; the descriptions of Susan's meals are out-of-this-world. In addition, the book is filled with practical lessons for sailing from how to line up markers to get into a hidden harbor to how to sail at night. I am Titty and my friend is Susan because he keeps careful lists and is always prepared. Our boat is &quot;Summer Song&quot; and we sail on the coast of Maine. We're looking forward to David Godine's publication of the complete series of books."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This series appears to inspire fanaticism in those of us lucky enough to read them as children. Included with a bunch of Enid Blytons from my grandmother this was one of my favorite books of childhood and has become an odd literary touchstone in my older friendships. An interesting adventure story that remains rooted in reality yet gives life to the childrens' fantasies this is a book I can always retreat into. I only wish my vacations had been like those of the Walkers and Blacketts. Their camping and sailing adventures in the English Lake District are not overly dated(considering they were written in the 1930's) and probably the least sexist childrens books from that era and from today- the girls and boys have equal responsibilities and the most charismatic character is Nancy Blackett, captain of the Amazons. I don't understand how these books have remained in such relative obscurity for so long."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"&quot;Who would wave a flag to be rescued if they had a desert island of their own? That was the thing that spoilt *Robinson Crusoe*. In the end he came home. There never ought to be an end.&quot; - Arthur Ransome.Even though I am quite knowledgeable about children's literature, I had never heard of Arthur Ransome, until Helen McCarthy's book on the master of Japanese animation taught me that this English author of the early twentieth century was one of Hayao Miyazaki's favorite writers for children, together with Rosemary Sutcliff and Philippa Pearce. As the director of such masterpieces as *My Neighbour Totoro*, *Kiki's Delivery Service* and *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind*, Miyazaki had to know what he was talking about, so I ordered the first half of this twelve-volume series, based only on his opinion and that of Amazon's enthusiastic reviewers. Knowing that the British even have their &quot;Arthur Ransome Society&quot;, &quot;formed in 1990 with the aim of celebrating his life and his books&quot;, also made me very confident in the power of his novels.As I read the first few dozen pages of the book, I first thought Ransome might have been a little overrated by readers who had grown up with him and were merely being nostalgic. I also had to acknowledge that I am not an outdoors person, and that camping and sailing have never had much appeal to me: I'd rather stay at home with a good book. So at first, *Swallows and Amazons* merely felt like a cute story about four brothers and sisters spending a few days on a little island on some unidentified English lake, putting up their tents, preparing meals and exploring their surroundings, their vision of the world transfigured by the influence of such novels as *Treasure Island* and *Robinson Crusoe*.But gradually, the novel grew on me. I started to be drawn into this little universe, rediscovering the curiosity and the sheer joy of being alive I had experienced as a kid: the same delight at watching birds go about their business, being caught in a thunderstorm or playing the part of whatever hero I fancied.*Swallows and Amazons* is not a highly introspective book, but it brilliantly manages to capture the sense of life of pre-adolescent children. Most interesting is the protagonists' use of the word &quot;native&quot;: at first, I thought they were merely applying the word to the locals, as they were pretending to be explorers on an uncharted sea. But then I realized the concept had many layers, and actually signified any person - child or adult - who would not participate in the world of make-believe children live in. Talk or any other behaviour can be &quot;native&quot;: it merely has to spoil the fun by its practicality and lack of inspiration.I can understand why the politically correct crowd should boo Ransome's novels. Of course, his characters are white and middle-class, but there is also a deeper epistemological reason at work: the children in these books are shown to be doing exactly the same kind of thing as the advocates of PC, i.e. renaming the various objects in their environment in order to indulge in a kind of shared fantasy. Uncle Jim is turned into &quot;Captain Flint&quot;, ginger beer into &quot;grog&quot; and water lillies into octopuses. Therefore, quite unexpectedly (and anachronistically), the novel can be read as a parody of political correctness, as even children are never completely fooled by their own word games and are quite capable of reverting to &quot;native talk&quot; whenever the situation calls for it.If you enjoyed Richard Donner's *The Goonies*, *Swallows and Amazons* will take you on the same kind of juvenile adventure, only it is not a Spielberg production of the mid-1980s, but an English novel of 1930. I particularly recommend it to Objectivist parents who are looking for good books for their children, because it presents independent and honest heroes without ever praising religion or the virtue of self-sacrifice."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"The great strength of Arthur Ransome's &quot;juveniles&quot; is that he never talks down to his young readers (which makes the books equally enjoyable by adults), and despite his own years, he seems to be able to slip effortlessly into an underage mindset and share the wonder and imagination of young people living what is in essence a fantasy life with a very solid grounding in reality (preparing their own meals, sailing to Dixons' Farm for their milk each morning). Set in the gorgeous Lake Country of Northern England, it follows the four Walkers (John, Susan, Titty (presumably her real name is Letitia!), and Roger (baby sister Vicky is too small to take part in their adventures), as they go camping on the small island they have observed from the farm where they're spending their summer holidays, explore the lake and its shores, and meet the Amazons--sisters Nancy (&quot;Shiver my timbers!&quot;) and Peggy Blackett, who were &quot;born on the shores of the Amazon River, which flows into this ocean.&quot; Living on a houseboat anchored in a nearby cove is the Amazons' uncle, whom the six (following on Titty's declaration that he must be &quot;a retired pirate&quot;) quickly christen Captain Flint. When he accuses John of setting off a firecracker on his cabin roof, war is declared. Meanwhile there's a thrilling cutting-out expedition by dark of night as the Swallows try to capture the Amazons' boat so John can be Commodore of the Fleet, an encounter with the charcoal-burners known as The Billies (Titty. ever the most imaginitive of the group, calls them &quot;savages&quot;), and a burglary of the houseboat (not, of course, by the children). The story climaxes with the Fleet's assault on the houseboat and a splendidly described thunderstorm.All six of the child characters are individuals sketched with loving and lifelike attention, who behave like real children; that they're British and growing up in the '30's may take some adjustment (and explanation to younger audiences), but it doesn't detract from the joys of the book. The imagery and names they use for their surroundings are wonderful. Like all the series, it would make a splendid family read-aloud."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"I first read this when I was a child, and remember crying buckets when it finished because I thought there was no more - in fact I was wrong, there are eleven more books, all wonderful. These stories are full of joy, inoocence and adventure, and are a tonic in our dark and uncertain times. I visited the scenes of some of them in England, and was surprised at how geographically exact they are. The characters are real, the stories believeable, and, with the various illustrations by the author, they create a truely magic world. They are also books about how to do things. You can, for example. p[ick up quite a good education in sailing and seamanship from reading them, along with how to smelt gold, burn charcoal, survey tidal mudflats, and all manner of other things. Hal GP Colebatch's book, \\"Return of the Heroes,\\" which I have reviewed in its own page, sets out a good deal about Ransome, and among other things indicates some relationships between him and Tolkien. If you love sailing, and the innocent, sunny golden days of childhood, buy these books and do yourself a favour. If you have hildren, buy these books for them!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"My father introduced me to the masterful tales of Arthur Ransome at the age of 5; since then I hvae treasured them above all other books in my collection. They become better with age, and I find myself seeking comfort in their pages more and more as I grow older. The stories inspired a sailboat purchase of our own, and I have spent many happy hours adrift in emulation of the Walkers and Blacketts. As a child, I remeber aching to join the Swallows and Amazons on Wildcat Island, and am utterly content when I can through Ransom's beautiful and simple prose."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"For everyone, who, like me, is always confused where in the series a specific book fits in, this book is the first in the series of Swallows and Amazons. It is a fantastic book about four children who camp on an island in a lake in England. They soon meet two girls who own a sailing dinghy and consider themselves to be pirates. The book is filled with sailing, and adventure, and takes place in the 1940s(I think). Since sailing technology has changed since then this makes the book interesting to read for people who have sailed before or are interested in it. I wold reccomend this book to everyone. The whole series is great and you should read them all."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"We selected this book as a read-aloud. We tried and tried, but just couldn't get into it. The vocabulary is VERY sophisticated, quaint, and old-fashioned. Also, it's hard to understand all the sailing terminology. It has sentences like this: \\"Is there a cleat under the thwart where the mast is stepped?\\" Who talks like that???"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is a very interesting and sweet story. It's cute and fun. But I just could not get through it as a read-aloud. The sailing terminology was really annoying, but that is what a dictionary is for. The real problem is in the lack of plot. The kids just go and do their thing. There isn't any problem or climax. I've made it through almost a hundred long books, novels, even Science encyclopedias. We were excited at first, but when there was no plot after 250 pages, I gave up. I'll see if my 7 year old voracious reader will finish it. My kids do like it, but even they aren't asking me to read it all the time, like they usually do when we are in the middle of a good book. I will say if you are a careful parent, this book is very healthy and morally upstanding except for a very few times when the children call each other names."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This book comes enormously recommended by the Brits who read it as children. I read it as an American adult and I'll be interested to see what my children make of it. I think it fits into those books that were so magical not because of what they contained but because of what I, the 10 year old reader, contained. I can see this story of summer freedom with a sailboat, as a jumping off point for imagination.My childhood equivalent was \\"What the Witch Left\\" -- it was my mind that made it a five star book."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"A solitary bachelor is inexorably drawn into the violent fantasy world of two underage gangs.A children's classic."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This was a pretty good book.

Milne minus the fantastic and adventure. Yet somehow without those things that so often make a good read, it was very enjoyable. Mostly because it was well written. The book shines as an example of lightheartedness and childhood imagination. I wouldn't recommend it to kids used to short, fast paced material, but rather the more patient young reader."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"What did kids do to amuse and entertain themselves before television, video games, computers, and smart phones? They played outside and used their imagination. That's exactly what Captain John Walker, his sister Mate Susan, their sister Able-seaman Titty, and brother the Boy Roger do. Their father, probably in the Royal Navy, is on a ship at Malta but under orders for Hong-King, so for their summer vacation their mother has rented a cottage on a farm at Holly Howe located next to a huge lake. They also have a baby sister, Vicky, who is taken care of by a nurse. The children have been taught how to sail, and they have use of the farm's sailboat, the Swallow. While out on the lake, they find an island where they receive permission to camp.During the course of their adventure, they meet up with the Blacketts, Captain Nancy (real name Ruth) and sister Mate Peggy, who have their own pirate sailboat, the Amazon, along with the girls' uncle James Taylor who lives on a houseboat near the island and becomes \\"Captain Flint\\" to the children. The Swallows and the Amazons declare war on each other with victory going to the side who can take the others' ship, then together they declare war on Captain Flint. Who will win? How will a burglary at Captain Flint's houseboat affect their relationship? And what will they do when a huge storm comes up over Wild Cat Island? The book had its beginning long before when as a child author Arthur Mitchell Ransome, with his brother and sisters, spent most of their holidays on a farm at the south end of Coniston and played on the nearby lake, but it was further inspired by a summer in which Ransome taught the children of his friends, the Altounyans, to sail. In fact, three of the Altounyan children's names are adopted directly for the Walker family.Swallows and Amazons, a paean to children's make-believe play and exploring their surrounding world, is a very pleasant story that involves the great outdoors, boats, fishing, and camping, with rich characterization, vivid descriptions, wholesome reading, and old-fashioned ideals. It includes a good deal of everyday Lakeland life in the early twentieth century, from the local farmers to charcoal burners working in the woods. Seldom have I ever come to the end of a book and felt sorry that it was over. If you read it and reach the same conclusion, you're in luck! Ransome wrote eleven more books in the \\"Swallows and Amazons Forever\\" series: Swallowdale (1931); Peter Duck (1932); Winter Holiday (1933); Coot Club (1934); Pigeon Post (1936); We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea (1937); Secret Water (1939); The Big Six (1940); Missee Lee (1941); The Picts And The Martyrs: or Not Welcome At All (1943); and Great Northern? (1947). A thirteenth book, Coots in the North, was left incomplete at the time of Ransome's 1967 death and published in an unfinished form in 1988 with some other short works. In subsequent adventures in the series, the children progressively grow older, change their usual roles, and become explorers or miners."},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is a fantastic book.

Swallows and Amazons is the first in a series of 12 books dealing with the Walker and Blackett children. They have adventures that any kid could have, meaning they're not fanciful or science fictiony... but that's not to say they aren't imaginative and fun! Ransome truly captures what it's like to be a kid, inventing stories and names for the places around you, switching between make believe and real life, and generally having a good time. For a long time they were very hard to find, so I'm grateful they've been republished and are available again. I highly recommend this series!"},{"Title":"Swallows and Amazons","review":"This is a first in a series of books about the Swallows and the Amazons written by Arthur Ransome before WWII. The Swallows and Amazons are two groups of children who meet during the summer. Initially, they are hostile toward each other as the Swallows set up camp on the Wild Cat Island which is claimed by the Amazons. But eventually, they become allies and experience a series of adventures. Each group has a small sail boat so most of their adventures are on water, having races, exploring the \\"unknown\\" and fighting against the house boat of the Amazon's uncle Jim, otherwise called Captain Flint the retired pirate.I first read this and Ransome's other books as a child and loved them! So I recently bought them for my own children as they searched for exciting adventure books. Needless to say my children love the books as well and read them both on their own but also as a family. The books capture the imagination of all children by taking them on the types of adventures children dream of. This is a wonderful book that should be present in every juvenile library.

Oh, but it should be so!See also the excellent movie made in 1974 also titled Swallows and Amazons. Simon West is John, the biggest boy and Stephen Grendon is Roger. Would that boys were ever so good, well behaved and nice? Say it wasn't so! These kids are so good that any parent would switch one of his monsters for these boys.In some ways, this story reminds one of Agatha Christie's Poriot storys, especially the films with David Suchet.

The narrator doesn't have enough range to make the characters sound different - instead she tries to convey character by reading lines in an exaggerated way.

The children are an adventurous lot and love sailing in their boat, the Swallow. Towards the end of their holiday they persuade their mum to allow them on an adventure for a week. They're allowed to sail across to the island not far away and make camp there by themselves.This is a great adventure for these intrepid explorers. They discover a retired pirate, camp, bathe in the lake, fish and cook for themselves, and are threatened by a rival group of bandits, the Amazons (otherwise known as Nancy and Peggy).

He never talks down; he explains. He is a master of suspense and the carefully-crafted plot. The four Walker children and the Blackett twins meet in the English Lake District, and with imagination and the help of co-operative adults their world becomes a world of pirates, explorers and naturalists. The reader is left with the feeling that if only you had the right brothers and sisters and friends, he too could have the same experiences as those children, if only he looked hard enough.

Such ordinary virtues in credible settings fired my imagination and excited my interest away from my squalid childhood circumstances. I owe a great debt to Arthur Ransome's writings.

Iwould add that Ransome has great insight into theminds of children (and adults), and his charactersare fully rounded, not the stick figures usuallyfound in &quot;series&quot; type children's adventures. At the same time, Ransome never preaches and never makes his point too obviously. The Walker and Blackett children (and the Callums in the later books) grow and change as they encounter challenges and difficulties that real children might actually encounter . . . although I'm not entirely convinced that these children are wholly fictional.

While this is not intended to be a theology text book and does not address any issue in depth, our parish has found it to be the perfect resource for persons in the Pre-Catechumenate stage of Christian Initiation. The colorful illustrations and very readable text are attractive and inviting. The articles lend themselves well to discussion questions that draw on the life experience of the participants.

His detail from the Celts and geography to the reign of George V is remarkable. While many of the &quot;MTV&quot; generation may find it dry and without enough visuals, Cheyney was very precise in choosing which visuals would accentuate the text. He does this masterfully. This text should be updated to the reign of Elizabeth II and required in any British History course. As a teacher, I would strongly recommend every school that desires to give History its proper respect to buy this book for its teachers and libraries. Again, this book gives such rich detail to English History that it proves to be indispensable to any World History or English History class."},{"Title":"A short history of England,","review":"A Short History of England by the late Edward P. Cheney (University of Pennsylvania) is an excellent introduction to English history, highlighting the major events from Roman times to World War II (my edition was published in 1944). Cheney devotes particular attention to aspects of the subject that are of particular importance to understanding the development of English government and laws and how they provided the foundations for the American Colonies and the constitution and legal structure of the United States today. A few examples include:1. The various peoples who settled Britain and their contributions to British traditions: Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Danes, Normans.2. Britain's relationship with mainland Europe, especially France, Britain's historical adversary up to the time of World War I. By shifting its alliances among the continental powers, Britain was able to prevent any one country from becoming dominant on the continent. The resulting political and economic competition among European rivals produced the conditions described in The Rise of the Western World, by Douglass North and Robert Thomas.3. The events and documents that form Britain's \\"unwritten\\" constitution: Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628), the Habeas Corpus Act (1679), the Bill of Rights (1689) and the (religious) Toleration Act(1689). These all served to protect the individual Englishman from the tyranny of the state (in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent on the European continent at these times) and have become the basis for safeguarding individual freedom worldwide.4. The joint and interacting histories of Britain and the American Colonies from the foundation of the Jamestown Colony (1607) and the first representative government in America (Virginia's House of Burgesses, 1619), through the turmoil of the English Civil War (1640-49), the Commonwealth (1649-1660), the Restoration (of the Stuart monarchy, 1660-1688) and the Glorious Revolution (1688). The modern form of British government came out of these events during the same years that representative government was evolving in the Colonies along similar but not identical lines. See The Cousins' Wars by Kevin Phillips for a description of the political and religious themes that are common to the English Civil War, American Revolution and American Civil War.5. The formation and evolution of the British Empire. The dissolution of the empire occurred after my edition of Cheney's book was published. Niall Ferguson's book, Empire, fills this gap, describing the rise and demise of the British Empire and its contributions to its former colonies, contributions which he describes as, on balance, positive due to the transmittal of the English traditions of political and economic freedom around the world.Cheney's book is written at a level appropriate for the general reader, requiring no special background. I have found it an invaluable resource for filling in gaps or providing background for other more specific histories, such as those cited above.The Amazon web site indicates that a new Textbook Edition is to be published soon. This is welcome news. The new edition should be used as the text for a (required?) high school course on English History to help students understand that the United States didn't just spring forth out of nowhere in 1776. Our Founding Fathers had over 1776 years of English history, government, law, tradition, and culture to draw upon."},{"Title":"Ecografia Fetal y Pediatrica Casos-Syllabus (Spanish Edition)","review":"I obviously am biased in analyzing the English version of this text which I co-wrote.

Professor Parker's tortured retelling of this very funny play sucks the humor out in favor of clever witticisms and offensive stereotypes. He has forgotten that this was a play written during the Peloponnesian Wars, and was a direct response to that conflict. If he had not, then why the references to Hamlet and other plays? Are we supposed to follow the story or applaud Parker's precocious re-telling? If you read this play as part of a class and use the anthology \\"The Living Theatre\\", do yourself a favor and get another translation."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"THIIS BOOK ALWAYS KEPT YOU READING.

It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"Having read several different translations of Lysistrata, I can report that the one you select may make all the difference in your opinion of this early comedy. Roche's translation is very vulgar but has good footnotes: get ready for cockney Spartans, however. Jack Lindsay's translation, done in 1925 (included in the Bantam edition of Aristophanes) seems to be overly literary in comparison to the original but lacks notes. It reads well, though sounds a little old-fashioned. The bawdry is present but made less direct; in this one the Spartan dialect is Scottish.I found Parker's translation to be the least satisfactory. The \\"hillbilly\\" dialect he gives the Spartans is painfully overdone,not to mention inaccurate, and the speeches are awkward and pedestrian. An excellent edition overall is Alan H. Sommerstein's in the Penguin Classic \\"Aristophanes: Lysistrata and Other Plays.\\" The introduction and notes are extremely informative, and the translation itself strikes the right note to represent Aristophanes' style in English. (Once again, though, the Spartans are Scots.)But perhaps the best choice is Sarah Ruden's 2003 edition. Her dialogue is unusually funny without straying too far from the original. Added value comes from her four very readable essays on Greek democracy, warfare, women, and comedy. It's also printed on quality paper and comes with a great cover!"},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"Lysistrata is perhaps my favorite of the Greek plays-it's never pompous or overbearing, and it never overwhelms itself with flowery prose. In addition, it's one of the few Greek plays I've read that portrays women as genuine human beings rather than murderers, decorations, or idiots. They're smart, sexy, and socially aware, especially in a time when they were very seriously repressed.Lysistrata is an intelligent Athenian woman who is sick and tired of the Greek city-states warring against each other. She calls all the women she can round up and comes up with a strategy to end the wars: Keep away from their husbands' beds, and the men will make peace with other cities to make peace with their wives. After a great deal of whining, the women agree to deprive their husbands of sex until peace is achieved. But that's only the beginning of what Lysistrata has planned...Too many feminist tales end up being heavy-handed-though women are on the side of peace and right in this, it doesn't bang you over the head. The men are human as well. The comedy is sly and witty (though full of mild sex talk--nothing too raunchy) and the scene where one young woman unmercifully teases her love-hungry husband will have you rolling.I can see someone making this into a movie-in modern or ancient settings, the dialogue can still be deciphered without a translation program *wink*. It's a story about the power that women can wield and the lengths that they can go to.Read, laugh, guffaw! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"&quot;. . .Here's how it works:We'll paint, powder, and pluck ourselves to the lastdetail, and stay inside, wearing those filmytunics that set off everything we have-and thenslink up to the men. They'll snap to attention, goabsolutely mad to love us-but we won't let them. We'll abstain.-I imagine they'll conclude a treaty rather quickly&quot;I picked this up when I saw that many peace groups were putting it on as sort of an answer to the warlike nature of our times. Apparently, it's a timeless notion- The women of the city were tired with wars, so they decided to collectively cut their husbands off. Of course, this leads to man funny incedents, as neither men or women find it easy to deal with this.I wonder what everyone is suggesting today? The Great American Poke Out? This is a wonderful, short play, and the translation preserves all of the puns and metaphors that color this comedy with innuendo.In a warlike world, it's fun to be able to sit back and enjoy a llittle comic fantasy. And at the price, you're paying less than the average movie: for something far better, in my humble opinion.Get this book!"},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"I wholeheartedly disagree with the review of LYSISTRATA (Douglass Parker translation) as left by Mr. Russell A. Potter. As a theatre practicioner (a stage director), I have read and studied a number of versions/translations of this work. By far, Mr. Parker's translation is the funniest, the most accessible, and the most entertaining.As for the use of what Mr. Potter refers to as \\"poor white trash\\" dialects, this technique (convention) is not exclusive to Mr. Parker's translation. Many of the translations that I've read present the Spartans as perhaps extremely southern or even \\"hillbilly\\"-like, as does Mr. Parker's translation. It seems unfair to refer to the dialect as \\"poor white trash.\\" That statement appears to reflect more of the \\"prejudice\\" that Mr. Potter refers to than does the text itself.The use of the dialect is purposeful. It is one of the things that helps make the work more accessible to modern audiences. The war in the play is between Athens and Sparta - the north and south of Greece, much like our US Civil War. There is much logic in presenting the Spartans as southern, albeit in a distorted fashion; after all, this play is a burlesque. It is not meant to be taken literally. I will concede that the dialect does make the Spartan characters seem much less cultured and sophisticated than the Athenian characters, but that too is an accurate portrayal of how the Athenians at the time of the writing viewed the Spartans (mostly brawn, little brains); after all, Aristophanes was an Athenian.The Spartans were not seen in their society as being very culturally evolved as compared to the Athenians (much in the same way that a New Yorker might view a \\"hillbilly\\" as being less sophisticated). A prejudice? Perhaps. But more importantly, it is an accurate portrayal of societal perceptions. Mr. Parker presents this societal view effectively. The Spartan women are every bit as strong and wise as the Athenian women; the Spartan men are no more buffoonish than the Athenian men.Overall, the translation works very well. Its dialogue is the least stagey and contrived of the various translations I've read. It is not a \\"literal\\" word-for-word translation (as Mr. Parker himself admits), but it fully captures the essence of the original work and puts it in a perspective that allows the play to make greater sense to the modern audience. Rather than avoiding this translation \\"at all costs,\\" the reader might do well to embrace it as a witty, clever, and in its own way very sophisticated translation of the ancient Greek classic."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"Sex, war, peace, the ingredients to a great play. Lysistrata is about women who are tired of losing their sons in battle. The women band together to bring peace by forming a pact, they refuse sexual intercourse with their husbands unless the war is brought to an end. However, that is only the beginning of the bag of tricks she has up her sleeve.The play is an absolute riot. I've seen this play performed live and while there were some good moments, I liked the book better. The book has a lot more witty humor and a sense of building frustration that the play lacked. The sexual innuendos are nothing too rash as to be insulting or offensive but rather appropriate, something college students can well appreciate. The \\"love scene\\" between Myrrhine and her husband Kinesias will leave you rolling on the floor. The use of props such as the \\"phalli\\" and towels are brilliant in accompanying the humor. It's funny to read (and picture) how the women \\"man-handle\\" their husbands to try to bring peace to the land. As a college student I've read and studied this book and found many interesting values covered that are appropriate for a Rhetoric or gender studies course. The theme of women suffrage, rising up against the men in a time when women need to be heard, is dominant in the play. Women banding together to fight for a common cause is something I have not read before and was pleasantly surprised of. For a Greek play, the women are portrayed as being very human, rather than being serial killers and jealous lovers and the sort. The women are characterized as being very sleek and sexy, something always to look forward to! The men aren't desensitized either; rather the men are just as human as the women.I recommend this book for any college rhetoric course or even an Interpretation of Literature course. It's the best of both worlds in terms of being very entertaining and having a fair share of educational value."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"\\"The Lysistrata\\" by Aristophanes is probably one of the earliest pieces of litereature demonstrating the free will and power that women inherently posess, but have historically seldom used. In this comedy, the women of Athens, and then throughout Greece, bond together under the common goal of ending the war between the Athenians and Spartans, so that their husbands will return home. Knowing their physical limitations, the women decide on a plan of attack recomended by their leader Lysistrata. She convinces the women that, in order to get their husbands back, they must abstain from the joys of love. Lysistrata insists that everything the women do must be executed with the purpose of arousing their husbands, however, once they have their man's interest they are to act coy.\\"The Lysistrata\\" was written during a time when the Greek city-states where in a constant state of quarrelling. Aristophanes' use of comedy mocks the pointless wars of the time, while trying to focus attention back to the things that should matter most in a man's life. Like Shakespeare, Aristophanes is trying to deliver a political message to as many people as possible; so, to keep the interest of the common man, he has masked his political agenda with a delightful comedy."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"Until now, I had known Lysistrata only by reputation. What can I say - I should have read it myself long since. This play seems to offer everything. It goes beyond just bawdy, but never turns salacious. It's got silly wordplay, but real social commentary. The battle of the sexes is about real battle this time, and Aristophanes fires a few well-aimed shots at both the men and the women. It's a classic of the Western canon, but amusing and readable. Also, for those who dread literature that's \\"good for them,\\" it's short. The script comes in under 100 pages, and they're not dense pages.As I said, this is a modern rendering full of wordplay and chants for the traditional Greek chorus. I'm afraid that the easy, humorous style puts me on edge, though. If a play starts in classical Greek, then ends up in modern English with proper rhyme, scansion, and dialect(!), I know the translator has taken some serious liberties with the libretto. Still I'm torn. Which is more important, academic integrity in creating a version for English readers, or being true to the popular, funny, bawdy tone that Aristophanes intended? I really can't answer that question.It's a great play in a readable translation. There's a good bit of explanatory material, but not the kind that interferes with the flow of the play. I recommend this Lysistrata if you want the fun in the play, but I have reservations about the rigor of the translation.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"I took a class from Parker over ten years ago during my dark days at the University of Texas at Austin. He taught a course in the Classics department called \\"Parageography,\\" which was about the geography of imaginary lands. I think it was an excuse for him to really get into the literature that he loved. It was a fun class, made all the more so because Parker allowed me to do the class project, wherein we created our own imaginary land, in hypertext (this was, obviously before the WWW, and hypertext had not gotten much play--I can't even remember the program I used on the Mac to create it).Parker's claim to fame as a scholar of classics, however, was his modern translations of Aristophanes, including this famous satire on how women could stop war by withholding sex. The translation is good, but still somewhat problematic for today's audiences--many of the assumptions of the story are based on the Greek and Trojan cultures, so a modern reader must check the notes every once and awhile to get the full nuance of the poetry. On the other hand, Parker's goal was to not censor the ribaldry, and so there's plenty here for an audience to realize that, even in 2,000+ years, some things really never change."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"I had to read this book for college and expected a dull dry read, instead i was delighted with the amusing lines and womans life beyond the painting on a vase."},{"Title":"Lysistrata","review":"I thought that this would be a very dry and difficult read.

Think of how the joke wears out so quickly in &quot;101 uses for a dead cat&quot;. Themes often turn into gimmicks and dissipate the cartoons, rather than unify them. Mick Stevens' book really is a list of things that would not improve one's day, with each item accompanied by a cartoon (eg, a picture of toothpaste flying out the window with a caption, &quot;Don't kick the wrong habit&quot;). Despite this repetition of the 'punchline', the book works because of Stevens'ability to place wide-eyed innocents in the path of horrible, though humorous calamity with simple lines that read fast.Funny and surreal and blunt -like the anvils of Road Runner cartoons falling on the Coyote.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Genesis and the dinosaur","review":"Von Fange suggests that humans and dinosaurs lived on the earth at the same time, during a chaotic period between Adam's fall and the great flood. He is a young-earth creationist, so a long pre-human biological and geological history doesn't fit his world view.One intriguing possibility he brings up is that humans and dinosaurs might have lived at the same time without interacting very much -- the large reptiles were limited to certain climates, and humans would have avoided them because of the danger. Thus, human and dinosaur fossils would not likely be found together.Another interesting idea he presents is that the earth was one supercontinent before the flood, and that this was broken up by the catastrophic forces unleashed during the deluge. This breakup continued for some time even after the flood waters had receded and humans had begun to repopulate the earth and spread out.Much of his book is in fact dedicated to debunking evolution. He doesn't present much material that would be new to someone who is well-read in the anti-evolution literature. I thought his chapter on the Neanderthals was particularly interesting, though. He also includes some useful critiques of radiometric dating methods.One positive aspect of the book is that it is mercifully free of fundamentalist soapboxing -- von Fange sticks to his topic fairly well. The book includes a bibliography and a good set of endnotes, so it is a useful pointer to other resources.Genesis and the dinosaur"},{"Title":"Distant Wanderers: The Search for Planets Beyond the Solar System","review":"A very timely book! Five years ago there wasn?t enough progress and news to warrant a book on this intriguing subject. Today this field is teeming with excitement and new discoveries. This book takes you behind the scenes of the serious research that is focused on finding planets beyond the solar system.Bruce Dorminey does an excellent job of setting the stage. For the layman, like me, there are simple explanations of the more technical terms and concepts. These are welcome and wisely placed within the text, making the book highly readable. The professional merely skips over these italicized paragraphs.As he travels the world to visit observatories, scientists and their scientific conferences, Mr Dorminey adds his own observations of the localities, the technical facilities and the personalities behind some of these remarkable discoveries. Amongst others, we follow him to Chile, Hawaii, the south of France and even the Isle of Capri!The final chapters on Signatures of Life and Signals of Life are what this search is all about. Fascinating reading!It is enjoyable and well worth the time to read this well written book on a truly absorbing subject."},{"Title":"Distant Wanderers: The Search for Planets Beyond the Solar System","review":"The search for planets in orbit around stars outside our own Solar Systems is one of the most exciting fields of science today. Since the first indirect detection of a planet circling another Sun-like star was announced in 1995, dozens of extrasolar planets have been discovered.In Distant Wanderers, Bruce Dorminey looks at the history, methods, and future of extrasolar planet hunting. He predicts, \\"Before the end of this new century, every schoolchild will know for certain how many planers circle nearby stars,\\" and whether or not Earth-like planets are a rare anomaly. Like many rapidly developing scientific fields, the search for extra-solar planets has had many controversies and false starts along with the startling new discoveries, and the book presents a variety of theories and viewpoints in a fair and even-handed way.In the first part of the book, Dorminey, an award-winning science journalist and former bureau chief for Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, describes methods that planet hunters have used (spectroscopic methods, astrometric detection, interferometry, microlensing, transit studies, and direct imaging through the use of a coronagraphic mask in the focal plane a camera). Although most of these methods require sophisticated technology and painstaking analysis, he explains each term or concept as it is introduced. He makes the science seem simple enough for lay readers to grasp and explains the strengths and limitations of each method.The rest of the book looks ahead to programs that are planned for the future, including telescopes in space and larger, more sophisticated instruments here on Earth. Some of these programs are already funded and will begin soon. Others are nd ambitious ideas that may not be attempted for years, if they ever happen at all.Dorminey explains current ideas about formation of planets and discusses the search for Earth-like planets and for chemical signatures of extraterrestrial life. Through interviews with numerous researchers and experts, he presents information on what has already been learned about extrasolar planets and gives readers a feeling for the personalities and activities involved in doing this kind of research. In the process of writing Distant Wanderers, Dorminey himself wandered to far-off places, meeting the scientists and visiting the telescopes that are searching for extrasolar planets. His reports on his travels make the book much more human, interesting, and also tell us something about the writer.After a visiting the European South Observatory's Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile's Atacama Desert, Dorminey wrote, \\"After a night on an observatory mountain, E-mails left unanswered and faxes gone missing seem trivial indeed. I knew that a thousand miles south and several thousand miles north, the world was racing hither and yon. But for me, at that moment, my own existence seemed as precarious as the shallow atmosphere separating us from the nothingness beyond. If only for a fleeting minute, it was impossible not to imagine Earth as it really is: an oasis in the midst of a relative void.\\"Perhaps you can't quit your day job to make a grand tour of observatories. If that's the case, buy this book and read it. I learned and enjoyed. So will you."},{"Title":"Distant Wanderers: The Search for Planets Beyond the Solar System","review":"Probably the most exciting aspect of modern astronomy is the recent discovery of planets orbiting other star systems. The techniques for finding them are only a few years old, but already astronomers have uncovered 74 (although, it'll be more when you read this).Distant Wanderers by Bruce Dorminey follows the short history of successful planet hunting, starting with the first bizarre discovery of planets around a distant pulsar and moving on to the more dependable Doppler spectroscopy method. As there isn't a long history, the book quickly catches up to the present, profiling the methods used by today's seekers. The bulk of the book, though, looks to the future of planet hunting; from new techniques to space-based observatories currently in development.Although the technical terminology flies fast and furious, Dorminey takes the time to explain each term when it appears (like Doppler spectroscopy), simply and clearly in a sidebar, to make sure you grasp the concept before going any further.Perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is how Dorminey presents his own journey to uncover the information and meet the researchers. It's mostly a science book, but it also feels a little like a travelogue, and it's that aspect that prevents it from being dry; these are real people, making some of the most exciting discoveries in modern science - it's hard not to get caught up in the adventure.A couple of complaints: the text is pretty small, even with good vision it isn't easy on the eyes; the photography is all black and white, which is a shame considered the beauty of the pictures selected (I know what many of them look like in colour). Finally, the science in this book is totally cutting edge, so I suspect it might feel a little dated in a few years - but that's progress!I definitely recommend Distant Wanderers, though."},{"Title":"Distant Wanderers: The Search for Planets Beyond the Solar System","review":"In February of 1990, JPL operators turned on Voyager I's camera for one last task, the so-called &quot;family portrait&quot; of our solar system. Though it was nearly 3.8 billion miles distant at the time, Voyager's camera was able to image the planet Earth - barely a 5th magnitude speck (Sagan's &quot;pale blue dot&quot;) about a degree away from the -19th magnitude sun.While Voyager's instruments were not designed with the detection of planets around distant stars in mind, that pixel-wide photo of planet Earth gives some appreciation for the difficulty of the task. Imagine trying to detect Earth from our nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri, which is 7000 times more distant than Voyager I was when the family photo was snapped.Bruce Dorminey's excellent new book &quot;Distant Wanderers&quot; does a great job of conveying the exquisite difficulty of extra solar planet hunting. What I had always thought of as a relatively narrow focus for a few astronomers turns out to be an incredibly rich and diverse field. As older technologies are adapted, and new technologies are developed, the field is undergoing an explosive growth phase, characterized by a dizzying array of new discoveries and tantalizing hints of discoveries yet to come.Dorminey spent over two years traveling to conferences, observatories, or any place he could find astronomers. He collected both narratives of their research as well as some personal asides on their motives and desires (though the emphasis is decidedly on the science). The text is written in the spirit of Overbye and Lightman. Distant Wanderers is scientific story telling at its best, as Dorminey introduces us to scientists who are not as well known as Butler and Marcy. The story of French scientist Antione Labeyrie (p. 103) and his attempt to develop instrumentation for the Hubble Space telescope for use in planet hunting is political and scientific irony at its ugliest and best.Instead of a glossary at the end of the book (which I find that I almost never use), Dorminey has peppered the chapters with indented asides containing definitions of major terms in bold print. These are placed in contextually logical places and I found them to be helpful and interesting while reading the text.It would be hard to overstate the rapid pace of change in this field. As I read &quot;Distant Wanderers,&quot; it became clear that the search for extra solar planets has forced astrophysicists and geologists to clarify their definitions of both &quot;star&quot; and &quot;planet,&quot; and Dorminey gives ample room to a discussion of both concepts along the way.Dorminey's book also contains what is perhaps the best description I've ever read of how optical interferometry can measure the diameters of super giant stars, and the efforts being made today to extend the use of optical interferometry to the search for planets around other stars. His ability to take thorny scientific issues and explain them in terms anyone can understand is excellent.Distant Wanderers joins two other excellent books on this topic: Worlds Unnumberedby Donald Goldsmith and Planet Quest by Ken Crosswell, both also well worth reading.Is the field changing so fast that &quot;Distant Wanderers&quot; will quickly be obsolete? Perhaps, but that is the risk taken by any science writer willing to take on a timely topic. If you're looking for a good general work on how the search for extra solar planets works, this book will remain a standard for many years to come."},{"Title":"Distant Wanderers: The Search for Planets Beyond the Solar System","review":"In an age of the human race's thirst for information regarding the unknown, Bruce Dorminey, hits it out of the galaxy. Extrasolar planets are the rave of future astronomers and to receive first hand knowledge from someone who has become close to the scientists involved in the discoveries allows us, the reader, to get a detailed description of the process and history not seen before.

Montel uses oral histories and local folklore to integrate and document actual commmunity and historical sources and events, providing an intriquing story as well as an excellent example of how to incorporate qualitative interviews into both an entertaining and academic text.Montel uses the art of oral history to entertain and educate within a historically accurate framework, showing the often overlooked history of Black Appalachians and their history after the Civil War to the present."},{"Title":"The saga of Coe Ridge;: A study in oral history, (Harper torchbook, TB 1645)","review":"Montell uses oral sources and folklore to reconstruct the history of a small African-American community in Kentucky. The book provides a permanent record of a vanished town, and it is an important foundation for contemporary interest in rural black communities. The book includes interesting discussions of ways to use oral sources when doing historical research, and the author provides useful ways to ascertain the validity and usefulness of these types of resources. His methodology includes ways to assess the historical accuracy of various stories, and the book also demonstrates how to interpret less verifiable stories to gain an understanding of social attitudes and cultural values that emerge in storytelling traditions. This is an especially interesting resource for discovering ways to integrate oral history with folklore study.

It is the first book I know of that methodically uses folklore sources to write history, rather than the usual method of being tied to written documents like a dog on a string.If you are interested in going beyond the book, and of finding out how people in Kentucky actually thought about themselves and the world around them here is a good place to start.This is excellent reading and will show you some interesting possibilities for historical research and writing you may have never thought about before."},{"Title":"The saga of Coe Ridge;: A study in oral history, (Harper torchbook, TB 1645)","review":"The Coe Ridge community of free slaves is one of the little know stories of multi-generation bad-ass heroism.

I have read two other books written by Carlton Stowers, and I am amazed at the empathy he feels towards the victims of violent crime and their families; while not outwardly doing so, his stories are a constant reminder that a homicide leaves many victims other than the dead person.&quot;Careless Whispers&quot; also serves as a reminder that heroes can come in unlikely packages. The hero of this case, if a story as dreadful as this can have a hero, is Waco policeman Truman Simons.After a mere eight weeks, the investigation into these murders was shelved and effectively deemed unsolveable. But they weren't unsolveable, and if not for the dedication and persistence of Truman Simons, this crime would, in all likelihood, STILL be unavenged. Thankfully however, that is not the case.A gripping, frightening and suspenseful book, this is a must read, and the pages within literally shriek &quot;The horror! The horror!&quot; And when you finish it, you'll feel like shrieking this phrase too."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I first read this book at least 10 years ago, if not longer. I was so entranced I couldn't put it down. I've read the book at least a 1/2 dozen times since then. Each time I read it I find something new, a twist, or a turn that I missed the time before, which adds new dimension to the story.Some reviewers see this book as being Biased. Biased at who? The murderers? The men that planned and partook in the slaughter of three innocent children? All of the men who were present at the time of the murders, as well as in the planning of the murders, have confessed during the years since the murders.The officer who spent all his waking time tracking down the killers of these kids should be commended. The author should also be commended. The book does what a good true crime book is supposed to do: it points out all the aspects of the crime are, and who the guilty party(ies) are.This is a must have for any true crime library!"},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"First, let me say that I'm not generally a fan of mysteries, nor do I actively search out stories of violence or crime. I don't even like to read the newspaper. But &quot;Careless Whispers&quot; is haunting. It draws you in and doesn't let go, even after you're done with the book. It's a terrifying story of real people with real feelings and motivations. It's a heartbreaking tale of mistaken identity, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It demonstrates just how vulnerable ordinary people really are.Carlton Stowers has a gift for story-telling. He candidly writes about his subject with an entertaining flair. If you can find this book, read it."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"As usual, Stowers writing style makes the pages in this book fly. Stowers, who has written multiple books on this subject, clearly thorougly researched this book. The cast of characterters is quite detailed. In fact, the specific details in this book may be even better than some of his others.However, I prefered his other book, Open Secrets over this one. The one thing that I did not like about Careless Whispers were there were some twists that didn't go anywhere. While that may have been the intent of the author (to show the frustration of the police), it made reading parts of the book dull.Nonetheless, the detailed description of the crime scene and autopsy are very impressive. Definitely a bit gruesome, but very compelling. The realism of the story is (as usual) enhanced by the pictures of the people affected by this crime."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Stowers does a great job of researching his books - background of his characters, attitudes and events that lead up to the crime, deep feelings of emotion and committments of the law enforcement personnel. In this one, you can just feel the pain of the Sheriff as he vows to bring the killer (s) to justice. Stowers pulls the reader into the deep, dark world of crime, drugs, alcohol, hatred and abuse = it's hard to put the book down.

He is a great author and I get into his books. What happened to these three young people was tragic, and Mr. Stowers captured the pain of family members as well as the frustrations that Truman Simons felt by being sabotaged by the Waco Police Department. I came away angry at them for their petty behavior and cruel deception, and total lack of respect for the survivors by not putting forth their best efforts to resolve this crime.

In the park, the teenagers met with their brutal, untimely death at the hands of David Spence and his friends.Truman Simons, a veteran police office, took the case personally and worked dilligently to obtain the proof needed to convict the three men who murdered these innocent teens.The twists and turns of this book make it hard to put down. From the intial investigation to the prosecution of Jordanian born Muneer Deeb for his role in the deaths of the teens (and, yes, I do believe he was guilty but walked on techinicality), the book is full of details as you walk side by side with investigators as they seek justice.The only disappointing aspect of this book is that little information was available regarding the third victim Raylene Rice. However, the author makes note that her family essentially decided to deal with the death of Raylene by distancing themselves from the other victims' families, investigators and prosecutors. At one point, Stowers even writes that Raylene, because of her families actions, almost became somewhat of an afterthought to the public.This is an excellent book.

Stowers' descriptions of the lives of these kids, their friends and families are hard to read sometimes. Stowers has made me really feel for them and what they endured. Particularly difficult is reading about the murder sites, Koehne Park where I used to eat lunch and take pictures of Lake Waco; Speegleville Park, where I used to watch the moon rise over the lake; places I frequented during my own high school years. Stowers is a great writer. This is a great account of a horrifying and very real tragedy. It has had, so far, a very marked effect on me and the memories of my high school years.

But a little over ten years earlier, a brutal triple murder stunned the community. While at times long-winded and repetitive, Carlton Stowers does a commendable job recounting the facts. Better editing would have circumvented these problems. On the other hand, getting the book's title from a song by the group Wham! seems to cheapen the product.Some reviewers have noted disagreements with the trials/convictions in this case. Stowers only goes through the facts as they occurred. Stowers did not make the courts' decisions. As other reviews have noted, the author engages in hero worship directed toward lead detective Truman Simons. As long as you do not have a reason to diagree with the verdict, you will not find this objectionable. Few objections to the book exist beyond these.David Spence was a disturbed individual based on the evidence portrayed in the book. Though the conviction was overturned, Muneer Deeb solicited Spence's services in the murder, as Deeb felt himself to be a scorned lover. Stowers follows each of the trials, which slows the pace of the book. While pace is sacrificed, the work is thorough.Stowers is also humble in his interactions with the families of the victims. One never gets the sense that he is exploiting their tragedy. Even going into graphic details, readers will see him as an objective storyteller."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I remember reading this book about the hideous nature of the crime involving the three teens who went out for a night of fun but didn't expect to be brutally murdered and raped on their last night of earth.

The triple homicide in a secluded section of the woods in Texas where two girls and a young man lost their lives. I remember reading this book and angry about the horrific murders of such young people. Of course, the book does unfold like a murder mystery. It begins at the beginning of the case and unfolds gradually. I was it was fiction but sadly it is not because it's all true.

The only part of this story that is not covered in deep detail in this book is the events leading up to and then the great fear and threats that several kids in the childrens home had to endure knowing our friends evil murderers were less than a block away from us. One of the murderers girlfriends threatened that if I talked to anyone that I would be next. Carlton Stowers came to the childrens home to talk to us (before the murderers were caught)I came down and briefly said hello and shook his hand but was too terrified to speak. It wasn't long after that, the same girl came into my bathroom and dropped a blowdryer into my bathtub electricuting me until my roommate came in and jerked the plug.If it were not for Truman Simons unyeilding determination, I am sure that there would have been more deaths and I would have been one of them. David Spence was Very Guilty..."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"but just abit too long. I am a fan of true crime and I must say this book was very interesting. However, I feel the Author must have a supersition with the word &quot;several&quot;. He uses the word &quot;several&quot; constantly throughout the book, that I found myself laughing everytime I came upon the word. It sometimes got in the way of concentrating on the story...&quot;several&quot;: days, books, bills, beers, inmates, minutes, seconds, hours, people...etc. You name it, it was &quot;several&quot; but all that aside, the book was interesting."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"The book is far longer than it needs to be, yet still manages to be unsatisfying, leaving obvious questions unanswered or unaddressed. The account seems to be have been informed primarily by one investigator for which the author's obvious admiration undermines his credibility as an objective chronicler. I found the organization to be annoying in the way it jumps back and forth in time. Some of the choices, such as detailing a woman's supposedly psychic vision of the crime too early in the narrative, seem to have been made only to entice the reader to keep churning through long stretches of repetitive and unnecessary text. I wondered if this was the work of the author or an editor. Nevertheless, there is some compelling reading here, especially the accounts of the effects of a brutal, unexpected crime on the families of the victims. Once again, I was also left wondering how any crimes manage to get solved by our undertrained, unprofessional police forces."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I feel that this is a dishonest book, perhaps not intentionally, but nonetheless dishonest. Although the work was originally published before much of the controversy and questions surfaced about the case made against the two men who went to trial, the book taken alone relies too heavily on the information from and the perspective of the author's adopted hero, a single investigator, alone in his conviction of guilt, despite lacking any concrete evidence. Odd omissions mark the book, such as any discussion of physical evidence, most of which did not fit the investigator's theory of the crime, and mention of the privileges he granted the inmates whose testimony constituted almost the entire case of the state. Instead, the book is chock full of snatches of statements from other characters in the drama that could never be admitted in a court, but which are intended to cement the guilt of the accused, along with corrobation from two women who claimed to have had &quot;visions&quot; of the crime. Most of the evidence presented appears to have been recounted to the author by his chief protagonists and cherry-picked to support the guilt of the suspects. In a recent postscript, the author dismisses the questions raised since he published his book without bothering to address them, suggesting in briefly recounting an encounter he had with a network news producer that any doubts are put to rest by his book. I wondered if he had actually read his own book. There's no rule that a work of non-fiction has to present a balanced or thorough view, but anyone reading this book should be aware that it's far from the entire story that it claims to be."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I only have two problems with this book. One, I felt it could have been boiled down. It was too long. The other is that there isn't much about the life of victim Raylene Rice. In my opinion, Spence was guilty as hell."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Overall, I thought this book was well researched and written; however, I found the author to be very biased. Granted it was written from the perspective of Officer Simons and the prosecuting attorneys, but the cheap shots that Carlton Stowers takes at anyone and everyone-from the opposing attorneys, detectives, to family members-was uncalled for. In my opinion, Stowers let his own emotion and friendship with those involved in this investigation and prosecuiton get into the way of his story. Also, there is always certain information privy to writers that for one reason or another that never needs to be included in a story. As an example here, what purpose did it serve to add the part about the jury pool and when the defense attorney would wash his hair?? There were several incidents like these directed at family members, witnesses, police officers, and defense attorneys that were unnecessary. These comments added nothing significant to the story and served only to embarrass and antagonize those on the opposite side. In addition, I also found the book very sensationalized. It is hard for me to believe Simons is an all God-fearing man, as continually demonstrated by his actions and behavior-&quot;You shall know them by their fruits-&quot; Yet, in the last chapter of the book Stowers has him falling on his knees, caught up in some kind of spiritual rapture. Given Simon's crude nature and the fact he had to ask his mother where to find salvation scriptures, it was a little hard for me to stomach this out of body spiritual transfiguration. Not that some of it didn't happen, I believe he was there and probably bowed his head and offered a simple prayer, but certainly not to the extreme as it was written. This incident is so unbelievable, it discredits every thing Stowers had written prior to that moment. I guess all this is a matter of taste for some people, but why ruin a good book when it's not necessary? In police jargon, it's known as &quot;overkill.&quot;"},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I found this book generally interminable and sometimes incomprehensible, with poor pacing and organization, and its hero-worship of the detective became downright annoying.

My advice is to avoid it, particularly since even the factual basis for the book is questionable at this stage."},{"Title":"Careless Whispers (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Just a reminder when reading this story that the author is a friend of the prosecutor.

It was the right size (not too thick, not too sparse), was very informative, and had great maps. I even liked the recommended routes (since Tunisia is small, it's very possible to \\"do\\" the whole country in a month), if one can \\"do\\" a country at all without living there.Two recommendations I had for them. The first is that I did miss the recommended itineraries if you have 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, etc. It would have helped.The second and more important issue I had was with the authors. Yes, they had a token female author but she reviewed the more women-friendly places such as Sidi Bou Said. The amount of harassment we received wasn't surprising, as I didn't solely rely on Lonely Planet and read up on those issues; but it really wore us down over the three weeks (I was traveling with a female friend and we are both attractive women in our 20s and 30s.)My friend and I found ourselves in hysterics when the male authorrecommended that we sit down with men in a cafe and talk to them about their lives. Yeah right!! I come from Turkey, so I am in no way ignorant about Muslim tradition (although North African culture is obviously different than Turkish), but nearly every single man we talked to hit on us.That's ok, that's life. But I was infuriated to read that covering our heads would invite ridicule, because finally, in our last week, I started covering my head in Jerba and I felt an IMMEDIATELY positive difference. Yes, if I had been a tall blonde perhaps the reception wouldn't have been the same, but is Lonely Planet only geared towards men and tall blonde women? What about Mediterranean types like myself who can easily pass as native Tunisians? I wish I had known beforehand and would have covered up the whole time (by the way, we dressed EXTREMELY modestly and after seeing how some tourist women acted in Tunisia, we are definitely sympathetic to the stereotypes the men have there towards women like us).Tunisia is a great place to visit and I still have to admit that this is a good guide but ladies, read up on your own. Or should I write my own guide for women? :)"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tunisia","review":"It's light and compact and has some useful maps. We used the hotel suggestions but in most cases the ratings were off, if it says 3 stars assume 1.5-2 stars. Take ear plugs. Almost all of the hotels were in noisy areas. Many of the suggested eating places were also off the mark. Extensive menus would be met with three or four options available. The guides to sights and towns to visit were very good. We used the walking tours and maps to navigate through the country quite comfortably. Assume you'll be ripped off by every taxi driver and you'll be ok. It's still very inexpensive to travel in Tunisia. And this book is very handy to have along for the ride."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Tunisia","review":"This is one of the few guide books I have read and not had to buy others for the same country by other authors/publishers.

Myers serves up, in this reading of the earliest gospel, a much-needed focus of radical discipleship -- i.e., Jesus as exemplar of nonviolent resistance to the powers-that-be in his day, and ergo in ours. Myers wrote this groundbreaking work not in the effete ivory tower of liberal intellectualism, but while living in seven intentional faith communities over the course of several years ... and yet, it's a remarkable piece of scholarship. Finally: a serious application of the socio-literary approach to a book of scripture, by an author who beckons us not to worship and adore a tall-steeple bourgeois Jesus, but to follow the itinerant rabbi he really was!"},{"Title":"Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus","review":"Excellent book - ideas for all who want to understand the Bible from the point of view of Liberation Theology - a gospel for the poor and oppressed.

Every christian pastor and teacher should read it and it will revitalise their vision of what is the Lord's work."},{"Title":"Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus","review":"This is one of the three books I wish I had read during seminary; but I have decided that in God's infinite wisdom, I was not introduced to it then because I didn't have the background to appreciate it until now.Myers finds too much Christian Bible study focused on private anguish and heaven - while our \\"world hangs in the balance on an imperial cross of violence and oppression.\\" (14) In addition to his goal of forging a new methodological approach to the Gospels, Myers says his second goal was to \\"challenge traditional spiritualized or dogmatic readings of the Gospel in our First World churches, in order to promote discipleship as the core of Christian faith rather than either decisionism (the tendency of evangelicalism) or denominationalism (the tendency of liberalism). This he does in spades!His analysis looks at historical and sociological backgrounds, semantic fields, the ideology of Mark's form, narrative strategy of apocalyptic, the effect of narrative sites, and Mark's wonderful use of intertextual allusions to the LXX, among many other considerations.The book is dense, but delightful, and parses the Gospel in great detail. I could read only about 10 pages at a time, but it was well worth it. His socio-political analysis turns many traditional interpretations of Gospel passages on their (deaf) ears. Having read this book, I will never read any of the gospels the same way again."},{"Title":"Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus","review":"Binding the Strong Man has become an essential text for people of faith who are asking important questions about how the Bible relates to our own age. This is a challenging read but well worth it. Ched Myers' public teachings are wonderfully engaging and challenging as well. Also look for his articles in Sojourners Magazine on biblical stewardship/Sabbath economics."},{"Title":"Binding the Strong Man: A Political Reading of Mark's Story of Jesus","review":"Binding the Strongman is a review of the Gospel of Mark from a socio-literary approach. I am not a trained theologian and got through the book with some difficulties. My second time reading the book made understanding the concepts and teaching easier to understand. Most of Myers work is very good and insightful. Every so often, Myers interpretations of Jesus teaching lacks foundation in the other gospels; however, the vast majority of work seems accurate and thought provoking. A wonderful work in getting to the heart of what Jesus is teaching in Mark. This book is for people with a good overall understanding of the new and old testament and a strong reading ability. The insight that Ched Myers bring to Mark's Gospel will make you think about the role of women in the church, Money in God's kingdom, and Jewish temple practices. This book should be read by all Christians to get a better understanding of what Jesus was truly teaching in the new testament.

The narrative is jumpy, hard to follow and often left me wondering what the author was trying to imply. This story would not even make a good parody of a romance novel.

Ever since my college days when the meanings of modernism and post-modernism seemed to control my brain, I've wondered how one defines \\"artist.\\" Is it Duchamp and his urinal? Or is it Ghiberti and his Doors of Paradise? Art Lessons helped me greatly in understanding where an individual stands in the realm of art. Haynes examines her own place as an artist while incorporating her spirituality into her considerations. Her personal approach is just lovely-you feel like you're having a conversation with a friend. Many books I read on art seem distant or too high-brow, but Haynes' banter allows you to really feel at home discussing the subject of art in great depth. All her philosophizing does not give you her own definition of \\"artist;\\" she never forces any opinion on her reader. But her considerations lead the reader to a thought-provoked answer that lies within the SELF. I titled the review \\"Excellent Compass\\" for that reason-it's a guide to take you to your own artistic destination. They are right when they say, \\"Art Lessons is for women of the twenty-first century what Robert Henri's Art Spirit was for men of the twentieth.\\""},{"Title":"The Twenty-Fourth of June: Midsummer's Day","review":"I love to read period books.

Though often scorned by literary snobs, the entire Dover series does fulfill one very useful function: it provides cheap, easy-to-read, and widely-available versions of literary classics. What you get, in this case, are all of Shakespeare's sonnets (undisputably some of the greatest poems ever written and a true treasure of English literature; obviously, a review of any edition of these poems will inevitably focus not upon the work itself, which is beyond repute, but, rather, on the individual edition as presented) -- and nothing else. Much more expansive (and expensive) versions are available, featuring an introduction to the sonnets with background information, notes and annotations, a handy list of definitions for archaic and obscure Elizabethian words -- and, more than likely, at least one pretentious individual interpretation of the work. Obviously, if one is looking to study Shakespeare, really go in-depth into the sonnets for scholarly or academic purposes, then one should look into one of the editions just described. If you just want a copy of the sonnets without desiring to spend too much money, you don't need or don't want all of those extras, or you simply want to impress incredulous people by owning a set of Shakespeare's sonnets, however, then you could do worse than picking up this inexpensive little book."},{"Title":"Complete Sonnets","review":"A colleague advised that I assign my college students this edition, and I am glad she did. Rather than reading the few anthologized works together with some handouts, students now own the entire set. For anyone not familiar with Shakespeare's 154 sonnets, this gives an affordable and portable version. For anyone familiar with the works, this book offers them in a beautifully light, compressed format that itself enhances rereading and re-interpretation. The book begins with a helpful one-page background on the sonnet form and on Shakespeare's collection, and ends with an also-helpful alphabetical list of first lines. The two-page glossary of terms at the end may be too little, too late, but the drawbacks of Dover's edition--its lack of notes and its use of roman numerals to number the poems--pale compared with the book's availability. As an enthusiast myself--someone who studied at the Shakespeare Institute, England, writing a 310-page thesis on the Bard--I feel grateful to be able to help others to such an inexpensive and pleasant way to own and explore Shakespeare's entire collection of sonnets. Because I could skim the poems in sequence so quickly and easily with this edition, the interrelationships among Sonnets 113, 114, 115, and the famous 116, &quot;Let me not to the marriage of true minds,&quot; for example, struck me in a new way as I reread them in this little book. A highly- recommended edition."},{"Title":"Complete Sonnets","review":"My English major friends kept raving about the sonnets, so I finally decided to spend a buck to get this least expensive edition. It was kind of interesting. I could tell that Shakespeare was really intense about his issues - but I was lost as to why everybody was so crazy about them. I also did not like having paper that was so thin that my highlighting and notes went right through to ruin the other side of the page :(Finally I spent another buck to get an (almost as inexpensive) edition (used) - the Signet edition edited by Burto. That helped a lot - with definitions of terms and hints about lots of secret relationships possibly there for those who would dig further. At last I'm starting to figure out why this guy is considered so awesome. To really get an appreciation of Shake's heart and mind, beginners like me really need more than just the poems.Now I'm borrowing an English major's copy of Dr. Vendler's edition (Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets). It's pretty heady, so I'm just trying to read her introduction. Whew! I haven't tested out all her theories, but is so much incredible care and complexity going on behind the scenes in these poems - it's no wonder people are still boggled after 400 years.Truly amazing - but unless you're an English major I wouldn't recommend bothering with this doubtful dollar deed.

When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Complete Sonnets","review":"I bought this for my high school freshman and I have enjoyed reading these again also.

But the author of this book--a white man with three ancestors who fought for the Union and one who fought for the Confederacy-- notes that the official figures show that 178,975 blacks were enrolled in the Union Army, and about 21% of them, 36,847, died of all causes. The overall percentage of deaths over enlistments in the Civil War was only 10.4%, he says.This is only the beginning of the black role in the Civil War. Over 200,000 blacks fled slavery to join the Union Army; some were accepted as soldiers and others were not, but those who were not often did very useful work at the garrisons in a support capacity. And some blacks fought for state militias on the Confederate side; while the North had many black regiments, the South had none.The author makes clear that the mission of the war to end slavery--he likes to think of it as the War of Black Independence--only became clear over time. At the start of the war, the enlistment of free blacks into the Confederate Army peaked and the enlistment of blacks into the Union Army stalled. He documents numerous attempts by blacks to form regiments that were ignored; at one point New York free blacks even offered to pay the entire cost of a black regiment themselves in order to entice the federal government to accept one.The reluctance to accept blacks as soldiers was caused by both prejudiced doubts that they could fight and political desires not to inflame the Confederates or to lose the loyalty of the pro-slavery boarder states of Maryland, Kentucky, and Tennessee which stayed on as part of the Union. It was originally hoped that it would be a short war after which everything could return to normal.But the intensity of Southern resistance soon became clear. General David Hunter, stationed at Port Royal in Charleston, South Carolina, immediately began to enroll fugitive slaves upon replacing General Sherman there on March 31, 1861 for what became known as the 1st South Carolina Colored Infantry. Hunter's approach was to inform Washington of what he was doing and assume he had permission to continue unless he was ordered to stop.On May 8, 1862 Hunter even issued his own early version of the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Lincoln, fearful of the reactions from the boarder states, made him rescind his proclamation. Hunter on May 9,1862 began to round up able-bodied blackss from plantations and urge them to join the Union army. He would then return those who declined to their plantations. This was going to far for all but the Radical Republicans in Congress, and on August 10, 1862 he was forced to disband his regiment.But others who were used less controversial methods to recruit black troops kept doing so. A few days before Butler was forced to disband his regiment, General Ben Butler, in command of captured areas around New Orleans, wired Secretary of War Stanton on August 5, 1862: \\"I shall call on Africa to intervene, and I do not think I shall call in vain.\\"By August 22,1862 Butler had issued a general order authorizing the enlistment of blacks, offering a bounty and generous pay. The hiring practices of his regiment was an early example of what is now known as \\"Don't ask, don't tell;\\" he got around orders requiring him to only enroll free blacks by simply not checking on who was free and who was not, and the author concludes that \\"most of the regiment was probably made up of runaway slaves.\\"On the same day that Butler wired Scretary Stanton, a wire was sent to Stanton by General James Lane, in the Kansas-Missouri theatre, who also sought to recruit black troops. After the first battle in which his black troops had fought, Lane was enthusiastic in his praise. \\"It is useless to talk any more about Negro courage, \\" he said. \\"The men fought like tigers, each and every one of them, and the main difficulty was to hold them well in hand. Saddle and mount is the word. These are boys to clean out the bushwackers.\\"Lane's troops functioned without authorization until January 13, 1863, when they became the 1st Kansas Colored Regiment. Lane also symbolizes the gradual transition of the Democratic Party from the party of slavery to the party of civil rights. \\"As an old Democrat, I felt a little repugnance at having anything to do with Negroes, but having got fairly over that, am in the work. They are just as good tools to crush the rebellion with as any that can be got.\\" Other Democratic generals in the Union Army would soon be echoing these sentiments.The author focuses intensely on the formation of the early Negro regiments, and then starts listing subsequent ones in groups. He notes the reluctance of their commanders--all of whom were white--to order them into battle, but describes the military pressures that overcame such reluctance.The author also notes that some blacks won admission to state regiments on their own iniitiative: 65 year old Nicholas Biddle, a runaway slave long a resident of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, attached himself to the Washington Artillerists, and is considered by some to have been the first Union soldier to have been wounded in the Civil War \\"while marching through Baltimore with the first volunteers from Schuylkill County, 18 April 1861.\\"The author details at length the resistance blacks faced in the Union Army. A black surgeon from Canada, given command over 8 white surgeons, was ulitmately forced to resign despite excellent performance because his subordinates felt demeaned at working under a black man. Even within battles, there was reluctance to have black soldiers be the first to attack.But the author notes that black soldiers were the most zealous, perhaps because they felt they had the biggest stake in the conflict. They took risks that white soldiers were reluctant to take, and they sometimes kept fighting rather than surrender even when battles had been lost. The author details Southern attempts to send captured black soldiers into slavery; Congress retaliated by threatening other actions against Southern captured soldiers, and this threat seems to have ended that Southern threat.The black regiments consistently won plaudits from their supervisors and observers, even when they lost battles, the author finds. And the author notes that in the last year of the war, when the Union Army losses had piled up, black soldiers played an important role in Union victories.Without discussing issues broader than the Civil War, the author sheds light on the disturbing historical paradox that so many backers of the Union became apathetic or actively hostile to the idea of full black participation in American life. The author documents the prejudice that advocates of black participation in the armed forces--white and black alike--had to overcome, and the step by step and sometimes guerilla tactics that had to be used to get black soldiers into uniform and into battle.The author even notes that Congress tried to iniitally pay black soldiers $10 a day while white soliders were being paid $13 a day, and pay at least one black doctor at the soldier's rate. Massachusetts black soldiers rejected the lesser salaries, and even rejected an attempt by the Massachusetts legislature to pay the difference. Their protest eventually led to Congress agreeing to pay the same salaries to black soldiers as to white soldiers. And the black doctor who got paid at the soldier's rate eventually got four years of back pay at the surgeons rate.The author has a keen sense of military detail, and devotees of military history will enjoy this book. Future historians should also use this book--culled largely from secondary sources listed in the back of the book--as a source of ideas for further research. This book is highly relevant to the history of American civil rights as well as the history of the Civil War. It answers the question of why Martin Luther King was so insistent on \\"Freedom NOW,\\" why black history adds needed context to what has been traditionally considered American history, and how the armed forces got enmeshed in the tradition of separate units for blacks--a practiced not changed until the Truman Administration.This is an excellent book well worth reading by black and white alike, by those who care about military history and those who care about social history, by those interested in the Civil War and those interested in military history in general. It should lead readers to both seek greater historical recognition of black troops in the Civil War, and to seek greater understanding of the evolution of the role of blacks in American society."},{"Title":"How to Grow Marijuana Indoors for Medicinal Use","review":"I found that this book does a better job explaining how to grow than most books, but i still found that i had some questions at the end.

Salvatore's Forgotten Realms novels published from 1998 to 2001. The principle storyline for this series is the return of Wulfgar from imprisonment by the demon Erttu, and his stuggle to come to grips with his new life. Three of the books included in this one make up the final part of the 'Legend of Drizzt'. One book, Servant of the Shard, seems to have been included in this volume only because of publication order. It is actually the first book of the separate 'Sellswords' trilogy and doesn't really have anything to do with Drizzt and Co.InThe Silent Blade (Forgotten Realms: Paths of Darkness, Book 1), a fresh new adventure for the Companions of the Hall is began. As Drizzt and Co. head out to Spirit Soaring to have Cadderly destroy the (same old) Crystal Shard, monsters hound them at every turn. Wulfgar struggles with inner demons until he finds a place as a bouncer for a rough tavern in Luskan, where he has a great time bashing heads and drinking booze. Artemis Entreri travels back to his roots in Calimport to begin reestablishing his name and fortune. Jarlaxle has ventured out of Menzoberanzan in the search for power and wealth and coaxes Entreri to join his plans. Character development is the primary thing that stands out in this book. Wulfgar, Entreri, and Jarlaxle especially grow as characters. [4-star rating].The Spine of the World (Forgotten Realms: Paths of Darkness, Book 2)is completely devoted to the continuing struggle of Wulfgar, who cannot seem to overcome his inner demons and allows himself to fall into a rather shameful existence. The story consists of two separate plot-lines that briefly come together near the end of the book. Wulfgar and Morik (who develops nicely here) fight, are framed, get beat, leave Luskan, fight, are framed, get beat, and so on. The other story was actually the more intriguing to me. It involves characters that we've never met before and their emotional wrangling. A hi-bred lord courts a lowly peasant (Meralda), who goes along with it for her family's sake but makes a big mistake in getting knocked up by another man. The two stories come together in an unpredictable way that results in a hugely surprising and satisfying ending. [3-star rating]The third book in the Paths of Darkness,Servant of the Shard (Forgotten Realms: Paths of Darkness, Book 3), probably shouldn't have been included in this collection. It is really somewhat of a duplicate book, released two different times with different looking covers, the second time as book one of The Sellswords. It is also one of the most enjoyable Salvatore books to date. The Sellswords series follows the adventures of Artemis Enreri and Jarlaxle. This perfect couple is extremely well-developed and are fun to read about. In book 1, the Crystal Shard occupies center stage as the story began in The Silent Blade is continued. The annoyingly pious Cadderly plays a part in the latter parts of the book, but doesn't do too much harm to the story. Excellent fighting scenes and plenty of action make for a fun and exciting read. [5-star rating].InSea of Swords (Forgotten Realms: Paths of Darkness), the story of Wulfgar is rejoined for the final book of the Legend of Drizzt. As the Companions of the Hall set out to retrieve Aegis-Fang from the pirate Sheila Kree, it seems nothing could stand in their way. Wulfgar finally comes to terms with his new place in life, and is reunited with his old friends before the final battle. A mysterious elf from Drizzt's past has plotted to slay Drizzt for years and the two meet in an epic clash. Overall, this was a bit disappointing for a Drizzt novel, particularly because of its being the last in the series. [3-star rating].Overall, these books really start to lose interest as the reader becomes inundated with Drizzt and his friends. The heroes (except Wulfgar ironically) become practically invincible and the stories become predictable. I'm just glad that I'm finally through the Legend of Drizzt (although I probably will read The Hunter's Blades trilogy)."},{"Title":"Paths of Darkness Collectors Edition Signed","review":"The Paths of Darkness Collectors' Edition is a very good deal to all avid readers who want to have all the enchilada in one. I for one, waited for this collected edition before I read it rather than read the individual books as they got released.While it is nice reading, and it did deliver to the standards as R.A. Salvatore can give, it must not be compared to its predecesors, The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale Trilogies, or suffer a less than generous review.It has the usual elements in Salvatore's previous books: the detailed action sequences, the way the villains are introduced (usually at the epilogues or the first chapters), and the believably slow and gradual development of each characters and how they relate to each other. Its selling point is probably the reintroduction of Drizzt's archenemy, Entreri, with a twist. And a focus on the Drow mercenary chief, Jarlaxle, seems to give promise to the excitement of this epic.As a whole, this book is recommended for those who vigilantly follow Drizzt Do'Urden's adventures. But to those who haven't read the Previous Trilogies and the Legacy of the Drow series, I suggest you read those first to fully appreciate this book. While it did not give the same level of excitement the previous books gave, it's still good reading for another piece of Drizzt, our friendly neighborhood drow."},{"Title":"Paths of Darkness Collectors Edition Signed","review":"This collection continues the excellent tradition of Dnd based Fantasy writing established by R.A.

Fortunately this is done in italics so you know when to skip on in the book.All in all, this is a very good read, very entertaining, and well worth the money.OVERALL SCORE: (A-)READABILITY: (A-), PLOT: (B-), CHARATERS: (B-), DIALOGUE: (B+), SETTING: (A+), ACTION/COMBAT: (A-), MONSTERS/ANTAGONISTS: (B+), ROMANCE: (C-), SEX: (n/a), AGE LEVEL: (PG)"},{"Title":"Paths of Darkness Collectors Edition Signed","review":"First and foremost, there are four books in the series and unless you have an idea what these books are, like this particular genre, like what they deal with or play D&D; then you probably should start at the beginning. It made several references to the old books and although it didn't annoy me since I read them, another reader might not like it. For the most part, this storyline speaks mostly about Wulfgar, his life and redemption after he returned from Errtu's grasp.In any case, the four books are listed and summarized below:The Silent BladeThe Spine of the WorldSea of SwordsServant of the ShardThe first one dealt with Drizzt and an old grudge a thief named Artemis had with him. The thief was apparently an assassin for Pasha Pook who was the Guildmaster Regis stole his magical gem from. The book was great and although there was some mature content, it wasn't anything near what a teenager sees online at a porn site or on the movie 300 in terms of explicitness of gore. Besides, I believe if you can read then you're entitled to some juicy bits of writing. If you're a DM much like me and play D&D; then this might give you an idea or two or a theme. It could even give you several comical or devious characters and scenarios to copy into your own campaign.The Spine of the World was great. At first it threw me off by introducing the story of some prissy Lord of a no-name town in the backwaters of Faerun but as the book progressed, the author meshed the two distinct storylines together into an intricate web which of course featured Wulfgar. This book is primarily about Wulfgar and his redemption. A daring rescue and a few lies later and Wulfgar found his life changed. I don't want to ruin the book or the ending but it's a strong read in my opinion! There was more drama and storyline than action in this book. There weren't many battles and the few that were in the book were obviously one-sided. There were some good plots there if you are a DM and I strongly encourage you read about how shoddy the fiefdom of Auckney really is. At times DM's make small hamlets too powerful and often their best fighter can take out the heroes in one or two hits. A perfect example is the gnome fighter who claims to be the best fighter in all of Auckney.The next book is off to a promising read with a couple of guys tracking down Drizzt and they are enlisting magical aid. Apparently from what I gathered in the first few pages I've read Bruenor is going to look for Wulfgar's hammer and the King of Mithral Hall is dying of old age. There is much to read as I am only a few pages shy of the fourth chapter. All his books thus far from the previous series have done his name and his claim justice. Read them all if you wish, but be forewarned, make sure you've got nothing to do as time will fly by!"},{"Title":"Paths of Darkness Collectors Edition Signed","review":"Like his other novels, Paths of Darkness was a wonderful read. I have enjoyed each and every Colectors Edition with the exception of the Cleric Canticles and that is only because i dont care for clerics. I am about 700 pages into it and cant put it down so if you are a fan of dark elves, assassins, monsters, magic and intrigue then this book is for you. One more thing about the Cleric Canticles: i didnt hate it because the story was bad. I just hate clerics and always have. So if you are a fan of clerics then you will be pleased. I can only take so much clerics in a story."},{"Title":"Two Pairs of Shoes","review":"This is a wonderful young children's picture book about a young &quot;First Nations&quot; girl who receives two special gifts for her birthday. Maggie receives a pair of black, paten leather shoes from her mother. It is exactly what she wanted for her birthday. In her excitement, she runs to her Kokom's (a Cree word for grandma) to show off her special birthday present. Her Kokom agrees that the black lather shoes are beautiful. Under her grandmother's bed is another special gift for her. It is a lovely pair of beaded moccasins. This is a very precious gift because Kokom is blind and the moccasins are hand made by her. Maggie was torn by receiving two pairs of shoes for her birthday. Which pair should she wear? She loves both the black leather shoes and the beaded moccasins. Her Kokom's advice is &quot;today is a special day for you, for you have been given two pairs of shoes. From now on you must remember when and how to wear each pair.&quot; I feel sometimes for bicultural children, they too have two very distinctive pairs of shoes to wear.This is a great book for anyone who experiences two cultures - especially with two different ethnic backgrounds.The glossary at the back of the book is very useful. Very young children will enjoy the colourful illustrations by Native artist David Beyer. His drawings capture the delight and tenderness of the relationship between Kokom and Maggie."},{"Title":"An Unfortunate Prairie Occurrence","review":"I live in England and have no idea how I first came across this book apart from the fact I bought it from Amazon! But am I so glad that I took the plunge and ordered it. I have not enjoyed a mystery novel as much as this one in a very long time. The plot twists and turns with as many potential murderers as stars in the sky. Combine this with a wonderfully laconic sheriff, Jules Clement, great scenery, a large dose of romantic tension plus a lot of wit, sarcasm and humour, and you have one of the best crime novels you will have read in a while. I could not recommend it enough and am going to spread the word about Jamie Harrison to all my friends."},{"Title":"An Unfortunate Prairie Occurrence","review":"This is outstanding writing, not merely an outstanding mystery, and is, in my opinion, the best novel of the year. The plot - and that word does not convey the depth of this story - would be marvelous by itself, but Harrison adds almost a dozen characters that stick in your mind and then melds them into a literary event. The writing's top-quality and there's not a hint of a wrong turn in this masterful performance. We all know her Dad's the better writer... uh, don't we? Don't we?"},{"Title":"An Unfortunate Prairie Occurrence","review":"The characters are all believable, the writing is literate and witty, and the growing sense of evil makes this book well worth reading. Ms. Harrison gives a clear sense of place (Southwestern Montana) that never detracts from the book's pace or plot. She handles the large cast of characters and their complicated relationships so deftly that I almost never had to remember who was related to whom. A real pleasure."},{"Title":"An Unfortunate Prairie Occurrence","review":"the plot is a great framework for a multi faceted writer. The enviorment and the main star both have hidden layers that interigue while ultimatly fulling their promises. The writer has a true grasp od the basic thoughtfulness a man must bring to his work and the complex issues of the individual and his relationships with his singular and multiple partnerships in life. The setting is a metaphor for growth without planning and a sign of hope for the future."},{"Title":"An Unfortunate Prairie Occurrence","review":"Hard to put down and so compex that there are no places in the book to just skim."},{"Title":"Maroon","review":"Delightful, evocative, sad, challenging!

Her poems are as much about sacrifice and namelessness as they are about love. The book is divided into four sections and in Section One she examines the uncertainty of Haitian life. In Section Two she describes life in America and Section Three is dedicated to familial loves with several poems about her father. The last section, perhaps the most exuberant, plunges us into the lush countryside of Haiti with its intense descriptions of the landscape and her love for her embattled country"},{"Title":"Discord in Harmony","review":"The Central Coast of California has long been a favorite vacation spot for my family. The sign, \\"HARMONY Population 18,\\" would always draw a smile as we wound our way up Highway 1. Recently, we stopped and visited the quaint artist town. As I walked down the street I could not help but wonder what this town was like years ago when perhaps it was a bustling community.Alicia Copeland has marvelously crafted just such a \\"wondering\\" with Discord in Harmony. She has authentically captured the feel of a simpler time and place while presenting to us characters that are complex and nuanced. The story revolves around a mystery, which begins with petty theft but then darkly evolves into scandal, cover-up and murder. And through swirl of conflicts, both internal and external, our little town of Harmony is thrown into discord; yet Cletus Haley, our protagonist remains true as a father, Sheriff, and as a man.So convincing is Ms. Copeland's storytelling that I can well imagine myself visiting one of those old, abandoned cemeteries on the Central Coast and finding the graves of Cletus and Ruby. How did their lives unfolded after we had left them in Discord? I can only hope that a sequel to this excellent and highly recommended novel will assuage my curiosity."},{"Title":"Discord in Harmony","review":"Discord in Harmony is a wonderful story filled with true to life characters that make it a novel which is extremely hard to put down! Taking place in a small coastal town in California during the Depression, the reader gets to meet the endearing sheriff, the obnoxious Nellie Geer, the sweet Penelope, town bully, and the intriguing school teacher and musician, Ruby Johnson. These are just a few of the fascinating characters that you will meet when you read this story. When you enter into the world that Copeland has created for the reader, you really feel like you are a part of the story. I promise you that you will love it--I did! In fact, I've already read the book twice!"},{"Title":"Discord in Harmony","review":"Discord in Harmony is not only a well-researched vision of what life was like in a little coastal California town during the depression, but a mystery that is full of suspense and page-turning intrigue.

Not only does Ms.Collins talk about life as in the title of one of her famous songs, Both Sides Now, but she tells her life works from all of her various sides and accomplishments.Using a typical day divided into morning, noon and night, Ms. Collins describes how her day is influenced by her creative flow which includes, meditation, meals and the time she devotes to her music or writings. It is as if everything she creates comes forth from the creative energy she pursues daily.I really enjoyed this book. I have long admired Ms. Collins as a voice of the 60's and recently both her fiction and non -- fiction books. To me she epitomizes a Renaissance woman not quite content simply to sing and write songs but to spread out her creative forces to many other aspects of her life. And she seems to do all of these things so well.While I usually don't quote from a book, I decided to include the following lines from Morning, Noon and Night as an incentivefor readers of this review to read a copy of this book.\\"Hope springs eternal they say. As long as I can hope, I can find my way somehow. As long as we can hope, we see around the edges of life as they appear and look for the best, look for the love, look for the light. It is no longer the responsibility of the world around us to make us happy; it is our responsibility to create joy in our lives and we must take what happens to us under all circumstances and find a way to tell the story, to find our way thru the dark, to get thru to our own strength from the failings that come to everyone, no matter how strong or how gifted they are.\\"Read this book and see for yourself if Judy Collins is not only inspiring and uplifting, but a woman for all times."},{"Title":"Morning, Noon, and Night: Living the Creative Life","review":"This book is a little off my beaten path but was on vacation and looking for some writing inspiration and wasnt disappointed.

Anyone who knows anything about Ancient Egypt can just look at the inaccurate information in some of these reviews and see how misinformed readers of this book will be -- for example Thuthmosis III (the accepted &quot;modern&quot; spelling is Thutmose from the Egyptian transliteration, more closely Djehutymose) was not 4'6&quot; -- that is a measurement of his mummy, minus his detached feet and lower legs. He more likely was about 5'6&quot; tall, a very respectable height for an ancient Egyptian. As for Thutmose III being a &quot;hero,&quot; this is a man who, solely for profit, invaded foreign countries, killing, maiming and plundering, carrying goods and slaves back to Egypt, leaving countless impoverished widows and orphans in his wake. It is so sad to think that a mass murderer is anyone's definition of a &quot;hero.&quot;"},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"Breasted's account of the history, culture, and religion of ancient Egypt stands, to this day, as a rare example of scientific writing that is also tremenduously entertaining to read. Never dry, this book is lively, vividly evoking images of the subjects described. Though research into ancient Egypt in the decades since this book was originally written has made many important discoveries, the essential value of this book, its capability to enlighten the reader on one of the great cultures of human civilization, has not diminished.As a writer, Breasted might have excelled at almost any genre of literature he might have selected. His work as a serious historian allowed him to use his skill as a writer to make otherwise perhaps esoteric material available to a broad range of readers, asking not much more from the reader than the capability to simply enjoy a good book."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"While his translations are slightly dated because of new linguistic discoveries, there is still no other work that can compare to James Breasted's monumental &quot;History of Ancient Egypt.&quot; It is an indispensable work for novice and expert alike. There are many epigones to this book, but not many are equal to it. It is stylish in manner, which captivates the reader's interest and holds it through many, many pages - no little feat! I would highly recommend this book to any one wishing to discover ancient Egyptian culture, whether your studies are inchoate or advanced. It is marvellous!"},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"My copy is the Bantam 1964 reprint of the 1905 classic. Almost a hundred years old, this book still reads surprisingly easily. Whether it's out of date or not, I'm in no position to judge, not being an expert in this field. But I'd assume that a lot of archaeological discoveries must have been made in the last century to make this book somewhat obsolete.Breasted was the first and foremost American Egyptologist, the founder of the prestigious Oriental Institute of Chicago (the premier archaeology academy in America - featured in Indiana Jones), and the first archaeologist elected to the National Academy of Sciences.(He was also a former President of the American Historical Association, and must have been the only person to have both honors.) I particularly like his opinions of Thuthmosis III, whose 3450th passing is today.Two other books that may shed some light on the recent findings are &quot;Egypt of the Pharaohs&quot; by Sir Alan Gardiner and &quot;The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt&quot; edited by Ian Shaw."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"Back when I first read Breasted's history it was already 60 years old. I was 14 and much enamored of this ancient culture that I knew mostly from horror movies and eerie museum displays. Cruising the library shelves I found this ponderous volume and dived into it. Starting a lifelong habit of always picking the heaviest book. Of course, the book was out of date then, and today it is more a document of the turn of the century mythology about ancient Egypt than it is anything that qualifies as 'history.'And yet, in many ways it entirely changed the world of a fourteen year old child - whose horizons were suddenly broadened in a multitude of directions. Breasted bridges the gap between tedious academic history and popular and simpleminded glosses. He is always conscious that the facts he narrates are a telescopic look into a culture almost completely alien from what we are today. His simple, direct style has brought the old world alive for the curious for almost a century now.If his thinking seems a bit nave now, it is important to understand that there has been a wealth of discovery in the intervening years. And this book was one of the inspirations that fueled that pursuit of knowledge, drawing people's attention to the mysterious past, and inspiring countless readers to look further. Look elsewhere for accurate material, but come here to see ithe excitement in the archeologist's mind."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"Both vols 1 &amp; 2 of this long out-of-print classic belong on the reference shelves of any aspiring Egyptologist or ANE historian. And if the reader is truly serious, the companion Ancient Records of Egypt, vols 1-5 belong there as well. Breasted refers to these coyly as a 'dictionary'. They represent a completely new translation (ab ovo) of all memorials, et al extant at the time of the original publication - 1909 - and are referred to throughout the main history.This history, though dated, is a much better read than the more recent and stuffy work by Grimal (a sure cure for insomnia).Breasted is able to switch from a wonderful flow of descriptive narrative when giving a synopsis of The Land to a more scholarly mode without dropping a beat.Don't buy this book for the illustrations - being an off-print, they've suffered in the process but there are better places to find these anyway. The Oriental Institute Archives come to mind.This is the seminal work on AE history despite its age - the historical vade mecum for the AE buff."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"The content of A History of Egypt is without peer and essential to ones understanding of this ancient civilization. However, the reproduction of the original text and photographs is unworthy of its author and his work. Broken type, such as many a dot-less lower-case \\"i\\" and arm-less lower case \\"r\\" is a constant irritant and source of confusion throughout its 600 pages. The original photographs have lost much valuable detail, bordering on worthlessness. A long-ago reader's inane underlining, imbedded in the source text, is carefully preserved in defiance of our digital age. Surely a better source copy could have been found resulting in a cleaner edition, I am appalled to think that Amazon would permit such a shoddy reproduction to leave its premises without due warning."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"The person who refers to himself as reader \\"July 8 2003\\" should stick to comic books and tabloids. He (or She) has no historical clue and was probably on drugs while reading Breasted.To Call Tuthmosis III (who spread civilization into Asia among the savage Hittites) a mass murderer, displays the utmost ignorrance of the simplest facts of ancient history. The barbarians of Asia Minor raided cities, killed, maimed, raped and pillaged and it was the duty of any civilized King, from the Pharaohs down to the Romans, to restore order in the Empire and force civilization upon them.I can understand our dislike for war in the 21st century; I am a pacifist myself. War is outdated like tooth extraction and limb amputation without anaesthesia, but 16 centuries before the birth of Christ life was different and thanks to Great rulers like Tuthmosis III, and Alexander the great, we can enjoy peace today.For the love of God, read History from an historical standpoint not your own morality or else stick to watching Fox news."},{"Title":"A History of Egypt: From the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest: Second Edition, Fully Revised","review":"James Henry Breasted, is the founder of american egyptology.

Some of the 50 recipes I tried were redundant and others ranged from inedible to fantastic. I didn't become emaciated, lost maybe 6 pounds which is fine, because I'm a little overweight. I also wasn't hungry and my cravings for cooked food minimal. This experiment has certainly led me to incorporate more raw foods into my diet. Anything that calls for honey can easily be substituted with agave nectar. You don't need to have all the top-notch equipment listed, I used a cheap food processor, ordinary blender and a used Ronco dehydrator I got for free. Admittedly, most of this is very labour intensive.Karyn's Tomato and Pea Salad (63)- Crunch, light and good. I would use less Bragg's.Lentil Salad (63)- Pretty good.Quinoa Tabouli (68)- Great in small quantities because the flavour is so potent.I Can't Believe It's Not Waldorf Salad (79)- Quite good, but not spectacular.Butternut Squash Soup (95)- Pretty good, but bland. I used the amount of water for desired consistency.Carrot/Orange/Pumpkin Soup (95)- Good, I used fresh onion and garlic instead of powdered. The recipe didn't include a liquid, so I added two cups of water.Ants in a Canoe (110)- Almost as good as Ants on a Log.Ants on a Log (110)- A person could easily live off of this!Mesquite Melts (124)- Absolutely terrible. The texture is very unpleasant.Spring Rolls (131)- Good, can be almost anything wrapped in anything.Corn Torillas (169)- very good, they've got some kick. Nothing like tortillas though.Jameth and Kim's Original Flax Crackers (168)- Good, easy and flexible.Sweet Golden Crackers (176)- Not so good, but edible.Barbecue Chips (177)-Okay, just don't add too much cayenne and skip the beat.Almond Milk (182)-Tied with hazelnut for the best milk I ever had.Almost, Hazel, or Sunflower Milk (184)- Can be done with pretty much any nut or seed. I used soy and added maple syrup and vanilla. Strain it in a cheesecloth.Quickest Tahini Milk (186)- So, so terrible.Banana Bites (193)- Good, but no very exciting.Granola/Grawnola (194)- Made a combination of these two recipes and it is wonderful, takes a long time though, so make a lot.Spiced Strawberry Granola Crunch (197)- Very tasty, would be better with less allspice because it's pretty overpowering.Viktoras' Secret Raw Horamola (198)- Terribly bland.Italian Rawsage (202)- Very very filling and pretty good.Italian Style Zucchini Pasta Pesto (202)- NEVER put 1/4 cup of salt, I put 1/8 and it was still not edible.Mock Spaghetti (205)- Okay, but boring.Avocado Burritos (208)- Very boring and way too many tomatoes.Chinese Wild Rice with Tender Vegetables (217)- Good but I would use less ginger.Chow Mein Memory (218)- Wonderful! I would add more tamari.Curried Kofka Ball in Cashew Tomatoes Curry Sauce (219)- One of the best recipes in the book, especially the sauce. I upped the spices a lot.Easy Sushi (221)- Fast, easy, good and flexible.Roast Tofu with Satay Sauce (223)- Good and simple. Don't overhydrate mushrooms. I added can of coconut milk, some garlic and some chile pepper to the sauce.Falafels (220)-SUPER! Just as good or better than traditional falafels.Live Gardenburgers (232)- Delicious. Next time I will add garlic.Neat Balls (234)-Really good, but again, better with garlic.Pecan Almond Stuffed Mushrooms (237)- Pretty Bland so spice at will. Cut pate recipe in half or you will run out of mushrooms.Spinach and Potato Latkes (241)- Just awful. I like spinach, but this has a fishy taste.Sun Garden Burgers (242)- Really good, mild flavour. Easy and fast, makes 14 large patties.Thai Crane's Nest in Coconut Curry (244)-Tastes pretty ok, but I was unable to form nests because they fell apart.What's for Dinner Loaf (247)- Very good! I made them into patties and dehydrated until crisp on the outside.Carrot and Tomato Spread (250)- Okay, but bland.Miso Mayo (254)- Good, but a very strong miso flavour.White Sauce/ Salad Dressing (270)- Not more than ok.Guacamole (274)- Pretty great.Pine Nut Sour Cream (276)- Good Base for any dip.Ranch Dip or Dressing (276)- Easy, fast and super yummy.Raw Hummus (277)-Pretty good, not spectacular.Salsa Fresca (278)- Good and fresh tasting.Tahitian Almond Dipping Sauce (278)- Really, really wonderful.Raw Candy (295)- Good, but not at all like chocolate as the book would suggest.Whip the Mister (327)- Yum!

What it would be like to only be six years old and come home to an empty house and your entire family gone. Luckily twenty five years later she has fallen in love with a man whose only concerns lie with Tory. His love is genuine and although it seems far fetched from reality to meet a man with that much compassion for a woman, romance books are of interest to most women for the mere fact that they want to experience something that they themselves have never witnessed in a man. Brett Hooker is unlike any other man, and you can't help but to wish that some man cared for you with that same amount of passion.This story is one of those ones that hit you square in the chest. It is not suspenseful in an action packed way, but there is that element of being a low key page-turner. You can not help but get a little choked up while reading this book. It will tug at your heart strings on a couple different levels. It is classified as a romantic suspense, but I would classify it much more as a contemporary romance with a hint of suspense. If you are looking for an action packed suspense with a touch of romance, than this book is not for you. On the other hand, if you would like to read something that will clearly make you feel the power of love than buy this book."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"In 1973 Arkansas, six year old Victoria Lancaster was abandoned. Due to selective amnesia, the trauma of coming home to an empty house has been buried deep in her subconscious. Over the subsequent years, Tory's childhood memories revolve around being bounced from foster home to foster home. For the past three years, Tory has lived with DA investigator Brett Hooker. Over the past quarter of a century, he is the only person to slightly dent Tory's emotional shield, but even he knows that in spite of their obvious love for each other, the ephemeral Tory is incapable of any deeper commitment.Her last photo assignment had Tory away from Brett for six weeks. However, though their lovemaking reaches stratospheric heights, something seems to be bothering Tory. A picture of a tattooed person that she recently shot has invoked hidden memories and has led to gruesome nightmares. Between this and Brett being shot on the job, Tory fears being abandoned again. Though thoroughly frightened, the intrepid Tory decides it is time to confront her past, regardless of the danger it leads to, if she is to enjoy a future with the man she loves.SWEET BABY is an ingenious psychological romance that allows readers to see first hand the childhood traumas affecting an otherwise tender but dauntless individual and the man willing to risk everything to protect her back. The story line is both emotional and fast-paced, a rare summit that only the supreme scribes such as Sharon Sala can successfully scale. Fans of psychological romance will cherish this keeper.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"It seems lately when I send a review that I've read a different book than everyone else. I found the female lead in this book unsympathetic and the male lead a bit of a wimp.Torie has been with Brett for four years. The last three, they've been living together in \\"his\\" apartment. In Torrie's mind nothing is theirs or even hers. Everything is Brett's. Brett's bed, Brett's chair, Brett's bedroom. Speaks of a lack commitment or permancence on her part.Torie keeps simply disappearing from Brett's life with no warning and rarely even leaves a note. She never bothers to tell him where she is and he has no way to get hold of her in an emergency. Jeez he could be dead and buried for all she knows. Occasionally, she might send a postcard, letter or leave a message on his answering machine. On very rare occasions he actually gets to speak to her! She\`d be gone 6 or 8 weeks, stroll back in, and never tell him where she was, what she was doing or if she'd been with someone else. Or not. Yet Torie makes Brett constantly promise he'll never leave her. She has a problem because of being left in her childhood. Why then would she constantly hurt the man she cares about by doing the same to him? Probably because she knows she can.Yes, she had horrible, horrible things happen to her in her childhood and they needed to be worked out. But Torie wasn't interested in getting help. If she'd really cared about Brett she would have broken it off with him completely so he'd have a chance with a life with someone who truly cared about him. She even leaves him shortly after he's been shot. She later admits; \\"I come and go with no regard for your feelings. I act as if I'm the only thing in the world that matters.\\" Ya think?But in all fairness Brett let her use him. He took whatever she wanted to give him and was her willing doormat. He spent half his time in fear that he'll wake up or come home from work and she'll be gone. Yes, he loved her. But after awhile he was just being a fool. There is a line between loving someone and remaining loyal to them; and allowing a person to walk all over you. And as a twist on the usual \\"woman apologizing to man for what he's done wrong\\", Brett apologizes to Torie for what she does wrong.I just couldn't have much respect for either one of these people and by the end I didn't really care what happened to them."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"This author was in my Amazon.com recommendations list and I decided to try one. I'm really glad that I did! This book made me laugh and cry. It's the best that I've read from a new author in a long time!"},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"Last night as I was sorting through my books to decide 'what's a keeper, which ones can go' I found this book again. Sweet Baby is a very strong story and very emotional. As soon as the story starts with the homecoming of six-year-old Victoria in an empty house, you are totally absorbed. Victoria had a very horrible childhood and now, as a woman, has a relationship with Brett, a cop. Brett is a wonderful man. He knows Victoria has some strange things, but he loves her unconditionally. We slowly are informed what exactly happened to Victoria. I always cry at the part where Victoria 'breaks' (when she arrives at the empty apartment) and Brett finds out about her childhood. Together they search for the truth. This is really really one of my keepers...."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"Sharon Sala has outdid herself with this one. Brett is the ultimate hero - caring, sensitive and most of all devoted.I found this book sometimes difficult to read just because of the emotions that it evoked in me but I could not wait to get to the end to find out what happened.I will recommend this to my friends."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"In my opinion, this is one of Sala's best. It was an emotional read for me from the very beginning. It's a contemporary and features one of the most sensitive &quot;good guy&quot; heroes I've ever come across in a novel. No annoying arrogance and impatience, just lots of understanding _and_ he looks like Mel Gibson :) You know from page one that he is deeply, totally, in love with the heroine and you feel it throughout the book. The heroine is the troubled one in SWEET BABY. She's had a hellacious past that she doesn't remember and it's kept her from committing to the hero. She walks in and out of his life and not until she recovers her memory will she be able to give her heart completely to him. With the hero's love, patience and police background he helps her confront the demons in her past. He gets my vote for #1 hero of the year."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I didn't mind this book. It had its moments but I find that Sala tends to use stereotypes. Nice people are always beautiful and often a tad too sweet. Bad people have tattoos, beards and piercings. It gets very predictable. Perhaps she should write fairy tales?Also, god help us all, she tends to like, god help her, using the same melodramatic phrase for characters throughout the book, god help them, so much that it stops, god help her, having any effect at all. God help us all.Spoiler:In one of the dream sequences (that actually turned out to be a memory) Sala also writes about the heroine's mother making a doll when the young heroine has gone to bed. It says how the mother has taken it out every night to sew, so that it will be a surprise for her daughter.How then, years later, can the heroine remember something she never saw?"},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"Sharon Sala can be hit or miss with her books, but with \\"Sweet Baby\\", she has a definite winner on her hands. This maybe considered one of her best.Victoria or Tory as her boyfriend Brett calls her, came home to an empty house when she was seven years old. Her parents were gone and the house was empty of everything. She was so scarred by the experience from going to foster home to foster home, she is more of a shell of a person. She is afraid to love the people in her life. She shuts down. And the fact that she can't imagine her childhood makes it worse.Brett, her live in boyfriend of 4 years loves her with his full heart and soul. Tory takes advantage of him, in which most men would tell her to hit the road. But Brett knows he is her soul mate. He can't bear to have her out of his life.Tory starts to have nightmares due to a picture she takes as a photographer. Her memories are starting to overetake her to the point of madness and Brett is the only one who can keep her sane.This story would be perfect as a television drama and Sala has written two sympathetic characters in Tory and Brett. Some may thinkg Brett is too perfect, but overall he is suitable to counteract Tory.Tory's emotional journey to find out what happened to her over twenty years ago comes to ahead, but she finally faces her demons and her past.A wonderful love story and a hero that any woman would want. Both teens and adults can appreciate this story.Katiebabs"},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"Luckily I have the week off for Christmas because I started reading this book this morning and couldn't put it down until it was finished. This is my first book by Sharon Sala and it won't be my last. Tory and Brett and incredible and the nature of the story is heart wrenching. I will definetly pass this book on to my friends."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"Not the most exciting book in the world but I enjoyed it all the same, and Sharon Sala is a great prose writer. Some of her characters are little too sugary at times but mostly they are believable.The plot centres around Tory, real name Victoria who has been shunted from foster home to foster home since the disappearance of her mother when she was barely seven years old.As hard as she tried Tory is unable to push the past out of her mind and even with a wonderful lover in the form of ruggedly handsome Brett she is emotionally stunted, and distant with a man she so obviously loves.Forced to confront the past before it tears her apart, Tory must be strong as she searches for the truth about her mother's disappearance, for the past is a dangerous country and some secrets are easier to cope with than others."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I've enjoyed Sharon Sala's books in the past and made a list of her older books I haven't read. In my searches, I stumbled across SWEET BABY and grabbed it, anxious to begin another journey that only Sala can master. This one, however, was a bit of a disappointment.SWEET BABY focuses on Tory Lancaster, a photojournalist in her early thirties who struggles with her own demons leftover from her childhood. When she was six years old she came home from school to an empty house. Seems her mother and her mother's boyfriend packed up everything and abandoned Tory. Tory no longer has a memory for anything that happened to her before the age of six, and can't figure out why she cannot commit to a romantic relationship. Brett Hooker, an investigator for the Oklahoma City District Attorney, is madly in love with Tory and is her anchor even though she won't commit to him.This book is supposed to be a suspense novel but there was very little in the suspense department. There was the side line of someone trying to kill Brett but that was predictable and had little meat to the story. There was the other sideline about Tory's mother, but again it had little meat and was obvious. This is more along the lines of a love story and should be categorized as a romance, not a suspense novel.The character development was excellent with the two main characters. The reader is given enough information about Tory and her past that intrigues you yet brings you into the fold as Tory tries to uncover the answers she so desperately craves. I really felt for this woman and hoped she'd get the satisfaction she needed. Brett was also well development but in a different way. He was written to be caring and compassionate, but Sala over did it and he came out as almost wimpy. When Tory would pack up and leave to go on a photo shoot, leaving no word about where she was going or if she'd even be back, Brett would patiently wait for her return. Huh? After four years of her coming in and out of his life, you'd think he'd tell her to have a bit more respect for him. Instead he moves from the apartment into a house that he knows she'll love. Either he's got it bad for Tory, or he has no backbone. Sala wants us to believe it's the love angle but it's still a bit unbelievable.Support characters were either developed or left more to the reader's imagination. Brett's family members were better developed than other cast members. His mother and brother were interesting and I wish more pages had been devoted to the interactions between them, Tory and Brett - it made for some interesting reading.However, the citizens of Calico Rock, where Tory grew up, were left underdeveloped. When Tory's best friend, Mary Ellen, shows up to rekindle the friendship from twenty-five years ago, we're only given the impression that she giggles a lot and is a redhead. For someone to want to see a friend that has not been a part of her life in twenty-five years there has to be more than a giggling redhead. But we are never given that insight. Other characters are brushed over and soon forgotten.Overall SWEET BABY is an ok book, nothing great but not too bad either. I'd recommend it only after you've consumed other books on your Must Read list as parts could be frustrating when you want to shake the characters for not clearly seeing the obvious."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"This is an exceptional book. I've read it a half a dozen times since I bought it and loaned it to friends. Everyone has loved it! The love story is poignant and the charactors are spectacular!

Sharon Sala must have done quite a bit of research into various aspects of this involved love story. It was a touching and really wonderful story of Tory Lancaster's tortured life (nightmares) trying to find her childhood and Brett Hooker's understanding and love for her; what a wonderful extended family the Hookers were. Especially Ryan. When Brett was shot I could feel her pain but when she left again and he finally had enough I was so sad. She always came back and it seemed to be a test to see if he would honor his promise. Will there be story about Ryan Hooker?diamondgirl1"},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I HAVE READ A LOT OF SHARON SALA BOOKS BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST AND SADDEST FROM PAGE ONE TO END.

IT IS WONDERFUL AND I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ACTION, TEARS, HEARTACHE AND JOY."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"SYNOPSIS:This is a sweet story about a woman with serious attachment issues. She's in love with Brett, but treats him like he doesn't matter. Tory leaves him over and over for work for weeks without a thought or a call, and saunters back into his life as if she never left.Brett is such a kind man who loves Tory so much he will do anything to help heal her and make her amenable to the concept of \`being loved'.Tory doesn't remember her childhood before the second grade. She was raised in foster homes, and has no information on her family. A mystery presents itself when she takes a chance photo of a stranger. It might be the key to quieting the demons that torment her, and solving her relationship issues.This is a good one, more honest than an average Harlequin type book. It has people with loving friendships with their siblings and family, and provides a perfect place for Tory to heal.Sala is IMO a master story -teller. She's on my short list of \`I'll buy anything I find of hers'."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I love Sharon Sala, she is one of my favorite authors. This book is a bit different from most of her books because the main couple have already been in a relationship for 4 years. They live together and are very much in love, but Tori tends to take off at random and never tells Brett where she is or how long she will be gone. This book deals with Tori and Brett figuring out their relationship, finding out about her childhood (she does not remember anything before the second grade and she grew up in foster homes) and her coming to peace with who she is, what happened to her, and feeling secure and safe in Brett's love for her. The thing I loved best about this book is that Brett REALLY loves her. He is frustrated with her random disappearances, but when Tori starts to have nightmares prompted by a photo she took, he is always there for her. He helps her search out her past and confront what happened to her, constantly letting her know how much he loves her."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I love how Sharon Sala pulls you into the story. I really enjoyed this book. I read fast so she needs to write faster."},{"Title":"Sweet Baby","review":"I usually don't leave reviews, but I felt that I should give fair warning. This is actually my second Sharon Sala book. I wasn't overly impressed with the first one, so I thought I'd give her another shot. This one was even worse! Without giving away the end of the story, one thing that bothered me was that we find out WHAT happened, but we don't find out WHY the man did it. It's been over three weeks since I finished it, so maybe I forgot about that detail, but even so, if the reason was stated somewhere in there, it obviously wasn't memorable. All that aside, though, I think my biggest problem with this book is how the author portrays their love. I get that this man absolutely loves and adores her, but can I admit that I only know that from reading other reviews??Honestly, the author does nothing to give their relationship any substance. She doesn't say why they love each other, or how they fell in love with each other, etc. It's all about sex. Every few pages it's talking about how her boyfriend wants to \\"be with her\\" so much he can hardly stand it. The author's descriptions sounded like lust to me, not love. I like a great love scene just as much as the next person, but come on.... can you tell us something else, ANYTHING else that this relationship is based on other than sex?? There were a few good parts if you have a couple hours to kill or are spending the weekend on a beach reading, but other than that, don't waste too much money on this one, because it won't be worth it. I got my copy off of ebay for $1.25, and after reading it, I wouldn't have wanted to spend much more than that."},{"Title":"Duranty reports Russia,","review":"Walter Duranty was the New York Times reporter in Moscow from 1922 till 1934.He opportunistically wrote positive reports about Stalin's gangster regime, not out of conviction, but to remain in the favors of the Soviet censors and therefore to keep writing from Moscow. Ralph Barnes of the Herald Tribune had been promised by his editors that if he were expelled from the Soviet Union, they would assign him elsewhere. Duranty did not get such a promise from the Times.Duranty enjoyed a lavish lifestyle while repeating Soviet propaganda and making up fables of his own - fulfilling his own expressed desire to write fiction.In 1932 he received a Pulitzer Prize for his articles in 1931. Ironically, the 1931 Pulitzer Prize had been won by H.R. Knickerbocker, who had been more critical of the Soviet experiment, sufficiently so that he was invited not to return to Stalin's 'paradise'.Duranty did a great deal of damage to American public opinion and public policy, being one of the factors that caused Roosevelt to recognize the Soviet Union. In his dispatches from Moscow, which he rarely left, Duranty denied that the Soviet Union was a police state and denied many of the crimes of the Bolshevik criminals, who were no better than the Nazis.Duranty painted a positive picture of the Soviet Union, about which he knew almost nothing, leaving Moscow infrequently, and then more frequently going to Western Europe and not to the outlying parts of the Soviet Union. He depicted Josef Stalin, a thug no different from Hitler, as a 'statesman' giving the Soviet people what they wanted (though Josef needed a gun to do it).This book is a good example of the trash published by pro-Soviet Americans at that time, others being Louis Fisher, Louisa Strong, Maurice Hindus, W.H. Chamberlain, and Eugene Lyons. The latter two revised their views - after leaving the Soviet Union forever, by which time it was too late to change many of the public perceptions of the Soviet Union they had helped to created.Numerous calls have been made for revoking Duranty's prize as based on fraud. To please the management of the New York Times, the Pulitzer Board has refused to do so. The New York Times and the Sulzberger family, which owns the Times, have given large amounts to Columbia University and its School of Journalism."},{"Title":"Love is the Answer, Creating Positive Relationships","review":"I first read this book about 7 years ago and at the time it had a transforming effect on my life. Based on the principles of &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;, yet light hearted and easy to read. While the message may seem too simple for those who believe that life is supposed to be difficult, if you apply the principles to your own life without judging them, you will see for yourself that sometimes it's the simple things in life that really make a difference. If you are interested in creating more meaningful relationships then this book will give you the skills you need to do so. Read it with an open mind and you just might find that Love Is the Answer!"},{"Title":"Love is the Answer, Creating Positive Relationships","review":"It has been more than a decade since I first stumbled upon this book. I cannot overstate how it has CHANGED MY LIFE ! I gained all kinds of new insights, and was able to see articulated things that I had innately believed, but had never seen validated. For example, there is the theory here that the only true emotions are love and fear. Hard to accept at first, perhaps, but then think about it: anger is a mask, hiding fear of some sort. This book is easy to digest, you WANT to pick it up and read it again and again and keep it handy. It's the kind of book you'll find yourself recommending to friends enthusiastically. The term \\"New Age\\" may have fallen out of fashion, but there's nothing mystical about this. It's practical, hands on, and talks about the concepts that everyone must live: forgiveness, trust, love. If you are curious about \\"The Course of Miracles,\\" here's a good place to start. Or if you just want to know yourself and improve your relationships, you'll find a warm and friendly voice here to guide you."},{"Title":"Love is the Answer, Creating Positive Relationships","review":"I first read this book about 3 years ago.

This book ultimatly changed not only my life but all of those I have come in conact with since. I have purchesed several copies for those I love. I strongly believe this should be top on every reading list in every High School and Middle School.

The first part introduces the notion of attitudinal healing.The second part deals with the issues of relationships. Part three develpes different stepping stones in the journey of attitudinal healing. This part deals with the ego and its role in fear based orientation to life. The basis idea is to recognize the role of split mind and heal it. One should transform fear into love. Final steping stone is the significance of forgiveness. The inner teacher is to be recognized and listened for guidance. Last part gives 15 lessons for daily meditations. For example, Lesson 10 &quot; Today I forgive my parents totally, releasing us all from past &quot;. Lesson 15 : I will be still for an instant. (Reminds Bible).

He merely wrote the preface. Preaching With Passion was written by Alex Montoya. It does not offer a lot of unique material, but it clearly presents an explanation of what is required to preach with conviction and sincerity.The book offers more than a few clever complaints about boring and tedious preaching, beginning in the first chapter, \\"Preach with Spiritual Power.\\" The other chapters include: \\"Preach with Conviction, Preach with Compassion, Preach with Authority, Peach with Urgency, Preach with Brokeness, Preach with the Whole Being, and Preach with Imagination.For someone who has not been exposed to similar material, this work may prove beneficial. It emphasizes the need for the preacher to have a close walk with God and a burden for his people. For those of us who have attended pastor's conferences and been around the block a few times, its value may be more motivational than informational."},{"Title":"Preaching with Passion (Preaching With Series)","review":"Montoya has written an excellent book for pastors and Bible study teachers who want to preach/teach with more conviction and passion.Among the points Montoya covers include:1. Reasons why preachers lack passion.2. The power to preach comes only from God.3. Passionate preaching comes from a person of convictions - know what you believe and then say it!4. Excellent notes on having compassion for the people you preach or teach to and wrong reasons for preaching and teaching.5. Do not use the pulpit as a weapon or become an authoritarian preacher. Do speak with authority but realize that authority comes from God, not yourself or others.6. Allow God to break you so you can become a broken man and be more useful to God!7. Use imagination when preaching - do not bore your listeners to sleep!I agree with the previous reviewer about the book being more motivational than informational. However, pastors and teachers do need encouragement and motivation even after we have become thoroughly educated lest we become too self-satisfied and complacent. While I love to continue to learn new things, sometimes God has used the Bible and other books to motivate and encourage me!"},{"Title":"Preaching with Passion (Preaching With Series)","review":"In the 1600's John Flavel proclaimed, \\"it is far easier to study and press a thousand truths upon others, than to feel the power of one truth upon our own hearts...\\" Some 400 years later Alex Montoya has detected the same problem; preachers are often trained for exegetical study but not preaching with passion. This short book offers principles to combat lifeless preaching. As Montoya says, \\"The fact is many of us simply preach sermons, not the Word of God. We preach the exegesis, not the divine oracle. We preach crafted, alliterated manuscripts instead of the living Word. We are biblical, but the Word has been deadened by a lifeless delivery or a hampering style.Montoya proffers his suggestions on restoring passion to preaching. He hopes to teach us how to preach with spiritual power, conviction, compassion, authority, urgency, brokenness, the whole being, and the imagination.What I Liked:I have noticed, and even fell victim to, the type of passionless preaching that Montoya is combating. If nothing else this book will serve as a wake up call to pastors that merely being exegetically sound is not true expository preaching. Montoya helps us wake up to the reality that how we say something has a bearing on what it is we say. It will serve pastors well to heed the advice given in this book.Montoya does a good job of reminding us where passion comes from and that it is not simply something that can be conjured up once you get in the pulpit. Passionate preaching is not yelling as you preach. It is, as Martin Lloyd-Jones said, \\"theology coming through a man who is on fire\\". I appreciate that Montoya follows the mold of such men as Lloyd-Jones. It is rare to find a chapter on brokenness in a preaching book, hopefully Montoya's words will be heeded and will as John MacArthur says in his recommendation, \\"start an epidemic\\".What I Disliked:In an effort to stimulate the preacher and spur him on to action our author at times seems a little too anthropocentric for my taste. In Montoya's defense I do not think he intends to be. There are a few other dangerous statements in the book as well: such as, \\"preaching needs to be constantly adapting itself to the changing face of culture\\". I get what Montoya is saying but it could be potentially misunderstood. However, the overall tenor of the book is solidly biblical (and for my Reformed readers--it is of the Reformed persuasion) and not a major dislike with the book.Should You Buy It:Most certainly. The truth of the matter though is that a book cannot create a passionate preacher. This book will not fix all. It will define the problem and give a few suggestions for laboring to become a more passionate preacher. However, it takes a lifetime of boldly broken fellowship with the Almighty to create a passionate preacher."},{"Title":"Preaching with Passion (Preaching With Series)","review":"This book has great content, easy to read, outlined well and very encouraging for any preacher who desires to proclaim God's Word passionately. I would recommend this to anyone from the beginner preacher to the \\"tried and true\\" preacher."},{"Title":"Preaching with Passion (Preaching With Series)","review":"While many books on homiletics (preaching) deal only with technique and sermon development, Montoya gets to the very heart of preaching. In some ways, I wish I would have had this book in seminary. But, it's probably more profitable for someone who have been preaching on a weekly basis for a period of time. For me, it was both refreshing and instructive.So, to pastors who need a boost, I encourage you to read this book.Here's a quote to whet your appetite:\\"Truth discovered warms the mind; truth applied in our lives warms the heart; and the necessity of imparting this same truth to others sets the pulpit aflame.\\" 50)"},{"Title":"Preaching with Passion (Preaching With Series)","review":"The book fails to center on the real power of preaching, God's Word.Preaching with passion comes from a passion stirred up in the preacher's heart by his study of The Word. Any other passion is only manipulation.Jonathan Edwards was said to read his sermons in a monotone voice in order to not manipulate feelings. He wanted the Holy Spirit, through The Word, to do the work.I would not recommend Edwards' method. There is no place in preaching for boring people, not Edward's method was boring. Nor is there a place for putting on a theatrical show. Preaching must engage the mind first, by The Word, and then permit emotions to follow.We're not to be preaching for apparent power or apparent effect, we cannot see as God sees. We are to be preaching to faithfully proclaim God's Word. All of the power is in The Word.I wish Mr. Montoya had started with The Word in preaching and how it, and only it, can produce the passion appropriate for the pulpit.This is the power: (Isaiah 55:11 NKJV) So shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; It shall not return to Me void, But it shall accomplish what I please, And it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.This is the source of passion: (Psalms 1:1-2 NKJV) Blessed is the man Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, Nor stands in the path of sinners, Nor sits in the seat of the scornful; But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night."},{"Title":"Logical Investigations, Volume Two","review":"This book is the founding document of phenomenology and the book (along with the works of Frege) which ultimately led to the analytic/Continental divide in philosophy. It is, therefore, a very important work not only in terms of understanding Husserl's own philosophy and the development of phenomenology but for anyone who is interested in the history of philosophy in the twentieth-century. It is a challenging work. Husserl's style is dense and somewhat dry and technical. You have to read very slowly and be prepared to re-read sections over and over but the result, if you have the patience, is very rewarding.It is important to realize that Husserl's road to phenomenology began with the goal of grounding the objectivity of logic against the doctrines of psychologism (the doctrine that the laws of logic are based on empirical facts of psychology and are, therefore, relative to the species homo sapiens). The first section of this book is a really devastating critique of psychologism. This is important because phenomenology is often criticized for its subjectivism and its supposed lack of objectivity. Husserl's goal in this work is to ground the objectivity of logic against all forms of relativism (especially species relativism and the relativism that Husserl believes is inherent to Kant's philosophy).Psychologism views logic as a technology of thinking, judging, proving, etc. and, therefore, believes it needs to investigate these phenomena, which are psychological phenomena, in order to work out a correct technology which would insure that we make correct or true judgements. Husserl writes, \\"Theoretically regarded, Logic therefore is related to psychology as part to whole. Its main aim is, in particular, to set up propositions of the form: Our intellectual activities must, either generally, or in specifically characterized circumstances, have such and such a form, such and such an arrangement, such and such combinations and no others, if the resultant judgments are to have the character of evidence, are to achieve knowledge in the pointed sense of the word\\" (33). This view seems to imply that this is a merely empirical question, namely: what form must our judgments take to possess the property of self-evidence and knowledge.Husserl ultimately overcomes this view by distinguishing between the sense of an expression and the act of expression itself. The sense of an act of expression is ideal and is not a real part of the act in question (this is the distinction between noesis and noema). Logic, in Husserl's view, is not concerned with the acts of judging, thinking, proving, etc. but rather with the ideal laws relating to the sense of concepts like Truth, Proposition, Object, Property, Relation, Combination, Law, Fact, etc.; concepts which, in Husserl's own words, \\"represent the categories or constituents out of which science as such is essentially constituted\\" (51). Husserl points out that all forms of relativism which base themselves on the notion of a \`subjective truth', or a truth that would be true for one person, or group of people, or one species, but not true for another, involve themselves in contradiction by using the word \`truth' in a way that is contrary to its sense and meaning. According to Husserl, laws like the law of noncontradiction \\"have their roots in the mere meaning of truth, that from these it follows that talk of a subjective truth, that is one thing for one man and the opposite for another, must count as purest nonsense\\" (47). People who believe that it would be possible for there to be beings that would not be bound by logical principles like the law of noncontradiction (who believe that these are merely empirical facts about our own thinking) will either believe that such beings understand the words \`true' and \`false' in our sense, \\"in which case it is irrational to speak of logical principles not holding, since they pertain to the mere sense of these words as understood by us,\\" or, \\"such beings use the words \`true' and \`false' in some different sense, and the whole dispute is then one of words\\" (48-49). In other words, anyone who uses the word \\"truth\\" and means the same thing that we mean when we use this word will be bound by the same logical laws as we are since logical laws relate to the sense of these words.Logic is merely the expression of the laws relating to these ideal meanings. It is similar, in this way, to mathematics. Husserl points out that mathematics is grounded in acts of counting, addition, multiplication, etc. but no one views mathematics as being grounded in the psychological study of acts of counting, addition, and multiplication. Mathematics relates to the objects of such acts which are not real parts of the acts themselves. The same is true of logic in Husserl's opinion. While thinking is carried out in acts of judgement it does not follow that logic is based in the psychological study of such acts but rather in the ideal correlates of such acts.Where Husserl differs from logicians like Frege is in his attempt to trace the ideal meanings of logic back to sense-bestowing acts of consciousness (though this is not a return to psychologism because we are not concerned with these acts in their empirical reality, or the causal mechanisms that give rise to them, but in their 'essence', i.e. in the aspects of these acts which would remain the same for any consciousness which was intentionally related to the same objects or meanings however different they may be from us in an empirical sense). \\"Phenomenology,\\" Husserl writes, \\"lays bare the \`sources' from which the basic concepts and ideal laws of pure logic \`flow', and back to which they must once more be traced, so as to give them all the \`clearness and distinctness' needed for an understanding...of pure logic\\" (86). In order to examine the sense of terms like Truth we must trace them back to the sense-giving acts which constitute them for consciousness though we will not be viewing these acts in their empirical reality as I have said (hence avoding psychologism) but will instead be viewing them in the pure generality of their essence. This leads Husserl to his notion of \`eidetic phenomenology' in which the essences of various types of acts are grasped. The analysis of these acts reveals certain ideal possibilities and impossibilities in regard to the possible intuitive fulfillment of the intentional objects presented in these acts. These are certain ideal laws which apply a priori to our acts of intuition and signification (though the realm of signification is wider than the realm of intuition and is definied by purely logico-grammatical laws rather than laws of possible intuitive fulfillment which simply means that we can conceive things if they follow certain grammatical laws that could never be possible objects of intuition, i.e., a square circle).The move back to phenomenology, and to consciousness, is ultimately what distinguishes Husserl from Frege and is what ultimately led to the Continental/analytic divide in philosophy. It is not enough, according to Husserl, to simply elucidate the ideal meanings relating to notions like truth; it is also necessary to inquire into how these meanings can be \`given' to subjects or to consciousness. As Dan Zahavi writes in his bookHusserl's Phenomenology (Cultural Memory in the Present), \\"If one wants to understand ideality, one ultimately has to return to the conscious acts in which it is given\\" (13). It is not enough for ideality, or the ideal laws of logic to exist, we have to know about them if we are going to talk about them at all. Zahavi again does a good job of summarizing this, he writes, \\"Even if it is impossible to reconcile scientific objectivity with a psychological foundation of logic, one is however still confronted with the apparent paradox that objective truths are known in subjective acts of knowing. And, as Husserl points out, this relation between the objective ideality and the subjective act has to be investigated and clarified if we wish to attain a more substantial understanding of the possibility of knowledge. We need to determine how the idealities are justified and validated by an epistemic agent\\" (11). This leads Husserl to his analysis of various acts and the modes of their intuitive fulfillment and leads him to a widened notion of intuition which includes what he calls \`categorial intuition'. This was one of the most influential aspects of Husserl's early work and had a direct influence on Heidegger.Husserl sums up his views fairly well towards the end of the work when he writes, \\"That a piece of sensory stuff can only be apprehended in certain forms, and bound together according to certain forms, that the possible transformation of these forms is subject to pure laws, in which the material element varies freely, that the meanings to be expressed are likewise limited to certain forms, which they can change only in prescribed manners, if they are not to lose their expressibility - all this does not depend on the empirical contingencies of the course of consciousness, not even on the contingencies of our intellectual or common-human organization. It depends on the specific nature of the acts in question, on their intentional and epistemic essence\\" (371). In other words, any intellect that can be intentionally related to a sensory object (to take one example) will be bound by the same laws that determine our own understanding in relation to such an object (and since the object and act are correlative one cannot change the act without changing the object). This means that even a divine intelligence would be bound by the same logical laws as we are (contra Kant).In summary, this book is a really important book and is essential reading for anyone interested in Edmund Husserl, phenomenology, or the history of twentieth-century philosophy. Anyone who is critical of phenomenology should read this work; if nothing else it will illuminate the motivations that led Husserl to develop the method of phenomenology in the first place."},{"Title":"The flight of the heron","review":"First published in the 1920s and still popular, The Flight of the Heron is a romantic adventure of the Jacobite uprising in 1745.

Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Straw Obelisk: A World War II Novel","review":"Tradition. We all have traditions that are important to us, oftentimes associated with holidays or from memories of family activities long past. Author Adolph Caso, in his latest book, The Straw Obelisk, highlights a story of one fascinating tradition, still held annually in Italy, and includes pictures of the young boy he once was, his family, and those taken at the 1994 \\"feast.\\" This book in unique. There is a love story. There is the tale of a long-time tradition, but there is also an unusual epilogue.First the love story! Samuel is a young man whose forthcoming arrival after the war is to be spread via an old woman who rides a bicycle to each home...a messenger who must deliver the job of homecoming or the sorrow of death. For just a moment each time she travels through the small village, she is the most important person living there. This time her news is happy as she shares with his mother that Samuel will soon be home.While happy her son is coming home safe, the news brings disruption and heartache as well to Maria, for Samuel's sister, Lucia, has borne a child outside of marriage and to a married man. Their fear of Samuel's temper when he hears of this disgrace to the family is so severe that Lucia immediately leaves her home. Anticipation of Samuel's homecoming spreads through the gossip and sharing common everywhere. However, the fear and pain experienced in the war has changed Samuel, so much so that he immediately goes to Lucia and brings her home to be once again together with her family.He also goes to find his former girlfriend, Franca, wondering and hoping that she still loves him, but also afraid that she does. While Samuel knows he is seriously ill, he nevertheless finds his love and is with her as much as is permitted within the community's environment--which is not often. The story, of life during the early '40's is slow, and you realize it is reflective of how we would have lived at that time.Samuel's change, though sometimes strange, as when anybody mentions God--and you feel as if he has been transported back into the midst of the war--is beneficial to the entire community, as his strange, new loving nature influences others. The culmination of his success is shown when he is selected as the lead man in the annual transport of the tall, intricately detailed structure with the face of the Madonna.My mind tried to create a vision of this activity--where six men and six bulls, along with hundreds of villagers, move the Obelisk as it first was moved. The only thing that comes close for me is the annual parades where large balloons come down the streets in front of department stores. How much more thrilling this trek must be!Learning of Samuel's illness, gentle Lucia seduces Samuel, but alas, the story ends...and we learn only in the epilogue that records seem to indicate that she had a still-born baby and died soon after. Samuel died from consumption.Now for the unusual epilogue, I need to quote it:\\"The Straw Obelisk is a metaphor for peace. Because it is also the product of man, the army tank is a metaphor for war.The plot of The Straw Obelisk is the struggle between good and evil. When men's efforts are expended on behalf of good, the result is an obelisk of straw as enduring as one of granite; when men's efforts are expended on behalf of evil, the result is a tank as obsolete as rust itself...\\"This book forces the reader to reconsider our lives, our traditions, good and evil. It moves slowly--to allow its impression to be made, for memory of the story will also be slow in leaving your mind."},{"Title":"The Straw Obelisk: A World War II Novel","review":"Reviewing fiction books is harder than non-fiction in that non-fiction is usually a true story or stories, that is why reviewing this book was more difficult than others. Caso's style is good and he has captured the feeling of the times with The Straw Obelisk.The book is set during World War II, where a young soldier named Samuele is coming home to completely transformed by the war. His attitudes about life and people have changed and Samuele must bring the Obelisk to the village.For most of the book the story is easy to follow, however there was some confusion during the reading. I got lost when a woman is killed and Samuele goes from trying to solve a crime to getting the obelisk to the village.The book finishes nicely and leaves you satisfied. I was impressed by the author's amazing detail of Italy during the war, which adds much to the overall storyline. While the book was published in 1995, it would still make a good read."},{"Title":"Aspirations of the world: A chain of opals","review":"I wanted a printed copy of this book and thought requesting it in this format would be great, especially with the website for other free online books.

I took a class in French Canadian literature and this novel was part of the reading list. If you are reading the novel in French. It is a hard read. It is easy to get lost with the story because Anne Herbert switches from the third person plural to the first person singular.That being said, the novel is quite intriguing. It is a story of love. A story of deception and a story of guilt. The main character, Elisabeth D'Aulni&egrave;res conspires with her lover to kill her husband, Achille Tache. She does not kill him by herself. Her lover the American doctor George Nelson does the dirty work for her. After killing Tache, Nelson flees from Canada. He is found in Burlington, but he is never extradited to Canada for the murder.

I was excited about a book that explores this racial mix. After reading this book I was really insulted. The female character is a stereotype even though she is a doctor. She has attitude for days and explodes for no reason. The more insulting part is that the character is only seen as beautiful because of her white heritage. This is expected coming from a white author. It is impossible for a non black author to write about a Black women's experiences and feeling (fiction and non) because they can and will never understand.Don't waste your time and money on this book or the other one she wrote (Ebony Eyes)."},{"Title":"A Drummer's Beat to Mend (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I liked this story, it is rare to find a love story about an African American woman and Japanese man or any ethnic group of Indian or Oriental (is that the right word?) background. But being a black woman myself I find that making the woman as eurocentric beauty wiseas possible irritating, the references to hair due to her white ancestor, (a lot of black people in the Western world due to slavery whether rape or consenual sex had a white ancestor nothing to boast about in my opinion) the fact Tetsu was attracted to her hair waves rather than the fact she had'traditional' black hair. I am not sure if the author is white or a mixed race (black with white) woman but the 'good hair' analogy which as black people we need to get over is sad to see in such a story. The fact that Mckenna being an educated doctor of thirty something acted so childish, she runs away rather than face a good bye, she does not tell him something that happens to her that he needs to know. However the Japanese culture comes through in a positive way.

It had to be destiny when a freak accident brought them together and East met West. For it soon became apparent that McKenna would find her heart being brought back to life as gently as the delicate surgery she practiced to repair Tetsuro's hand in bringing back the beat to his life.--- I loved this story which I found to be both an original and absolutely mesmerizing read. I was totally caught up in the Japanese traditions, the background of the taiko drumming, and especially in the gentle and honorable portrayal the author used in the characterization of Tetsuro who also harbored his own heartbreak of loss. MacKenna was also created beautifully and endearingly as a highly intelligent African American woman, a gifted physician whose personal life harbored all the emotional heartbreak of having loved and lost quite fiercely and finally the joy in finding such an understanding and wonderful man who believed in her and wouldn't let her down. Secondary characters were brought into play with just enough storyline to enhance the main story thereby making this a very smoothly written and memorable novel. I also found this to be a deeply sensual read written with some simmering physical encounters, depicting a slow and sensual dance that enhanced the romantic aspect so much more than just the physical, which was nothing to sneeze at, and was depicted very well indeed.

Also, I'm not sure if the author is black or white, but McKenna makes some comment about being happy to have a white grandparent because it gave her soft manageable hair. WHAT!!!! What kinda crazyness is that????

Most of the characters in I/R novels tend to react the same way every time, but not these characters. I also liked the contrast of the African American and Japanese cultures.

The author also brushed over issues that needed further development such as McKenna's relationship with her ex-husband. McKenna's relationship with her family was too soap-opera like: overdramatic/unrealistic. SPOILER ALERT: Another pet peeve for me was the fact that when McKenna miscarried she didn't even inform Tetsu, for a reason, that was in my opinion, not strong enough.

This is a must have for your interracial romance collection."},{"Title":"A Drummer's Beat to Mend (Love Spectrum Romance)","review":"I am personally one who appreciates competent writing and I think Ms. Swanson is definitely a great writer. I think she did a good job with developing her characters and plot in this book.I did have an issue with two things:1) I found this book through someone's listing of interracial romance books. To be honest, as someone who has read (and loved) romance novels since I was 12 (now I'm 34), this book is not one that I would consider \\"romance,\\" as say, a Johanna Lindsay or Beverly Jenkins book. Rather, it seemed so much more formal than that, as if it were a novel, say like \\"The Thornbirds\\" (can't think of anything else at the moment), with elements of romance in it. For me personally, in terms of the types of books I seek to purchase, the element of a book being a romance novel is more desirable to me than a book that is a novel with romance. It's as if the romance piece were an afterthought, not the central theme of the book. Again, this is what I seek in a book and why I purchased it. Although I think Ms. Swanson is an excellent writer and the book is well written, I honestly wouldn't have gotten this book, knowing what I know now. I don't really feel it should be advertised as romance, but that's my personal opinion. After all, I think John Grisham is a great writer, also. But I wouldn't go out and purchase his books, because I'm not into the genre of his novels.2) As another reviewer stated, I don't know Ms. Swanson's heritage, but I did take exception to the \\"exaltation\\" of the character's hair and the \\"White\\" ancestry bit. It reeked of the good hair-bad hair, slave mentality too much to me. While I am okay with \\"describing\\" hair as straight, wavy, kinky, etc., I think adding a \\"ranking\\" of or giving \\"status\\" placement of hair is a regression to me. THAT element in the story was a HUGE turn-off for me and I think it was really hard for me to connect to and really care for the heroine thereafter."},{"Title":"From Trials to Triumph","review":"As an author and former owner of 6 Christian bookstores for 20 years I have read many books. Connie Cenac's book From Trials to Triumph is certainly at the top. It's not only informative, but life changing. She is brutally honest and transparent in revealing her heart amidst her trials. But watching God show up because of her relentless faith in Him, will blow you away! God will be bigger than ever after reading this comfortable read. It's like she's sharing these incredable stories in you living room, its just that your back won't hit the back of the chair, clinging to every word! Thanks Connie for the challenge of desiring...\\"Great Faith\\" in a \\"Big God\\"!"},{"Title":"From Trials to Triumph","review":"With \\"From Trials To Triumph,\\" Connie Cenac has emerged as a fresh voice for dealing with the pains of life, whether caused by others or ourselves. Most authors are not as open about their own foibles and the way others have injured them as Cenac is. At first, her candor is a bit startling--but soon I realized that she could not help others without being completely truthful about how she brought herself out of trouble and into a life that basks in the love of Christ. Cenac addresses the mistakes and sins that can either tear us down or grow us closer to God, as we realize how much we need Him, how far we fall from His glory, and how sufficient His grace is to restore us and make us better people. I highly recommend this book, for its honesty and the many practical suggestions Cenac offers to help us do just what the title says."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"This book presents the history of this country in a surprisingly thorough manner for a shorter history book. The struggles and strife of a people and a country are excellently portrayed with clarity and a hint at the emotions they must have felt. The struggle to protect the borders of the land from powerful enemies coming from all directions provides an interesting theme which kept me reading. I was also emotionally touched by the bravery of these people in defying Hitler and refusing to send Jews to their deaths during WWII.I was inspired to begin learning in more detail about periods and events in Bulgarian History."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"Bulgaria is a little-known but fascinating country that has labored for years in obscurity. It has always been behind some Curtain--the Iron Curtain for four decades, the Ottoman Curtain for five centuries, and Byzantium before that. Until now, there have been only a handful of scholarly books on the country, and these have been on narrow periods or topics. There hasn't been a book that would allow an educated reader to get a grasp of the country as a whole. Now there is. This book, by a noted Oxford scholar, is clear, concise, and yet reasonably short. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"I found this book to be a good coverage of the subject matter, starting mainly about 600 AD and moving forward. I found the subject matter to be very interesting, partly because I knew so little about Bulgaria. Reading this book enhances my understanding of Greek, Serbian, and Turkish history (such as it is). This is an area left out of my earlier education, and this book does of good job of efficiently relating the broad sweep of Bulgarian history. At times I felt the book might have benefited from a more in depth discussion of the contemporary economic, intellectual, or cultural context bearing on certain events or trends. On the other hand, the author does not get bogged down in interesting trivia. The author does a good job of relating the main events in Bulgaria of the past 1400 years, and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"This is an excellent book that serves its stated purpose. Most shortcomings are related to the impossibility of summing up 1400 years of history in less than 300 pages. My main qualms are (1) that the emergence of the \\"Macedonian Question\\" is not elaborated clearly enough; and (2) that for a book that continuously (and rightly) underscores the theme of territorial frustration in Bulgarian history, the maps are absolutely useless. To fill in this deficiency, I would direct the reader to the excellent _Palgrave Concise Historical Atlas of Eastern Europe_ by Dennis Hupchick and Harold Cox. They also produced a similar atlas of the Balkans. Either would work to clarify the myriad territorial complexities of Eastern European and Balkan history."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"This is a thorough basic history of Bulgaria. It covers every major topic and most important events but does not spend too much time on any one event. It also does not bog you down with frivolous details.

I was also hoping for some more details on the early Khans."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"I have no problem with the content with this book but the Kindle version is horrible.

I would request a refund but I don't have time right now to wait for a printed version."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"In the preface, Crampton warns of his insistence that his own students follow a policy of \\"brevity\\". Crampton can never be accused of hypocrosy, as this book takes brevity to an extreme. Concepts are intimated, but go undeveloped. Themes are introduced, repeatedly referred to, but never fully explained. Another reviewer stated the book fails to sufficiently elaborate on the Macedonian question, and I couldn't agree more.My background is in Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, etc). As a speaker of Bulgarian, I was very excited to read this book and to learn more about the country. I ended up being very disappointed because the author's text is too concise. It ends up being vague.

Although embroiled in wars, external occupations and internal strife for much of its history; a rich and diverse cultural heritage has remained intact throughout Bulgaria.

This book serves the purpose of those trying to find out a little about this ancient country in the Balkan peninsula. Bulgaria has friendly people, lots of history, and possibly a good future. This book tries to summarize the past thousand years of history with an overview. As one of the previous reviewers have already noted, the Ottoman decades have not been covered in great detail, so readers may need to look elsewhere for this information. Altogether, this is an informative read for those trying to learn about this country and its people.This references a 1996 edition, and I think great changes have happened recently with this country. An updated edition would be nice."},{"Title":"A Concise History of Bulgaria (Cambridge Concise Histories)","review":"You have to really want to learn about early Bulgarian history to enjoy this book.

However, I am traveling to Bulgaria this summer & after reviewing two of the more popular books on the Balkans, I opted to start with this one because other reviewers were less likely to accuse the author of have an \\"agenda.\\" (e.g., read the reviews of Balkan Ghosts).

It is very helpful that the book can be read with different historical time periods in mind.

These chapters are useful for discovering sources for researching folklore in Arkansas. The remaining chapters explore topics such as traditional music, storytelling, folk belief, vernacular architecture, foodways, and festivals that are characteristic of Arkansas's traditional culture. The writing is rich and compelling, and the book provides a clear idea of distinctive forms of folklore from the state. The chapter on folk music in Arkansas is especially good, and the discussion of genres and musicians from the Arkansas provides a fine introduction to the topic of traditional music in general. Arkansas, in particular, has a rich legacy of important contributions to American folk music, and the thorough discussion of Arkansans' contributions to old-time, blues, gospel, and country music is remarkable.

One published in the USA, the other in the UK."},{"Title":"Ghost Riders: Travels with American Nomads","review":"Fascinating analysis of nomadism in its historical context, focusing on the Native American Plains Indians during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Loaded with well-researched anecdotes of the interaction between \\"mountain men,\\" trappers, traders, French, Indians, pioneers, etc., some of which serve to contradict much of today's commonly accepted theories of, for instance, what motivated such restless spirits as Daniel Boone and Sam Houston. Historic locations are compared to what is seen first-hand, through the author's observations as he explores the sites. Woven into this historical overview are the stories of contemporary nomads he encounters at truckstops, bars and on the road. A very thought-provoking book, it makes me reflect both on why we choose to live in cities, towns or groupings in our sedentary life-styles, with our rigorous routines, and what freedoms we have sacrificed."},{"Title":"Ghost Riders: Travels with American Nomads","review":"Ok, I got Ghost Riders, In English, In good time.Thanks, Happy with this, Jeff."},{"Title":"Joseph Cornell","review":"If you seen the work of Joseph Cornell before and loved it then you will find much to learn from in this book. But, I'm not sure readers encountering Cornell for the first time through this book will be won over. The detailed text by McShine is thorough, covering his life, his surrealist box constructions, collages and cinema. A huge amount of his work is reproduced, and an extensive bibliography are included. However, most of the plates are in black and white, with only a handful of colour photographs of his work. Moreover, the photographs of his work lack depth, so the three-dimensional tactile qualities of his enigmatic box constructions are lost. Perhaps these qualities would be difficult to convey in any photographs. So, it is not the perfect Joseph Cornell book.

The legend has it that after King Philippe the Fair (Philippe Le Beau) disbanded (and destroyed) the Order of the Templars, their Master, Jacques Molais, cursed Philippe and his seed as he was burned at the stake. At the time of the curse, Philippe was in great health and had three grown sons. Less than a quarter of a century later, the Kapetians ceded the throne to their cousins Valois--for the lack of male issue to take up the throne and the inability of female issue to do so (prior to Philippe's death, a woman could techincally rule France). What happened? That is precisely the subject of Les Rois Maudits--and the first book deals with the family from the last months of Philippe's reign and until the ascention of his oldest son, Louis X.I read this book in one day. I was awed by the characters, particularly Philippe and his gorgeous daughter Isabelle, Queen of England (remember Braveheart--the pretty French princess?), and of course, Robert D'Artois and his evil cousin Magot. The only problem with it is that it definitely leaves you hanging in the end, simply making you go and read the second book--the Prisoner of Chateau Gayard.I would highly recommend it--it is gripping, well-written, historically accurate."},{"Title":"The Iron King (Accursed kings)","review":"If you are looking for a book that would be rewarding to read in the original French, you could not do better than &quot;Le Roi de Fer,&quot; first in a 7-volume sequence, &quot;Les Rois Maudits,&quot; or &quot;The Accursed Kings.&quot; Read it in translation if necessary. Philip the Fair, no pretty boy but a strong monarch, stamps out the Knights Templars and is cursed by DeMolay (their chief) when he burns him at the stake. The curse seems to be working, as poisoning, strangling, the forced election of a Pope, and the beginnings of the Hundred Years' War are described in one dramatic scene after another. Sex is handled far more adroitly than in most historical novels; Nevin's &quot;1812&quot; seems almost crude by comparison. We get the flavor of fourteenth-century life, but subtly, not forced down our throats. Continuity is achieved when characters reappear after absence.

The Iron King is the first of his series of seven novels about the French dynastic struggles that led to the Hundred Years War, collectively known as \\"The Accursed Kings\\".Druon's writing is translated to English, and thus may be influenced a great deal (albeit unintentionally) by the translator. With that caveat, the writing is direct and accessible, with forceful imagery and action. Druon takes great care to keep the various characters easily distinguishable to his readers, and thus avoids the confusion of too many similiar names or titles.The Iron King is Phillip IV, \\"The Fair\\" (as in \\"handsome\\") who is the French king responsible for the dissolution of the Templar order.

I have also come to find out that this is not the only book that Mr. Foster has written. He has been quite prolific, and is very, very well known in certain circles.J. Edgar Hoover, I have no doubt, had a very extensive file on William Z. Foster. Mr. Hoover, I'm sure, has Mr. Foster listed as a top ten American Scumbag of all time. But in reading the biography of the now deceased J. Edgar Hoover, I find that it becomes more difficult determining top American Scumbags as the years roll by. Yesterday's hero may be today scumbag and yesterday scumbag may become one of today's heroes. From what I have read so far on these two men, I am more attracted to Mr. Foster than to Mr. Hoover.\\"Pages from a Worker's Life\\" was great.

He also goes on to talk about what an efficient and humane system the gulags were in rehabbing prisoners and building up Russia. The US communist party chapter gives a distorted view of the party's history and certain members of it.With that said most of the book was interesting, particularly the sections on his life as a sailor. Foster worked many jobs in his life and it's enjoyable reading about jobs one has no experience with and horrifying to read about the conditions back then. The parts on hoboing are also worth reading. Parts of this book are reminiscent of You Can't Win by Jack Black. There are a few humorous parts, such as his passing reference to the sexual perversity of shepherds.

There are 18 chapters, and the first four deals with General Relativity and the remaining chapters discuss physics and cosmology of black holes. Since the book was published in 1977; some discussion about black holes is old and outdated, but the introduction to general relativity is pretty good.Einstein revolutionized classical thought in physics by proposing special theory of relativity which stated that speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant. In other words the speed of light does not depend on the state of the observer. Special theory of relativity comprises a set of equations called Lorentz transformations. These equations tell us how various things appear to different observers moving relative to each other. The moving clocks slowdown according to stationary observers; this is called time dilation. Time dilation depends on the speed of the moving clock. Moving rulers (distance measuring devices) shrink, and shrinkage increases with the speed of the observer; this is called Fitzgerald contraction. The mass of a moving object increase with increasing speed of the observer: Thus special theory of relativity precludes reaching the speed of light because it increases the mass, dilating time or contraction of the rulers. The Lorentz law of covariance states that the laws of physics are same to all observers and they do not depend on the motion of the observers. But the physical reality described by the quantities such as mass, time, and length is not the same to all observers. The amount of time that elapses between two events in the four dimensional spacetime is the same for all observers and hence it is said to be Lorentz invariant. But different observers moving relative to each other may disagree on specific distances or time measurements but the total interval remains same for all.In relativity, a small region of space (locality) does not distinguish between gravitation and acceleration, and the idea that gravity is a force is invalid. Special theory of relativity applies to accelerated systems although some mistakenly believe that it does not, but it is restricted to flat spacetime (away from gravitational field). If we assume the spacetime is curved in the gravitational field then the distortion of the geometry of spacetime would be regarded as gravitational field. The Riemann curvature tensor and Ricci tensor derived from Riemann curvature tensor would tell how much space-time is curved by the gravitational field of an object. That is how spacetime above sun or earth has warped, but it does not tell in which direction the earth moves around sun. Einstein made a simple assumption that a planet moves along the shortest path in warped spacetime called geodesic. This is the generalization of the concept of straight line in a flat space.Chapter 11 and 12 gives clear description for writing Penrose diagrams for space trips to Kerr black holes. Chapter 10 for nonrotating black holes and Chapter 11 for charged black holes. The construction of Penrose diagram for a rotating black hole is described very clearly on pages 183-185 and 185 shows how two diagrams could be combined to form a complete Penrose diagram for a rotating black hole. For the simples black hole containing only mass (Schwarzschild black hole); there is one other universe besides our own. This universe cannot be reached because the singularity is spacelike. When black holes are charged (Reissner-Nordstrom black hole) or have a rotation (Kerr black hole); the singularity is timelike and can be reached; they connect to an infinite number of universes. The gravitational field surrounding the black hole is a potential barrier that prevents anything from getting out of the hole. The massive black holes have fields extending over a large distance and the barrier is correspondingly big and strong. The possibility of mass loss through quantum tunneling is minimal. Since matter is not lost from massive black holes; their temperatures are close to absolute zero, and the Hawking radiation loss is insignificant. For smaller black holes, the gravitational field exists over a small distance and potential barrier is thin, matter could be lost due to quantum mechanical tunneling via particle and antiparticle created by energy conversion. Therefore the black holes behave like white holes. Some physicists now believe that for an outside observer, objects falling into a black hole would appear to take an infinite amount of time to reach the event horizon, due to gravitational red shift, so no information is lost, and the black hole would dissipate via Hawking radiation before an event horizon would ever form. In 2004, Hawking conceded that the black holes eventually transmit back information in a garbled form.There are some inaccuracies in book; the Chandrasekhar Limit, the maximum nonrotating mass that can support against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure is about 1.4 solar masses, and not 1.25; and the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years and not 18 billion (outdated figure). Experimental tools to be used for black hole detection in the cosmos are also inaccurately stated. Although black holes cannot be detected directly, many observational studies have provided substantial evidence for black holes."},{"Title":"Bible Difficulties","review":"William Arndt (1880-1957) was a professor of Hermeneutics and New Testament Exegesis at Concordia Seminary when he wrote this book.He has chapters on \\"Some General Considerations,\\" \\"The Miracles of the Bible\\" (e.g., \\"Jesus Not Performing Miracles in Nazareth\\"); \\"Moral Difficulties\\" (e.g., \\"'Impure' Stories,\\" \\"the so-called Imprecatory Psalms\\"); \\"Historical Difficulties\\" (e.g., \\"Darius the Median\\"); \\"Difficulties from the Point of View of Science\\" (e.g., \\"Joshua Bidding the Sun to Stand Still\\"); and \\"Miscellaneous Passages\\" (e.g., \\"Satan in the Book of Job\\").He concludes on the note, \\"Wherever the solutions submitted seem insufficient, we can confidently look forward to further research to furnish the desired light, thinking of the many instances in which during the past patient study, explorations, and excavations have brought us the knowledge that was needed to remove the clouds obscuring certain texts.\\"While not as comprehensive as, say, more recent books like Norman Geisler'sWhen Critics Ask: A Popular Handbook on Bible Difficultiesor Gleason Archer'sNew International Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties, Arndt's explanations are often more detailed, and interesting in themselves.Arndt's later (1955) book,Does the Bible Contradict Itself?: A Discussion of Alleged Contradictions in the Bible, will also be of interest to readers of this book."},{"Title":"Learn to Speak Tibetan and Hindi","review":"thought it would tell me how to read the hindi or learn the alphabet, vowels and so on.It doesn't; it just shows you how to say it in phonetics; so when there is something over the letter k I have no idea how to say it; like two half circles."},{"Title":"Screeno: Stories & Poems","review":"Sometimes with the legend, we forget how great the work is.

I expected a dish full of stones and instead found I have a plastic cup (a little smaller in width than a cola can) with 5 small stones in it. It looks rather silly, since the cup can hold many more stones than the 5 mine came with. They don't even cover the bottom of the cup. The pump is rather amusing too. Sometimes one squeeze will bring a little bubble of air to the surface, and sometimes it will shoot out and splash around the cup. It's actually fairly entertaining, but I've also made a pretty big mess on my desk. The pump has a hole in the bellows part, and I found that if I suck the water through that and then squeeze the bellows the pond continues to bubble for a while. Unfortunately that didn't work for long because the last time I tried it squeezing the bellows shot all the water out of the wrong end of the pump and right up my nose. This is getting more entertaining by the minute. I recommend this if you are looking for an unusual addition to your desk and don't mind the mess. You might want to add your own stones, though to make it look more like a water garden."},{"Title":"MINI WATER GARDEN KIT","review":"The cover says &quot;...everything necessary to recreate the relaxing sound of rippling water wherever it's most needed, whether at home, at work, or on the road.&quot; Like the other reviewer, I was unimpressed by this &quot;water garden&quot;.

Boy was I wrong. I survived chapters 2, 3, 4 etc. No, I won't take you step-by-step through all of them. When Merlin got back to his cave, things became so incredibly boring I could not bear to go on. Besides that, this book would focus more on the *Arthur* myth, and Arthur is, to me, the most boring character in Arthurian legend (tragic, isn't it?). Give me Morgan le Fay or Gawain over him any day. Now, for a book on this subject, &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; is superb. But for a sequel to the breathtaking &quot;Crystal Cave&quot;... Middling. Average. Also... Understand that I've been able to pull through the boring moments in &quot;Mists&quot; and the wordiest historical novels one would ever lay eyes on.Oh well.

I soon found, however, that Mary Stewart's book &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; far outdoes &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot;. Though both books follow the legend of Arthur fairly well &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; has more action and the ending is much more satisfying. &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; continues right from where &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot; leaves off. The main character is the powerful and wise sorcerer, Merlin. The book follows his struggle raising the young Arthur and helping Arthur rise to the position of High King of all Britain. All throughout this there are spies and bounty hunters hired to kill Arthur before he reaches the age he can claim the crown. This book shows a unique view on the Arthurian legends. Instead of following a knight of the round table or the king himself, as in many of the books about King Arthur, it follows a character who appears in most every legend about the infamous King. This book gives Merlin's perspective on all of the events that made King Arthur's life into legend. The book follows Arthurian legend well. Of course, there can be no story that perfectly follows the legend because there are thousands and thousands of legends pertaining to King Arthur. Even though they cannot be all represented in a single interpretation, &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; follows as many of them as possible without contradicting itself. I does, however, go against some of the more well known legends such as the origin of Excalibur. Mary Stewart is an incredible writer. She describes everything very well without becoming annoyingly detailed. The world that she creates for this book is beautifully sculpted with her masterfully chosen words. All of her characters come alive when reading the book. Unfortunately, the beautiful setting which Mary Stewart uses for this book is not a very realistic representation of Medieval ages. The threat of starvation and disease that ran rampant in those times isn't very well represented. Though the book starts off a little bit slow, after it catches the reader up with the events from the first book, &quot;The Crystal Cave&quot;, it quickly speeds up. Mary Stewart uses suspense to keep her readers interested. The suspense also makes the book hard to put down, which is a good attribute for a book. I picked up this book and read through all 436 pages in less than a week. There are simply no good places to put the book down at. The ending leaves the reader satisfied but still wanting to read more. Mary Stewart leaves it so that there can be a sequel but can be read as an individual book and still be appreciated for its full value. The reader looses very little by not reading the other books but still gains very much by reading the others. &quot;The Hollow Hills&quot; is an excellent book about a very interesting time in history. It's a fast paced book and is full of action and suspense. I would gladly recommend this book to anyone who has the slightest interest in King Arthur. I can't wait to read the other two books in the series."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"A long time ago, I read Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy, which consists of three books: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, and The Last Enchantment. I had last read the trilogy back in the mid-1980s, back when I was in high school. So, recently I turned back to these old favorites, and found myself enjoying the tale once again.Here's a brief background of the story, without spoiling it too much for potential readers. England is suffering under fractured leadership following the departure of the Romans, some time before. England is broken up into several small kingdoms, with a High King to hold them all together, and to try to repell the Saxon threat already encamped on the shores. Into this time, Merlin is born, the bastard child of a local princess. The trilogy tells the tale of his life.In the first book, Merlin is first a small boy in Wales, where he finds his tutor in magic and the gods and medicine, and is touched by the prophecy which will shape his whole life's work. He flees Wales, for his own protection, and his subsequent actions inexorably lead to the conception of a child: Arthur, the future High King.In the second book, Merlin is charged by both the High King, Uthur, and his god to keep Arthur in his care, and to train him for his coming challenges. The story closes with Arthur assuming the mantle of leadership, following the passing of Uthur.In the third book, Arthur and Merlin work to end the Saxon threat, found Camelot, and close with Merlin's final destiny, as he had long since foreseen...almost.The tale is told in the first person: Merlin. In this fashion, the story feels personal in a way that few other Arthurian fantasies ever have. Merlin, the character, is a sympathetic one: he has good in his heart, he looks after his mission in life with care and humility, and he certainly doesn't buy into this \\"Merlin the Enchanter\\" crap circulating about England...though he's not above using it to his benefit from time to time. The other characters in the story are also fleshed out with care...and the characters are certainly not one-dimensional or static.The storyline is clearly grounded in historical \\"facts\\", as much as possible. Clearly Mary Stewart put some time into research, before beginning the writing of this tale.The writing style is very descriptive. In some novels, the description is somewhat threadbare, willing the reader to fill in the look of the setting to some extent with their own imagination. It's a perfectly valid writing style, and I've enjoyed many books written with that style. Here, however, Mary Stewart has sought to ground us, again, in a historical setting, and she puts a lot of attention into describing the setting so as to help with that grounding process. It's very effective.So, with the close of the tale, I feel somewhat saddened. Merlin became like a friend. So, I encourage other readers to pick up the challenge, and read the Merlin Trilogy, so you can be touched in this way also."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"It's not uncommon for the middle volume of a trilogy -- the \\"bridge\\" -- to be the weakest of the three, but that's certainly not the case here. The story picks up less than an hour after the end of the first volume, The Crystal Cave, with Merlin having ensured Uther's night of lust with Queen Ygraine of Cornwall and the conception of Arthur, the once and future king (i.e., the \\"new Ambrosius\\"). Much of the narrative is taken up with Merlin waiting. First, waiting for the child's birth (while being on the outs with Uther), then waiting for the beginning of his guardianship (when Uther becomes more realistic), then waiting while Arthur spends his infancy in Brittany (during which Merlin hits the road to the ancient lands of the Near East), then a long period of waiting while the boy grows up in the care of Count Ector (and he himself becomes the hermit of the Chapel in the Green). Along the way, he acquires the sword of the Emperor Maximus and tucks it away on a sacred island in a lake, knowing Arthur will recover it himself in good time. And, of course, the waiting ends with Arthur being hailed as High King at age fourteen, minutes after his presentation to the lesser kings and his father's sudden death at a victory dinner. The pacing is a bit slower, but there's a strong sense of inevitability, both for Merlin and for the reader. Stewart's amazingly sensitive and evocative descriptive powers are strong as ever. One of my favorite lines, on why you should never take the favor of the gods for granted: \\"The gods like the taste of salt; the sweat of human effort is the savour of their sacrifices.\\" Marvelous stuff."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"This book, from the beginning was a bit scary. I say scary in the fact that it is a very thick book. I did not let that stop me, and a beautiful story unfolded before me. It is true that this story has a slow beginning, but if you hang in there you won't want to put the book down. The setting, the characters, the whole meat of this book is will draw you the reader so into the book that you will find it hard to put the book down. I personally love fantasy books. If you don't, after this one maybe you'll reconsider. Basically we get to watch how merlin handles the task of raising the soon to be king Arthur. There are many tasks and obstacles that merlin and his apprentice must overcome. It comes to an action-packed conclusion that you should not miss. Take my word for it and read thisa book. Like I said, it starts off slow but it will go 90mph as soon as you reach the second part of the book."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I was on a Caribbean cruise when I read this book.

Add it to your library now!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"If this second book in Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy isn't a page-turner, I don't know what is. I mean this in a very good sense. Yes, the suspense is an important factor, but it is the, well, ensorcelling, character of Merlin that keeps the reader glued to the pages. Even when the world's eyes are on the young King Arthur towards the end, the reader's mind and heart are still with this version of Merlin that Stewart has conjured up - so to speak; For she has imbued this Merlin with an inner life as well as her own poetic sensibilities.Readers of medieval romances will be attracted to the work, of course, but so will lovers of the poetic and those concerned with the inner life. I shall let Merlin's spell fall on the reader here in his own words:\\"It is one thing to have the gift of seeing the spirits and hearing the gods move about us as we come and go; but it is a gift of darkness as well as light....One cannot be visited by the future without being haunted by the past; one cannot taste comfort and glory without the bitter sting and fury of one's past deeds.\\"Further,\\"To remember love after long sleep; to turn again to poetry after a year in the market place, or to youth after drowsy and stiffening age; to remember what once you thought life could hold, after telling over with and calculating fingers what it has offered; this is music, made after long silence.\\"I'm too spellbound myself to give this book less than five swirling stars."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"As always Mary Stewart is a great story teller and \\"The Hollow Hills\\" is a must in the Merlin series of 3 books with \\"Crystal Cave\\" the first, Hollow the second and the final one, \\"The Last Enchantment.\\"Stuart did get bogged down a bit with too much descriptive language of the forest, lake or whatever. Skimmed that when grew tired of it and it did not lend itself in my opinion to the story line.Despite purchasing the used book that was stated as in \\"good\\" condition, the paperback (Hollow) book literally fell apart in my hands. It was interesting reading in clumps of pages. I wish I had noted the seller's name. Not sure how to give negative feedback for that vendor. The other 2 used books were in excellent condition.A word of advice to young families. This series, especially \\"The Crystal Cave\\" is a great introductory work for pre-teens or teenagers who admire, mystical, magical, noble and courageous European characters in a 5th century setting. I read Crystal myself as a young woman and did not know about the following books until now.A big \\"Thumbs up\\" for all 3 books!!!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"This is the middle story in Mary Stewart's Merlin Trilogy and, while it is good, it is impossible to say that it is as good as The Crystal Cave. Perhaps this is just because that not much happens in this part of the Arthurian saga. The events in this story concern what happens to young Arthur before coming king - in other words, it covers the same ground as The Sword in the Stone, but it is less fun.The action picks up with Merlin taking the newborn Arthur away from his parents, Uther and Ygraine, at Tintagel. He then deposits him with Sir Ector and goes off on a trip to Europe. The main invention of this novel is how Mary Stewart comes up with a different version of the Excalibur story (here referred to as Caliburn). In a manner of speaking, Arthur does take the sword from the stone, but not in the way you'd expect.This book made me want to read the next one - perhaps because I know in the next one, more things will actually happen. This episode is kind of laid back and inert."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"Following on from the spell binding The Crystal Cave Mary Stewart came up with an equally enthralling page turner taking us from the morning after Arthur's conception until he is proclaimed King of Britain at fourteen, on the day after of the death of his father Uther Pendragon. It shows us the story through the eyes of a very human, brilliantly intelligent, resourceful, and wise Merlin with powers of enchantment. Merlin is takes to oversee Arthur's childhood where he is been placed under the care of Count Ector of Galava (modern day Ambleside in Cumbria, Northern England)where Artuhr grows up with his foster brother Cei, and his loyal bosom friend Bedwyr.Filled with battles, chases, stand offs, melees and exciting journeys, it begins when Merlin is 22 years of age. Arthur has not een born through actual magic shape shifting as in the original legend ub th through disguise, subterfuge and trickery. The magic in this series is downplayed but not discarded and in Merlin's brilliant clairvoyance. Merlin go's into hiding after learning that Uther wants the child to be hidden until he has produced a 'legitimate' heir.He journeys across Europe where he discovers the existence of the sword Caliburn which is in Wales. He finds Caliburn in Wales and from there to the north of England where he becomes tutor to the young Arthur (Emrys) and Bedwyr.In Galava Merlin has a vision of the word guenwyvhar when he is with Arthur and Bedwyr, in the shape of an owl, which he foresses will come between the two boys with Bedwyr being figure that will be in the role of Lancelot.Merlin and the young Arthur plays a key role in the battle where the invading Saxons are once again rooted and forced to fleeOn the death of Uther who proclaims Arthur as his heir just moments before departing the world, Arthur's right to kingship is challenged until he returns to the Chapel and draws forth Caliburn as proof before the assembled nobilityA true spellbinding page-tuner in an amazing five part touer de force, combining history, folk-lore and imagination.

Stewart creates a fictional character named Ralph that the childhood of today's day and age can relate to. You follow Merlin's conquest through his trouble's and his trimphs until the very end of the book. It is suspenseful until the end, but doesn't give up then. It keeps you reading until the very last word. The only dislike that I have come to with this book is the fact that it is slow to get in to, but aren't the best understood books tht way? You must have a basis for what you are reading even if you haven't read the rest of the saga.

Yet I found myself skipping pages repeatedly. The plot in itself was interesting, mixing traditional arthurian legend with Stewart's own creativity. It is a powerful mix, but the potency is lost. Why? The passages are far too long, the descriptions uninteresting and repetitive.

The main character (Merlin) is interesting, however the supporting characters are not as much. This is a trilogy, but I have not decided if I will go on to read the last book, yet."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"The book was received quickly and it was in excellent shape. Well worth the price.Thanks!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I truly enjoyed The Crystal Cave (Book 1). This book, however, left me skipping pages trying to find a part of the story that was truly interesting again. The book takes an unusual look into the life of Merlin and the first 14 years of Arthur's life. Perhaps the boring nature of Merlin's travels far and wide, the introduction and exit of many minor characters and the still under-developed story of Arthur's childhood are the reasons that other authors have simply glossed over this section of the story. IT IS BORING. I finally found true interest in the last two sections of the book - an easy 250 pages in.Read the last section - when Arthur discovers his identity, Morgause begins her trechery, Lot attempts to usurp the boy king and Uthur dies - that's all you need to move onto book 3. The rest is filler at best."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter and was extremely upset that the outside edge of the pages was marked as if it were a discatd book.

It's about Merlin, with Arthur as a secondary character, but the reader is reminded why he gave the name to the legend.A must read!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I have read many books about the Arthurian legend. This book happens to be one of the best. Mary Stewart is a professional at capturing the essense of true English writing. She has proved herself the master of knowledge and unbidden storytelling with interesting characters and prose."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"This is a wonderful telling of the King Arthur legend from Merlin's point of view. Merlin is an engaging character who becomes more human through Ms. Stewart's literary skills. This is a long novel but quite worth your time. The pace picks up speed midway through the novel and moves quickly towards the conclusion. I enjoyed learning things about Arthur that T. H. White in the Once and Future King doesn't tell the reader. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"Amazing how Mary Stewart can set her fiction into the heart of 6th centry England.Merlin's life as Arthur's tutor was believeable-and it is also believeable what Arthur suspected about Merlin. This dispenses of the magic and tells the story of King Arthur as it could have happened."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"After reading &quot;The Crystal Cave,&quot; I immediately read &quot;The Hollow Hills.&quot; It is such an amazing story of Merlin's part in raising and bringing to Kinghood young Arthur. Beautifully written and described. Mary Stewart must have spent forever researching everything needed to write this mini-series! Not a detail of the legend is excluded."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I was given this book to read on a list for summer reading at my highschool and gladly recommend it to everyone. It wasn't too long and was very interesting and easy to read. If you like J.R.R Tolkien then pick up this book!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"Merlinus Ambrosius, gifted physician and enchanter is vividly brought to life in this historical fiction by Mary Stewart. The gift of this book is how Stewart &quot;humanizes&quot; all of the characters, she literally brings them to life right before our eyes and the results are unforgettable.This is a painstakingly detailed account of the pre Camelot legend from Merlin's prospective. There is no better telling of the rise of King Arthur, and you will have chills when you read Stewart's account of the how he pulled the sword from the stone. It's as if you are right there in the midst of the action. The entire book is mesmerizing!Every page is drenched in imagery and descriptive detail. Mary Stewart has a very sharp pen, and a strong command of the english language. She tells a fascinating and beautiful tale. Don't miss this one.Four stars because it moves slow, but is well worth your time.Cris"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"Some reviewers unaccountably didn't like this book, comparing it negatively to the other two in the \\"Merlin\\" trilogy of Mary Stewart. I thought it was excellent. It's just about as good as the thrilling first one--and better than the third.But they are all good novels, worth reading and rereading. And while you're at it, read her 4th Arthurian book, although it's not of the Merlin series, THE WICKED DAY, which takes Arthur and Mordred through to the end."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"I mention in my review ofThe Crystal Cave (The Arthurian Saga, Book 1)that fans ofJ.R.R. Tolkien Boxed Set (The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings)will, for the most part, enjoy this trilogy as well even though the magical element is much more subdued.This is my second reading of the work and I wanted to make the point that this book stands entirely on its own, (but you'll clearly be inspired to read the other two in the series.) Of course this particular book is the second of the trilogy.THE STORY: The focus here is as much on young Arthur (from his birth to age 14) as it is on Merlin, his sorcerer cousin. (Mary Stewart somehow managed to turn this one into a page-turner which is difficult to do with a \\"part two\\" of any three-part series.) Danger abounds for Arthur in this post-Roman era of English political turbulence so Merlin secures him away from the time of his birth. He is ultimately raised in a normal home in the wilds of the English forest, far from the royal house of his father, King Uther. But the time arises when Arthur must be informed of his royal heritage, (during a great war where King Uther takes on an army of Saxon and Germanic invaders.) Arthur is the heir apparent to the throne but he faces many formidable competitors before his coronation can become an actuality. It is here that the legendary sword Caliburn (later romanticized to \\"Excalibur\\") is revealed to Arthur.In Mary Stewart's version of the King Arthur allegory, the magic of Merlin is somewhat played down, a shrewd feature which lends notable credibility to the legend. The book runs about 300 pages in length and it doesn't lack for excitement, a very compelling saga.If you'd like to watch a sort of movie version,Merlin (Special Edition), you'll find it to be a fine film -- but I'd read the books first.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"Merlin, as the narrator of this tale, is an interesting and exciting voice to listen to. Although the action is small, when it appears it leaves you breathless in its wake. The Hollow Hills is a beautiful story, aimed at those who enjoy the history under the coming of Arthur. If you were captured by the detail of Tolkien, you will be likewise captured in Stewart's The Hollow Hills."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"This books was awesome!

Not only did this book tell the story of Merlin in a belivable way but it also told the story of his childhood and most Arthurian books don't do that.

If you didn't like it you obviously need to read it again."},{"Title":"Hollow Hills","review":"This book, part of an Artherian trilogy centered around Merlin, is a detailed description of the raising of young Arthur and Merlin's prime. Don't read this book if you don't like slow, pleasurable reading, because it is definately not for everyone. I am sad that people have insulted this series because of being forced to read it.

Otherwise, I find it a nice introduction to the work of Nostradamus. Just don't make it your only source about him."},{"Title":"The prophecies of Nostradamus","review":"Michel de Nostredame is perhaps indeed one of the most undisputed 'psychics' ever known to man. His reputation as a defied prophet, mainly in our modern times, is made much likely due to the many false interpretations of self-professed 'interpreters' to his prophecies - that when time shows their fallacies, it is Nostradamus' name who suffered in the result.Although not to the full extent of taking some high acclaim about her abilities to interpret Nostradamus' prophecies like the number of the other so-called interpreters -- Erika Cheetham is not too far being different from the number of these \\"Nostradamus experts\\"; her quatrain interpretations of Nostradamus' prophecies either lack accuracy or they miss out on some overlooked detail to further identify the intended meaning from Nostradamus' writings. Her commentaries on some of the verses interpreted are even at times self-confessionary in admitting to this.THE MAN WHO SAW TOMORROW however, may be good enough to fill in for other books in the study of Nostradamus' works; the author, along with a biographical chapter found in the introduction to this book on the life of Nostradamus, have provided commentaries on some of the Century Quatrains, and is quite impressive with her notes for the portions pertaining to Hitler, Queen Catherine, and Napoleon. (I don't buy much of the stuff about the over-rated Kennedys though).This book (which is the basis and companion to the film of the same title hosted by Orson Welles) contains all of Nostradamus' ten Century text writings with the authors' personal translations for each verse.But if you would like to save some of your time, watch the movie instead."},{"Title":"The prophecies of Nostradamus","review":"At a going market rate of one penny (plus postage of course) this book might be an investment you could consider. Anything significantly in excess of that - think twice. In fact there is a short preface by the editor, agreeably written and providing some basic background on the seer and his seeings. This is what has enabled me, after a brief struggle with my conscience, to award the second star. Apart from that, I could not get out of my mind an early address where Nostradamus practised what really does seem to have been effective social medicine during the plague in Toulouse. This address was the rue de la Triperie, and the image of tripe was one that I could not forget as I read on.There are 400-odd pages of this stuff, and of course the interpretations do not originate with the editor Erika Cheetham. Michel de Nostredame gained an early reputation as a prophet, and let me say before I start on the hermeneutics that his utterances are subjected to that I do not rule out the possibility that there may have been some substance to that reputation. I always remember what Arthur C Clarke said when musing on Childhood's End many years later - his interest in the paranormal had declined, but not all the phenomena can be bogus. However I'm in no doubt either that most of them are. Seers, prophets, shamans, swamis and whatnot occur in eras and in cultures where that kind of belief is common and indeed orthodox. The tradition lives on to the extent that people remain superstitious, and from certain visionaries, e.g. Frau Magda Goebbels, it can gain a new vigour and currency among those who seem to find in it predictions of what they would like to predict.There is even a special irony here. Nostradamus met, and for a time was friendly with the brilliant but quarrelsome Julius-Cesar Scaliger, father of the great classical scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger. The irony is that it was the younger Scaliger whose unaided brains first produced sense and intelligibility out of the corrupt MSS of the difficult astrological Latin epic the Astronomica of Manilius. To edit Manilius has since been seen as ascending the Mount Everest of textual criticism, something later achieved by first Bentley and then Housman, and it needs knowledge of astrology as well as knowledge of Latin. The towering intellects of Scaliger Bentley and Housman went about the matter in one way. Several centuries of human credulity have gone into explaining the texts of Nostradamus, and this is the tradition that Mrs Cheetham treats us to.You don't need to go far to see the method, though that is no word for it. \`La republique par gens nouveaux versee' is translated as \` The new republic will be troubled by its people.' The word for \`new' goes with the noun for \`people' in the French, not with the noun for \`republic'. Where does \`its' come from? The French does not say whether these are the republic's own people or foreigners. In the very next line \`jugeront' means \`will judge', not \`will rule', and \`a l'envers' more naturally means \`in different ways' than \`wrongly'. If I had read every page I would doubtless encounter more such examples, but I have found them on every page I have read. Why is \`serpens' supposed to come from some Greek word serpos, apparently meaning a shroud but unknown to Liddell and Scott's Lexicon? Surely it is simple Latin for \`serpent'? Again, why on earth should \`Hadrie' be some variant of Henri? It is much more likely the French for Hadrian, possibly abbreviated. It also takes special insight to get NATO out of the author's Arton.I shudder to think what Housman might have said. The whole process is the total negation of any sound scholarly method. It is just piling hypothesis on fantasy on wishful thinking. However the horrors I have been quoting are only details. We are simply not told by what process the various pronouncements are linked in the first place to the events and even the eras they supposedly refer to. I wonder why not, or rather I think I don't need to wonder. Nor should you expect any process of textual criticism and evaluation of the MSS readings. Scaliger, Gronovius, Heinsius, Bentley, Lachmann, Haupt, Madvig, Porson, Housman - you have not really lived and worked in vain, but you have as far as this kind of production is concerned. If, as seems likely, a lot of the interpretation is of a text that is or may be corrupt you would never know it here.The fall of communism is apparently foreseen, but quite apart from the general issue of whether such a meaning could even possibly be extracted from the text, it took no Nostradamus to predict that, only a basic grasp of economics. This volume saw the light first in 1973, so doom and disaster was still a possible runner in the year-2000 stakes, but among disastrous years of several kinds I don't recall it being one of the worst, and at least the world has not ended yet, something apparently scripted for the millennium year.I wonder what the real truth might have been regarding the alleged visionary insights of Nostradamus. In the Spirit of Arthur C Clarke I don't rule that out, but neither you nor I will get much help with that question here."},{"Title":"The prophecies of Nostradamus","review":"It's a great book!

While the questions in the Quantitative Review book are somewhat easier than in the Official Guide, that isn't the case (to the same degree, anyway) with the verbal, so I can recommend this to just about anybody.Further, the difference between authentic questions and inauthentic ones (i.e., those generated by writers at test-prep companies) is much greater in verbal material than in math. I should know: I've written hundreds of practice verbal questions, and matching the voice, structure, and objectives of the original is a daunting task.

She told me that she sees hundreds of these scores a year and the ones who get 700+ all have one thing in common - they have all done every problem in all three books.My advice: spend the money on all three. Work every problem, noting which ones are hard and which you get wrong. When you are done, go back and work the hard/incorrect problems again. Then, when you are done, start over from page one.

For example, GMAT SC tests such things as \\"gerunds which pose as nouns\\" and how they can only be parallel to action (but not regular) nouns. Unfortunately, this book leaves a lot wanting in the more difficult questions of the GMAT verbal.Simply put, this book does not provide the type of questions the present real GMAT will give you.You are far better off studying the Manhattan GMAT (especially SC) 3rd edition books. And no I do not work for Manhattan GMAT.Do yourself a big favor and practice GMAT Prep (downloaded free from MBA.com) prior to taking the real GMAT. Otherwise, you will be in a shock at the difficulty of the questions when you take the real GMAT.Unless you are shooting for sub 650 score, do not rely solely on this book for your GMAT verbal preparation.

This book is awful in every way I can think. The book's title would lead you to believe that this is a story with an unhappy ending for the country. Fear not, a &quot;happy&quot; ending is at hand. Most of America's large cities destroyed-namely the ones with the most Jews and blacks, along with other &quot;undersirables&quot;. All of Israel utterly destroyed, and most of the large cities of Europe and most of the Middle East. Seeing a pattern yet? Yes, several of the &quot;nasty&quot; main characters die, as punishment for their racist sins. But America winds up a Jew-less, black-less place by the year 2025. And EVERYONE concerned-Jews, blacks, and all secretly racist and anti-Semitic whites-is satisfied with this. Not to mention the incredibly childish and base writing style. I have to stop but sufficed to say that the reason this book was a COMPLETE waste of my money is because JUST after I finished it (yes, I did amazingly-I thought I would justify the purchase)-I threw the book in the trash and threw the trash out. Don't even think about."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"I have waited for a book like this one for a long time. I was fascinated by the fact that it spells out what many white Americans do not dare speak out loud. I hope this book breaks that tabu. It's high time, too. I recommend it to every American regardless of color, ethnic or racial origin. The book lays out a solution to our social problems, which, I dare say, will only get worse in the future. We owe it to our children to heed the writers imaginative vision of our future and therefore make an effort not to let it come to that. The same goal can be achieved without the tragedy described in the book. One other comment: I am a single woman and after reading pages 257 through 274, I put down the book, rushed over to my boyfriend's apartment and bedded him queenly.

If you want to teach someone about hate, this is the book to do it with. Some will follow it's message and some will be sickened by it, as I was.If you're not a white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant, male, this book will make you barf. I suggest wrapping the garbage in it as an alternative use of the paper."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"I have read the book and my first impression was that its message smacks of anti-Semitism. On second thought though, I must reject that. I am a secular Jew and I try to be objective when it comes to interactions between the Jewish community and the Gentile majority. In my opinion, the prophet in the book, Rabbi Birns, (Birns is a convenient abbreviation for Birnbaum, Peartree in English) is telling American Jews something, giving them a bit to think about, for much of what he says rings true. He mentions Jacob Wassermann and his assessment of the Jews in Vienna around the turn of the century a hundred years ago. I had never heard of Jacob Wassermann and at first I thought he was a figment of the writer's imagination. To my surprise, Jacob Wassermann did live and did write about the Jews in Vienna in his book &quot;My Way as a German and Jew&quot;. It's written in German and I got it on an inter-library loan, and had that part that's in the book translated just to check the writer's tranlation, wich, I must say, is very good. At any rate, the book, as I have said, gives American Jews something to think about. I encourage them to read it. Shalom and happy Hanukkah! Charles Steiner, Boston. P.S.: I found my name in the book, a coincidence of course, but another good reason for writing this review."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"I kept hoping that the author was setting the reader up for aplot twist, but no. ....

My last regret is that there is no zero star rating."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"I must tell you quite frankly, you have never read a book like that. The author's style is fascinating, I mean, he writes like people talk when they are at home behind closed doors. There are no dull moments, and, I should say, it is adult reading. I can recommend it to all who want to spent several hours of good reading with a glass of wine at hand. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"The title &quot;THE FALL OF AMERICA&quot; is subject tointerpretation depending in which corner of the social debate in theUS one has chosen to reside. Perhaps two other suggested titles would make that clear: &quot;THE FUTURE OF AMERICA ? &quot; and &quot;THE LIBERATION OF AMERICA&quot;. I would say that no other contemporary author has said so much that needed to be said so compactly. The brusqueness, the scorn of polite prose, the passion of feeling and clearness of thought, and the pungency of unjackneyed phrase, give the writing of Mertens a swiftness, color and force that few, if any, writers of past decades have equaled. The color is at times dark, the mood at times gloomy and the critcism stings. We are carried with fascination by a narrative at once stately, turbulent,salty, impetuous and bawdy to the last page. Character upon character rises onto the stage and has his or her say. Our reading enjoyment is heightened by the author's street corner vocabulary, his easy moving colloquial and lusty passages."},{"Title":"The Fall of America","review":"As an African/American, who believes strongly in Separatism, I want to applaud the author of the &quot;The Fall of America&quot; for having suggested a desirable solution to the black/white racial dilemma that exist in the USA. It may interest the readers of this review to know, that, according to a survey conducted by the NAACP, 50% or more of white people and 50% or more of black people in the USA believe Separatism is acceptabe and desirable. This makes Separatism legitimate and should, therefore, be openly discussed and acted upon by congress as The Solution. With intense fascination did I read the preparation and the execution of the black exodus (return to Africa)as described in the book. The writer's style is fluent and his story carries you along with growing antissipation, a point that even the Zionist from Palestine could not deny (this refers to the previous review). The author's treatment of the principal black characters is realistic, respectful and sensitive to black peoples sensibilities, with the exception of Julia Penn, whom he paints as an obsessed black activist who comes across at times as a vulgar gutter snipe. And I must confess, we have quite a few of them among us. I know a few myself. The Nation of Africans is the thinly diguised Nation of Islam, of which I am a member. We African/Americans owe it to our slave ancestors that we return to Africa. We owe them a part of the dividend that we,their descendents, have been reaping in this country, although not all of us. And that part of the dividend we owe them is to carry back to Africa our scientists , lawyers, politicians, our professional people, men and women that are needed in Africa to turn things around there and make life better for all Africans. For that is what our slave ancestors want us to do. In return for their suffering they expect us to do something for their homeland, Africa. We may not disappoint them. If we do, we are nothing other than their spolied and ungrateful children.

The tape on evolution is teeming with ignorance and idiot student questions. The whole half of the second side is a dialogue between montgomery and some weird foreign student who talks about mud and cheese and India. The guy was so far out you couldn't get a radar fix on him. Montgomery should have cut him off or atleast edit this out of the tape. Montgomery stresses Ph.D's and accredited colleges for reliable intellectual sources. Unless I'm mistaken, these colleges are the source of the problem. How many reputable colleges produced the great innonvators? I don't know of one. I do know that Galois, Descartes, John Kanzius, Tesla, Eric Laithwaite and so on didn't obtain their insights from attending some worthless college. They all were banned from colleges. Montgomery does a great job on the tape \\"miracles\\" and the ones dealing with theology, but he is clueless about how to properly handle evolution. In fact, he counsels us against refuting it and even suggests that Teilard de Chardin was a Christian. I thought the apologetic mission was to tear down \\"all\\" strongholds against truth? The best sources against evolutionists are by amateurs. For example, genesispark.com and other websites have done a magnificent job in showing that dinosaurs and humans were and are contemporaries. Montgomery is quite an academic snob and is difficult to stomach in this respect. And he accomodates worldly affairs a bit too much allegedly in the interest of the Gospel. He's very erudite and is a great speaker. But, don't go to him for how to deal with the cults or evolution. Walter Martin addressed the cults in a far superior way. The internet websites have dealt with evolution in a superior way. His specialty is theology and epistemology."},{"Title":"Yorktown Campaign and the Surrender of Cromwallis, 1781","review":"Although written in 1881, this book remains as a well-written summary of the campaign with detailed order of battle and casualty appendices. Although the British typically blame the defeat on the failure of the Royal Navy this is just passing the blame. The fact is that despite having several months to prepare a defense, adequate supplies and a superiority in cavalry, the British army put up a lackluster defense of Yorktown. There was essentially no covering force battle to delay Washington and Rochambeau, despite the presence of Banastre Tarleton's elite cavalry. One suspects that the British professional soldiers already felt the war was lost and were less than eager to lose their lives in a lost cause. Casualties were amazingly light (only 7% of the total force) and mostly concentrated in the German units (who suffered 38% of the casualties but were only 23% of the army). After the surrender, the quantity of ammunition and supplies captured indicate the British could have fought on longer. Maps are adequate."},{"Title":"Wings Bestsellers: Robert Parker: A New Collection of Three Complete Spenser Novels","review":"This collection brings together the fifth, sixth, and seventh Spenser for Hire novels by Robert B. Parker, representing the early glory days when our hero was trying to figure out how to make things work with Susan Silverman and Hawk was always around to help do the good deeds. The key thing is that Parker refuses to fit into a restrictive formula at this point and that his books are perfectly suited for those who spend time reading as a way of enduring the commuter lifestyle.\\"The Judas Goat\\" (178) offers some twists on our hero as he travels to Europe and needs the assistance of Hawk to do his good deeds as we learn that apparently Spenser cannot do everything by himself. Spenser is hired by a millionaire industrialist who was crippled in the terrorist bomb blast in a London restaurant that killed his wife and daughter. Hugh Dixon will pay Spenser $2,500 for each of the nine members of the gang, dead or alive. Spenser's plan is to go to London and find himself a \\"Judas goat,\\" someone in the gang he can turn to get at the others. Of course, since this is a Spenser novel the case proves to be a lot more complicate. This is one of the fastest paced novels in the series and features a most efficient Spenser, which seems a strange comment given all the waiting he does in this novel. On the personal front his relationship with Susan is progressing nicely (apply appropriate adage involving distance). The final twist that takes our hero to Montreal is a bit over the top, but if you remember events from the summer of 1972 it is not so far-fetched.In \\"Looking for Rachel Wallace\\" our hero is hired to protect the title character, a radical lesbian feminist who has been receiving death threats because of her latest book \\"Tyranny,\\" which is about people in high places who discriminate against gay women. To no one's surprise Rachel Wallace does not take well to Spenser's sense of humor, the way he dresses, his chosen avocation--okay, she does not like ANYTHING about him. But she needs protection and he can carry on an intelligent argument, so there is some level of respect. Everybody is worried or at least wondering what Spenser thinks about lesbians and radical feminists, and there are several feisty conversations along such lines between the pair, but the actual subject under examination in this book turns out to be Spenser himself, although most of the insights come from Susan Silverman instead of the Rachel Wallace. There is a point where Spenser explains if anything happens to him, Hawk should take up the case. Susan points out she does not know how to contact him and Spenser assures her that if anything happens Hawk will show up and ask if she needs anything. Susan talks about the implicit code that binds Spenser, Hawk, Quirk, Healy, etc., and I suddenly realize that Spenser has been NETWORKING! The first half of \\"Looking for Rachel Wallace\\" deals Spenser trying to do his job until he offends the writer's political sensibilities and is dismissed. As you can tell from the title, the second half of the novel brings changes the nature of the case and even though he is no longer employed to care, of course he takes responsibility for everything that has happened. The most unique part of this novel is that Spenser makes some serious mistakes (I even spotted a key clue way before he did), so he is not as on top of his game as usual. You especially know this is true when Spenser gets beaten up in a fight and apologizes several times for what he says. More than any other novel to this point in the series, \\"Looking for Rachel Wallace\\" gets to the heart of the character, understandably knocking him off stride to reveal the true nature of the man.With \\"Early Autum\\" we again find a new twist in a new Spenser adventure. This time our hero is hired by Patti Giacomin to find her son Paul, kidnapped by his father. Spenser finds Paul almost immediately and it quickly becomes clear that neither parent really cares about the boy, who is just a pawn in the wake of an ugly divorce. Paul needs someone to teach him, well, just about everything (except how to shrug; the kid does that really well in response to literally every question asked by Spenser throughout the entire book). \\"Early Autumn,\\" a metaphor for a 15-year old kid who has to grow up really fast, finds Spenser talking more than any of the previous books, although at the end his detective skills will again come into play. A large chunk of the book is Spenser and Paul talking about a whole bunch of different topics. In doing so, Spenser explains his view of the world, a task usually left to Susan Silverman. There is also an unforgettable twist as Hawk lends a hand at a key moment.Can you beginning with \\"A New Collection of Three Complete Novels\\" and pick up the Spenser for Hire series from there? Certainly. But there is something to be said for going back and doing this series from the beginning. Early on the point is more the cases, but as the series progresses it becomes more about the relationships. Not just the major ones with Susan, Hawk, and Paul, but also those with the growing supporting cast, which includes Rachel Wallace."},{"Title":"Wings Bestsellers: Robert Parker: A New Collection of Three Complete Spenser Novels","review":"Why in the world would someone post an omnibus three novel hardback for sale with no identity of what the three novels are.

It was another page-turner of Ms Krentz that you can easily finish reading within one day. In this book, Rachel and Chance had very similar characters - smart, independent, intelligent and very protective of their family. The whole story was simple, entertaining and full of love. The attraction between the hero and heroine was strong from the very beginning and you could just predict they would be together and perfect for each other. That's what romance is supposed to be. Don't you think?"},{"Title":"Chance of a Lifetime","review":"Krentz (also known in the Historical Romance Genre as Amanda Quick) uses the plot device of mistaken identity to get this novel started. The heroine is a typical Krentz heroine--sassy, agressive, and determined to see &quot;justice&quot; done. Similarly, the hero fits the mold of the tough, sarcastic loner just waiting for the right woman to arrive and bring him the stability he (supposedly) craves. A couple of confusing subplots and some annoying behavior by the hero (frequently he bellows for his Scotch before dinner) prevent this from being a great book, although it is a good beach or airplane read. I've read better from Krentz/Quick."},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"\\"Accidental Death of an Anarchist,\\" by Dario Fo, is adapted by Gavin Richards from a translation by Gillian Hanna. The Methuen Modern Plays edition contains an introduction by Stuart Hood; Fo himself contributes an author's note and a postscript. The opening pages note that the original Italian edition had a copyright date of 1970. The author's note describes how the play was inspired by the death of an anarchist being held in police custody.This outrageous comedy opens with a character known as the \\"Maniac\\" being brought to a police station. It's a very \\"metatheatrical\\" piece; Fo warps theatrical conventions and makes jokes in a way that reminds me a bit of Luigi Pirandello's \\"Six Characters in Search of an Author.\\" There are some really funny scenes, but a very serious vein still runs throughout the piece.Ultimately, this is a thought-provoking piece about truth. What is the true story, and how do you discover it? Fo's satiric wit explores police brutality as well as the relationships among the police, the media, and the political establishment. I recommend this piece by the Nobel Prize winning Fo to all with an interest in 20th century drama and/or political activism."},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"In the age we're living in today, this is the perfect satire of police departments. We always here in the news about some cop in some city getting caught framing someone innocent (or sometimes worse). Fo does a wonderful job of humorizing that situation. Some might call the play over-the-top, but they're just missing the humor of it all. I've read a lot of plays, and this is definitely one of the best modern plays out there. Everything about it screams &quot;wit.&quot; The characters are great, and memorable too. If you have the chance to buy it, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"I truly enjoyed this play and again am wondering why it is not put on more often. Granted, it has a specific political objective, due to its timely plot and circumstancial event. Yet, as a performer, I find the quality of writing to be extremely wonderful. Interestingly, I also discovered that Fo's viewpoint on comedic and political theatre to be very similar to my own:(It) grabs at the heart and guts, but attempts to get there by a violent moment of laughter. Because laughter does not remain at the bottom of the mind, leaving sediment which cannot be wiped off. Because laughter helps avoid one of the worst dangers, which is catharsis. (5)Fo wanted the reverse of catharsis, the emotional release, and it is very apparent in Accidental Death of an Anarchist. He seeks to provoke, debate, to arouse feelings and to challenge ideas while inviting his audience to consider new points of view. I respect this form of theatre, for it is the hardest to write, collaborate, and present clearly to an already cynical audience in this day and age. By using an absurdist/satirical/farcial approach towards the issues of power, its abuse, and political stations, he creates sense out of nonsensical characters and situations. The maniac, a harliquien like character, leads the members of a police station somewhere in a city, in this case we assume New York or London, through a dizzying investigation around the questionable death of an anarchist from years before. Mysteriously, the anarchist had \\"thrown\\" himself from a four story window during the course of police investigation. We, the audience suspect foul play for the cause, and in effect we see the maniac give nothing but insane play to the accused. He is quick witted and incredibly dynamic with language and vast information. The maniac flaunts with their pride and guilt, causing mass confusion. The audience cannot help but love his crazy ways. In true satiric fasion, just and darkly comedic rewards are served to all characters by the end. The audience is left wondering how these events effect them. The ever present window in the scene is the only realistic element that the audience must contend with. It reminds them of the reality of the crime, how it really took place, and yet they are forced to laugh at it and find disgust in that humor. It is this form of satire that provokes thoughts and action towards change, which is what Fo wanted. It is this subtle stealthiness of dark humor that creates the desired effect of political theatre: change, perhaps for the better, or in this case, for the playwrights cause."},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"I laughed myself sick (good knee-slapping, floor-pounding laughter), and yet, at the same time, was keenly aware of the political statements Fo made throughout the play. Dario Fo has created hysterically funny tragedy with this satirical look at Italy's police force. I am not familiar with Italy's political scene, but the message is clear: problems lay not only a corrupt system, but are also inherent in attempts to reform that system."},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"There has been a long debate about the death of the theatre. And that debate still continues, but plays are nevertheless being produced, actors are playing Hamlet over and over again, and directors are staging everything, from timeless classics to newest avant-garde. Even so, death of the theatre seem iminent. New methods of expression appeared which drove public fromt the teatre seats. Nowadays, in those seats you can only find aged critics, younger men and women still posessed by the power of art\\" and some older couples which have no place to go. Can there be future to such setting?Whilst future reamins obscured in unsettling clouds, past looks glorious and full of appeal. Not only in works like ones of O'neil, Brecht, Pirandello or Shakespeare but also in the ones that have more modern\\" sound, whatever that should mean. Dario Fo is one of those men who brings with himself entire glamour of theatre together with precise sharpness of satire and political subversion.Upon reading this play, you cannot but think of Groucho Marx and his extravagant style, high intelligence and unparalleled big-mouthedness. All of those characteristics were incorporated into the Fo's character called Maniac. But such comparison might not be entirely fair, having in mind what was said before. Still, Death of an anarchist\\" functions as classic farce, with what it seems as a total anarchy in script and staging, anarchy that is apealing in such a way that you simple cannot put this book away.Magic of the theatre shows itself in the best way on these pages. You are being drawn into the world wihtout rules, which scarringly resembles our own and which we can relate to. That kind of identification puts us on the edge. And Fo is aware of that and uses that fact in such a brilliant way, that you have to bow to him.It is quite unnecessary and to some extent impossible to retell the story of Death of an anarchist\\". It would be exactly the same as if you were going to retell the Marx brothers film and expect that it would have the sam impact as seeing and hearing Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo act themselves crazy.When you're feeling sad or you would just give up on everything and go with the flow, forgeting that posibility of rebellions ever existed, you should reach for this book, and it will charge up your dead batteries, making you feel the joy of existence and laughter all over again."},{"Title":"Accidental Death of an Anarchist","review":"I saw a small production of this play a few years ago in downtown Minneapolis and was most interested in what it had to say about police interrogation techniques. This is not a topic which I would expect to be popular now, as most emphasis has been shifted to deadly confrontations, and the only major death in this play is of a suspect who was hanging out of a police department window before he dropped to his death. In the history of people being pick up for interrogation, this might be as famous someplace in Italy as the Biko case in South Africa, where police in Port Elizabeth picked Biko up and slammed him against the wall because he was not cooperating fully in their investigation of his attitude toward law and order.I thought that the theme of the play was that the police get overly zealous in trying to pin a crime on a particular person once the police have made up their collective minds who they think should have committed the crime, as the defense allegations in the famous O.J. murder case seemed well founded when the methods of the L.A.P.D. were subject to the scrutiny of attorneys who are aware of how these things are usually done. In the case of the actual event upon which the Accidental Death of the Anarchist was based, the police techniques were subject to an official investigation, and the play was written as on ongoing farce which kept Italy informed as more facts came to light. The play may be way beyond the Zen of any audience, but if people think that something about the nature of the police is revealed in it, I don't think that those people should be considered as paranoid as they ought to be. Anyone who loses sleep over this kind of thing hasn't adjusted well to modern society, so they can probably find a shrink to give them pills that will put them to sleep, but that is a different topic, but not much different, really."},{"Title":"LITTLE BEAR'S TROUSERS","review":"This book is a must-have for all parents of young children.

Because after his first edition chronicled the venerable show's history, many old Monitor hands contacted him to share their experiences in helping produce Monitor. The result is a fuller, richer picture that lets Monitor fans feel like they are looking over the shoulders of these lucky broadcast professionals as they created hours upon hours of live radio programming in the '50s through the mid '70s--a time when radio meant something far beyond today's homogenized, plasticized, excruciatingly boring programming.For Monitor was a revolution in its day. When it was developed by the great Pat Weaver, then NBC President, long form radio programming (i.e.; fifteen and thirty minute shows) was almost extinct, television having siphoned off the audience.Weaver created Monitor, a magazine of the air that ran on weekends and saved the NBC radio network from extinction. Monitor combined news, music, interviews, features, sports, comedy, and live remotes to bring listeners an ever changing and totally entertaining format that engaged listeners in what was going on in the world around them.To top it all off, it was hosted by a pantheon of broadcast legends like Dave Garroway, Gene Rayburn, Hugh Downs, Mel Allen, Bill Cullen, Henry Morgan, Frank Blair, Ed McMahon, and many others each of whom gave the show its distinctive flavor.Monitor was a big idea that sounded big and it resulted in what became practically a national institution over its twenty year run. Many fans, including this author, still miss it to this day.Frankly, it's a puzzle why Monitor isn't still running today, since radio sure could use the intelligent, dynamic programming that typified a Monitor weekend.Maybe it's too much to think that Monitor could return to the radio waves today, but I'd wager that after readers finish Hart's affectionate history, they'll wish it were so."},{"Title":"Monitor (Take 2): The revised, expanded inside story of network radio's greatest program","review":"Take 2 is indeed the expanded, inside story of Monitor.

One of Pat Weaver's great creations - along with TODAY & TONIGHT - the show pretty much invented the NPR model of broadcasting (specifically, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED).

The latter are not unwarranted: Hart has done his homework, as confirmed by many interviews with those who made the show happen. Hart's love for the subject glistens on every page. My dissatisfaction with the book lies in its lack of deep analysis. It is primarily a chronicle of the creation, rise, and fall of one of America's finest endeavors in broadcast journalism and entertainment. One could learn nearly as much by consulting the author's webpage on the subject--which is graced with photographs of the leading figures, none of which is reproduced in the book. Through no fault of the author, the book is suffused with elegy for a world that apparently no longer wants what Monitor uniquely provided: radio that brings us the world in its fullness with charity, wit, and intelligence.

We watch Freddy grow up, come out, accept himself, and hisfamily's and friends' perceptions of him. Scanlon makes us like Freddy, whether or not you are gay, you can identify with his struggles against his family. He was that unplanned for child born years. His Mom recognizes his being gay at an early age and indulges him and it. His father and grandfather abduct his GI Joe, but Mom buys him a new one and takes him to the toy store to outfit him in the latest Ken Doll fashions. No one thinks it odd that this young guy has always liked show tunes. He owns LPs by age 4! I think its great and record store owners set some aside for him. He grows up in Bethesda, Maryland, outside DC and gets out as soon as can. He lands in NYC, where his warmth and innocence do him harm, but gain him some nice friends.

However, I believe I'm an expert on this Wall Chart of World History. My experience covers about 25 years with this Super Book on World History. The name of the Book in the original setting was (The Wall Chart). (Of world history) from earliest times to the present. This is an apt description as the pages fold out to 15.5 feet in an accordion fashion, and indeed makes a super (Wall Chart.) Most of the time you will use this wonderful book just like any book you use by just turning the pages. There's no need to fold them out.The description on the back of one of my first editions says. \\"14 connecting panels unfold across 40 centuries before, and 20 centuries after, Christ.\\" In brief, the Book starts at 4004 BC and follows Ushers timeline with all the Bible characters shown as linear and their Children are all named and how long they lived and are shown also linear in the same fashion.After Noah's flood, Noah's children Shem, Ham, Japheth branch out into the different nations, and all the time line of events that follows shows the different nations below in all the expansion of those nations up until now, and my last book was up to date and shows our present time including the USA to President George W. Bush.This is my experience as I have bought as many as 30 to 40 during my 25 years of buying these wonderful books.The original printing was first published in the 1890's. My own first purchase of the printing goes back to 1989 as a reprint. That's 22 years to today, March 2011. All of my later purchases are reprinted editions since then and are known as a (facsimile edition). The quality of the pages is super, the images are super, and the coloring is super. Nothing about the quality of this book is less than super and that includes the clarity!The Truth about history is found in Bible Chronology and seems to be the closest to any form of world history. This book itself compares with the other historic timelines and calls other timelines (Exaggerated Chronologies.), and gives examples of why they are called that.My first purchases of these books were to use in teaching and to give all my family members copies and to even give a few to my grandkids schools.Everything I'll explain from here will reveal my frustrations to get my last 4 super books.All the revised additions I have up to the last were Barnes and Noble on the Jacket.I knew that the only way for me to get more of these books, I'd have to buy old used ones, I thought.* In Hawaii about a year ago I found what I thought was the books on sale again. About $9.99. I didn't ask to open the cellophane protection as I thought it was what I wanted. However, the new name was the (Time Chart) of World History. Back in Colorado I ordered about 7 since the price was right. When I went to Barnes and Noble to pick them up I was really surprised. This was not what I thought I had ordered. The pages inside were totally different. I did not purchase these. Remember the two words (Time Chart) It keeps showing up but different.* I went to Amazon who has been super working with me. I put in the old ISBN # and the Icon of the book looked like just what I wanted. I just ordered one this time, and when the book came it was used like new. The book still had the correct name on it (The Wall Chart of World History), but was updated and better. I got better than I had ordered. How often does that happen?* This next time I ordered 3 of these books, but when I saw my order, it said The (Timechart) History of the World: 6000 years of World History $25 each. I knew I didn't want the Timechart so I cancelled that order. Amazon help was just super. Remember the two words (Time Chart).This time I had an Amazon employee help me. I ordered 4 new at $29.95 each and the identifier was. (The Wallchart of World History (Revised): Form Earliest times to the Present - A Facsimile Edition) Hardcover by: Edward Hull. Just what I wanted. Here's why I'm writing this 5 star approval. You guessed it, the title on the cover is and I'm looking at it now. (The Timechart history of the World). My heart just sank. I quickly opened the first book, and it was revised to George W Bush, and it is by far the best of all the editions. I haven't tried yet, but they say this one expands to 30 ft. Yikes.You may have to order this (new) like I did. You won't regret it. It is no longer published by Barnes and Noble.New important info.Amazon did me a great job.Published by Metro BooksMetro books 122 Fifth Ave, N.Y. New York 10011ISBN - 13: 978-0-7607-6534-0Printed in China.Thanks. It was worth all the pain to get these.By the way the Icon below here looks just like my old WallCharts of World History.

I must admit, this one has got to be one of the most beautiful, most detailed, and most ambitious (17 feet long!) that I have ever seen. However, please be aware that this chart was made in 1871 (!) and all the versions of it (even the ones that update it so that it goes up to the 21st century) are still 98% the same as the original 1871 version. Therefore you are getting a very Victorian/Eurocentric view of history. Historians have uncovered a wealth of information about the past since the 1800's and unfortunately, this is not conveyed on this chart.So I do NOT recommend this for teaching history. But it's a great novelty piece.Oh, and I should also point out that the correct author is Sebastian C. Adams, not Edward Hull (Edward Hull only contributed one of the many insets).

The chief value of timelines is allow the viewer to see what was happening simultaneously in the world at particular times, and this presentation manages to squeeze in a wealth of data.

Because this was first published for 19th century audiences, it has to proceed from its Victorian starting place, and likewise Victorian religiosity. It goofily begins at Adam and Eve in 4004 b.c.e. (!). Because a diagram is not easily revised once finished the more recent panels just continue the problem. It caters to Victorian hero worship by covering historical figures only, and maybe a few events; no text mind you, just a citation of the event. What these events mean will be just as unknown after, as before you purchased it. Hundreds of kings names on various double-page spreads will continue to be meaningless to a reader. All you'll know after getting this is chronology. You'll know Joiada preceded Onias but you still won't know who the hell they were, or anything they acheived.In favoring the dubious \\"Great Men\\" approach to understanding history, the Victorians failed to devise a more alive, dynamic concept for its study. Names and dates are just not compelling - history IS the history of ideas. This elaborate document never gets around to epoch-altering ideas at all. A sequenced timechart of ideas (and maybe technology; the development of agriculture, the gothic arch, the invention of glass, the Gutenberg press) would be valuable, and a much more interesting way to engage history.

A good experience."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"\\"This Man's Army: A Soldier's Story from the Front Lines of the War on Terrorism,\\" by Andrew Exum, is a memoir by a U.S. Army infantry officer who saw combat in Afghanistan after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Exum gets into detail about his military education and training. He discusses his time in ROTC, and also takes the reader through the phases of Army Ranger school. He also covers his stateside duty at Fort Drum, New York.The book shifts into a more intense mode when Exum recalls the infamous 9/11 attacks, after which his unit was mobilized for wartime duty. He discusses his unit's activities in Kuwait. After taking the reader in detail through his missions in Afghanistan, Exum describes his return to the U.S. after the war, and the changes that occurred in his life.I really enjoyed this book. Exum's straightforward, down-to-earth writing style is nicely complemented by some thoughtful literary and cultural references throughout the book. His accounts of military training and wartime service are interesting, especially his accounts of encounters with the press. The book strikes me as a well-rounded account; he deals with the excitement and soldierly bonding of wartime, as well as its tedium and annoyances. He creates warm and entertaining portraits of the soldiers he served with. He presents a compelling view of Afghanistan: a \\"Wild West\\"-type environment of rugged natural beauty. Exum also offers his musings about the relationship between war and spirituality.\\"This Man's Army\\" struck me as grimly ironic in light of ongoing operations in Iraq. Exum notes how at one point he felt the Afghan campaign was \\"the greatest war ever,\\" \\"an adventure,\\" a \\"big game [. . .] against an overmatched opponent.\\" Of course, Iraq has proven to be a much more difficult and deadly theater. Overall, I found this book to be a thoughtful and informative look at contemporary training and warfighting in the U.S. Army. Recommended companion text: \\"Not a Good Day to Die,\\" journalist Sean Naylor's nonfiction account of U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"\\"This Man's Army\\" provides both civilians and servicemembers a thorough examination of entry-level officer training and the early days of the Global War on Terror. It was entertaining and informative, with only a very few dull spots. The author's use of quotes from more established authors was an interesting aspect to the book. All in all, his words will ring true to most soldiers serving in a post 9/11 Army, and will provide great insight on the part of civilians attempting to understand the modern Army. My only significant complaint was the author's perception that his Ivy-League education somehow made him a rarity in the modern Army."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"I'd recommend reading this book, if for nothing else than for the insight in to the challenge of Ranger school and infantry platoon level operations.One the the liners on my copy of the book used the term \\"humble\\". Hardly. Andew Exum has every right to be proud of his service and that of his men in time of war. But a bit too much horn tooting for my taste. You'll be reminded about every 10 pages that he graduated from an ivy league school and Ranger school. Okay, we got it.My hope in reading the book was to get a troop level view in to the war on terrorism. Instead, we mostly get a catharsis. About the ivy league, ROTC, early Army life experiences, etc. By my calculation - and I welcome to be corrected - the book's combat coverage was only about 2 1/2 months worth in Afghanistan(?) Exum was later deployed to Iraq, but this book does not cover that period of his valuable service.Not Exum's fault, he just deployed when and where they sent him. And thank God we have such folks doing that. I appreciate that service. But I felt a bit 'cheated' knowing the stories of so many others is not being told, since they are on their third, fourth or beyond deployments?I was glad to have read this book, but I'll continue to search for more representative accounts - from those men and women who spends YEARS in combat zones."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"The global war against terrorism was the major issue of the 2004 presidential election, and while rhetoric was plentiful, reasoned discussion was scarce. What began as a police action to support the war on terror in Iraq became hopelessly politicized. As such, public discussion of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan became proxy political battles; partsans of John Kerry insisted that the sitting president had bungled the wrong war at the wrong time, while advocates of President Bush argued that only he could manfully prosecute the fight against terror. Anyone watching cable news during the 2004 election season was treated to dueling pundits repeated this two mantras, as if that might make them objectively true. This may have been carthartic for over-stressed pundits, but it hardly raised the level of knowledge of this crucial issue.People who seriously care about the war on terror and are interested in how it is perceived by the young people fighting it would do better to read Andrew Exum's This Man's Army.In this autobiography, Exum shares with the reader the experiences that led a young man from Tennessee to the Shah-e-Kot valley in Afghanistan. While at the Univeristy of Pennsylvania, Exum enrolled in the Army ROTC, and after his graduation with a double major in English and Classics, he served at Fort Lewis, Washington, and went through the Infantry Officer Basic Course before meeting the challenge of United States Army Ranger School.Ranger School, as one can see in this narrative, is a physically and mentally draining multiphase exercise that weeds out the weak and unfit. Exum spends a great deal of time discussing the challenges of Ranger School, which is entirely appropriate; 95% of the US population could probably not pass the initial physical fitness tests of \\"Zero Week,\\" which are a prelude to the actual training itself. Exum, then, relates to the reader what was needed to pass Ranger School.After Ranger School, Exum was assigned to the Tenth Mountain Divison at Fort Drum, New York, and his story continues, as he relates the details of his first command, until it is shattered by the events of September 11, 2001. Exum's division is then sent to the Middle East--at first Kuwait, as the first conventional unit to deploy as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.From there, Exum and his platoon eventually are sent to Afghanistan, where they fight in the front lines against the Taliban. It is here that This Man's Army truly shines, as it tells the story of the war against terror as seen by an intelligent, articulate young officer."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"This book is very well written and entertaining.I also served in the Infantry in the 10th Mountain Division and his book pretty much tells it like it is. I like most his depictions of what infantry life is really like, especially the games and horseplay that they do."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"I found the training part of the author who is an Army office very interesting but the book started to lag toward the end which is why I gave it four stars. Still, the author was a dedicated military professional who goes through hard training and lead by example."},{"Title":"This Man's Army","review":"This is a memoir of a driven man--driven to perform, to excel, to understand, to lead others--doing the hardest task on the planet, which is that of defending democracy. Exum writes about his time from high school, through University of Pennsylvania ROTC, training and Ranger School, through his tour with the 10th Mountain Division in Afghanistan, and subsequent career-ending injury in a freak sports accident. He retired as a Captain.This is clearly a man's world, that of finding bravery and a place in the halls of warriors. Tough, gritty, occasionally humorous, appropriately introspective, devoid of any kind of coddling and women, Exum presents himself modestly, as most driven people might do.This is what my Army friends call a \\"quick read,\\" no less worthy for its speed. Exum adds to the public knowledge of Ranger training and Afghanistan, and how a handful of American warriors took down a regime whose tribal and religious brutality marked it as pervasively totalitarian. The reading public will acknowledge Exum as the hero and warrior that he came to be. Thus, this is also a \\"grateful read,\\" and sets into context the news flashes we get every night on CNN."},{"Title":"The Prisoner of Sex","review":"There is much to argue with in &quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot;, and though I'm in sympathy with the aims of the womens' movement, I cheer Mailers' defense of the artists right to use their sexuality and sense of the sensual world as proper fodder for poetic expression.There are times when Mailer- the- mystic clogs up an otherwise lacerating arguement,where his romanticism veers dangerously towards a lunatics hallucinations, but his defense of Miller, Lawrence and Genet against the clumsier moments of Millets' orginal critique in &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; is literary criticism at its most emphatic.&quot;Prisoner of Sex&quot; is, I'm afraid, incoherant at times, but there are long passages of rich knock-out prose that demonstrate why Mailer is thought by many to be one of the premiere stylists of the times, and if nothing else, his lyrical defense of D.H.Lawrence is worth the purchase by itself."},{"Title":"The Prisoner of Sex","review":"This work, although not typical of Mailer, was of his best.

This is raw Mailer as he deconstructs the world around him to discover one reason for living - sex.We are guided by sex's force and the urge limits our potential. What makes this book enjoyable is that Mailer is able to weave so many issues around one basic human act.

What makes the book important is precisely the fact that Mailer felt there was a need for a man to stand up and have a word against and about the rising tide of Feminist theory; while many male writers were too confused, adrift in daydreams of irony or bottled up rage, and while the academy was surrendering its arms without a shot being fired, Mailer spoke up and wrote that there was a profound and important difference between the sexes, and that while social justice must and will prevail regarding the rights of women in the work place and overall social sphere, one cannot maintain, straight faced, that the only difference between the sexes has to do with genitalia.There are times when Mailer- the- mystic clogs up an otherwise lacerating arguement,where his romanticism veers dangerously towards a lunatics hallucinations, but his defense of Miller, Lawrence and Genet against the clumsier moments of Millets' orginal critique in \\"Sexual Politics\\" is literary criticism at its most emphatic. \\"Prisoner of Sex\\" is, I'm afraid, incoherent at times, but there are long passages of rich knock-out prose that demonstrate why Mailer is thought by many to be one of the premiere stylists of the times, and if nothing else, his lyrical defense of D.H.Lawrence is worth the purchase by itself."},{"Title":"The Prisoner of Sex","review":"This book, wriiten when the women's liberation movement was still in its nascent stage, is a reponse to some of the writings of the movement's leaders, in particular, Germaine Greer, Kate Millet, Betty Friedan, and Gloria Steinem.

It was a bestseller in 1907 and tells a tale of a woman on a four year teaching stint in Japan. The lady is recovering from a nasty marriage. She seems to have gone through a rough time and needs to find herself once again. Luckily (I guess) the man died and she was able to escape. The story does not focus on that time of her life, it is the reason for the journey.I downloaded thefree Kindle version. It is roughly 1200 locations - so a nice quick read.Little's writing style is crisp and witty. There were many lines that had great impact on me. Readers will find though that there are also numerous non PC terms about the people she encounters. If it were written today Little would be labeled racist. But perhaps this is a peek into days gone by when those types of derogatory slang terms were allowed. It was written 108 years ago.The story didn't grab me like I thought it would. Every three paragraphs the author switches to a new topic.

Of my extensive bead book collection, I rate this one at the bottom! The cover is very nice, which drew me in, in addition to the fact that there are few good books on bead embroidery. I hoped this book would fill the gap, but the content is seriously lacking. Not only is it not innovative,as advertised, but the instructions leave large holes. I'd say, go back to the drawing board. An illustration of a process really does require clear words to go with it. The problem begins in chapter one and does not get much better as the author continues on."},{"Title":"Beadweaving: New Needle Techniques & Original Designs","review":"I enjoyed this book. I found it beautiful to look at. It offers a wide variety of projects in beginner to experienced skill levels. The projects offered gave clear instructions and materials are readily available at craft or bead shops. I would recommend this book for someone just beginning to work with beads as well as the more experienced beader."},{"Title":"Beadweaving: New Needle Techniques & Original Designs","review":"This is basically a project book, with only brief explanations of the author's beadwork techniques. Since the book reviews emphasized the innovative aspects of her work, I was somewhat disappointed to see how little creative exploration was actually presented.Unfortunately, the projects themselves aren't to my taste. But that's not a criticism -- just an observation of personal preferences."},{"Title":"Beadweaving: New Needle Techniques & Original Designs","review":"I like this book for the varied concepts and color combinations chosen for the numerous projects.

A wonderful book to make many things.The shipping was unbelievably quick."},{"Title":"Beadweaving: New Needle Techniques & Original Designs","review":"I'm not sure why they say the needle techniques are new, since the first technique on offer is a basic square stitch altered to three beads at once instead of one at a time, a method that looks rough and unpolished even in the book's photos. The second is simple card beading. There are some nice projects, including pins, earrings, necklaces and hair combs, but nothing too exciting. It's a decent enough starter book for beginners, though skilled weavers should probably pass, as there's nothing new here."},{"Title":"Beadweaving: New Needle Techniques & Original Designs","review":"This is an incredible book with fabulous pictures and inspiration.

I am in my 20's and have been in a long distance relationship for over a year. We are constantly looking for resources to help us grow together spiritually. I was hesitant at first to get this devotional, thinking it would be too corny and geared just toward kids. But, I took a chance, and I'm so glad I did!The full-color pages include fun facts that coordinate with each day of the year--and a fact that ties in to that day's devotional. There are lead-in topics that range from Johnny Cash songs to Spider-Man to Penguin Awareness day to Silly Putty. And, best of all, each topic leads into a helpful spiritual truth with a few scriptures and references. Each day also includes a \\"To Do\\" suggestion for that day--like listening to a song, memorizing a verse, or thinking about a question it presents.I look forward to reading it every night, and it adds to my excitement about getting into the scriptures. We've discovered that we like to look ahead to the next day so we can sort of \\"celebrate\\" that day as it's happening. For example, today was \\"Opposite Day.\\"If you're looking for a fun, but relevant devotional, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"365 Trivia Twist Devotions","review":"Our family has used this book for a few years now, and my 15, 13, and 8 year-old still enjoy it!

The book received excellent reviews but a few flaws were picked up. Wriggins has corrected most of these drawbacks in this 2004 edition that has slightly changed name: \\"The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang\\" pointing the index more on the travel route than on the character. This change of title was probably an editorial choice since the Silk Road is presently an appealing subject.Fortunately, this book is really about Xuanzang, the 7th century Buddhist monk, that traveled for 16 years and 10,000 miles from China to India and back to quench his spiritual search for the perfect form of Buddhism (he himself later on founded a rationalist chinese sect that lasted a few years), to acquire and bring back the original buddhist texts to undertake a meticulous and truthful translation of what was to become the principal Chinese religion for years to come.Xuanzang's journey and adventures are retold and condensed from his original \\"The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions\\" that he wrote for the Emperor Taizong and his biography written by his disciple Hui-li and integrated by the Author's travels and studies, that however are never mentioned as such.Xuanzang's journey started from Chang-an (Xian) and through the Silk Road carried him to Tashkent, Samarkand, Balk to the Southern deviation to India. Here he stayed for many years visiting Buddha's sacred sites and practically all the Buddhist monasteries then existing. He also traveled down to Southern India, without however reaching Sri Lanka and after 13 years he started back loaded with manuscripts, artifacts and also a white elephant, gift of King Harasha. On the way he met kings and scholars, he entertained courts and monks, he saw all the important monuments and historical and religious sites of medieval India ed he thoroughly explored the various buddhist schools and sects until he gained spiritual and mental satisfaction of his curiosity.Describing Xuanzang's progress the book takes the leisure of inserting images (beautiful photographs and art reproductions), maps, legends and connections to other cultural contexts so that every page is a new discovery. Much of the pleasure I experienced reading this book was due to the beautiful figures appropriately inserted in the text and the precise and explicative notes. More than 80 pages are composed of notes, legends of figures, glossary and bibliography.Another word must be spent for Xuanzang's legacy that is magistrally explained. His adventurous journey gave way to a series of popular tales and legends that were successively written down during the sixteenth century in the \\"Journey to the West\\", translated into English by Waverly and known as \\"Monkey\\" and one of the best known Chinese novels of all times. The precise description he made of all his sightseeing has represented the scientific basis for archeological exploration in Central Asia and Northern India. His translations of Buddhist texts are still utilized today. He is a part of the collective memory of one nation and in this era of globalization of the whole world.I read this book right after Schafer's \\"The Golden Peaches of Samarkand\\" and it helped me to immagine the Tang times in a wider context. As noted by other reviewers the Author takes for granted a knowledge of Buddhist thought during that period. If you get confused, a good help if you don't have other texts available is \\"The Religions of the Silk Road\\" by Foltz that gives a summary excursion of religious thought of those times.This book posesses a rare quality and that is the capacity of stimulating curiosity for further reading on the subject. When finished reading we have a complete knowledge of Xuanzang as a man, and we can't but admire his integrity, intelligence and culture but at the same time the small excerpta of his original writing inserted in the book are not enough to really satisfy our curiosity, so further reading is ahead!P.S. If you like books that narrate old travelers journeys without having to read the whole ancient texts read \\"The Adventures of Ibn Battuta\\" by Dunn, that in many ways remembers \\"The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang\\"."},{"Title":"The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang","review":"I picked up Wriggins' book mainly out of interest of the Silk Road itself. The book recounts the journeys of a Chinese Buddhist monk named Xuanzang in the 600's that travels a fantastic distance from China to the deepest corners of India in search of answers to his metaphysical questions.I would have preferred a little more engaging of an account (such as perhaps Undaunted Courage by Ambrose), as Wriggins tends to describe each location and circumstance only briefly and then moves on with the narrative. On occasion, a few of the accounts are descriptive and moving, but on the whole, it reads more like a lecture in a history course.This is a detailed book that will help readers interested particularly in the impact Xuanzang made on Imperial China and the world of Chinese Buddhism because of his travels and experiences. For an engaging travel narrative or for a more vivid picture of the Silk Road itself, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang","review":"A criticism of the book (that is relevant to most general readership books today), is that the title does not exactly reflect the content.This work is primarily about Xuanzang (Hsuan-tsang) the man -- what we know about his character from the extant sources, what his motivations were in leaving China, the content of his itinerary, important people he met, his hardships, triumphs, and the intellectual, spiritual, and cultural legacy he left behind. The book is next about Buddhism: it explores Xuanzang's exploration through the various scriptures of the different schools of Buddhist thought, his impressions on the \\"best\\" ideas of each, and then comments on the regional forms of Buddhism practiced and the various Buddhist monuments and sites of pilgrimage he visits along his journey.The sequence of events in Xuanzang's sojourn is of course narrated according to his progress along the Silk Road, but this is not a book about the Silk Road proper or its history; however, within its central, biographical framework, the book offers a brief discussion of the historical geography and regional political history of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.Aurel Stein described Xuanzang as a \\"Buddhist Pausanias\\" for the depth, accuracy and quality of his geographical narrative. The primary motivation of this work seems to have been to make an argument for Xuanzang as a scholar and translator (and to show the impact this had on Chinese Buddhism and philosophy), not just as a geographer or a politico-cultural historian, as he is usually remembered. However the book spends only a short time discussing this toward the end, as an epilogue.Following on the previous review, the author's voice is indeed rarely extant in the text until this epilogue, as she prefers to narrate the substance of Xuanzang's experiences rather than discuss her own. In this sense I would call the writing skillful, engaging, and easy to read, not dry and dull.The intended audience seems to be those that know something about Buddhism, but are not familiar with Xuanzang or his immense importance to Chinese thought. The work serves as a charming introduction to the man, but it assumes a general knowledge of Silk Road and Buddhist history. The book does a good job of providing brief, but interesting details to the informed reader, but also will not overwhelm a general reader who is unfamiliar with the more important Buddhist sutra or the differences between Buddhist schools.Copious footnotes to the text, and endnotes that discuss the plates, are accompanied by a topical, selected bibliography that invites the reader to expand into the specialist material. The text does not suffer from undue editorial or grammatical flaws, which is nice to see.A very tight and thorough manuscript; four stars given for a fine introduction to the history of Xuanzang."},{"Title":"The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang","review":"In The Silk Road Journey with Xuanzang, Sally Wriggins gives a detailed account of a seventh-century Chinese Buddhist monk--Xuanzang--on his sixteen year journey to India. Her book provides a very approachable narrative account of Xuanzang's journey that is as thorough as it is easy to read. Still, her project is nevertheless beset by theoretical problems concerning her portrayal of Indian religions. Wriggins' comparison between Buddhism and Christianity is done in a haphazard and problematic way that naturalizes Christianity as human religion par excellence. The way the book proceeds seems to assume that Christianity is the benchmark against which all other religions should be measured. While Wriggins no doubt intended these comparisons to make her readers more comfortable, they often do little to improve the reader's understanding and function only as a way of setting up Christianity as 'natural' religion. Furthermore, Wriggins romanticizes Indian religion (and perhaps even the Indian subcontinent as a whole) as ahistorical spirituality. Wriggins clumsily claims that \\"spiritual realities, as so often happens in India, tend to overwhelm the particularity of historical details\\" (p.99). Her characterization of India as eschewing historical detail in favor of \\"spiritual realities\\" risks portraying India as a romanticized, super-historical, spiritual land; to do so is to essentialize and de-legitimize Indian history, pigeonholing the entire subcontinent's heritage as primarily 'spiritual.'Though she has produced a laudably thorough and accessible account of Xuanzang's journey, Wriggins would do well to nuance her discussion of Indian religion to avoid these problems."},{"Title":"The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang","review":"A comprehensive survey would be more than most readers would be interested in or have time for. This author has a colloquial writing style that kept me turning page after page."},{"Title":"The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang","review":"This was the first book I read in preparation for a trip to parts of the Silk Road. I knew nothing about Xuanzang before this and after reading it didn't think much of him, or his story. It was only after reading other books that referred back to his journey and the impact his history had on China and the image of the silk road that I became more interested.Unfortunately Wiggin's apparent passion for Xuanzang's story does not translate into a narrative that reflects on the journey, analyses the realities of it against the legend, or gives any more than the most basic supplemental details about the regions he traveled through. It's not a book that provides insights about the silk road, buddhism in China and Central Asia, or for that matter India in the period in which Xuanzang travelled. Nor is it a book that takes a critical look at the historical realities of what Xuanzang describes. Instead, similar to what I have read of Marco Polo's recounting of his own trip, it gives random facts and musings that to those with little knowledge of Xuanzang seem disjointed and without context, leaving more questions than answers.Xuanzang really is a fascinating individual and an extremely important cultural figure in Chinese history, and I would have to recommend looking elsewhere for real insight into who and what he was."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Bierce brings us a collection of definitions that highlight the more interesting institutions of our society - religion, government, marriage, death ... all with a twist that will make you laugh, make you think ... or make you mad.

L. Mencken of the 19th century (or Mencken was the Bierce of the 20th century). His timeless and ego-deflating observations of Homo Sapiens reminds us that today's 21st century politics and pop culture were well-known to this 1842-born iconoclast. For instance, he defined a conservative as, \\"A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others\\" (1993 p.18). He defined a homeopathist as \\"The humorist of the medical profession\\" (p.51). He defined a clairvoyant as \\"A person, commonly a woman, who has the power of seeing that which is invisible to her patron-- namely, that he is a blockhead (p.16).

He was awarded the nicknames 'Bitter Bierce', 'the Devil's Lexographer', and 'the Wickedest Man in San Francisco'. It is a compilation of Bierce's favourite definitions from his magazine, the Sting. They remain cuttingly true today, although they were written at the end of the nineteenth century. For example:Monday, noun. In Christian countries, the day after the baseball game.Monkey, noun. An aboreal animal which makes itself at home in genealogical trees.The Devil's Dictionary is great not only as bathroom reading, but in helping one muddle through today's society. I only wish Bierce had written more.More, adjective. The comparative degree of too much."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"The Devil's Dictionary is the first book by Ambrose Bierce I've read and I think it's one of the most brilliant in American literature. It is timeless in a rare, hilarious way, yet chances are you have never heard of it unless you are an AmLit scholar working on satire or found it by chance like I did while prowling the web for free ebooks.Bierce took no prisoners; the book is both politically incorrect and timeless. This is not a contradiction in terms. It is as relevant now as it was a hundred years ago, and will remain relevant and funny for centuries to come, because human character doesn't change on such small time scales. By the standards Bierce sets to intelligent humor and satire, Mark Twain is a bumbling schoolboy and whoever spawned South Park is an aspiring amoeba.In a different country, The Devil's Dictionary would be taught in school and university, and the author would have streets and landmarks named after him. (I know, because I'm from such a country, and we have a Bierce equivalent who lived in the same period and is now considered a classic.) The reason why \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" is virtually unknown, ignored in the classroom, and excluded from the list of American classics is that the US is such a God-fearing country. There are two obstacles to this book being afforded its rightful place among the best in American lit: the devil in the title and the atheism of the author. (One can only guess what Bierce would have written after putting together the Biblical story of Jesus throwing the businessmen out of the temple and the decision to inscribe \\"In God We Trust\\" on American money, for example. Ambrose, we need you so badly!)"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"The Devil has nothing on Bierce, (except maybe a pretty good blackmail file with color photographs). Bierce plays with the English language and presents his cynical and humorous view of the world. Biting satire would be appropriate here if the use of an ordinary dictionary were permitted. With Bierce's included definition: \\"Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the authors enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness.\\" However, this book isn't obsolete, but becomes more evidently true as time goes on. An excellent list of definitions that insult everyone in general and everyone in particular. This book is a necessary tool to carry in your pocket and correct people's definitions at cocktail parties. You could tell people the definition of a Saint, 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited'. Someone should start a movement to canonize Bierce, since he qualifies for Sainthood by his own definition."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"This book is an absolute gem, and here is a wonderfully cheap edition, even allowing for conversion to non-USA currency. I like to go to sleep with a smile on my face, and this little tome was my bedtime reading for a while. Yes, I laughed my head off every night. Bierce's biting wit and skill with language are such a joy. His observations are as relevant now as when they were written, which was quite a long time ago. I particularly enjoyed his comments on religious and church matters. I have already given a copy to a friend who shares my love of language and wit.

Sometimes he is shocking--but hilarious!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Ambrose Bierce was unique in being the only major writer to have served in combat during the American Civil War. In fact, he was actually invalided out of the Army after being shot in the head, and only after that did he become a writer. Perhaps his experiences in the war generally, and that catastrophic wound in particular, did something to his mind, because his writing remains unparalleled in the annals of dark, sardonic wit.Not least among the products of Bierce's twisted view of the world is his famous (or perhaps one should say infamous) \\"Devil's Dictionary\\". Like most of Bierce's work, the diabolical entries in his dictionary originally appeared in a series of newspaper articles, and only later were collated into a single volume.Bierce was primarily a journalist and short story writer, who did not write novels, and perhaps that explains the principal reason why he is not as well remembered today as are many of his lesser literary contemporaries. The fact that his \\"Devil's Dictionary\\" defines the novel as \\"A short story padded\\" speaks volumes of the author's disdain towards that particular literary form.Nevertheless, no person who considers himself truly literate and educated can afford not to be acquainted with the work of the incomparable Bierce, and most particularly with his unique \\"Devil's Dictionary\\"."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I've got several editions of this, most recently on my Kindle.

Bierce is satirical and puts his finger right on the nub of the thing!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I first acquired this book about five years ago, after reading Bierce's fictional works. I could not put it down. You don't read this book sequentially, but rather it is a book to leaf through, stopping where you find a word that interests you. With the format of a dictionary, Bierce sets up the look and feel of the official word, which is what we expect from a dictionary. Then, reading the definitions, you at first think, &quot;Bierce is being a wise guy.&quot; But after a few more definitions, you realize that Bierce is actually delivering a concise treatise on Western Culture by giving you a shot-by-shot commentary, using as his basis the essential element of any society -- its language. Birece may not have realized it when he wrote the book, but The Devil's Dictionary aligns with some 21st-century literary experimentations with concise presentation, irony, and non-linear exploration. Even reading it non-linearly, however, you soon find you've read every entry in the book. Then, of course, you'll want to start again...My favorites are the definitions pertaining to religion."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Beginning in 1881 and continuing to 1906, Ambrose Bierce created a series of sardonic word definitions of his own. Many of these were collected and published as The Cynic's Word Book, which he later protested was \\"a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve.\\" So in 1911, he pulled together a collection that was more to his own liking and called it The Devil's Dictionary. The entries are a tad uneven in quality, but most are amusing and some are great. Each reader will have his own favorites, some of mine are as follows : ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know well enough to borrow from, but not well enough to lend to. A degree of friendship called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate when he is rich or famous. ALLIANCE, n. In international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third. BIGOT, n. One who is obstinately and zealously attached to an opinion that you do not entertain. BORE, n. A person who talks when you wish him to listen. CONSULT, v.i. To seek another's disapproval of a course already decided on. CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision. DICTIONARY, n. A malevolent literary device for cramping the growth of a language and making it hard and inelastic. This dictionary, however, is a most useful work. DISCRIMINATE, v.i. To note the particulars in which one person or thing is, if possible, more objectionable than another. EDUCATION, n. That which discloses to the wise and disguises from the foolish their lack of understanding. FUTURE, n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper, our friends are true and our happiness is assured. HISTORY, n. An account mostly false, of events mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers mostly knaves, and soldiers mostly fools.... A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling... He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable. He sets the fashions and opinion of taste, dictates the limitations of speech and circumscribes conduct with a dead-line. POLITICS, n. A strife of interests masquerading as a contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private advantage. And, my choice for the very best among them : CONSERVATIVE, n. A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others. By all means, read it and pick out your own; you're sure to find a few that tickle your fancy. GRADE : A"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"'The Devil's Dictionary' is an interesting, very intellectually cynical collection of proposed definitions to words collected by Ambrose Gwinett Bierce, a journalist, writer, Civil War veteran, and general misanthrope, who disappeared without a trace in Mexico about 1914.

Bierce delights in irreverence and poking fun at all aspects of life.Bierce's own definition of dictionary gives some insight into his general thought patterns:'Dictionary, n.

This dictionary, however, is a most useful work.'This would lead us to conclude (most correctly) that Bierce is a world-class cynic. What is a cynic?'Cynic, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic's eyes to improve his vision.'Originally published under the title 'The Cynic's Word Book', most of the definitions in this book originally appeared as part newspaper columns. There have been many imitators, but this is the first and finest collection. Arranged as a dictionary, it provides an interesting writer's tool for finding a unique perspective on words and phrases. There are more than 1000 entries. A few examples include:'Outdo, v.t., To make an enemy.''Universalist, n. One who foregoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.'Fair warning -- those who do not like cynicism and scathing wit will find this book irritating, and sometimes offensive. Bierce is a product of his generation; political correctness wasn't in vogue then, and, even if it had been, Bierce would have been one of the sharpest critics.As a Christian priest, I take great delight in the insights from Bierce's criticism of religion in general, and Christianity in particular.'Christian, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin.'Why does this ring so true? Of course, there is the old adage that if you scratch a cynic, you'll find an idealist. Bierce would undoubtedly have described himself as a realist, but buried beneath many layers of cynicism, one can sense the idealism.Why did Bierce go to Mexico? Perhaps his underlying idealism led him to a country that was awash in revolutionary ideas; perhaps those ideas are what cost him his life. Perhaps he went underground? It is possible we will never know.The publisher of this volume, one of but many reprints of the text over time, says: 'The caustic aphorisms collected in \\"The Devil's Dictionary\\" helped earn Ambrose Bierce the epithets Bitter Bierce, the Devil's Lexicographer, and the Wickedest Man in San Francisco. The words he shaped into verbal pitchforks a century ago--with or without the devil's help--can still draw blood today.'This book is very useful for generating ideas for writing and reflection. It is a good counterpoint to 'guides to positive thinking' kinds of material, and can serve as a tempering agent on such collections."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"I'd skip this and purchase the UNABRIDGED version. Some of the definitions left out in this version are among Bierce's best. Also, the complete work is not so long: no reason to abridge something that in full length is only 100 or so pages long."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Bierce's misanthropy and glorious cynicism remain a breath of fresh air, never having lost their ring of truth for the better part of a century. His aversion for hypocrisy, formal education (He was of humble origins and self-educated), and religious self-righteousness are appropriately barbed. His disillusionment with concepts such as patriotism (&quot;The first refuge of a scoundrel&quot;), are particularly interesting, considering his rural midwestern upbringing and heroic service in the Civil War. The most consistent and I think interesting theme throughout this volume is his disdain for the institution of marriage. Long before marriage was seen by many as a burden and divorce became unstigmatized and commonplace, Bierce's definition seems prophetic for his time: &quot;An institution consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all two.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"This edition doesn't obliterate all the merits of a literary classic, but it comes remarkably close.Do yourself and Ambrose Bierce a favor: purhcase a copy of The Devil's Dictionary put out by a reputable publisher instead. Whoever released this version didn't see fit to identify themselves, possibly for fear of crmininal proscecution. Defiling a literary masterpiece may not be a crime in the United States, but this release makes a good case for it becoming one.Overlooking the fact no biographical or editorial information was deemed necessary for inclusion, the thugs involved in this crime weren't even responsible enough to check the accuracy of the text. In one instance, the use of the word \\"is\\" for \\"if\\" is obvious enough for the reader to reconstruct Mr. Bierce's original intention, but in other cases, his words are so carelessly mangled, his meaning is beyond comphrehension.As written by Ambrose Bierce, The Devil's Dicionary is a uniquely wonderful reading experience. If I could rate this version with a negative number, I would gladly do so. As it is, one star will have to do. Avoid this at all costs."},{"Title":"The Devil's Dictionary","review":"Ambrose Bierce was a man of many distinctions - writer, journalist, humorist, and Civil War veteran. We all remember reading his classic story &quot;An Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge&quot; in eighth grade English class. Bierce is best known for his ghoulish horror tales, which were on a par with Edgar Allan Poe, but his greatest work was The Devil's Dictionary. A scathing parody of Webster's dictionary, Bierce's volume was a showcase for his brilliant, caustic wit. This is Bierce at his best, mixing comedy with social commentary, unleashing his anarchistic convictions to the hilt! Bierce blasts away at God and country and all that is respected and proper. He defines patriot as &quot;the dupe of statesmen and the tool of conquerors&quot;, a Conservative as &quot;a statesman who is enamored of existing evils&quot; and a clergyman as &quot;a man who undertakes the management of our spiritual affairs as a method of bettering his temporal ones&quot; and so on. Nothing is sacred and no one is safe in this classic work of 19th century American literature which continues to attract just as much controversy and outrage today as it did when it was first published.

Bierce has a sharp wit and a cynic's eye and he uses both well in this anything but ordinary dictionary. Not all of the definitions are funny, but the majority of them really take no prisoners and it is very good at pointing out the little things we all still see in this modern day and age -- those little things we think to ourselves but dare not say outloud.The only problem with it is that, true to its time, there are some racist and mysogynistic overtones to some of the definitions [the only reason it didn't get a full five]. But if you can see around these as simple dating of the text to the acerbic, razor sharp wit that permiates the pages of this book you're sure to get a good snicker or two out of it yourself.My personal favourite?

The UGA edition contains a dry, academic history of the work and includes appendices featuring notes and additional definitions that Bierce himself chose to omit when he supervised the 1911 publication of his collected works. There's really not much need for a pricier copy. In fact, the Dover edition's format is superior in its use of boldface for the word entries and a smaller typeface to present Bierce's illustrative stories, poems and quotations. Like the author, it is also a triumph of economy, taking only 139 pages to present the exact core content that the UGA edition requires over 100 more to set forth (with its use of larger fonts and broader line spacing).Buy the maximum three copies of the Dover for the price of one of the other editions and give the other two away.

Jeez."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I spent some time trying to find out why this potboiler turned literature is called \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" since at no place in the novel is a postman even mentioned. At first I thought it might be an echo of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh, dreamt up by Knopf, Cain's publisher, to lend some literary pretension to a novel they weren't sure about; but that play wasn't written until some years after Postman was published in 1934. It was recently suggested to me (by Joseph Feinsinger, one of Amazon.com's best reviewers of literature) that it might be a rejoinder for the saying \\"opportunity knocks only once,\\" which was the sort of pabulum given to out of work people during the depression. Cain's original title was \\"Bar-B-Que,\\" which is entirely appropriate for a couple of reasons (the caf&eacute;, the burning car), but was perhaps a little too morbid for Knopf's sensibilities.At any rate, the title finally chosen is somewhat magical as is the novel itself, the first of Cain's hard-boiled, loser tales that somehow caught the imagination and psyche of depression America. Re-reading the novel today one wonders why, but then again, I can see why.First there's the raw sex with Frank forcing himself onto Cora, biting her lip, etc. and she loving it, that was somewhat shocking for its time. Ditto for the spontaneous sex they have in the dirt outside the car after Frank has beamed Nick. Then there is the fascination we have with stupid people doing vile deeds rather clumsily (with whom we might identify). But more than anything else it's the style. Cain raised the dime novel to something amazing with his no nonsense, no time to chat, no description beyond the absolutely necessary--a pared-down to raw flesh and bones writing style that made even some of the icons of literature sit up and take notice. Edmund Wilson, long the dean of American literary critics, was intrigued by the novel, as was Franklin P Adams who called it \\"the most engrossing, unlaydownable book that I have any memory of.\\" (Quoted from Paul Skenazy's critical work, James M. Cain (1989), pp. 20-21). And Albert Camus said that his internationally famous masterpiece The Stranger was based in part on Postman. The alternate English title, \\"The Outsider,\\" perhaps reveals its debt to Cain more clearly. Today the sex seems rather tame and the terse style seems almost a burlesque, having been so often imitated. I personally think that Cain, who was a one-time editor of The New Yorker and a relatively sophisticated literary man, was actually taking Hemingway's primer-prose style to its logical conclusion by simply cutting out all of Hemingway's poetic repetitions and anything else that didn't move the plot.Well, how well does this stand up after almost seventy years? It was made into two movies, a 1946 version starring John Garfield and Lana Turner and a 1981 version starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, which you might want to compare. You can read the novel faster than you can watch either movie. I read it in an hour and I'm no speed reader. There was also a play and, believe it or not, an opera. The atmosphere is suburban naturalistic, set in the environs of Glendale, California, just north of L.A. where there really are (or mostly were) oak trees. (The name of the caf&eacute; is the Twin Oaks.) The story is a little confused in parts, and a little unlikely elsewhere (Cora really would not be such an adept at gun toting, and the Frank would not be so quick to fall for the D.A.'s line of chatter and turn on Cora, nor could Nick be quite so blind to the hanky-panky going on behind his back). But what Cain got so, so very right was the underlying psychology. This is a classic triangle, the old guy with the resources who can't cut the mustard anymore with a young wife who longs for love, a little excitement and to be rid of \\"that greasy Greek.\\" Even deeper (and this is characteristic of Cain) is the suggestion that Nick encouraged Frank and kept him around, using his presence to spice up his own libido. Furthermore, Frank is a kind of depression-era anti-hero, who beat up on the hated railway dicks, the kind of guy who has become a film noir staple, a man who acts out his basic desires in an amoral, animalistic way. I see woman. I take woman. I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry, and sleep when I run out of gas, a kind of natural man on the run, the kind of guy we think we would like to be for a change (a brief change) in our daydreams around two p.m. on a blue Monday afternoon.Cain followed this up with Double Indemnity (using some insurance fraud research he had left over). Double Indemnity appeared as a serial in Liberty magazine after being rejected by Redbook. It was also made into a classic Billy Wilder movie starring Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson in 1944 a year after it finally appeared in book form.Cain, along with Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Nathanael West and later Ross MacDonald created a kind of southern California milieu that Hollywood has mined again and again with such postmodern films as, e.g., Chinatown (1974) and L.A. Confidential (1997). Read this (during lunch) for its historical value as a precursor of film noir and the hard-boiled detective novel."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Whenever the question of the origin of the &quot;hardboiled&quot; school of detective literature comes up in conversation, three names always get mentioned: Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and James Cain. Hammett was the master of the character, Chandler of the atmosphere.And Cain was the master of the plot. Not in the sense of trying to tease us with the &quot;whodunit&quot; like the great British talespinners; Cain's books are not mysteries in the true sense of the word, because we usually know almost from the outset Who Done It. But Cain will keep you on the edge of your seat following the incredible turns of fate that his characters experience. And perhaps that's the key to Cain, not only in this book but in all of his others: the real major character is an unfriendly fate, which sooner or later destroys the protagonists. Cain's stories are ugly - his characters are all either ugly and stupid or ugly and clever - and perhaps this is the ugliest story he ever wrote.Hollywood was always both fascinated and repulsed by Cain; Warner Brothers made &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; into a movie, but only after they turned it over to Rayond Chandler to do the screenplay and &quot;sanitize&quot; it (Billy Wilder got screenplay credits along with Chandler, but the book was Cain's; it's more than worth a read too). &quot;Postman&quot; has been made into a movie twice, and while both versions are admirable each in their own way, neither one of them manages to express the utter futility of life, and the sense of just how amoral the average man can be in the right situation, that are the hallmarks of Cain's work.I think it's not the sex in his novels (of which there is some, but tame stuff by modern standards) that made Cain unsettling in his day, but rather this sense of futility, and that is why Hollywood, and society in general, had a hard time accepting Cain as a mainstream writer. Great? Yes. Give him a read - it's like watching a train wreck. It's horrible, but you can't take your eyes off it."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"When I was 12 I climbed on board something called The Texas Cliffhanger at Six Flags Over Texas. It was a small four or five person bench with a cage around it that lifted us something like five stories into the air. Then it pushed us forward and dropped us. The entire ride lasted maybe a minute, but I never forgot it and I by God knew I&#8217;d had a thrill. The Postman Always Rings Twice is no different. It is wild and one of the shortest novels I&#8217;ve ever read. But believe me, I know I&#8217;ve read a novel.Not only is the book short, its pace rarely relents. There is not an overabundance of description or other literary devices. It slams the door, straps you in and drives you to the end. And you get there fast with no detours and no fluff and nothing extra, just the point. You rip right through piles of mistrust and angst and murder and love and passion and lies and truths and you end in reality. And for Cain, reality is a cold floor and a long walk and a knotted rope swinging in the wind.I believe this novel started a whole line of fiction and movies that continues to this day. First and most obvious, the noir genre has its roots here. The colloquial speech, the first person narrative, the looker dames who are in where they ought not be &#8211; it&#8217;s all here. Second, the love triangle involving a drifter and a young woman married or indentured to an older, wealthy man....I&#8217;d recommend this one wholeheartedly. Not just for its place in literary history, but for the pure joy of a good read. Lie back and let it take you for a quick thrill."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This is a book that never gives you a chance to catch your breath. More happens in 116 pages in this book than in most 500-page novels that I have read. James Cain doesn't mess around with flowery prose or deep narrative insights into the characters or the period or anything else. His writing is strictly minimalist, and that gives this book its raw, gritty feeling. You don't learn much about what's going on from some detached, third-person narrator. Instead, you get up close and personal with the characters themselves, who are all complex and fascinating.Much of this book is dialog, often extending for pages without even a \\"he said\\" or \\"she said\\" interspersed between lines. Cain has a real gift for getting at the heart of his characters through dialog. The voices of the characters are so expressive that you really don't need much narration to get a good sense of what these people are all about.At the heart of this story is an illicit love affair and a murder. There is an uncomfortable tension throughout the book, so strong that I wanted to put the book down at times to wipe the sweat off my forehead and let my pulse return to a normal rate."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Unlike the detective fiction of Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Hammett's Sam Spade, James M. Cain's brand of noir in \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is concerned more with the drama behind the crime than with the investigation of it.The novel begins with a flurry of premonitions: A dangerous young drifter named Frank Chambers stops for a bite to eat at a California roadside lunchroom owned by an affable but naive Greek named Nick Papadakis and his much younger, beautiful wife Cora. Frank accepts a job offer from Nick and almost immediately begins an affair with Cora, who confides to Frank that Nick disgusts her and she feels trapped in her marriage. She suggests that the only way out is to kill Nick, and Frank, who really doesn't have anything personal against his new boss, decides to go along with it.After a false start, Frank and Cora finally manage to carry out their crime, although not without a significant amount of bodily sacrifice. Of course they tell the police that Nick's death was an accident, but the District Attorney is suspicious of the circumstances -- particularly when it is discovered that Nick had a considerable insurance policy on his life. From this point on, Cain uses the principle of poetic justice to ensure that Frank and Cora pay for their crime through their arrogance and foolishness.Frank, Cora, and Nick make an interesting love triangle. Situations in their lives seem to have brought them together partially because of their relative stupidity -- for a guy who's spent his life on the road, Frank shows he even lacks street smarts when he gets suckered by an obvious pool shark; indeed, a story like this relies on fundamentally stupid characters. Nick, of course, never suspects his wife is having an affair; he's just a simple immigrant who's proud and grateful to be living the American dream of owning his own business. The smartest character turns out to be Cora's lawyer, Katz, who probably guesses the truth about Nick's \\"accident\\" right away but knows he'll make out like a bandit no matter what happens to his client.The characterization, mood, and style of this novel reveal the source of noir fiction: When the corruption and violence of the '20s erupted into the squalor and desperation of the Depression of the '30s, noir must have emerged naturally as the time's most representative artistic expression. Here we have characters who are so poor and hopeless that they're desperate enough to do anything and violent enough to turn to crime."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This is a book you read once and can't stop thinking about. It's what I call a 'blue book', one that is soulful and strangely mellow. It actually makes me feel like I'm underneath a very shady tree on a sunny day. Reason being that the light is very blue green, so a 'blue' book.Before I try to make sense of this, let's continue.Frank Chambers is a young drifter who rolls into town, goes to work in a diner for Nick, a tough Greek, falls for Nick's young wife Cora, then decides, with Cora's help, to murder Nick and take over the restaurant. What should be simple becomes more complex. The first murder attempt fails, the second one is successful but easy to see through. With the help of a very smart and very crooked lawyer, both Frank and Cora are soon free. That, really, is where the problems start.Frank and Cora love and hate each other fiercely, speaking with remarkably accurate, real dialogue. Cain doesn't even attribute his dialogue, so pay close attention to who's speaking. The book is mostly just people talking, in very real language, full of slang and fragmented sentences. It's like listening to a REALLY interesting conversation.Frank and Cora are two very small, unremarkable, inconsequential people caught up in something too big for them to understand. They mistake happiness and hope for lust, hate, anger and even apathy. And just when things look alright, one little, honest accident washes it all away. This book shows us how fragile everything is, or at least how fragile it can be. That's what elevates this to the level of tragedy. This is something to live with and dwell upon, something you can never quite shake off, no matter how hard you try.(...)"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This novel was another stunner from Cain. Set out in a then country area of California, outside of LA in the early 1940s, most of the action takes place at a diner on the main highway. This too involves a wife very unhappy with her husband, Cora with Nick. She finds a possible way out of her life with this brutish husband when drifter Frank comes into the diner and hangs around doing odd jobs for them. The couple plot to kill Nick so that they can end up with the diner and each other. There was one movie version done by John Garfield and Lana Turner in the 1940s that was absolutely faithful to the book. There was a 2nd version in the 1980s with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange that deviated somewhat from the novel, especially towards the end. I enjoyed both film versions equally and would highly recommend them. A Cain novel is very hard to put down once you've started and the man used no excess words. He too was an expert at looking at the best and worst of people as brought out by crime and its punishment."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James M. Cain, along with Chandler and Hammett, really created the literary genre which would be turned into film noir. One revels in the image of Cain, who was himself an insurance adjustor, sitting at his desk dreaming up the perfect murders which form the basis of his novels.In Postman, Frank Chambers interrupts his cross country rambling at a diner owned by Nick Papadakis after getting one look at Nick's wife, Cora. That first look conveys everything we need to know about the relationship between men and women in noir fiction, &quot;Except for the shape, she really wasn't any raving beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips stuck out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her.&quot;Frank and Cora become lovers and are soon plotting to murder Nick, but find they don't trust one another and &quot;Love, once you get fear in it, turns to hate.&quot;As the novel closes, Frank is on Death Row. One of the other inmates theorizes about the sub-conscious and how he's not responsible for his crime. But Frank says, &quot;To hell with the sub-conscious. I don't believe it. It's just a lot of hooey, that this guy thought up so he could fool the judge. You know what you're doing and you do it.&quot; This is another quintessential element of American noir--the &quot;heroes&quot; are not victims of the psyche; they are knowing actors &amp; when the time inevitably comes to pay for their sins, they accept punishment stoically, knowing that they deserve it for their evil deeds. There's an important lesson here, as we close the Century which saw a sustained assault by the partisans of Freud and Marx upon the notion of personal responsibility.To quote the immortal philosopher Baretta, &quot;don't do the crime, if you can't do the time.&quot;GRADE: A"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Time does not diminish that incredible book. It is better than either movie. The narrative keeps you moving until you just have to finish it."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"The Postman Always rings Twice is an Americal classic--a great book by any standard. Cain's plot for the book is simple enough: an immoral hustler who lives by his wits gets in cahoots with an equally desperate and amibtious woman who is seeking to escape her loveless marriage.Cain's book is remarkable for its suspensful account of a well laid out murder plan that succeeds but doesn't bring the two perpetrators much happiness. The book stands out for its blunt and realistic portrayal of vicious criminal behavior.It's helpful to know that Cain was a screenwriter in Hollywood before he wrote the book. That I think is the reason for his sharp dialogues, some of which will stick with you forever! Cain's great dialgoue writing skills are a key factor in keepign the action tight throughout the many twists and turns of the book.I haven't seen either of the movies based on this book, for one reason or another. Surprisingly, I've read this book atleast a half adozen times and the book has left an indelible impression on me.

CainGenre: Mystery/Suspense (Hardboiled)Plot Summary:A drifter, Frank Chambers, wanders into a roadside filling station and cafe where he is offered a job by the owner, Greek immigrant Nick Papadakis. Frank quickly becomes involved with Cora, Nick's sexy wife, and the lovers decide to do away with Nick before they hit the road together. Things, however, do not go as planned, and the two find themselves behind bars. The plot begins to twist and turn as Frank and Cora become pawns in a bitter rivalry between an overzealous DA and a mysterious defense attorney.Geographical Setting: Outskirts of Los AngelesTime Period: 1930'sSeries: NoneAppeal Characteristics:Expect the unexpected in this classic of the hardboiled genre. Cain is a master of suspense and this short, easy read will keep you wondering what will happen next. The prose is stripped bare. Do not expect much description of the scenery or character development. Still, despite a lack of characterization, you will become emotionally invested in the lives of the two main characters and hope that they will find a way to survive together. The story is told through the eyes of the anti-hero, and the reader gets a dose of dramatic irony as it becomes apparent that he is not as wily as he thinks he is. At times the plot twists can seem a little contrived, and realism is sometimes sacrificed in order to keep the story jumping. However, the story is so engrossing that you will not have time to sulk.Read-Alikes:Fans of this book should try other novels by the author, such as \\"Double Indemnity,\\" \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" and \\"Serenade.\\" Other writers in the hard boiled genre would also be of interest. Dashiell Hammett, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler will give you similar reads, but from a detective's perspective. For more tales told by the criminal, see \\"After Dark, My Sweet,\\" \\"A Hell of a Woman,\\" or \\"The Grifters\\" by Jim Thompson. All of these books are written with a minimal amount of verbiage and give you a window into the criminal mind.Red Flags:Violence and sex are prevalent throughout the novel, although neither are depicted graphically. Casual racism and mysogyny are also present."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Like reading about crimes of passion? This is it! Like a hard punch between the eyes. Cain was a master at this type of sordid tale. Noone does it better. Noone."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I had to read this book for my AP English class as summer reading. I usually hate the books that my school makes me read. However, right from the first page, it had me hooked. Cain uses simplistic style and makes it easy to read and a very fast-paced book. Only problem is that you have to get used to the way he writes. Cain usually does not supply information in regards to who is speaking and it gets confusing after one quote follows another without speaker information. The way Cain writes captures the reader and makes the reader want to read even more of the book. Instantly, readers will connect with one of the characters. That's what makes the book so special. It's a good read for anyone into crime kind of books."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Despite only taking a few hours to complete, this was as intense and exciting as any crime novel I've read. James M. Cain manages to squeeze a whole novel's worth of characters, plot twists, and emotions into only 116 pages. Like Ernest Hemingway, Cain employs a minimalistic writing style to fashion uneducated, \\"simple\\" characters with complex emotional undercurrents. He knows when to understate a scene and when to use vivid, erotic images to shock his readers. His pacing is nearly flawless, except for one awkward scene with the briefly-mentioned Madge Allen character. And the conclusion, while somewhat of a cliche, is typical of the best 1930's roman noir fiction.The only reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 4 is that I wish Cain had added more dialogue and development scenes at the beginning to show how Frank and Cora fell in love and fed off each other's neuroses."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Say you were reading the thoughts of OJ Simpson. Similarly, James Cain has given us the thoughts of a man driven by passion to possess a woman and willing to pay any price to do it. She encourages his passion, and plots with him to kill her own husband. The writing is crisp, honed down to the bone, and erotic for its time. What raises this murder story above the average for me was the interplay of the judicial system with the lovers. Although the trials did not establish the truth of what happened, a weird justice resulted. The district attorney and defense counsel here put John Grisham's cardboard cutouts to shame. A quick read, a fun read, a guilty pleasure."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"It always seems that the best books are full of cliches. Then again, they needed to become cliches somewhere right? That's the pantheon of books that The Postman Always Rings Twice sits in. This film noir classic sets the stage for most of what follows in the genre, and with good reason as it cuts a story of romance, revenge, anger, and the human condition that sucks you in and refuses to let go."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"You have probably heard a book described as one \\"you couldn't put down.\\" Mostly that just means that the reader did not want to put it down because it was so good, not that he actually didn't put it down. Well, this is a book that I literally did not put down. I started while eating my breakfast and didn't stop until I had finished it.This is a noir story in the tradition of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, but it is written from the viewpoint of the amoral murderer, rather than from the viewpoint of the detective. The narrator is a young drifter, who becomes romantically involved with a sullenly sexy young wife who is physically repulsed by her older Greek husband. The situation seems to the two lovers to have only one solution, but it takes them two tries to accomplish their bloody goal. And that is only the beginning of the story.This is a really creepy book--the only thing I can think to compare it to is the Ripley books by Patricia Highsmith, also about an amoral murderer. And it is absolutely riveting. I can't figure how Cain did this, writing about such despicable characters. While I was reading, the characters seemed absolutely alive to me. I completely surrendered myself.Dashiell Hammett said about this book, \\"A good, swift, violent story.\\" That pretty much sums it up."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I liked this story because it was ironic - like life. They managed to get off on the first occasion when they tried to kill the Greek (and even got $10,000 insurance money out of it); they even got off on the second occasion when they had killed the Greek. But, on the occasion when they were supposed to be setting off for a life together, and nobody was meant to get hurt, the girl ended up dead and the guy ended up going to the electric chair for killing her. Sod's Law, as they say."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A portion of my review originally from my blog, The Reader's Commute.The Postman Always Rings Twice follows Frank Chambers, a drifter, as he takes a room and a job working at a roadside diner. The diner is owned by Nick, also known as \\"The Greek,\\" with a rambunctious voice and greasy hair. His wife is Cora, a true femme fatale and the object of Frank's affections. Check out Cora's introduction:\\"Except for the shape, she wasn't any raving beauty, but she had a sulky look to her, and her lips stuck out in a way that made me want to mash them in for her.\\"Hello, Fifty Shades fans! That's the kind of sexy, sadomasochistic vibe we should all be looking out for!Frank and Cora fall in love, and hatch a plot to kill The Greek. Naturally, the scheme falls flat, and what follows is a roller coaster ride of little victories and failures that eventually ends in despair. The effects that jealousy and paranoia have on Frank and Cora make this a gripping read, full of dirty deeds, backstabbing, and steamy reconciliations. The strength of this work is definitely found in its sparse prose, giving the reader only the details necessary to piece together the plot and understand the characters. A scene between Frank and Cora, after a staged car accident, was one of the strongest scenes in the novel.I found the book to lag a bit towards the middle (the introduction of Madge and the pumas sort of threw me for a loop), but as I neared the final pages I hoped for more. I think that this novel is a wonderful introduction to the roman noir, and an easy book to pick up."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A drifter blows into town and sticks around at the roadside diner because of the beautiful wife of the proprietor.

A sense of futility and hopelessness is pervasive: Frank and Cora are doomed the moment they meet--he's a drifter, she's an unhappily married woman, both harbor vague ambitions and are fatally attracted to the other, and her husband is in the way. Or as she says, \\"I want to work and be something, that's all. But you can't do it without love.\\"In only one hundred pages, there are two crimes and two deaths, a headline-screaming trial, and a scorching lust-driven affair. It's one of the most tightly written crime novels ever published, and the ironic closing tragedy is one of the more memorably unique plot twists in the genre. That said, its episodic parts are somewhat disjointed and its police procedural and courtroom scenes are sketchily inauthentic. In sum, the novel is 99% attitude, and it has lasted the test of time for its style rather than its substance. I wouldn't place this among the best examples of noir, but it's surely high among the second rank."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"and so did I! Obviously ... loved it because it was very existential (...) but I'm not he, so I loved the book for different reasons.

While I praise the brevity of the novel, it's low word-count is the only reason I did not award &quot;The Postman&quot; five stars. I feel a five-star book should not be something that can be read so quickly.From the opening paragraph, I was hooked.

Double Indemnity is also good, but the movie is better -- in this case, both movies fail to live up to the book.

She wanted something, and she tried to get it. She tried all the wrong ways, but she tried. I don't know what made her feel that way about me, because she knew me.

The Postman Always Rings Twice turned out excellent and may well have earned its place on that list.The Postman Always Rings Twice is a hard-hitting, gritty novel of a man and woman who conspire to kill her husband and who end up caught in their own web of deceit.

And he is frank, as well as amoral and impulsive, with no idea that this sets him apart from the world. Nick, the Greek, is warm and generous, I guy I might have liked. In other words, the kind of guy that Frank instinctively parasitizes because Nick just can't imagine the Franks in the world. And, the reason the book was banned in Boston, there's Cora. She's halfway between them, in several senses of the word. She knows those animal urges as well as Frank does, but has a human hand on the leash that controls them.It's a compact story.

So powerful, in fact, the two of them conspire to do away with Cora's husband, a hapless Greek immigrant. I don't think it would be giving anything away to say things end badly for all concerned.A short novel with plenty of dialogue, The Postman Always Rings Twice is a very quick read. Interestingly, the passage of time has served to alter reader perception. The sex scenes, deemed positively scandalous when the book was first published, are rather tame by today's standards. Nevertheless, you will not want to miss this viscerally intense classic."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"No sense chewing the same fat twice (I covered the \\"basics\\" in reviewing Double Indemnity), but a few additional points should be made. In Double Indemnity we have the same story as Postman. Instead of a drifter, vapid vixen vamp loser, and a cafe owner, we had an insurance salesman, sexy seductress, and a wealthy businessman. The plot? Same thing: the meeting, the sparks, the plan to kill the obstructionist interloper, the plan going bad, the consequences. But, here was the birth of the noir genre. The seed was planted, the flowering from which inspired a multitude of thriller fiction writers to follow--up to, and including, the present day. For this we owe James M. Cain a deep debt of gratitude.Reflecting the despair, desperation, near-panic atmosphere of the Great Depression, Postman does a better job than do the affluent characters of Indemnity--the impact is more surreal, more profound, more lasting. (This, in sharp contrast to the joyous, \\"there's a better day coming\\" gospel of the happy-face Warner Bros. and MGM musical extravaganzas of that period.) Cain also established a milestone in dialogue in his books, particularly this one: let 'er rip, don't let spoken comments attributions get in the way, just get out of the way and let the action (much of it consisting of pure dialogue) build, swell, and burst with an eruption of meanng. I have long thought that James M. Cain's contribution to American literature was not only the \\"Birth of Noir,\\" but by presenting convincing evidence that minimalist writing--by way of vivid, gritty dialogue as the chef ingredient--was the best, to-the-point way to hone and present character--and, importantly, to move the story. Aspiring novelists can only benefit from studying Cain's techniques with a microscope."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Opportunity may knock once, but fate may ring at your door more than once and has a strange way of turning on you.The characters in this story went about life without any consideration or thought for anyone but themselves and in doing so, set the stage for an almost comical tragedy! Though it's hard to feel sorry for the main character after his hand in murder, you still do, but only slightly! After all, he did tempt fate, and fate turned on him and gave him what he, and most of the others deserved.As for the writing, this book gave birth to a genre that we still enjoy today! Hard to believe that a story with the twists and turns of this one could be told so sparcely in words, and yet be so compelling in just over 100 pages!

So I decided to read it and came away plesantly surprised. It's laconic, short, dark, and undoubtedly a ground-breaking novella. This is the bad boy that started the whole roman noir and existentialism genre back in 1934. Albert Camus, the author credited with fully developing existentialism and the depiction of characters devoid of conscious, credited Cain as his inspiration for his very similar masterpiece, The Stranger, after having read The Postman.The two leading enigmatic characters, Frank and Cora, as does Meursault in The Stranger, assume ultimate responsibility for their heinous acts of free will without any knowledge of what is right or wrong or good or bad. Being a novel noir genre fan, I recommend the once-banned Postman to anyone who has the stomach for some mild eroticism, violence, and moreover, clever writing."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I finished reading The Postman Always Rings Twice a week ago, and i was astonished at how a short book could pack such power, you can read it in half a day...you could understand why he did what he did.

Cain is both a writer's writer and a poet of the streets. Perhaps the most striking evidence of his talent is his use of dialogue. Two- and three-way conversations are captured with a fine ear, and the voices are so distinct that you never wonder who's saying what, even though Cain rarely uses the old &quot;he said&quot; / &quot;she said&quot; tags. I urge all readers who like tough writing, all fans of the passionate and violent, and everyone who ever quoted PULP FICTION to buy this book and meet the grandaddy of them all."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Set in the backdrop of the 30s Depression, Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice typifies hard-boiled roman noir, with seedy characters aimlessly drifting towards nature's dark side. We see this epitomized in Frank and Cora, whose existences are two-faced and bleak, their ideal happiness seemingly at the expense of others. Yet, Cain aptly takes you along with their schemes, and with a minimalist approach to narrative, exposes his character's flaws and sins. With deceptive, dishonest and generally \\"no good\\" people, Cain's novel uses dangerous situations, murderous plots, and gritty suspense to keep you entertained.Cain sets the stage for his gritty novel when drifter Frank Chambers stumbling in to the Twin Oaks Tavern while checking to see if the coast is clear. When he's introduced to the owner's wife, Cora, it sets in motion big trouble ahead. Taken to one another, Frank and Cora begin an illicit affair and concoct a scheme to bump off Cora's husband. Whether it's Frank's bad nature that rubs off on Cora, or whether she's just a naturally rotten person too is hard to say. Maybe Cora says it best, \\"We're just two punks, Frank.\\" A perfect murder, however, might not be so perfect.What Cain brings to this novel is a simple approach to narrative and dialogue, yet effective turmoil and suspense. It is dialogue heavy at points, and at times I found the dialogue a bit confusing (identifying who was speaking), but mostly Cain uses simple, snappy dialogue to hit you quick, often with a cynical tone. A fun part of the read was just following the characters attempt to outmaneuver each other, like Frank and Sackett playing cat and mouse during questioning.One can read The Postman Always Rings Twice and be reminded of what a noir should feel like, with shady, but street smart characters. It is a quick, easy, short novel to read, but in its one hundred plus pages, it does leave a taste for wanting to read more Cain noir novels."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A drifter takes what he intends to be a temporary job at a roadside diner but is soon involved in an affair with the owner's wife, which leads to a plan to bump the husband off.James M. Cain had an engaging story and stripped his prose down to the essentials, producing one of the greatest sustained examples of narrative momentum I can recall. With scarcely any interior dialogue (despite the use of a first person narrator), he paints a penetrating psychological portrait of the conspirators as their relationship evolves from their initial attraction, through their attempts at murder, until their post-crime mutual mistrust and reconciliation. The end is shattering, completing Cain's bleak portrayal of the human condition."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This book is a quick read. The plot moved swiftly and there are enough twists and turns to keep anyone interested. The two main characters actually seem believable. Believable enough that some parts of the book actually made me uncomfortable. The ending was a surprise to top it all off."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Talk about being years ahead of time. Before there was \\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Stranger,\\" there was this 1934 novel by James M. Cain, a dialogue-driven, first-person narrative in the form of a diary by a man on death row.While I still haven't figured out just where the title of the book relates to the story (who cares?), what I have figured out is this novel just plain works. This page-burner is a half-day read at best. It's as though someone lit a fuse on a stick of dynamite and you read faster and faster until it all blows up on the protagonist of the story and his lover, two killers who are in their relationship for the money, sadistic and masochistic carnality and, ironically, love.The book stuck with me for days. Cain didn't waste any time on the flowery descriptions common with works of literature -- no talk of the sounds of leaves crunching underfoot beneath a sky of azure. He jumps right into the eerie plot and takes you into the minds and actions of two amoral people and what they'd do for money and their own brand of twisted love.Many reviewers call it noir. Others would say it's full of existential dread a la Camus. I call Cain's unique style \\"existential dreadnoir,' and it's insanely readable and impossible to put down. Grab a couple cups of coffee, read it in five or six hours and be prepared to examine your thoughts for at least a couple of days.Unsettling and karmic and full of irony, it's titillating crime reading at its best."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"One of the greatest noir novels ever (and a short one, clocking in at only three discs in this unabridged audiobook), read by the great actor Stanley Tucci. Much imitated, but few authors can capture so vividly the human condition with such economy of prose as Cain. Tucci flips the genre on its ear by with a nuanced, conversational reading that avoids the hard-bitten or the cliche. This is what happens when you \\"monkey with murder,\\" and for fans of Cain or noir, this audio book breathes new life into a classic."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Cain's famous novel of Frank Chambers,a young no good drifter whom fate leads to the Twin Oakes diner. The Greek, Nick, takes him on, but Chambers only accepts and stays as he is infatuated with the Greeks wife-and she with him.They plot his murder-the perfect murder, so perfect that Chambers evades justice for what he did do,but gets caught in its web just the same...A short but brilliant novella, still wrapped in controversy. Cain brought a new edge to realism.The novel is narrated and written in Chambers' inarticulate vernacular which adds to its unique realism.Anymore detail or fancy words to describe something and the whole wouldn't have worked.Not only a book you can read in one sitting, its one you will read in a sitting as it grips completely.An underestimated giant in American writing and the realism genre. Don't miss it or think the many film adaptations can compare to the written work."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"There's not many novels that are that are more hardboiled than The Postman Always Rings Twice.It's hard as can be. You know the story: A drifter, a man, the man's wife. The man ends up dead at the hands of the drifter and the man's wife.I've read 50 Shades of Grey. You want sadomasochism? This short novella has more scenes of that than that modern bestseller. She asks for it, he gives it to her, she likes it. She asks for it again.The story and writing is like a .22 to the brain pan - short, direct and effective. I love the fact that it wasn't dragged out for 80,000 words. I found the writing so direct it had a few too sharp edges. It was a bit clipped and abrupt but, then again, that's the mood. Finally, when I finished I was exhausted. What a ride.It's a little book that kicked off a lot in 20th Century America. Nice."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James M. Cain's first novel, The Postman Always Rings Twice, is a short violent book that was \\"banned in Boston\\" for its sexual content. Written in 1934, the obscenity was extremely tame by todays's standards. I liked this, typical of the dialog: \\"I kissed her. Her eyes were shining up at me like two blue stars. It was like being in church.\\"The title is metaphorical. There is no postman in it. It's more a reference to the fact that something will always come back to those who commit evil. One way or another, there's no escape. The story moves fast with tough dialog and a murder being planned. The lover's, Frank, the drifter, and Cora, the Greek's sexy wife, are into it with no turning back. I kept picturing Lana Turner or Jessica Lange, \\"a woman ready for anything,\\" as I read it. That's the trouble with seeing the movies before reading the book, even though it's been years since I saw them. But it didn't destroy the pleasure of the book--gritty, sultry, excellent writing.On the back of the book, Cain is quoted: \\"I make no conscious effort to be tough, or hard-boiled, or grim, or any of the things I am usually called. I merely try to write as the character would write, and I never forget that the average man...has acquired a vividness of speech that goes beyond anything I could invent.\\" Good advice on writing.Cain helped set the standard for noir fiction.

Unfortunately, it can't keep up that pace and devolves into wonderfully trashy pulp in the end. That said, the prose still startles, snaps and delivers even 75 years after it was written.But for me, the high point of the novel comes very early when Frank convinces roadside dinner owner \\"Nick the Greek\\" to buy a new sign for the place. The argument for the new sign goes like this:\\"Well it's out of date. Nobody has bulb signs any more. They got Neon signs. They show up better, and they don't burn as much juice. Then, what does it say? Twin Oaks, that's all. The Tavern part, it's not in the lights. Well, Twin Oaks don't make me hungry. It don't make me want to stop and get something to eat.

My first venture into the genre of American crime noir, and a successful one.This short (only about 100 pages) novel is narrated by Frank Chambers - a homeless bum, a morally deficient good-for-nothing fellow who gets by by hitch-hiking, gambling and turning shady deals. One day he comes across a roadside diner/gas station and is quickly hired by its owner - a Greek entrepreneur Nick. The only reason Frank sticks around is because of Nick's wife - a blond femme fatale Cora. The two quickly find themselves involved in a passionate, violent and destructive love affair that eventually leads them to the decision to kill Cora's husband. Surprisingly, they succeed in getting away with the crime, but they never quite recover from what they've done. Guilt, fear and mutual suspicion push them to their demise...I actually found myself very surprised (pleasantly) by this novel. It was very intense and rather risque (I can only imagine its reception when the book was first published in 1934). A great blend of sex, murder, corruption, violence, and, ironically, love.P.S. I also watched a movie adaptation of this book with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. That movie was something... Very provocative."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I've long admired Albert Camus's \\"The Stranger,\\" and I've just finished James Cain's \\"Postman.\\" The similarities are remarkable, and I'm told that in fact Camus acknowledged a debt to Cain. Both writers create criminal characters who live on the outside of their worlds and who act with strange detachment. Camus's character shoots an Arab seemingly without much thought or intention. Cain's killer uses more premeditation, and his detachment is modified by his passion for his victim's wife. Curiously, he sort of likes his victim too, but he lacks free will and a moral center. We see in Cain's portrayal something of the famous \\"absurdity\\" that moved Camus, although Camus found it appropriate to make his character less passionate.Moreover, Cain provides the prototype for the absurd justice system that Camus depicts. Cain's lawyers and police are without moral values, whereas Camus's are bent on trying his protagonist for not having displayed the proper feelings at his mother's funeral rather than for murdering someone. Both novels are darkly ironic, especially in the fact that the custodians of moral behavior have no moral center themselves.The crime in Camus's novel, according to society, is merely the indifference at the heart of the protagonist's character. The crime in Cain's novel, from the point of view of the justice system, is simply to get caught. And both books end with a sort of realization or epiphany on the part of the protagonist. In this regard, Camus's ending, in which his character becomes aware of the \\"benign indifference\\" of the universe, has more philosophical reach than Cain's, but nonetheless the parallel is clear.It is not surprising that Cain's novel--more like a novella, really--has been made into more than one good film. It is quickly paced, with a gritty kind of speech. And the sexual passion comes across as loud as hellcats going at it in the night. In the genre of noir fiction, \\"Postman\\" is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Okay, so now that this reviewer has recently warmed you up with review of James M. Cain's lesser works, including the minor classic Double Indemnity it is time to bring up the big guns- The Postman Always Rings Twice (hereafter, Postman). I have reviewed elsewhere in this space both the movie versions of this novel- the original one with John Garfield and Lana Turner in black and white in the 1940's and the color version with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange in the 1980's. Both have there merits although the Nicholson/Lange version produced at a time when there was a more permissive atmosphere in portraying raw, primordial sexual passions is closer to the sense of Cain's novel.Both films also take some license with the story line from the novel. That line, in summary, went something like this- Girl is unhappily married to older uncouth owner of a highway diner and gas station in sunny California of the 1930's. Boy an outlaw tramp, who also happens to be handy, very handy, with a wrench, comes down the road and hubby puts his to work in the station. Boy meets girl. Bang. Hubby is doomed but the newly formed couple, after a false start in clearing up that little matter, seemingly is ready to start a new life together once the murder rap is cleared up. Or are they?After a fair exposition of Cain's works in this space, including a few short stories not reviewed, it is apparent that he was onto something about the way that novelist could look at crime and the vagaries of human passions. Most of his works, including Postman, center on the reactions of his characters to the way that their lusts (and it is mainly the distortions caused by their lusts that Cain wants to look at) lead them inevitably to crime, mainly the most heinous one murder. Moreover, as demonstrated here, no crime no matter how perfectly committed or maneuvered around, will go unpunished either as a result of the psychological reaction and revulsion against their crimes, no matter how deeply submerged, of the characters, as here, with Frank and Cora or by some quirk of fate. No police or gumshoes need apply to solve these crimes.I have sometimes mentioned in reviewing Cain's work that the women tend to be femme fatales and that is true to the extent that these women have strong sexual identities, use that fact, and are, usually, to the extent they are fully developed by Cain stronger than the men. But then we are back to the old Adam and Eve story, aren't we? After all Eve was the one who took the chance. I would argue, as an aside here to the theme presented in Postman, that as conventional as Cora is in many ways, trying to make a go of the diner and trying to create a stable environment after the close call on the murder rap, that there is also some primitive Christian notion at work here. Something about the fates being played out a certain way and the gods best stay on the sidelines while they get worked out. But, hey, why don't you read this little gem and try to figure it out for yourselves."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A voyeuristic look into the shallow, callow amorality of people on the side of the interstate.

Aspects of this reminded me of DI, though TPART was actually written first, so I'm willing to forgive any similarities.A drifter hits town and becomes smitten with a bored housewife. They have a fling, and then decide to remove the husband permanently... and things spiral down from there.On the plus side, it's a quick read (just over 100 pages) and managed to keep me interested. The down-beats would be a rather chunky and clunky bit of exposition towards the end that threw the rhythm off, and Cain's prose - very rushed and unpolished. Granted it was his first novel and he was probably going for that effect anyway.I was a bit surprised to learn this was banned (by Boston, at least) as obscene upon its release, though I guess I can see why: the main characters flaunt their lack of \\"moral fortitude\\" so this was probably quite shocking for the time it was written. To an extent, this novel inadvertently functions as an odd little time capsule of the period.Worth reading once, if you like anti-hero crime fiction."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"James Cain's short and enigmatically-titled novel, \\"The Postman Rings Twice\\" (1934) began a new form of genre writing and noir film. It is tough, tersely told and raw, with a portrayal of sexuality that was extreme for its time. The novel works well because it depicts a sense of place - the dingy and poor areas, both rural and urban, of California in the 1930s. The characters are painted well in short, pointed strokes. The writing style is tough and laconic.The story is told in the first person by Frank Chambers, a violent 24-year old loner and drifter. At the outset of the story, Chambers is thrown out of a truck in which he had stown himself away in Mexico. He finds himself in rural California about 20 miles from Los Angeles. He is offered a job at a small gas station and restaurant, the \\"Twin Oaks Tavern\\" owned Nick Papadakis, whom Chambers calls \\"The Greek\\". Chambers and Papadakis' young, frustrated wife Cora quickly begin a seamy affair. Cora is attracted by Chambers' strength, youth, and sexual brutality.Chambers describes his and Cora's two attempts to kill Papadakis in which he narrowly avoids detection. The murder attempts are interspersed with stories of games of pool in shabby halls, drinking and wandering on Los Angeles streets, the gritty life of a waitress in \\"hash houses\\" full of sexual come-ons, and a short trip to Mexico that Chambers takes with another woman, Madge. Cain also portrays the defense and prosecutorial lawyers that occupy this level of the criminal justice system. But most of the book centers upon the torrid relationship between Chambers and Cora, as they betray and try to separate from each other. Chambers is an unsympathetic, immoral character for most of the story, but I found myself feeling for him and for Cora as the book comes to an ironic, fated end.The novel has been made into at least four movies and it created a new form of pulp, crime novel. But in this case, the novel transcends its genre. With its tight style, portrayal of lonely lost people, and dismal places, \\"The Postman Rings Twice\\" is a work of literature separate from noir. The novel is available in a separate text; but it is probably best read as part of a Library of America volume of \\"Crime Novels, American Noir of the 1930s and 40s\\" that includes five additional works by five different authors.Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1930s and 40s: The Postman Always Rings Twice / They Shoot Horses, Don't They? / Thieves Like Us / The Big Clock / Nightmare ... a Dead Man (Library of America) (Vol 1)Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I had some spare time in between brushing my teeth and flossing, so I decided to read this thing cover to cover. It's nearly that brisk a read. The triangle Cain sketches out is so classic--the boorish husband knocked off by the young wife and her drifter lover--that it was already part of my mental furniture before I even read it. You'd think it would come across as too worn, but instead it remains remarkably fresh. Well, great writing never goes stale. This is an incredibly disciplined piece of work, always moving swiftly but never cheating the reader of detail. Cain knows how people from all strata talk (the dialogue is stylized, but it always rings true), and he knows just how things can go terribly wrong and why. Life's losers and winners, caught here for all time.I get pretty fed up with people saying Cain merely grafted a crime plot onto a Hemingway-esque prose. Oh, is that how he did it. As if that's so easy. Plenty of writers have tried to ape Hemingway; few have absorbed the style and made a living thing of it the way Cain does here. (And he manages at least one thing Hemingway never did--he makes you laugh.) I'm also a bit impatient with everyone who says how tame this book's sexuality is for the modern reader. Anyone who finds Frank's and Cora's encounters tame has been watching too much assembly-line girls gone wild.

Written with curt statements, little detail, and almost exclusively dialogue (could be a movie script), this book quickly outlines a thorough story in about 100 pages.The protagonist, Frank Chambers, is basically another impulse driven, good-for-nothing, tiger on the road. He is the bad boy which good girls fall for. And the girl in this book is Iowa blond beauty queen, Cora Papadakis - whose surname comes from older husband Nick Papadakis. Frank's character reminds me immensely of Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" hero - Dean Moriarity.Cora hates herself and her life. After Nick employs Frank, she falls for the help. The femme fatale employs Frank to free her from her misery - which means murdering Nick. After botching the job the first time, and failing to run away while Nick sits in a hospital bed, Frank meets up with Cora for a second chance (hence the title).The second attempt leads you through another botched caper which only leads to an ingenious and fruitful legal maneuver which climaxes with the insurance agent perjuriously testifying in order to save the company money. Money acquits evil.But, if you sleep with dogs, you wake up with fleas. A few escapades later, Frank and Cora mutually mistrust one another to the point where each believes the other will do to them what they did to poor Nick.The ending is classic irony. And, that is what makes the book so ingratiatingly wonderful for film makers and readers. Love is conquered by the unknown. Isn't it usually \\"Love conquers all?\\" Then the unknown conquers all, or does it?If you are looking for flowery prose, detailed description, or poignant passages of reflection - forget about it.

What I discovered was 100 plus pages of violence and moral vacuity that made Hammett look flabby and sentimental by comparison. James Cain was not content to portray his characters as morally bankrupt. He obviously thought it more effective to shove moral bankruptcy right into the reader's face.The action moves very fast. Frank meets Cora and the attraction is electric. Their first physical encounter is brutish. That she is married makes not a whit of difference. Cora describes her husband in the most repulsive terms imaginable. They plot to kill him. Everything goes wrong.It is not difficult to see why POSTMAN was surrounded by controversy upon its release. The violence and sex are right up front. The characters show no misgivings about the adultery they commit. But I think the real issue with this book, what really sent people into tizzy fits, is the atmosphere. One would have to look long and hard to find characters so bleak and amoral. That Cain allows these characters to unfold as they do without a word of disapproval compounds the effect.

Nick dies in the ambulance, Frank is badly injured with a broken arm. Cora escaped the falling car. The police and an ambulance take them away. After the Inquest District Attorney Sackett questions Frank, and gets him to sign a statement. Sackett suspects murder (Chapter 9). The best lawyer in town will defend Cora against murder; Katz will handle everything. Nick's insurance policy is the alleged motive. There is a shocking surprise plea (Chapter 10). Katz says this is the greatest case in his life, then explains how he will argue in court from the insurance policies (Chapter 11). [This technical detail is simplified in the film.] The rest of the story plays out. The differences in personalities between Cora and Frank result in growing conflicts. After one critical argument they resolve their differences. But an accident brings up the past, and their fate is sealed. [This story is told from Frank's point of view and seems self-serving to me.]"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"A quick, easy, pot-boilin' read, that somehow--maybe because it was a novel novel--was elevated by the MLA 100.

The only question is how? Little discrepancies arise along the way: Frank just wants Cora, running away together is his plan. But, Cora, the tricky Cora, wants Frank and the money of Nick Papadakis. The perfectly staged accident is carried through (on the second attempt), Papadakis is dead and the notorious couple gets away with murder. Only the postman rings twice, and when the pay time comes, Cora dies in a random car accident, and Frank ends up charged and sentenced with murder that he didn't commit, which is the murder of his darling Cora."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This is the classic story of murder and adultery tied up in a tightly woven style that is in your face from the opening paragraph. Drifter, Frank Chambers comes upon a greasy spoon diner and falls in love with the owner's wife, Cora, a former small-town beauty queen who made do with a man has grown tired of and is now disgusted by. After a short and brutal affair, they agree that the key to their happiness together is to rid themselves of Nick, Cora's husband.The murderous, adulterous couple carefully plot and carry out their plan with straightforward efficiency, fully expecting that the result will bring them together to live in peace and happiness. But this is classic noir fiction, so a happy ending is simply out of the question.It's an amazingly powerful book that cuts right to the chase, scene after scene, ensuring that the all-important emotions of fear and hatred stand out even more starkly."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"Two weeks ago, I read &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and was blown away! It was the first hard boiled book I ever read and couldn't wait to read &quot;Postman.&quot; Unfortunately, it wasn't what I expected. The characters are idiots compared to Walter Huff and Phylis Nirdlinger, the murder was boring, and it pales beside &quot;Double Indemnity.&quot; It's unfortunate that Cain was too busy writing about LA to ever mention his native Baltimore... Anyway, if are just starting with James' books, like I was 2 weeks ago, read &quot;Postman&quot; before &quot;Indemnity&quot; to prevent the disapointment I felt."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"In the reptilian world of James M Cain, there is only a blink separating the urge from the act.A drifter gets a job at an isolated diner/gas station and sinks quickly into a lustful relationship with the Greek proprietor's young wife. And from consummated lust to consummated murder is an equally short jump. It is the ironic unfolding of the consequences in which Cain unhooks the direct causality from crime and its punishment that the actors in the drama become pawns in a larger game in which their actions are irrelevant.Made into 3 excellent films (including Michelangelo Antonioni's IL GRIDO), POSTMAN has never lost its ability to shock."},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"This slim novel was first publishedin 1934, it felt timeless to me and was finished in one sitting without pause. The lead characters Frank and Cora are bleak and cold, totally lacking in redeeming qualities. What makes the book so gripping to me is that the style of the writing, the sparse use of words and it's coldness exactly matches them.The content is not suitable for young children and at one time Cain faced prosecution for this publication. Today as the world has changed Postman would not have had the same impact in those terms, but as a literary work I think it is still stunning.The plot is the murder of a small time diner owner by his wife and her drifter lover who comes to work for them and the destruction of what affection they had for each other through their own amoral natures.Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Postman Always Rings Twice","review":"I &quot;had&quot; to read this book (for research purposes in the noir field) and discovered that it's one of the greatest love stories I came by in my reading life. Cain - contrary to Hammett or Chandler - likes and enjoys women. The climax of the Postman lives up to the scene between Hector and Andromache. The whole novel has the archaic vigour of the the Iliad. If I compare Cain to Hemingway the latter seems sentimental. Camus shall have said that the Postman inspired him to The Stranger. But the Stranger does not have the virility of the Postman. I'm deeply moved and challengned by this novel."},{"Title":"The Cattle Killing","review":"I feel conflicted when describing this book. The words are beautifully pieced together yet the story moved like a loose dingy caught in choppy waters, which made it difficult for me as the reader, to feel any attachment to the characters. This book has to be cradled to enjoy, meaning it requires attention like a needy relationship. I would have enjoyed the book as much if I had opened a page and read a random paragraph. Wideman has the ability to translate words into emotion. I was so moved by some of his random thoughts, which to me, were as moving and powerful as Bataille or Nietzsche. For example, &quot;Light struck dumb since the moment it witnessed sin.&quot; Overall, I do recommend it, maybe as a bed stand companion for brief inspiration."},{"Title":"The Cattle Killing","review":"Mr. Wideman's book is a challenge to the reader, with its shifts not only in time but alsoin voice. This book takes the reader from 18th century England and America to the presentday in a mesmerizing yet ambiguous tale. Ultimately, Mr. Wideman attempts to understandhow stories can influence the understanding of ourselves. Although much of Mr. Wideman'swritings have a clear Afro-American centrism, nonetheless Mr. Wideman is still able toshed light on the murkey underpinnings of present day mainstream American culture. Forreaders who wish a thought provoking book by one of America's most celebrated novelists,and who don't mind the challenge of a, at times, difficult-to-follow narrative style, then&quot;The Cattle Killing&quot; is a definite winner."},{"Title":"The Cattle Killing","review":"Iam looking for help to study the main themes (death, African influence,..) of The Cattle Killing. please help me."},{"Title":"Lords of the Rink","review":"This is the best guide to goaltending I have ever read!

Most people recovering from eating disorders already have far too much experience in that area.The book also heartily endorses several unscientific ideas, such as:- Compulsive overeating is an addiction. (Actually, scientists now know that eating disorders and substance dependence have very different etiologies).- \\"Trigger foods.\\" In particular, flour and sugar are viewed as \\"toxic\\" foods that \\"make us overeat.\\" Nonsense - psychologists have since shown this to be complete bunk. In fact, it's worse than that because it encourages people to have \\"forbidden foods,\\" which is an eating disorder behavior.- People with eating disorders can never be cured. It is a lifelong disorder. Actually, people can (and often are) cured of eating disorders.- Either you're abstinent or you're not. Recovery is a destination, not a process. The idea of abstinence reinforces the guilt and shame of not having \\"arrived\\" yet and encourages \\"all-or-nothing thinking.\\" The idea is that, if you're not \\"abstinent,\\" you're not really recovering and your disease is just getting worse and worse, which ignores the fact that you can make significant progress before you're completely behavior-free. The idea that you somehow throw away all of your progress if you slip at all is ridiculous as well.While some of the meditations are uplifting and helpful, overall this book is too flawed for me to recommend it."},{"Title":"Food for Thought: Daily Meditations for Overeaters","review":"While this book might be very helpful to individuals of many faiths and spiritualies, it is not Bible-based and should not be included in the category of other Christian books.

I've struggled with weight issues for sixteen years now and although I had done well for the first six months of this year, having some meditations to help address my subconscious problems appealed to me. What I've found in Food For Thought is not so much any meditations, but daily messages that are very uplifting. They appealed to me in many different ways, and also made me feel as though I am not alone in my struggles.The book is actually the OA manual for success which may or may not be a problem for some people. My personal problem is more medically based then it is an actual overeating issue. Either way, the fact that these words cut right to the heart of the weight causes and \\"cures\\" is beneficial. My only criticism is that instead of having each message dated from January 1st to December 31st is that it should have simply been left out or replaced with Day One and so forth.

To my amazement, it has &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of EACH episode of the Next Generation and Original Series. When the book was published, Voyager just came out and it talks about it for a chapter or so. Deep Space Nine also got a litte recognition from the writers, but don't expect too much. A BIG plus is the many, many pictures it has. Mostly from conventions and such. Unfortunately, the author might have fallen asleep while writing some sections because a few pages were repeated right after each other. All-in-all, it's pretty good, I'm thinking about getting the sequel, Captain's Logs Supplemental."},{"Title":"Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages","review":"Captain's Logs contains *very* detailed on some of the internal politics and strife during TOS (the original series) and TNG (Star Trek: The Next Generation), and several of the movies. (Because of the timing involved, there's not very much about DS9 or Voyager. This is covered in the supplemental volume.)All of the episodes in TOS and TNG have a summary and most (&gt;95%) have some behind-the-scenes arcana. There is surprisingly little &quot;[actor] was also in [other feature]&quot; type stuff, but rather juicier background on all of the writing and directorial changes.While the honesty in stating &quot;Star Trek 1 was terrible&quot; is refreshing, it seems like the authors dwell more on the &quot;problem&quot; aspects of the show. For example, in discussing the episode &quot;City on the Edge of Forever,&quot; the authors spend a much longer amount of time on the Harlon Ellison saga (Ellison writes the story, it gets butchered into an episode, both win awards, Roddenbery and Ellison at odds over credit).The result is a less-than-flattering portrayal of Gene Roddenbery. (To be fair, I came away a greater awareness of and respect for Gene Coon and Rick Berman.)Overall, a worthy read for the die-hardest Trekker."},{"Title":"Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift from my parents in 1995, the year it was first released. I was quite happy to get it too - I have read it cover to cover no less than five times. Being a huge fan of the series (all of them!) I have found the book quite diverting. As mentioned in the other reviews here the book contains synopses of all of the episodes of both the classic original series and its successor 'The Next Generation'. The movies are covered here as well right up to the first big screen appearance of the TNG crew in 'Star Trek: Generations'. The information is as accurate as one could expect this type of 'prattle' to be; this is not a knock on the book but rather a valid point as I will explain later on.The few reviews that appear here may or may not be a testament to \\"Captains' Logs\\" popularity among fans of the TV and/or movie series. Most of the Star Trek books, collectibles & memorabilia have their staunch defenders - no matter how 'cheesy' the item(s) might be. Perhaps the answer to the reluctance of fans to come to the defense of this book can be answered right here on this webpage. As one of the reviewers here summarized, what the book constitutes is no more than a glorified fanzine. And honestly, I could understand someone being disappointed with the contents of the book. If you had regularly read the publications or subscribed to 'Starlog' and 'The Next Generation' magazines, then you've definitely been exposed to most of the information here. It may not be firsthand information but having it all gathered here in one compendium sure makes it indispensable. Besides that the episode guides are handy and the background info on the TNG episodes is especially entertaining. But I thought the best parts of the book are the sections on the short-lived Saturday morning animated series and the busted television revival series. The animated series was much maligned during its two season run (the fall of both 1973 and 1974) and quickly forgotten. I was glad to have the history and genesis of this program; I always felt that these episodes provided a way to do things that couldn't be done on the live action series due to budget constraints. It's also interesting to note the fact that some of the episodes written for the busted TV revival series showed up on 'The Next Generation' in one form or another. One of the other episodes written about here for that same never-was TV series sounds remarkably similar to a 'Star Trek: Voyager' episode.Now I want to explain what I meant when I used the word 'prattle'. Much of the information following the single episode synopses are really no more than 'sound bites' from the actors or production staff seemingly given at the time of production. While a good portion of the book is based on research many of the statements attributed here are transcribed from audio tapes of interviews that the authors conducted over a ten year period. That's not to say many articles that were previously published carried much of the same information. And seeing it here again would be considered a weakness by fans who regularly read the magazines I mentioned before. But I think we can all agree that we (the fans of Star Trek) can appreciate having this volume in our libraries. There are other books available dealing with each of the series on an individual basis and they are great in their own right. But the authors were right to conceive of this project and to try to demonstrate the continuity of the Star Trek universe. How well they succeeded is up to each individual's interpretation.The main drawback to the book I thought was the proliferation of photos used throughout. The choices of some still photos that accompany the episode synopsis of some stories just boggle the mind - if you've seen the book you know what I mean. Some of them have no reason to be here at all, some have no discernible significance whatsoever. They're just from the surplus of publicity photos that seems inexhaustible in Hollywood. I do however value the reproductions and stills of many of the Star Trek inspired magazine covers that appear mainly towards the end of the book. Some of the featured covers are from popular juvenile publications like 'Cracked' and 'MAD' magazine; others are from more traditional pop culture magazines like 'TV Guide' and 'Entertainment Weekly'; and yet still others from the internationally respectable 'TIME' and 'LIFE'.An update is inevitable - and in fact there is a publication available titled \\"Captains' Logs Supplemental\\" by the same authors. I haven't yet read the book and I don't know how much of the later 'Deep Space Nine' and 'Voyager' series are covered, but I'll still be curious enough to get a look at it when the opportunity arises. I do beg the authors to do one thing though before going to publication once again: please, please, please get someone to copyedit your manuscript!"},{"Title":"Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages","review":"This book is cut and paste writing at its worst. Transcripts from previous interviews and pictures from conventions and old movies are the basis of this book; which translates into a giant fan magazine with all the problems associated with that label. By trumpeting \\"Unauthorized\\" you get the feeling the authors have some behind the scenes info, but after looking at a picture of Deforest Kelly in a western in the middle of a synopsis of season one; you realize \\"unauthorized\\" means unprofessional. If you need an episode guide, this is complete, but you can probably find the same info a million other places."},{"Title":"Songs From The Voice, Vol. 1: Please Don't Make Us Sing This Song","review":"I normally hate things like this. Basically this is a compilation CD where music artists give their interpretations of several of the psalms. While I agree in principle this is how the pslams should be done, normally it results in fluffy pop garbage. I expected to hate this CD. I didn't. It's beautiful. These folksy arrangements hit home in unexpected ways and, I think, really capture the spirit of these pslams. Artists like Derek Webb, Don Chaffer, Sandra McCraken, Sara Groves and others lend their talenst and gifts to this beautiful interpretation."},{"Title":"Songs From The Voice, Vol. 1: Please Don't Make Us Sing This Song","review":"This is a first impression:The words, based on a retelling of the Psalms by the \\"Ecclesia Bible Society\\" (who need to get themselves a website, IMHO) are fresh, expressive, lyrical. I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the music, which never seems to find a tone appropriate to the words being set.Much of the music is languid and melancholy, a kind of grainy lethargy ubiquitous to the indie-rock ethos. This style works well for the title track: \\"Please don't make us sing this song / It used to be happy / When we were free and home\\" (from Psalm 137). But when \\"Let the name of God be high\\" is sung with a melancholy drone of background vocals, and \\"Gather round with those who love and sing / He is our king\\" (Track 4) is set as a melancholy ballad, it makes me wonder if the artists are too stuck on being indie-rock cool.When the album does go for a change of pace, it's poorly executed. One particularly egregious example is \\"As if that were not enough,\\" which sets the text awkwardly and mechanically to such banal music I'd expect it to underscore a circus clown act (there's a whistle solo). This to the words: \\"He reached down and drew me / From the deep dark hole where I was stranded.\\" If I didn't know better, I'd think this was a parody.It's not a complete disaster, though. If you like the indie-acoustic-rock-band style, this is a decent collection of songs with some very artful lyrics. That they take musical risks is more commendable than putting that saccharine Nashville CCM production stamp on everything."},{"Title":"Violent Act","review":"This true account of the spree murders perpetrated by Mike Wayne Jackson in Indianapolis in 1986 gives the reader more than just a typical &quot;true crime&quot; story. It seems as if Wilkinson divided the telling of this tragedy into three parts: the murders, the search for Jackson, and the day- to-day stories of the victims following the murders. The stories of each person involved in the crime (including Jackson's mother, the first victim's widow, etc.) are each written extremely well, and each helps us to understand the crime better, as all of the people that were involved in this crime are trying to do."},{"Title":"Violent Act","review":"Alec Wilkinson, in \\"A Violent Act\\" has written a true crime documentary which is quite unlike most of the boilerplate true crime being written. This book, as opposed to much of the unintersting tripe being marketed, was obviously a long time in the writing.This is a story about Mike Jackson, a dangerous small time burglar and hold-up man who kills his probation officer and leads authorities on a week long search. The book is well-written, literate and intelligent, and is obviously the product of extensive interviewing and research. The effects of the murder on the victim's family, which include some odd and increasingly strange contacts by the family of the killer, are discussed in detail. The major focus of the book however is Mike Jackson. I can not overemphasize the depth of the author's research and of his presentation of Jackson's life: the fact that early on he exhibited the inability to cope with simple childhood experiences; his inability to perform even the most menial jobs except criminal ones where no continuing personal interaction was necessary; the long stretches he spent in jail; and his descent into psychosis.The reason I gave the book 4 rather than 5 stars is that I felt Wilkinson went on too long, and ultimately excessively, about the search efforts of the FBI and other police groups. While some of this was necessary and interesting, Wilkinson described the police efforts for each day of an effort that lasted over a week. Since most of these days were numbingly the same, Wilkinson's narrative also becomes numbing during this part of the book.The in depth study of Mike Jackson is however superb. Wilkinson writes about him with such understanding and empathy that his writing about Jackson, a man who less talented writers would simply dismiss as an evil career criminal, sometimes approaches tenderness.This book is well worth reading and will be appreciated by fans of true crime who are interested in real understanding an event."},{"Title":"The concise Persian-English dictionary: One volume","review":"Great dictionary. Much better than old Haim. My copy even has little tabs for each letter of the alphabet to speed indexing. Entries have the English translation, Farsi synonyms, and even more important for the English student, many examples of Farsi usage. You can learn a lot from each example. You will find few words in the modern Persian press that aren't here."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"Jim Albert and Jay Bennett share two traits that make them the perfect authors for this type of book (1) they are both baseball fans who know the game and have seen many games and much statistics from many angles and (2) they are both professional statisticians who understand probability and the subtle aspects that chance can have on statistics. By being professional statisticians they also know how sophisticated statistical techniques can add to ones ability to seriously address questions of strategy and comparison of player performance. That is what they accomplish in this book, teaching some basic probability and statistics along the way.They also make it very interesting to the baseball fan by raising interesting baseball questions related to players that the fans relate to, namely the stars that the fans follow and the great clutch hits and clutch defensive plays that we baseball fans have imprinted in our memories, like Mazeroski's game winning home run in the 1960 World Series, or Willie Mays' famous over the shoulder catch of Vic Wertz's long fly ball in the 1954 series, or Bobby Thompson home run that won the 1951 playoffs for the Giants.In the very beginning Albert and Bennett distinguish themselves from the sports statisticians that are hired by the teams. The sports statisticians collect the data and present it in various ways. However, this is merely exploratory data analysis. Albert and Bennett point out that a numerical difference in a hitting statistic such as on base percentage between Chuck Knoblauch and Kenny Lofton may be a real difference in ability but may also be a small enough difference to be merely due to chance. Finding ways to analyze the baseball data to make probabilistic inferences like answering the question of whether Lofton is better at getting on base than Knoblauch is the focus of what professional statisticians do and is the theme of the book.In the course of reading the book you will learn many things about baseball. Some may agree with previous notions and some will be surprises. You will learn about the massive amount of major league baseball data available, about SABR a society for baseball research and more. You will be opened up to the hinden world of professional statistics where probability models have been used for over a century to handle military, engineering, energy, environmental, agricultural and medical problems. These same tools in recent years have been used to handle baseball questions also.They start with simple table top baseball games like All Star Baseball to introduce concepts. They then move on to baseball data and probability. Then they look at statistical questions, situational effects in Chapter 4, hot hitting in Chapter 5, methods of measuring offensive performance in Chapter 6, more sophisticated measures in Chapter 7, simulation models in Chapter 8, measures of clutch play and team value in Chapter 9, ways to predict performance in Chapter 10, analyzing World Series results in Chapter 11 and final comments in Chapter 12.This is a great book for any one who loves baseball and baseball statistics. It also is a great way to learn and become interested in the techniques of the professional statistician.For statisticians that teach statistics, it provides a wealth of interesting examples to help illustrate important statistical concepts in basic or even advanced courses, including the value of Bayesian methods, the need for overdispersion models (e.g. batting averages) and the value of linear and nonlinear prediction models."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"This is a book that I was excited to buy but unfortunately I did not enjoy it as much as I had hoped for. The two main reasons for this are 1) the lack of major insights and 2) the huge quantity of typos (I stopped counting after around 20). The copy editor for this did an absolutely terrible job, I'm afraid to report (writing this guarantees a typo somewhere in my review :) ). Some of the players' names are spelled incorrectly, and some of the numbers in the charts are inconsistent. This is very distracting.The book is divided into 12 chapters, starting with a fairly trivial look at tabletop baseball games. The authors devote much attention to evaluating offensive performance, comparing various measures such as batting average, SLG, OBP, linear weights, total average, runs created and a few other more obscure ones. There is also some discussion of clutch hitting and a look at &quot;Did the best team win the World Series?&quot;One of the other problems I found was that the authors stop short of providing actual statistical formulas and get into hand-waving a few times. I see that they have all the academic credentials but it seems as though they took the &quot;book sales are inversely proportional to number of equations in the text&quot; relationship to heart. I felt the book suffered because of that.I'm not sure who I could recommend this book to. I have a feeling that some of the concepts might be too advanced for kids, and not deep enough for those who have a decent understanding of statistics. If you are into baseball stats but you don't know much about real statistics you will definitely find some new concepts in here, so I guess that is the audience."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"I'm not sure who the target audience for this book is. At the beginning the introduce the most basic of statistics concepts as well as the most basic of baseball concepts. And at the end they seem to assume lots of knowledge of statistics. As both a baseball fan and a mathematician, I felt the beginning of the book very slow, but I also worry that someone who isn't knowledgable in both already might have trouble following some of it.That said, the book was very well written, and posed some interesting ideas and questions. I wish it had been longer, as the last few chapters were really getting me into sabermetrics!"},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"As a statistician and baseball fan, I had high expectations for this book. Generally, those expectations were met, although I came away from this book feeling like an opportunity had been lost. The biggest problem with the book is that the authors can't seem to decide how much knowledge to assume of their readers. The first 100 pages or so are presented at a sub-high school level, while the last few chapters assume the reader to have taken higher-level college courses in statistics. Also, I do not expect any book to be written and edited perfectly, but the typos actually become an occassional distraction from the text.On the whole, though, I would still recommend this book--it is by far the best contemporary statistical breakdown of the game of baseball. It is an especially good complement to Michael Lewis's \\"Moneyball,\\" which is a more anecdotal presentation of similar material. If you enjoy baseball at all, and have even a passing interest in batting averages, ERAs, and HRs, you will be entertained by this book and will probably learn a lot, too."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"This one is a book for the Sabermetrically inclined who already have a background in stats. In the first couple of chapters, the authors review some basic concepts through the lens of baseball before getting into some deeper analyses. To be honest, there's nothing in here that you can't get in Baseball Between the Numbers (although to the authors' credit, this book predates BBTN by 6 years) but it's a decent starter's guide. Worth the read, although those with a background in Sabermetrics will probably want to pass."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"Very good book. Most academic types write about sports as if they have never watched a game in their life, but not so in this case. Good for beginners and others who already have a working knowledge of sabremetrics."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"The world of sabermetrics is a much-explored one. Many topics have already been explored by some stat guy or another in the last 20 years. Some have been explored many times (clutch hitting, for instance). One of the best things about this book is that because the author isn't particularly immersed in sabermetrics, he manages to strike out (NO PUN INTENDED) into new territory and has some somewhat new insight on things that have already been looked at elsewhere.Baseball game nerds will recognize the game at the beginning of the book as Ethan Allen's All-Star Baseball, one of the oldest on the market. It is, as noted, pretty basic, which is why it's so much easier to use as a model than, say, Strat-o-Matic or APBA (additionally, it isn't really, really awful, so it beats APBA there as well). He does return to the simulation from time to time, which is kind of fun but isn't really necessary: most statheads are well aware of the concepts of probability and random chance.One area he does really strike some new ground in is in the category of consistency. It's really just an introductory look at the subject (to sum it up shortly, he demonstrates that Todd Zeile in the late 90s was subject to a lot more streaks and slumps than you'd expect by random chance) and as such it doesn't really *prove* anything, but it's definitely an avenue that deserves more look.The book as a whole is worth nuggets of stuff like this. A full-on stathead will decry the All Star Baseball format because it doesn't truly model the way baseball works (as a guy who's done beta testing for a computer baseball game, I can confirm that people like this exist), but IMO that's a small criticism to make. A bigger one is that there are a lot of ideas tossed out but not a lot of proof made. However, if you already have TangoTiger's \\"The Book\\", subscribe to Baseball Prospectus, and have thrown away your Derek Jeter bobblehead because he sux, this is a good book to have on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"For anyone who wishes to understand cause and effect in baseball, this is a very insightful book. The authors clearly and convincingly demonstrate that many of the statistical outcomes we generally attribute to a player's ability are really nothing more than random effects. For example, a player with a lifetime batting average of .300 who hits .280 during a season is said to have had an \\"off year.\\" The authors show that any player who has a true batting ability to produce base hits in 30% of his at bats (i.e., a .300 hitter) can be expected to hit .280 or less or .320 or higher about one-third of the time. For someone who grew up thinking that all these year-to-year fluctuations were the result of \\"good years\\" and \\"bad years,\\" the very significant impact of randomness came as a rude awakening! But for the serious student of the game, this is a critically important insight.Similarly, the authors show that a team's win-loss record during any single season may not reflect the team's real ability. Again, in 162 game season, randomness rears its head. It is not that uncommon for a team to win 12 to 15 games less (or more) than its underlying talent would suggest.As we reduce the number of games in a series (for example, consider the typical best-of-seven post-season playoff format), the effects of randomness are greatly magnified. Thus it is not at all uncommon for the best major league team in any season to fail to win the World Series.\\"Curve Ball\\" is well written, and the authors do a good job of explaining the statistical models they employ. I often find myself returning to this book to refresh my understanding of baseball probabilities.The one deficiency that bothers me most is the lack of a subject index. Thus the reader is forced to thumb through the book to locate some particular topic of interest. But even so, this is an excellent book that belongs in any good baseball library."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"More than any other sport, baseball is a game of statistics. This book goes behind the numbers and looks at where the true patterns are and where the seeming patterns are just the result of chance.As an example, the book discusses how, in general, hitting is not affected by night play or day play; on the other hand, there is an effect for facing a right-hander versus a southpaw, based on the side of the plate you are on.Generally well-written, this book only sometimes gets bogged down in statistical calculations and is generally accessible to the nonmathematician. The main flaw in the book is its emphasis on hitting and the relative lack of writing on pitching. While there is plenty of discussion on the value of batting average, slugging percentage or on-base percentage in determining runs scored, there is no similar discussion on ERA or strikeouts and its impact on wins.The other problem I find with the book is it removes some of the mystique of the game. It's sometimes more fun not to overanalyze things; it's kind of like watching a magic show; if you understand what's happening, you feel smarter but some of the pleasure has gone away. Which is not to say that I'm not going to continue enjoying baseball, but I will look at the game with more scrutiny when it comes to all the statistics that are cited."},{"Title":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in the Game","review":"Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics And The Role Of Chance In The Game provides the non-specialist, general reader with a sophisticated by accessible approach to statistics that can greatly enhanced their understanding and appreciation of baseball numbers and the game itself.

Have done this before with other Lovelace books and enjoyed the nostalgic voyage, but this one stands out. The location descriptions, the plot twists, and the serious substantial themes woven throughout about what families are, provincialism and the damage it can do, how children can lead their parents to expand their viewpoints, I found myself quite impressed, all the while having a wonderful time immersed in Deep Valley again."},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"[...]The url above lists ALL Maud Hart Lovelace's books (including ones for grown-ups, some of which she even wrote along with \\"Joe\\"!). But of course the Betsy-Tacy series are for grown-ups, too! :-) I agree with everything everyone's written! Utter joie! What I love about these books is how boys and girls, and then young men and young women, HUNG OUT together (how Julia-of-the-thousand-beaus advises her sister Betsy not to hold a boy's hand because that was being \\"spooney\\"!). There is a kiss or two exchanged in this series, but don't tell anyone! How Julia's beau would give Betsy and her friends a dime to get rid of them! Ha ha! The PAIN of love is so well recounted, jealously, lessons learned -- remember how in highschool a few of the girls (Betsy the ringleader) form a \\"sorority\\" and how this cuts them off from people and the pain they suffer in this discovery? Remember the goatgirl, the Syrian Village...how they could roam their whole world, safe and free? What one reviewer said about rereading them and finding new gems each time... Ah, yes! Every true gem, when you turn it, dazzles with new sparkles. God bless Maud Hart Lovelace!Look at the Wordsworth poem with which she chooses to set the very first book off (\\"Betsy Tacy\\"):There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,The earth, and every common sight,To me did seemApparell'd in celestial light,The glory and the freshness of a dream"},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"Betsy Tacy and Tib,three little girls growing up in Deep Valley,Minnesota.They have their laughs and they have their crys.Since this was based on Maud Hart Lovelace's life,you feel as if you are at the turn of the century,watching them have all the fun that children can possibly have.I have read every single book in the Betsy,Tacy,and Tib series and even all of Lovelace's other novels.I recommend this book to someone who likes books taking place in the &quot;olden days&quot;....but it doesn't seem very old fashioned!This review refers to the paper-back edition of this book."},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"Ah, what sweet little girls Betsy, Tacy and Tib were. Well, until they splashed each other with mud and went begging...and messed up the kitchen by making Everything Pudding (ingredients: everything in the pantry)...and cut off each other's hair. Well, actually they weren't so sweet all the time, which is what makes this book GREAT.This is the story about three very real little girls who use their imaginations to entertain themselves. Of course, this means getting into trouble from time to time, but that doesn't discourage Betsy, Tacy and Tib from embarking on further adventures with each subsequent chapter.Maud Hart Lovelace is both an entertaining and poetic writer who deserves a prominent place in the world of children's literature. If you haven't read any of her books, please do so...you're in for a very special treat!!!"},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"The story continues in Betsy~Tacy and Tib when a new girl named Tib moves into the neighborhood and their friendship broadens and they are 9-10 years old. Now, the three girls have many more adventures together and even start their own club. They have their share of troubles that they get into and I chuckled to myself at quite a few of them. They also must deal with life and death issues such as illness and the loss of a family member. I believe that the experiences Betsy, Tacy and Tib share are universal ones related to enduring friendships, sibling rivalries, parental authority etc. I believe that the Betsy~Tacy books can open up a world to young girls that can also teach them about compassion, sharing, generosity and so much more.What I loved about Betsy~Tacy books was the simple and gentle approach to life, community and family. I would best describe them as wholesome, and they share a way of life that is different than our current modern lifestyles of today. There were no TV's, computers, cell phones to distract them away from the simpler things in life. I could relate to some of the girls experiences as I grew up in the 60's and 70's. I met my very first \\"best friend\\" in a similar way as Betsy when a new girl moved in across the street when I was between 3-4 years old. She was a year older and we became instant friends and loved playing dolls together. She was more of the bossy one who took charge and came up with the ideas that usually got us into trouble, similar to Betsy. I guess, I was more like Tacy who was a bit more shy and followed along with the \\"great\\" ideas. I also had red hair like Tacy as well. I loved cutting out paper dolls as a girl and so did Betsy, Tacy and Tib. They explored nature, built houses from wood, and were allowed some freedom to explore the world. These days, it is harder to trust our own world and society to allow our children to ride off on their bicycles or play unattended as for fear of predators and other dangers. I'm sure that there were issues in these times as well but we live in a different world now. There were also no TV's, computers, cell phones to distract them away from the simpler things in life. I think it would be enriching for more children to read the Betsy~Tacy books today and give them some wonderful ideas as to how to \\"play\\" without the use of all of the electronic media that they \\"think\\" they so desperately need to survive! In my opinion, as a mom and as an occupational therapist by profession, kids have lost some of the natural curiosity and ability to play easily and simply and many have to be taught imaginative play. I know that we are fortunate to have our electronic gadgets and it would be hard to live without them if we were to have to give them up. On the other hand, if we don't have all the \\"stuff\\" or limit it and have more of a balanced life, our children can live a simpler more imaginative life. I think it would be enriching for more children to read the Betsy~Tacy books which can open up a whole new world to a child, to me, that is the beauty of reading and books!The artwork was beautifully illustrated by Lois Lenski. There were wonderful black and white sketches throughout the books. They added charm and a way to imagine as a reader, what the girls worlds were like in Minnesota. I also enjoyed reading Maud Hart Lovelace's forward, notes and photos and sketches at the end of each book where she explains that much of the books are related to her real life. There is also a website dedicated to the Betsy~Tacy books called the Betsy~Tacy Society."},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"I read these books as a child and reread them to this day. The first four books, Betsy Tacy, Betsy Tacy and Tib, Betsy and Tacy Go Over the Big Hill, Betsy and Tacy Go Downtown are wonderful for a girl age 5 and up. The books progress in reading level as they go, as well as in themes. The final six books in the series, just reissued in 3 2-book volumes, are absolutely amazing. They are Heaven to Betsy/Betsy in Spite of Herself; Betsy was a Junior/Betsy and Joe; Betsy and the Great World/Betsy's Wedding and are great for a girl age 9 and up. We follow Betsy through four years of high school, with dances, rides in autos, boys and hijinks. Then she's off for a year of travel in Europe just prior to the outbreak of WWI and then she returns home to marry her high school sweetheart and begin on her writing career. Lovelace based these books on her own upbringing in Mankato, Minnesota and they are simply wonderful. This summer I traveled to Mankato for the Betsy Tacy Convention and saw Betsy's, Tacy's and Tib's house. I cannot wait to read these with my own daughter, but in the meantime, I will continue to reread them. They are my literary equivalent of comfort food.

Maud Hart Lovelace did a spectacular job writing these stories. My mother read the books and loved them, my sister and I read the books and loved them, and now my little girls are reading them and loving them. These books never seem to grow old even though they are set during the turn of the 20th century. As a child, I not only read them, I wore the books out! I read and re-read the books, I couldn't put them down. I talked about them so much to my friends, they started checking them out from the Library and we would play Betsy-Tacy during recess. Now set in a period of a hundred years ago, they are still captivating kids today. My husband read the first four books in the series to our kids (Ages 7, 5, 3, and 1 at the time) and they love them all. My oldest begged me to let her keep my copies in her room so she could read them herself.There are many great books in the series, this one in fact is not the first in the series.

The books take Betsy through grade school and high school, to Europe right before the 1st world war, then back to America for her wedding and the joys and troubles of married life.

That is the effect the Betsy-Tacy and Tib series of books had on me. I read the entire series about 14 years ago and even now, from time to time, I'll remember them and smile because of all the joy they brought into my life. They lived at the turn of the 20th century and grew up with the invention of the automobile and the first World War. Maud-Hart Lovelace writes of a time of innocence and wonder and I personally feel like Betsy and Tacy and Tib are life long friends that will always exist in my heart and I'll always hold dear the memories of their young lives. There are not many books that grab hold of you like this cherished series does but when they do, you will forever be caught up in the spell of three little girls growing up in a kinder and gentler era and their many adventures and loves and losses. I highly recommend these books to ANYONE if you want to understand a bygone era, when our grandparents were growing up, and see the world through their eyes. I loved the books when they were small and when Betsy went to Europe for a year and of all her escapades in Italy and Germany. I'll never forget the many Friday nights the gang would get together and eat onion sandwiches Betsy's father would make, and how everyone would sing around the piano. The genuine love and warmth the friends and family felt for one another was uplifting and heartwarming and beautiful to read about. And Betsy's boyfriend Joe was also a loyal friend and played a prominent role in the series. If I could step into any world from the past, I would choose their world. You can't ask more from a book.

After I first finished reading the series, I wished that the wonderful and talented author, Maud Hart Lovelace, had wrote more, (as if 11 books weren't enough). But, as the story of life, and of the wholesomely-spirited Betsy and her friends goes, every sweet simple thing must come to an end."},{"Title":"Betsy-Tacy and Tib","review":"The Betsy,Tacy and Tib books were among my favorites when I was a child.

I followed the adventures and drama of Betsy, Tacy, and Tib as children and all the way until they were in college. \\"Betsy-Tacy and Tib\\" is the follow up to the popular \\"Betsy-Tacy\\". The book pretty much picks up where \\"Betsy-Tacy\\" leaves off. In this book, the girls get a third friend named Tib, a cute blonde girl who had moved to Deep Valley with her family from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It didn't take very long for the two girls to hit it off with Tib.It quickly becomes apparent that Tib is more adventurous and free-spirited which gets Betsy and Tacy into heaps of trouble but what young girl didn't get into trouble at their age? \\"Betsy Tacy and Tib\\" is an equally wonderful follow up to this classic series.

However it's very clearly written and the author goes through great lengths to explain some of the jargon and technical elements to the point that any person unfamiliar with flying can understand.Many parts of the book, I found myself thinking, \\"Hey, I thought that only happened to me!\\" and brings back many memories of working my way through the ranks of aviation.

In 1898 he self-published the first edition of this book, and proposed migration of populations from overcrowded urban centers (thus relieving their congestion) to sparsely-settled circular rural districts he called \\"Garden Cities\\"----so named from the greenbelt of undeveloped or agricultural land that surrounded them, limiting the size and growth of the city. People would live and work in these cities, which would be cooperatively run by quasi-public organizations renting the property to tenants (both businesses and individuals).In the Introduction, Howard notes, \\"Palatial edifices and fearful slums are the strange, complementary features of modern cities.\\" By way of contrast, \\"Garden City is not only planned, but it is planned with a view to the very latest of modern requirements, and it is obviously always easier, and usually far more economical and completely satisfactory, to make out of fresh material a new instrument than to patch up and alter an old one.\\" He thought that Garden Cities would combine the best attractions of both \\"town\\" and \\"country,\\" and would be just large enough to promote a full social life, and would be linked to each other by a rapid-transit system.At the end of chapter 10, Howard summarizes, \\"My proposal is that there should be an earnest attempt to organize a migratory movement of population from our overcrowded centres to sparsely settled rural districts; ... that the migrants shall be guaranteed ... that the whole increase in land values due to their migration shall be secured to them; that this be done by creating an organization which ... shall receive all 'rate rents' and expend them in those public works which the migratory movement renders necessary or expedient ... by so laying out a Garden City that, as it grows, the free gifts of Nature---fresh air, sunlight, breathing room and playing room---shall be still retained in all needed abundance, and by so employing the resources of modern science that Art may supplement Nature, and life may become an abiding joy and delight.\\"This book is of abiding interest to utopians, those interested in intentional communities, New Towns, urban planning, the New Urbanism, and more.

It is definitely not an advanced SOAP book.It seems that the author does not understand .NET very well. In Chapter 1, he explains the function of CLR engine as compiling IL code into Windows or Unix based code. Why UNIX? Will Microsoft .NET ever support Unix platform? He wrote the entire Chapter 11 trying to talk about BizTalk server. However, the very first sentence of Chapter 11 he wrote: \\"Chances are good that you've never used Microsoft's BizTalk server and that you never will\\". What is the point of writing this? In this whole chapter, he did not even mention that the most important functions of BizTalk are:1. transform many different E*Commerce message formats (EDI, xCBL, cXML, SAP IDoc) into Microsoft XML doc.2. XLANG scheduling and Orchestration.3. Interface with Commerce Server and trading partners for catalog publishing and buying/selling.The index of the book is not well organized either, missing lots of important references.The book does not have enough diagrams to support the author's ideas or to describe the relationship among web technology components.

The author really only spends 80 pages on SOAP it self-including preamble and non-related text. The rest of the book is UDDI, WSDL, HTTP, XML-RPC, BizTalk and like 167 pages or appendices which are rehashes of information that you can find on the web that are better presented.The author also does not seem to know his topic very well and occasionally make statements such as SOAP may some day replace EDI which is silly since SOAP basically is a packaging protocol (he calls it a communication protocol which in some sense it is but only in a very general sense) basically defines how data is to be bundled, handled, and referenced. EDI deals with accountability, repudiation, complex exchange of data and programmatic information, is actually a standard, and is designed to model complex process while SOAP is not. Now if he said ebXML might replace EDI then I could take the statement seriously but SOAP will not be able to replace EDI.

As always, I enjoyed the adventure, shoot-'em-up, and beautiful ladies. The novel starts off with Longarm rightfully blasting a wife-beater on the train to Flagstaff, and not having a funeral parlor close-by or funds for a burial and service, he throws the miscreant off onto the railroad track with the corpse probably becoming wolf-food within hours. Of course, he ends up making love to the damsel in distress - something to do with eye contact and the rhymatic motion of the rails.It is more than a story of good vs. evil, available females, and water rights, and a passel of new characters, including Apaches. You have to read it yourself - it well worth the few bucks and your time. I liked it!"},{"Title":"Longarm 330: Longarm and the Apache War","review":"Any longtime reader of this series is going find this saga quite different. Longarm gets a very clear assignment from his boss but has a lot of trouble getting to the problem with all the diversions that keep cropping up along the way. It would be easy to ignore the injustices that confront him; but that's just not Longarm's way.Several times Longarm has to reach into his own lean pockets to help someone in need .It almost seems that he is playing the role of government in assistance 50 years before FDR came up with the New Deal.Too bad they didn't staff the departments with people like Longarm;a lot more would have been done,a lot faster ,and for a heck of a lot less money.In this saga,we meet some great characters.Gassy,but keep your distance,Geronimo,John Stanton,Old West artist,writer and mayor( I tried,but to no avail to find out if he was a real person). Anyone out there know?We get a bit of everything in this one.Rescue of a wonderful wife from a husband who doesn't deserve her,a train ride which turns out to be both enjoyable as well as a lesson on how not to depart from it.A short course in what a well executed scalping should look like,what it feels like to hear someone digging your grave,and even Longarm doing some gravedigging himself.We see how Longarm goes out of his way to help others and in return gets repaid well by those he helped.If you've ever wondered what \\"Waterboarding\\"is like;Longarm shows his type,and there was no ACLU waiting to aid the guilty.A great read,just too bad it ended so soon.Oh yeah! The Apache War in the title?..You'll just have to read the book to find out about that.\\"He damn well better consent to see me\\", Longarm thought.\\"Sometimes it is better to sleep with the enemy to know his strenghtsand weaknesses.\\" Donita\\"How bad are you hit this time?,Longarm asked.\\"Not bad Marshal.Not so bad that I won't live to spit on both of theirgraves!\\",Gassy said."},{"Title":"Longarm 330: Longarm and the Apache War","review":"As a long time fan of the Longarm series I have had an opportunity to read and review numerous titles in the past. For those new readers of Custis Long, U.S. Deputy Federal Marshal books, these are formula western novels written by different authors all under the same name of \\"Tabor Evans.\\" This is why there is such a difference in writing styles at various times when reading these novels. I truly enjoyed reading Longarm and the Apache War, even though no war actually started. However, unlike a lot of book reviewers, I stick to my policy of not giving too much away when reviewing a novel and spoil it for the future reader.This story flows well and has interesting characters. From the very first chapter Longarm gets involved in a domestic dispute and winds up helping a battered wife leave her drunkin abusive husband. The novel quickly moves to Custis receiving another dangerous assignment from his boss Marshal Billy Vail. Like all of the Custis Long series there is the right amount of drama, conflict, fights, shoot-outs, and love making to keep you turning the pages. My only small complaint is that the writer should have also included a little more the western lingo we are used to reading in a Longarm novel. Nevertheless, I like this particular writer's style and look forward to reading more Longarm western adventures written by himIn conclusion, if you are a fan of this adult western series you will love reading Longarm and the Apachi War.Rating: 5 Stars.

The writing is good and the characters are better. Especially 'Gassy' (J. D. Gaston) an old timer, muleskinner and miner, whose attacks of a flatulent system can at the least make a mule's ears quiver and at the worst drive people away from him. Or as he says when Long asks his name, \\"...call me gassy because I fart so much.\\"This new Apache war is not your average affair, no, past Apache wars ended in Arizona Territory some years back. This newer one is in the vicinity of Canyon City and its adjacent reservation will be a war over who owns water rights. That's correct, the Apaches need the water to flow through the reservation as it always has, which unscrupulous town leaders are now diverting, away from the Apache farms of corn, cotton, and hay. The Apaches have settled down and settled in to lead peaceful lives and with the water flowing through the reservation (San Carlos Indian Reservation) are making a success of it. Some whites, however, see their profits increase if another war can be brought about.Deputy U.S. Marshal Custis Long out of Denver will attempt to avoid any blood shed other than that he creates. Longarm as he is known and loved, will have some able assistance from good ole 'gassy' and a young, Senorita named Donita Rameriz. This is a very complex and dangerous situation, but as Longarm asks: How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. This will be Deputy Marshal Long'a approach to not only defeating the town leaders but also the U.S. Army."},{"Title":"Music librarianship: A practical guide","review":"Eric T. Bryant, a charming man and an outstanding librarian, wrote two editions of his wonderfully useful and thoughtful guide to the profession of music librarianship. Prior to the earlier (1959) edition of Bryant\`s own study, was the initial edition (also still recommendable) of \\"Music Libraries\\" by Lionel Roy McColvin and Harold Reeves, also destined to appear in two editions (firstly in 1937, then revised by Jack Dove for publication anew in 1965). Despite the usually opposite tendency among monographs of this sort for later editions to displace the earlier ones that had been in use, Bryant\`s original 1959 edition of his own work remains decidedly as useful as the later edition. It is somewhat less obsessed with technicalities and minutiae of cataloguing and so forth, but that is due partly to the fact that neither of the major Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (A.A.C.R.) codes of 1967 and 1978, which so minutely normalised the cataloguing of printed music and of sound recordings, had been published yet.With all of the standardisation that has occurred in librarianship (and, to some extent, in the music trades) since the 1950s, in which the two editions of the Anglo-Cataloguing codes themselves played such an important part, many music librarians have lost sight of practical needs and of appropriately flexible approaches; perhaps Bryant\`s main concentration on the needs of public libraries, especially small and medium sized ones, kept him from the kind of methodical perfectionism and hide-bound conformity, even by 1985 and certainly back in 1957, to norms that so help but also bedevil modern librarianship. In his 1985 revision of the book, Bryant, fortunately, explains in ample deal not only the 1967 and 1985 A.A.C.R. codes but also North America\`s A.L.A., L.C., and M.L.A. codes which had antedated 1967\`s A.A.C.R.-1. Bryant also describes some codes authorised by U.K. professional organisations as well as the I.A.M.L., all of which are rather little known in North America, having preceded and prefigured, or overlapped, the formulation of those Anglo-American rule books of 1967 and 1978. Even cataloguing rules and guidelines that had preceded all of these fall under the purview of Bryant\`s study. Indeed, Bryant goes rather far back into catalogue rule development and revision, discussing, among several other codes, the 1908 Anglo-American rules, though, surprisingly, not the \\"Cataloguing Rules of the Vatican Library\\" of 1928-1931 which had much influence on later codes (although, admittedly, not so much regarding specifically the cataloguing of music) and which libraries of French- and Spanish-speaking regions, among others, widely used in the first part of the 20th century; Bryant handled the theory and precepts behind good music librarianship with an even broader retroactive and then-current scope in the 1985 revision of his own book than he had done in 1959, part of the advantages of reading alike the two editions of it, the latter of which benefits from the updating which the 1985 edition, so extensively rewritten, provided. In the 1985 revision of Bryant\`s work, one also notes with pleasure (the more so for a Canadian reader!) that he also discusses, to quite helpful effect, the 1979 revision, compatible with AACR-2 (i.e., the second edition of at least three, one of them published yet later, after the time of the 1985 edition of Bryant\`s book) of \\"Nonbook Materials: the Organization of Integrated Collections\\", by Canada\`s very own multimedia specialist, Jean Weihs.Bryant\`s discussion of various classification schemes, for example, is one of the quite absorbing features of both editions of the work, even if this part of music cataloguing is only really only a secondary aspect (despite public perception) of bibliographic control, the major underlying concepts (reflected eventually, in variously ways, in the specific rules of the later great Anglo-American codes of 1967 and of 1978, as well as of the earlier A.L.A. and M.L.A. rules (and, not to be forgotten, such earlier codes as the terse Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules of 1908) which preceded them. All of the classification schemes and cataloguing codes, as well as past and former practice merit the attention of the historian and theorist, so that the 1959 and 1985 editions alike remain of importance to those interested in these matters. In the 1985 edition of Bryant\`s book, the 1967 and 1978 codes receive nearly equal treatment one to the other in the revision (and, indeed, one notes that the examples of cataloguing given reflect, variously, the rules (closely or loosely) of both of these editions of the A.A.C.R.). Such cataloguing rules are principles which are not electably interchangeable, as the various classification schemes happen to be. One seldom sees in the literature much about the Bliss classification and some of the other schemes, and, as a British professional with such contact with public and broadcasting libraries, Bryant avoids, in the earlier edition, thankfully then at least, the idolatrous preference that North American music librarians hold for the miserable and tortuous U.S. Library of Congress classification (Class M of which is for music) with its useless kinks, oddities, inconsistencies, and certain needless divisions of class assignment for essentially the same kind of printed music at far-separated parts of the classification tables. (On the other hand, for all of its kinks, Bryant does give an higher approval rating to the L.C. and Bliss classifications, for music, than he does for the several other ones. all of which he describes meticulously.) Bryant was to drop in the 1985 edition, as classification schemes increasingly unused and/or abandoned, his interesting evaluation of the Bliss and the Cutter Expansive classifications (despite the predilection for the former that he expressed in this 1959 edition), while choosing to give fairly detailed discussion in 1985 to the still significant Dickinson Classification and its variants, as well as the Phoenix 780s (music) schedule and some other improvements on Dewey\`s Decimal Classification which had not appeared yet at the time of this 1959 edition (as well as some prior ones retained for explanation).As with principles and practice of bibliographic control, so it is with music library administration, acquisitions and collection development, with administration, budgets, equipment, and supervision, with reference work, and with other aspects of music librarianship: while much has changed and been codified and standardised (often for better but also, in some ways, for loss) over the years since both editions of Bryant\`s treatise have appeared, much about how the librarian carries out these functions still applies, i.e. the principles that should guide conceiving and executing music library work to do well and flexibly what is suitable, accurate, and fitting (both for present and anticipated future realities), rather than what is merely perfunctorily \\"correct\\" at any particular time. Thus, Bryant\`s second edition of his book, almost amounts to such a different work (but not necessarily to a superior one), that the 1985 edition, despite its many excellences, fails to displace entirely the earlier and classic 1959 edition. While it is true that music librarianship has changed enormously since 1959 (especially regarding that normalisation of standards and the assault of computers upon the practice of librarianship), there is much in the first edition of Bryant\`s book that still applies at the level of basic principles and precepts, which a music librarian, especially in a public library setting, ignores at his own peril.An especially welcome feature, as the (now retired) music librarian writing this review finds in Bryant\`s work in its 1959 form, is the continuing usefulness of the basic repertory list for what any music library should have as the core of its collection. This feature is one which the second edition, alas, probably in its effort to be more compact, dropped altogether. The list itself and the comments on the music are pertinent, well considered, and make for a pleasingly well-rounded basic library collection of classical music. A North American librarian, of course, can discount Bryant\`s tendency to put so much more emphasis on British composers, and correspondingly less on Canadian and American ones, than s/he would do so in deciding how far to follow, in placing orders for the printed music (and editions thereof), Bryant\`s rcommendations to include such a large proportion of these British composers and their music. (A North American music librarian well might question the extent to which they really are so essential and thus whether to include or to refrain from selecting such an high number of works, especially of vocal music, by U.K. composers to be in a collection\`s initial holdings.) As for the North American musical works to order for a basic collection, they can be filled in for by using, selectively, any of the M.L.A. basic repertory lists for printed music (and recordings) for this and any other gap in coverage (of which there really are not many at the basic level) in Bryant\`s list. However, those M.L.A. lists, even the briefer of them, tend to be rather too much more comprehensive in the music, of whatever origins, that they list (which is true also of the second volume, likewise devoted to such listings, of McColvin and Reeves\` work) than a starting collection really can be in the early stages of collection development, so it is better to supplement Bryant\`s listings with those of the Music Library Association (the \\"M.L.A.\\" already mentioned) rather than vice versa. Bryant\`s grading of how essential the works which he sites are to smaller libraries or to early stages of collection development further help the librarian, whether a music specialist or a generalist, to identify the most crucially important scores and other printed music to acquire firstly for a beginning collection, then, by increments, for a collection as it grows. The annotations mostly are quite helpful and practical. On the other hand, the recommendations for choosing among editions of the works tend to exclude too many fine or at least utilitarian offerings from American music publishers (e.g., International Music Co., Kalmus) Of course, vintage and current popular, ethnic, and jazz music needs to be accounted for nowadays, especially by recordings, in most music collections, and lists of basic printed music and of sound recordings, of which there are many, can be mustered up to balance Bryant\`s classically-oriented list.It is this earlier 1959 edition that merits reprint publication as much, at least, as the second edition (the latter being the one reprinted). Search out the original edition of Bryant\`s book to improve your understanding and practice of the noble profession of music librarianship!"},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"The Great Depression is an event that tends to dominate the history of America from 1920-1940, and while it certainly had an impact, this impact was not uniformly felt throughout the country. Other factors helped shape the modern world we live in today, and many of them had their genesis in the period 1920-1940. Music, movies, diet, fashion, where people lived, what they did on dates, and even family planning -- this book covers it all and does so in a way that is easy to read and entertaining. If you think the Depression and Prohibition are all there was to life during this time, then I recommend you pick up this book for a more well-rounded view."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"The automobile and electricity are so common in today's society that it is difficult to imagine life without them. It is easy to forget that at one time these things we take for granted were new innovations that altered every aspect of life. In Kyvig's thoughtful examination of American daily life through the 1920s and 1930s, he explores the innovations that changed daily life and the varying speeds at which changes were accepted. He begins his enlightening examination with a discussion of daily life in the 1920s, prior to many of the changes he later discusses. Then he smoothly transitions into a discussion of the technology that completely changed the lives of contemporary Americans in both rural and urban settings, including the automobile, electricity, radio and cinema. Kyvig's clever and insightful portrayal demonstrates the full implications of technology. For example, he shows how the automobile made it possible for people live farther from work, led to the school consolidation movement and changed dating rituals as teenagers ventured farther than their own front porches with their dates for the first time.His discussion on the Great Depression, however, changes its focus to a discussion of government adminstration and programs, and is not as fascinating or focused on \\"daily life\\" of common people as the rest of his book.This book was enjoyable to read and covered a variety of aspects on the daily lives of Americans, so it would have wide appeal for a number of readers. It is backed by solid scholarly research, and includes fascinating pictures that add to the enjoyment of the narrative. Kyvig has a true talent for writing, and this is apparent through reading his book. His study should not be overlooked as just another book on daily life in the 1920s and 1930s - it is an all-encompassing study that provides insight into a number of aspects of daily life. It also provides a detailed, fascinating history of the development of the automobile and its impacts on life."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940, by David E. Kyvig, traces the developments in American culture and lifestyle during this critical period. Using US Census Data, Kyvig calls attention to the demographic changes that occurred over these dynamic twenty years, one of the strong points of this book. Among the technological developments discussed are the automobile, electricity, radio and movies. There are two chapters devoted to the day-to-day aspects of life during that time covering such topics as food, fashion, hygiene, courtship, etc. Kyvig also discusses the impact of the Great Depression, the New Deal and the expanded role of government during that era.As a former history teacher, this book reminds me strongly of an expanded version of the typical US History chapter covering this time period. It isn't terribly deep, but does provide a solid overview. It is well-written, easy to read, and is a good starting point for people interested in the time period (or for students who need help for a research paper). Those of us who want more detailed information will need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"The author, whose master work, Explicit and Authentic Acts/Amending the U.S. Constitution, I read with great satisfaction on 6 Feb 1998 and which was a co-winner of the 1997 Bancroft History prize, does in this work a good job discussing the two decades referred to in the title, devoting separate chapters to automobiles, electricity, radio, cinema, culture, and other topics. He discusses these without much foreshadowing, thus taking us into events as they appeared to the people who lived during them, rather than looking at them from the present. I found the book well-done and there is a good bibliography."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"My real interest in this book was to learn how ordinary people coped with life in a great depression. What interests me is in finding out how certain parts of society experienced it as I am sure the impact varies greatly.This book - despite its title - clearly fails to answer this. Sure it tells me some of the reasons around the boom and bust, and some statistics on unemplyment, etc. But what I really wanted was the 'how they lived their lives' aspect that the title and blurb teased me with.Despite my annoyance, I can't give this a 1 star (which is what it is worth to me) since it is a well written book and covers the topic well."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"If we don't learn from the past....This book is well-written: it is not a dry, plodding description of the Great Depression of the 30's and the decades before and after. The gaiety of the Roaring Twenties, Prohibition notwithstanding, is well-described, to the extent one can almost step into the post-WWI exhilaration. Only to be followed by financial disaster.Then the crash of the stock market, explained so that even I, a non-financial-investments person, can comprehend the cause and effects. The daily life, which was what I initially sought to understand, was thoroughly examined from the popular attendance of the new talkies to the government programs initiated to alleviate the dire circumstances of so many people.I recommend this book to anyone interested in learning from the past: a past that may resemble our future!"},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"I could not put this book down...certainly was the cause of a few tired mornings at work for keeping me up too late! It covers all the small details of life that most history books never get into. I was fascinated by all the \\"mundane\\" aspects of life that the author does a great job of describing in detail. You really get a good sense of what life was like during this time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"History is more than the story of big, important men making important decisions. Any worthy historical account needs to give insight into how the masses lived during a given time. This book accomplishes just that and tells the reader how day to day life was, for most Americans, from 1920-1940. For example, in 1920 less than half of Americans had electricity or running water and the situation only gradually improved. Important facts like that are left out from most other accounts, which is why this is a must-read for anyone who wants to know about the subject. To understand the World War II generation, this book should be mandatory. I used this book as a reference when I wrote my own book. See:Alcohol, Boat Chases, and Shootouts!

This author realized the importance to the reader of understanding the decade leading up to the Crash and the Depression, as well as learning about day-to-day life as it was lived by average Americans in order to reach a full understanding of what America was like during this time. This is EXACTLY the approach I was looking for and I was very pleased, indeed, by this volume. It is well-researched and well-written, and relates information I have had trouble finding elsewhere. I highly recommend it for a broad range of ages."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"This was a great read. I like how the author highlighted the social and the economic and the cultural changes that took place during these formative years in 20th century America. You read about the genius, yet uncompromising Henry Ford, who designed the Model T, and later the Model A, but failed in his bid to create a winning farm tractor (they kept tipping over backward).You will also read about the greed and the heavy loans that banks gave out that led to the 1929 stock market crash. But you will also read about FDR's tremendous reforms: The creation of Social Security, the SEC, the FDIC, the Agricultural Adjustment Act (which was later struck down by the Supreme Court, but reintroduced in a different incarnation based on taxes), TVA, and many others.I enjoyed reading about how American life changed with the advent of electric light in homes, which led people to read more. The chapters on marriage, divorce, and sexuality were also interesting.This is a great book about the roaring Twenties and the depressing Thirties."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"Although this book is undeniably thoroughly researched, I must agree with some of the other reviewers on here in that this a dry, dull overview of what was a fascinating time. By the end of the book you will have very little idea of what life was like, on a personal level, for people living during these days. Having grown up with grandparents who were young adults during the 30s, I can categorically state that there are many fascinating tales to tell of these decades - this book provides none of them, and most frustrating of all provides no material not readily available elsewhere."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"This is a very good introduction to the social history of the Stats between the two World Wars. It focuses primarily on the Twenties, but there is a good long cue on the Thirties too.The book starts off with a picture of the United States at the closing of WWI, a portrait that tries to take in as diverse situations as possible, with a heavy help form the statistics of the Census (statistics are a great part of this book, which if on one hand grounds the matter in an objective perspective, on the other comes across as dry in many places) and some anthropological studies of the period.Because the Twenties are essentially years of big changes, regarding so many ways of life, this is where the book focuses. The first few chapters deal with the three more important innovations in the decade: the car, the radio and electricity. Things that already existed, but now became so widely common to change the way people worked as well as they used their free time. In response to this new asset of life - more free in many respects - people expectations changed as well, so that to a material change correspond a more \`spiritual' one.A couple of long chapters in the middle of the book deal with the way life moved in the short run (everyday life) and in the long run (a year around portrait of life). Here is where the true details come out: the way life changed inside the house, the way houses changed in response to new technology and new expectations, the way people behaved toward one another, the way they reacted to small and big event in life (going to school, falling in love, managing a family, dealing with life events like births and deaths). Changing behaviours toward job, changing behaviours toward entertainments, changing behaviours toward food, clothes, hairstyle, advertisement.And to be honest, what impressed me the most about these chapters concerning the expectation of people and the way they sought to realise them, is how much it's similar to today attitude. It's true, there are so many different things between the Twenties and today, but there are also so many similarities. More, in my opinion, than with any other past decades. It's here that so many things we take for granted first entered people's life (electric appliances, the car, far and fast communication - radio and phone - but also the way people get together - parties, cinema - and look to each other - a less restrained, less rules-heavy way of relation). It's here, in a way, that the world as we know it today started.Then in a couple of chapters, the book tries to touch all other important aspects of social life: policies, economics, law and order. These are very wide and complex matters, though, and the book only touches them by. The soar and fall of the KKK, important trials that impacted on the society's perception of themselves (Scottsboro, Sacco and Vanzetti), natural catastrophes that affected entire sections of the population (the Dust Bowl), the attitude and real situation of criminal life, the attitude toward immigrationAll of these is dealt with with great essentiality and the reader is left wanting to know more. And this is a shame, although I understand the author had to make a choice about the subject matter.The last third of the book deals with the Thirties and the Great Depression. It starts off with a very vivid description of the onset of the Depression and the way it affected people's life. It explains in a clear, simple way (maybe even too simplified, but I won't complain about that) what caused the 1929 stockmarket crash, and how the psychological and emotional reaction of people affected it as well as an objective economic difficulty. It describes in essential, but very vivid details, and with scant or no statistics, what life was for a great part of people. It was nearly more a narration than dissertation.The last chapter then relates the work of the New Deal. It is essentially a chart of the many initiatives the government took to relief people's life, with brief dissertations of why those measures were taken and how people reacted to them. A bit dry, maybe (also because of the heavy statistics), but interesting all the same.The last chapter is a second portrait of American society at the verge of WWII. Again statistics, again considerations, again a look to the same communities the book opened with and to the changes they had been through in the Twenties and Thirties.Overall, a very interesting book. Maybe more valuable for people interested in the Twenties than the Thirties (the Great Depression is dealt with in an admittedly extremely essential way), but certainly enough to get a good overall grasp to life during these two decades."},{"Title":"Daily Life in the United States, 1920-1940: How Americans Lived Through the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression","review":"Kyvig gives us a straightforward, clear history of two vital decades in U.S. history.

Instead, this is written as though there were no humans or rather that they are merely being studied through statistical patterns. Example: 20.2% of the population lived in the northeast in 1910 vs. 16.5% after World War I. 37% had electricity in 1920 vs. 74% by the end of 1937. The only slices of real LIFE offered in this book come from quoting another author's book! I'm the rare kind of person who finds statistics and interpreting them fascinating. But this is hardly a reflection of daily life in any era, only a compilation of statistics and a spattering of conclusions drawn from the whole. I could have obtained virtually the same info from the US Census Bureau.Rather than being organized chronilogically, the book is divided into subjects such as prohibition, automobiles, electricity, radio, cinema. Each chapter attempts to explain \\"the effect\\" of these subjects as they changed throughout the two decades, especially using percentages of public participation (in prohibition compliance or defiance, automobile ownership, etc.) It is left to the reader to reorganize and make conclusions about how these topics co-existed and affected each other and the lives of the people who lived through them. Humans have no emotions at all in this book! It is as though he is studying the fashion habits of ants.I kept hoping it would get better.

One thing this book does really well is differentiate between different geographic/economic areas. On multiple occasions, I'd be reading about some aspect of city life (use of electricity, automobiles, wages, etc), and I'd be thinking \\"I wonder if it was the same in the rural areas,\\" then BAM, the author would answer my question.Another review said the book is general, and I guess that may be the case, but it gives a nice sweeping overview of pretty much everything you'd want to know.My only caveat with this book is that it got a little repetitive at times and some language was awkward.

And perhaps it was. But everything in a movie (or TV show) must first serve the story. Being accurate to history sits lower on the priority list. So it's always good to have reliable sources, like books such as this one, to tell us what life was really like.

I was excited to get started reading this book because Lynn Bulock has been on my Amazon recommendations list for so long. Well, it started out okay, but it never really picked up.

Ken was the brooding bar owner with baggage that he couldn't get past. They become close, then in a moment of misunderstanding Ken accuses Tallie of something she didn't do.

So this is definitely a book for the specialist in the byways of genre films.The reviews are generally a lot of fun, though the author's opinions are a lot more mainstream and forgiving of big-budget dross than I'd like; better are his rants about the terrible films that make up an expectedly large chunk of the book.

In Dr. Cat's Helping Handbook: A Compassionate Guide for Being Human, she shows how readers can do the same. This handsome and well-crafted first book is her contribution to the process of personal growth.Packed with wisdom, empowerment, and love, Dr. Cat's Helping Handbook reveals ways to move from merely living life to loving life. This transition can occur through a change of consciousness induced by exploring the depths of emotion in very practical ways. According to Dr. Cat, it's possible to shift a frame of reference to a place where guilt is useful, pain has a message, and addiction leads to awareness. What's more, it is possible to keep all emotions, none of which are good, bad, right, or wrong. Dr. Cat is a gentle inner guide sharing intimate aspects of her own learning to illuminate the underlying truths of addiction, abuse, anger, shame, and fear.&quot;When you meet your needs as they are, without judgments or conditions, they can evolve naturally in a way that supports your spiritual growth,&quot; says Dr. Cat. &quot;It's not necessary to pit your spirituality against your humanity.&quot;Fifteen years in the making, Dr. Cat's Helping Handbook is full of hard-won wisdom. Being in tune with both the mental and physical worlds, Dr. Cat draws from a lifetime of intensity. She demonstrates that it's possible to learn from and be in charge of life itself. Courageously, she explores what it means to be alive. She has a talent for distilling her personal experience into practical pathways for life discoveries. For instance, she uses &quot;conscious ritual&quot; as a creative way to meet her need for connection. &quot;With compassion for my human tendency toward attachment and familiarity, I use rituals to celebrate these tendencies in positive ways, instead of denying them. Conscious ritual increases awareness; addiction decreases it.&quot;Dr. Cat insightfully suggests that what may not be working in life can be an opening to what works if there is willingness to recognize fears of both pain and pleasure. Such fears, she says, are openings to aliveness. Step-by-step, she tenderly shows how to move deeper into feelings. This allows for the emergence of a truer connection to self and confidence that encourages being in the moment, spontaneity in expression, and enthusiasm for life. Not afraid to take strong positions, Dr. Cat speaks frankly about such things as &quot;the fight-or-flight response that goes beyond personal anger to collective survival.&quot; She discloses how she makes sense of violence and war, and explains how she makes peace with her pacifist tendencies &quot;so they don't tyrannize all my other principles.&quot; Finally, she dares readers to explore their relationship with violence &quot;all the way down to its most terrifying, enigmatic, primitive core.&quot;Through an amazing range of thought-provoking and memory-stimulating exercises, Dr. Cat models digging deeply to excavate the buried parts of self. At the same time, she honors the body with love, compassion, and wonder. In short, Dr. Cat's Helping Handbook will work on you, and inspire you to work on yourself, relentlessly assisting you in becoming your own best ally.There are several special gifts in this volume of more than fifty chapters, including &quot;How to Be Seriously Silly,&quot; &quot;The Dilemma of Forgiveness,&quot; &quot;Four Principles of Effective Apology,&quot; &quot;The Resolution Prayer,&quot; &quot;Death as an Adviser,&quot; and &quot;My Personal Rules of Respect.&quot; There is also an in-depth section called &quot;The Group as Healer,&quot; along with a section of guided meditations, plus an extensive and helpful bibliography. For good measure, Dr. Cat has included a wonderful collection of pithy quotes in the margins, adding just the right touch.This powerful guidebook can open sensitive eyes and lead right to the heart of the matter.

DeForrest was a former military enlisted man who ended up managing a great deal of the prisoner interrogation for a major Agency facility in-country. His story ties together a number of important themes, from the failure of Ivy League types to understand what they were dealing with to the inadequacies (and sometimes the superiority) of vast numbers of &quot;contract&quot; case officers who would normally not have been hired, to the very real value of systematically debriefing all prisoners and entering the results into a database amenable to search and retrieval, something we don't know how to do today. Across every major military operation since Viet-Nam, it has been my experience that we have no table of organization and equipment, completely inadequate numbers of trained interrogators and translators, and no commitment to the tedious but essential work of extracting knowledge from large numbers of hostile prisoners."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"This expose is badly needed.I am not a Mormon, but I do know that the original believers advocated polygamy and later on the mainstream LDS church repudiated it. Since I don't have a thorough knowledge of Mormon doctrine so I'll not attempt to do a critique on it here.But I do know that the kind of polygamy shown in this book is ghastly. That's the only way I can describe it.1. First of all, the young age of these brides is unbelievable. Twelve, thirteen, fourteen years old. I believe that no matter what the culture, a person needs to mature emotionally and physically before marriage.2. The refusal of many of these men to support their wives and children, making them dependent on the welfare system. This is just plain unbiblical. Even in the early cases of polygamous marriages in the Old Testament, the Patriarchs kept their wives and families fed and cared for.3. The spousal beatings. If these people claim to believe the Bible along with their Mormon doctrines, they will have to realize that there is not one command given to men (in either the Old or New Testaments)that they can beat their wives. In one of the examples given in Moore-Emmet's book, a man hit his wife so hard that he broke her eardrum. Religion or no religion, there's one word for an act like that -- it's a CRIME! And it needs to be prosecuted as one. (By the way, the man I just mentioned was prosecuted later on.)4. Although this book mostly concentrated on the plight of the girls, it also showed that young boys can be victimized, too -- that sometimes they are considered threats to the older men who want the young wives.5. The slowness of the city and state governments to do anything about it. When the whole state is majority Mormon, I can understand the uneasiness about prosecuting polygamy in general, although I think it needs to be done. But how about outright abuse that is against the law? Or, for those who think they are above the law of the United States, how about against the Bible itself?I think polygamy is set up for problems, and I'm not just saying this because I'm female. History is full of family squabbles over the children of one mother ganging up on their half-brothers and sisters who are descended from a different mother. It can breed a lot of jealousy and resentment because many men will have their favorite wives and neglect the others.It's a thorny problem that won't go away soon. But thanks to this and other books like it, our attention can be guided to the problem and some time in the future we can find a solution. We must never forget about it."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"Anyone who believes polygamy and slavery are sins of other cultures or times, will find this disturbing collection of true stories about contemporary American women who have escaped from polygamous marriages both shocking and a call to action. Readers learn about girls who are \\"bred\\" to become young brides of their own male relatives or of their father's close friends, of women denied education, freedom, and even the use of money, and of local government officials complicit in keeping the women and girls enslaved, even physically beaten.Most chilling to me is the patriarchy's justification for polygamy, rooted primarily in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' (Mormon) history and doctrine. Although polygamy was officially outlawed by the Church in the late 1800s via a revelation (that many fundamentalists believe was politically motivated so Utah would attain statehood), the practice flourishes in growing enclaves in Utah and surrounding areas.This powerful expose shows how the huge families of sister-wives and children drain welfare funds in order to survive and typically live in poverty while the patriarch enjoys his sexual, monetary, and religious status. It also tells of a group called TAPESTRY that is dedicated to helping the women and children escape from the religious and sexual domination of these men.My feelings while reading this book included anger and disbelief, shock and sorrow, a voyeuristic horror, and finally pride in the women brave enough to tell their stories to the author so that the sexual predators could be \\"outed\\" and their victims, especially the young girls, offered hope of escaping the horror of this slavery. Polygamy in God's name is certainly NOT \\"sex between consenting adults\\" when young girls are treated as wombs and chattel, and given no choice in who or when they wed.By giving a voice to the brave sister-wives, and creating an underground railroad route for others to escape, \\"God's Brothel,\\" the author and other members of TAPESTRY may be the Harriet Tubmans of our time."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"Andrea Moore Emmett opens our eyes to a horror that most of us assumed did not exist in modern-day America.

I've read a lot about it and living in Utah and having been raised in the mormon community, I figured I had a good feel for what might go on behind the walls of these compounds and homes. The stories in this book describe pretty much every perversion and abuse I might have guessed could occur in such an environment. All it takes is an understanding of patriarchal cult/religion and power combined with human nature to figure that what these women describe makes sense.I learned a little bit more about the state of Utah and how far it is from bringing justice and support where it is most needed. With the prevailing mainstream mormon influence within the power structures of this state, it seems they are still in the business of protecting their own polygamous doctrine and history first and foremost.So far, the most revealing book I've read on polygamy. Others that I've read have left me feeling that there was much untold."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"I was very impressed with the research into the various groups who practice Pologmy worldwide. This book has a map showing where these groups are thoughout the USA, and if they are Christian, Muslim or Fundamentalist Morman. She does explain that the Modern LDS church DOES NOT condone Pologamy, and explains why some groups continue to believe that this is the only way to heaven.The first part of this book is a history of Pologamy, and gives a summary of many groups and how and why they got started. She makes it very clear that this is not just a \\"Morman\\" occurance, but rather widely practiced in many religions.The second part contains 18 stories of women and girls from various groups who have chosen to withdrawal from this lifestyle, and have begun to speak out what their experience were, and how it affected them and their families. It is an eye-opening group of stories, allowing the reader inside the walls of the groups.The people who become involved in these groups come to a believe that this lifestyle will be an escape from the stressful way the modern American lives. It appears to be a close knit family, pulling their money together, avoiding outside stressors, and living a Godly life in order to obtain lasting life in the here-after.Perhaps there are many groups who do practice the above: however, what this book tells is the stories where the system has gone corrupt, forcing girls as young as 12 into marriages, demanding they have a child a year, discarding males, and using the public welfare system to support the children. Education is withheld, and attempting to leave the groups can become a deadly game for the women and children.I recommend this book for anyone interested in studying this lifestyle because it tells stories of all religious pologmany groups, and you hear the actual stories of 18"},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"This powerful book is hard to read at any length because of the horrifying stories it contains. It is clear that polygamy (specifically the marriage of many women to one man) turns ordinary men into abusive cult leaders. Want to create your very own Jim Jones, David Koresh or Sun Myung Moon? Then tell a man it is God's will that he should marry many wives. He will proceed to ignore the emotional anguish of his wives as they try and fail to suppress their inevitable jealousy, and he will walk around as if he is perfect and beyond reproach even as he perpetrates or encourages rape, incest, child abuse, neglect, welfare fraud, and murder. Only a truly cruel God would wish such a fate on women and children. The mainstream Mormon Church should have not merely discontinued the practice of polygamy (as they did in 1890); they should have declared that the entire revelation of Joseph Smith with regard to polygamy had been mistaken. But they didn't, and as a result breakaway sects of fundamentalist Mormons still feel encouraged to engage in this destructive practice. Meanwhile, the State of Utah, being dominated by Mormons, tries as much as possible to ignore the abuses. After a thoughtful introduction by the author, this book contains the painful stories of 18 women who broke free. You will not be able to take a laissez-faire attitude to polygamy again after you read this."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"This is about Bible-based fundamentalist polygamy. This is a hot topic associated with the current best sellerEscapeand also Jon Krakauer sensationalUnder the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith. Those books convey polygamy is a euphemism for cults that promote child rape and women enslavement.The author discloses a map showing Mormons and Christian fundamentalist polygamist communities spread all over the U.S. and Mexico. Some members live in major cities besides Salt Lake City such as Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Sacramento. Fundamentalists LDS (Mormons following the original scriptures of Joseph Smith) are fragmented among tens of groups. Those groups split apart to create new groups in other areas. They are lead by self appointed leaders who claim being direct descendents of either Joseph Smith or Jesus.These self-proclaimed prophets are delusional. They rewrite the history of the world to fit their mad self glorification (pg 157). They have apocalyptic visions of the return of Christ. Some proclaim communicating with beings from other planets (pg 156). Others lead anti-government militia and believe the government controls the weather (pg. 169). A few have been arrested and placed in azylum.Groups splitting results from rivalries. A rival breaks away from a group to start his own, declares himself a prophet. The splitting gets violent with killings under the guise of religious \\"blood atonement.\\" Such killings are also aimed at members trying to escape.The author suggests that the ills of fundamentalist polygamy emanate from Joseph Smith scriptures. She quotes his \`Doctrine and Covenants': \\"And if he have ten virgins..., he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him,... if one... of the ten virgins..., shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed...\\" Those words engendered communities that both the author and Jon Krakauer compare to the Taliban.The author covers the history of the Mormon Church and how mainstream Mormons renounced polygamy only under military attacks from the Feds. To this day she indicates that in Utah State and police authorities make efforts to avoid prosecuting polygamy and related crimes (child molesting and rape, etc...). As polygamists referring to Utah authorities say \\"That prosecution dog don't hunt.\\"Such communities are disasters for males too. If the average male has 5 wives, this means 80% of the males are ousted to maintain this unnatural 5-to-1 female/male multiple. What happens to the 80% of males? The author states on page 50 \\"they are driven away... [or] stay to become worker bees ... or they die mysteriously.\\" On page 181, she reiterates how they die mysteriously of car accidents on rural roads with no traffic.Such societies are disasters for children. They are deprived from descent education, nutrition, and parenting. They are exploited as child labor to work for free for the businesses managed by those communities. The level of child abuse, beating, molestation, pedophilia, sodomy of young boys, and rape is sickening. On pg. 171: \\"My father began raping me when I was eight years old. My mother sexually abused all of us...\\" Herpes among very young children related to sexual abuse is common. Girls as young as nine are ordered to marry relatives sometimes in their fifties. They bear children soon after risking their own lives in the process. They never receive adequate medical care. They are taken out of school at a young age to ensure their total economic dependence.From a genetic standpoint, this lifestyle is insane. The level of in-breeding through inter-marriages is unprecedented in the U.S. The rate of Down syndrome, autism, dwarfism, and deformities in many of those communities is sky high. Down Syndrome is hoped for by expectant parents because such individuals are compliant and bring in larger government benefits (pg. 173). Community leaders attribute those deformities as God's punishments to wives that have not been subservient. They don't know that procreating through incest, uncle and nieces, and brothers and sisters is not good.The health of women is entirely subjugated to procreation. Women are ordered to produce a child per year regardless of their health condition. Women often have more than 10 children with little means to support any. On page 126, a testimonial describes a woman dying of brain cancer who gave birth against the advice of the doctors. She died during childbirth. Child birth is undertaken without any descent health care support. On page 136: \\"Brenda's pregnancy ended in miscarriage, and she hemorrhaged for four hours with out any medical attention.\\" Treatment of women amounts to persecution (pg. 163: \`Her husband had mutilated her genitals ... with fishing wire.'From an economic standpoint, those communities are failures. They live in some form of totalitarian communism whereby all economic resources and assets are owned by the Church. The individual laborers (mainly wives and children) keep nothing. Economic subsistence is solely reliant on State and Federal subsidies. Those communities are all adept in extracting the maximum government benefits totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And, they are proud of this feat. They call it \\"bleeding the beast\\" as an effort to bring the government down.The testimonials of the 18 women who survived polygamy are nauseating. This passage comes to mind: \`When Laura was four, one of her stepbrothers tied her to a bedpost and attempted to rape her... After I was crying, my father told me he would slap me until I stopped crying, which he proceeded to do... My mother made herself busy in the kitchen so she wouldn't have to watch.\\" Another passage: \`on her 16th birthday, her father took her for a ride in his Cadillac because it was time for her \\"Sexuality Lesson.\\"The book gives you much more in depth info that I don't come close to cover.

Before I could only imagine what was going on and never really knowing what polygamy was all about. Now after reading this book I want to and need to do something about this. These men are so disgusting and what these women had to endure is just amazing and extremly disturbing. With this book you go into the lives of these women and you can feel what happened to them, it's absolutly amazing.

When it comes to the position of women in society and family, Mormonism shares more similarities with Islam, since the Quran too promotes polygamy (Sura 4:3) and men superiority over women (Sura 4:34).A good thing about this book is that it shows how little a difference there is between fundamentalist Mormons and mainstream Mormons. They both pray a polygamous god, sing the same hymns and believe in polygamy.Mainstream Mormons have stopped practicing it to avoid legal trouble, but their own literature testifies that polygamy will be restored after the second coming of Jesus (Mormon Doctrine, Bruce MacConkie).Besides the unhappy women trapped in polygamy today, we should also start to think about the condition of \\"happy\\" LDS women, whose future prospect is to share their husbands with other women after the second coming.Not my idea of a pleasant afterlife."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"While not many would argue that abuses happen in SOME polygamous families, most would also readily agree that the same alleged abuses occur in \\"normal\\" families (whether one parent or two). It seems that the writer has an agenda, and lets this color every sentence contained in this book. Unfortunately, she begins with an unconvincing legal analysis which can be likened to the decades of arguments supporting slavery, prohibitions on interracial marriage, and those forbidding same-sex marriage. Like it or not, some people may CHOOSE to live lives we don't all agree with. Fortunately, most of us take a live and let live attitude, and respect the right of the individual to be self-determinative - this is the essence of being an American. This is not true of Ms. Moore-Emmett who apparently knows best how each of us should live, after all she tells us throughout this book how things SHOULD be, and how we should and shouldn't be allowed to live - she's not exactly capable of an unbiased look at the subject. Furthermore, I was offended by the fact that she wrote about the experiences of the women as she interpreted them (complete with unnecessary commentary), rather than allowing these women to have and use their own voices. I would have enjoined hearing the storytellers' voices rather than the author's interpretation of what their stories meant as she heard them. This is particularly true because Ms. Moore-Emmett is NOT a great writer.In addition to the poor writing, the muffling of the womens' voices, and the extraordinary bias, are the errors. For example, early in the book she tells us that Joel LeBaron continues as the prophet of the LeBaron group, but approximately half way through the book she quite correctly tells us Joel was executed at the command of one of his brothers. On pages 102-103 she tells a story of one man losing his job for stealing arms from a military base to prepare the Utah group for Armageddon, then on the very next page, she tells us they were stolen the arms to sell to Iran. Well which is it? Does the compound need to defend against the imminent Armageddon, or is the man aligned with terrorists? It seems the author will stretch the truth of the story to make it more interesting. This point brings to mind the confusing nature of the writing - several times I reread portions in an attempt to understand who had performed certain acts, or who was involved in certain transactions, and even with several reads it was sometimes impossible to be certain.Overall, this book is a simplistic, conclusory, and biased look at a complex issue. There are many much better books on the market that allow the women of polygamy to speak for themselves, and these tend to represent a much more balanced look at the subject. While I have no interest in living polygamy or polygyny, I cannot confidently say we should have the right to interfere with the choices individuals make, except to the extent that they ask us to support it through various forms of public assistance. Perhaps the answer is not prosecuting polygamy since we have seen this fail several times, but to place restrictions or conditions on aid. I'm sure this action would also be met with arguments of privacy violations, but at the end of the day, I think most taxpayers would agree that some sacrifice for a handout that can be refused is fair."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"The book arrived in only a few days and was in good condition.Would do business with this seller again!"},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"This book, even if partially true was clearly written with the intent to sensationalize and entertain.

If you want a sick tabloid of abuse to read go ahead and buy it, but if you are looking for the facts of a minority lifestyle look somewhere else. look at principle voices, or tapestry against polygamy, and you may get an accurate picture of what is really going on.

I would encourage the readers to also read the book &quot;Voices in Harmony,&quot; which presents the stories of women who live in plural marriage. There are two sides to every issues. In some way, plural marriage was indeed approved by the God of the Old Testament. But I agree that it's a life which is only for those who choose it. There were a few typos in the book.

If Mormon leaders had totally turned their backs on polygamy, that passage would no longer be in the D and C.

All who wonder about these sects of FLDS clans should read this book. The book reveals the extant of control and mental abuse that is a basic tenet in the mental control of multiple wives and their many children. The men make the wives live in poverty and on welfare and foods stamps as the male leaders absolutely control ownership of all property and the considerable wealth of these communes. The men refer to this practice of getting federal aid as \\"bleeding the beast\\", or seditiously attempting to bankrupt the Government of the United States.Male children become undesirables as they approach adolescence because there are just so many 13 year old \\"virgins\\" to go around as teen brides for the elders of these clans. Teenage boys either become homeless (\\"lost boys\\") without education or trade except carpentry skills. In many cases, these boys are excommunicated for trivial transgressions like talking to girls or watching television. Within some sects (i.e. the LeBaron clan) teen boys are taken into the desert, shot and buried. Ervil LeBaron even murdered his own daughter, Becky in \\"Blood Atonement\\" for questioning his authority.Women and children are chattel (property), to be dispensed to favored elders as rewards for their fealty to their leader. In many cases, spiritual wives and children are taken from one husband and given to other, more favored male elder. There is no paperwork trail except \\"Temple Sealing\\" documents as proof for these exchanges. No marriage license is required. This book discusses the Morman \\"Doctrine and Covenants-132\\", written by Joseph Smith in which he (in his unique method of convoluted reasoning) justifies the \\"taking of virgins\\" as being justified by the Heavenly Father. However, all LDS church members support these Doctrine and Covenants in the belief that they become polygamists after death to create \\"spirit babies\\" which are then transported by Morman families to earth.The book details the story of (18) women who came from several of the (11) active sects of FLDS, \\"families\\". The women in this book were offered shelter in organization called the Tapestry of Polygamy for support and counseling which prepares they and their children for entry into an outside society which is totally foreign to their experience, training and belief systems.

The 18 individual stories in this book are very disturbing, and I do applaud these women for finally breaking away. BUT--I still have many unanswered questions and concerns about the women in these situations--both those who left and many others who did not. Many of these 18 women consciously and willingly joined the lifestyles, and even bounced from one bad situation to another before finally leaving.Overall the motivation of the males is obvious--power and dominance over weaker individuals. The men essentially are given free reign to physically, emotionally, and sexually abuse anyone in their household, and many take full advantage of the opportunities.The motivations of the females, however, are not clear, and this book did little to help me sort those out--it just made me madder. The maternal instinct is incredibly powerful, but for many of these women it is apparently either not present or not strong enough to combat their personal quest for religious salvation. This book (and none of the others I have read) does not attempt to explain the psychology that contributes to these mothers allowing their children to be abused.All that said, it is a book worth reading if only to get a better understanding of the scope of the problem, and the kinds of women involved in the lifestyle."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"I bought this book to find out what was actually going on in the fundamentalist branches of the LSD Church.

According to Joseph Smith, the founder and first prophet of the Church of Latter Day Saints, he received a revelation that the \\"principle\\" of polygamy was to be followed, and they did. Years later, as the LDS church eventually settled in Utah territory, the big issue with attaining statehood was that they practiced polygamy. The reigning prophet of that time received a new revelation; polygamy was no longer to be practiced and the LDS Church threatened to excommunicate anyone who did so. Well, there were many followers who didn't accept this and saw this not as a true revelation but one that was \\"received\\" just to satify the United States government; they were unwilling to recognize this new revelation andwent on to form offshoots of the LDS Church.God's Brothel is not a bad book but it's not a great one either. It attempts to give some background on some of the fundamentalist churches, the psychology of why these women stay and also includes a few personal stories of women who have left their respective churches. My biggest problem with the book is that it feels like the author was trying to fill up space with big print and many wasted pages with forwards and introductions and not enough content. There was so much more to say and the personal stories and background infomration could have had a little more depth.There are much better books out there that give a personal viewpoint of what it's like to live (and leave) polygamy such as \\"Escape\\" by Carolyn Jessup who really explains why women just don't leave. Another good one is \\"His Favorite Wife\\" by Susan Ray. Again, this is not a bad book but kind of like a Reader's Digest version of the subject matter. It's not worth the money."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"These 18 first person accounts of life in modern Mormon polygamy make for both a riveting and horrifying read of religious and sexual abuse. Moore-Emmit's anthology is essential reading for those wanting an insider's view of the secret religious and sexual abuses still perpetrated by Mormons upon the family in this century the name of obedience to Gods law. The women who speak out have done so at considerable personal risk. They don't hesitate to name names and give lurid details (the Mormon theology of \\"blood atonement\\" justifies murder and some former cult leaders have made threats). Moore-Emmit's interviews are a powerful contribution to the sociocultural literature of polygyny. For this reason alone you should read the book.However, be advised that the author and contributors have a political agenda. These are a group of women who have suffered horrific abuse as survivors of religious cultism. There is no question that that this cultism must be exposed and the leaders must be held legally and morally accountable. I applaud the authors efforts to end the abuses ( Moore-Emmit is the president of the Utah chapter of NOW). Some of the contributors have formed the political group Tapestry Against Polygamy and have lobbied with some success for stronger enforcement of laws against polygamy - justifiably so.I certainly agree with the argument to end cultism and religious/sexual abuse. However, the author has gone so far as to generalize her small sample of data and the extremely abusive experiences of this group of Mormon cultists to all non monogamy. In her view these abuses justify calling for an end to all forms of marriage relationships other than monogamy. Not all non monogamists are radical religious cult members. Some even report a very positive experience in adult consensual non monogamist relationships (i.e. polyamorists).There is also another side to the Mormon polygamy question. Some claim to be having positive experiences living Mormon polygamy. To examine both sides of this debate readers should compare \\"God's Brothel\\" with the anthology edited by Batchelor, Watson and Wilde: \\"Voices in Harmony: Contemporary Women Celebrate Plural Marriage\\". These two accounts will allow the reader a unique insider's view on the two extremes of this issue voiced by the Mormon women who actually live the lifestyle.Although I deeply appreciate and sympathize with the victims voices in God's brothel and generally applaud this book, there is a glaring absence of a correct historical analysis of the true root of the problem. Moore-Emmit projects the abuses of Mormon Cultism on all forms of non-monogamy.In her too brief introductory historical review Moore-Emmit merely identifies Mormon church founder Joseph Smith as the instigator of the Mormon doctrine of polygamy, but she misses the important opportunity of sharing with the reader the essential details of the origins of the \\"fundamentalist\\" tactics that are used to abuse her victims. Modern \\"Fundamentalist\\" Mormons did not invent the abusive manipulations they use to oppress the women in \\"God's brothel\\". The sexual/religious abuse tactics described by all of Moore-Emmit's victims are \\"textbook\\" examples of manipulation tactics historically used by Joseph Smith. He was the original master manipulator. He is the instigator of the method and \\"theology\\" of religious blackmail that is described in this book and that is the source of the major problem of Mormon polygamy today. His cult methods are merely being mimicked today by Mormon men who use them just as successfully (and unsuccessfully) as Smith did to talk wives into living \\"the principle\\". Missing from \\"God's Brothel\\" is the essential description of Smith: \\"God's pimp\\". There are many documented accounts of how Smith manipulated vulnerable underage girls into becoming his secret sexual partners. For example, the history of 14 year old Helen Mar Whitney clearly documents the religious threats Smith used in arranging with her parents his child marriage to Helen, and how she was pressured to acquiesce to an illegal marriage by powerful psychological religious manipulation in return for a promise of her parent's salvation (see Todd Compton's \\"In Sacred Loneliness\\"). Smith set the ugly pattern for all other later \\"fundamentalist\\" Mormon cult leaders to follow. This example of blatant religious extortion for sex, along with many others, is readily available to anyone taking the time to research the official historical records of the Mormon Church. These records form a tutorial for modern church elders who get labeled \\"fundamentalists\\". Mormon Fundamentalists are merely asking \\"What would Joseph do?\\"The women who were the victims of Smith's secret marriages detail their own accounts of his methods of how he manipulated those around him to act with complicity in a futile attempt to keep these sexual relationships secret from his wife, who abhorred polygamy. In a letter to the New York Sun following Smith's murder, his first wife, Emma, testified: \\"I never for a moment believed in what my husband called his apparitions or revelations, as I thought him laboring under a diseased mind...I shall educate my children in a different faith\\" (See Tammy Braithwaite's \\"A Mormon Odyssey\\"). Emma Smith was the first victim in \\"God's Brothel\\". Moore-Emmit needs to point this out.Until members of the modern Mormon Church who make the laws and set policy recognize that Smith's cult tactics are still alive and well within mainstream Mormonism, the modern Mormon church will remain blind to the fact that it continues to spawn elders trained in cult methods who get excommunicated for \\"fundamentalism\\" by simply mimicking Smith's own methods. Self righteous monogamous Mormons point to these \\"apostates\\" as their scapegoats and blindly fail to recognize their own cult practices that lie hidden beneath the carefully constructed public image of \\"Christian\\" respectability. As they down record numbers of anti-depressants (Utah has the highest rate of anti-depressant consumption in the nation), mainstream monogamous Mormon women laugh at the suggestion that they belong to a \\"cult\\".Moore-Emmit is in an awkward political position as she seeks to win cooperation in ending abuse from Mormons politicians who make and enforce the laws, and who themselves are covertly (and often unknowingly) complicit with the theology of religious cultism and abuse. Moore-Emmit recognizes that she cannot confront the larger mainstream Mormon enemy and ask the obvious: Why do Mormon public officials still make secret oaths of obedience in Mormon temples to always place church theology above their state oaths of office? Lurking in Utah State Government is Utah's shadow Theocratic State Government that won't bring an end this cultism that results in abuse. In short, Moore-Emmit has done a remarkable job, but she has confused non-monagamy with cult manipulation. Fundamentalist polygamy is merely the illegal child of legal mainstream Mormon cultism (which is been packaged in modern socially acceptable conformity and is hiding out in the guise of monogamy). Maybe Moore-Emmits next effort should document first person accounts of the marital abuses suffered under the hands of cultist tactics disguised as religious doctrine by the Mormon monogamist patriarchy. Would there then be a \\"Tapestry Against Monogamy?\\" Maybe what really is needed is a \\"Tapestry Against Mormon Cultism.\\""},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"This book gives a small history of polygamy and then chronicles the lives of women who lived it. Short (6-10 page) chapters highlight each woman's experience and it is a very fast read.I am just finishing the book and my eyes have truly been opened about Polygamy in the U.S. It's sickening what I've learned about these poor innocent children raised in these sects. It's encouraged me to get involved to help stop this madness."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"Moore-Emmett is a real journalist, five time recipient of Utah Excellence in Journalism award. She is also President of the Utah Chapter of NOW. She interviewed 18 women who had quite different stories to tell of their experiences with fundamentalist polygamy. The specific group that dominated them, the husbands and \\"sister-wives,\\" their children, their parents, are all quite different, and offer breadth to this horrible story.She also provides a \\"Reading Group Guide\\" at the back of the book, suggesting she had in mind that the book would be used as a teaching tool. The Author's involvement with a group known as Tapestry Against Polygamy (TAP) could indicate that she expects that organization to use it in reading groups. TAP is an aid program modeled on safe houses for victims of domestic violence. Indeed, that's essentially what it is, although of a specialized nature, since polygamous husbands (and their religious leaders) routinely use quite forceful methods to \\"discipline\\" a wife into submission. Child abuse is also rampant, and incest is sufficiently common that those two groups of victims overlap a good deal.These men are either quite insane or quite evil, or perhaps both. They claim \\"revelations\\" from God which govern their decisions, and many contend that certain sins can only be washed away with \\"blood atonement.\\" In the bluntly worded Glossary, this is defined as \\"The death of the sinner or enemy of the church to pay for his or her sins.\\" They're not kidding, either, although the deaths are attributed to accident or suicide. Since the local police in several of these communities are polygamists themselves, it only gets a woman or child in more trouble to report abuse to \\"authorities.\\"Even those who escape are scarred, physically, mentally, emotionally and economically. They typically escape with little more than the clothes on their backs. They have very limited educations, often no more than a grade school education, and that in a very limited school that teaches religion and a few practical skills. They know nothing, or almost entirely nothing, about the world outside the polygamist group, and have been taught to fear that world as demon-driven. They are also raised in the most extreme forms of racial and religious and sexist prejudice. Women can only get into heaven with the assistance of their \\"priest-head\\" (husband in most cases), who can reject them on a whim. The husband's power is very nearly absolute over his wife's life, with only the power-mad \\"prophet\\" over him.Still, courageous women who conclude the risk is no worse than remaining where they are have escaped, helped each other to cope with the world outside, and even won a few battles in the courts of law. Some of their children get past the traumas of their childhood (where sexual abuse is almost common, and the children are condemned as \\"disobedient\\" if they protest), and some fall into depression, alcoholism, drug abuse and suicide.Not a pleasant book to read, but an important one."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"I was born and raised a Mormon. From age 12 I was taught that polygamy (polygyny) is the only type of marriage allowed in Mormon Heaven. I was taught Polygamy is against the law of the land, but not God's law. The psychology behind Mormon thinking is cause and effect to justifying an affair with sex partners outside of marriage. Andrea Moore-Emmett shows us what happens when men ]are taught they have dominion over women. Give even the most righteous among us power over others and watch the abuse develop. Moore-Emmett's book should be in every library in the country and in every bookshelf of every congressman in every state in The Union. I applaud her for her research.

It's an important book.However, I have to warn you: these stories are angry. Say it again in a high-pitched, Margaret Cho-like screech--These stories are ANNN-GRY!!I suppose that anger is the emotion you feel most after a lifetime of abuse, so I guess it makes sense.As far as I can tell, this is a book about abuse. However, I think this book tried to take on way too may topics. I was left with these questions, which I think are all of the topics the book tried to tackle.Is the book trying to be critical of the Mormons for no longer practicing polygamy?Are they trying to be critical of the Mormons for not supporting anti-polygamist efforts more?Is the book trying to stop underage marriages in polygamist groups?Is the book trying to stop polygamy from ever happening?Is the book trying to outlaw polygamy?Is the book trying to inform the public about polygamist culture?Is the book trying to stop incest?Is the book trying to stop marriages that would result in incest (first cousins or closer)?Is the book trying to be critical of the state of Utah?Is the book trying to criticize the Mormon Church for distancing itself from polygamy?Is the book trying to get people to donate to Tapestry Against Polygamy?Is the book trying to pressure people once heavily involved in Tapestry Against Polygamy to return to working more for Tapestry Against Polygamy?Is the book trying to talk about the prevalence of polygamy in the US and Mexico?Is the book trying to say that men are bad?Is the book trying to say that men, when in a polygamist religion, will eventually turn into abusive molesters?Is the book trying to say that polygamists should use doctors?Is the book trying to expose the covered-up deaths of some polygamists?Is the book trying to expose tax fraud in polygamist religions?Is the book trying to vilify all polygamist leaders?Is the book trying to let polygamist women know that they can marry who they love instead of their old uncle?Is the book trying to let polygamist women know how to escape?I don't know. I really don't know. I couldn't put the book down, but the content confused me.I think it would have been better this book had been just about one topic, or even limited to two, three, or four topics. Then, this book might have actually made a difference. This book has a very low likelihood of making a difference because it's really just a \\"rant\\" book.Each of the 18 chapters is supposed to tell a story about a woman. Really each chapter is only 1/4 the woman's story and the rest additional commentary. The content of this book really seemed like the story of one women rather than the story of eighteen women. But, I couldn't tell for sure.I was left wondering what was factual in this book. I attribute this to the book trying to tackle so many different topics at one time.I could only conclude one thing for sure about polygamy from this book--that in polygamy a man will sleep with only one wife at a time. That was a question I had, and this book answered it.I also need to mention the title--the title has nothing to do with the book. It's only there to provide a shocking title so that people will read the bookOne of the basics about abuse is that abuse is not about sex to the abuser; it has to do with control and power. The title is probably harmful in that it seems to indicate that the rape and molestation are more about sex than about control and power.Overall, though, you should read this book. Hopefully this book spurs many more books to be written, and hopefully they're a lot more focused."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"Sometimes it is just amazing what humans can do to each other. Especially those atrocities done in the name of religion in this case. Moore-Emmett is not unfamiliar to polygamy. Growing up in a Mormon household there always flirted the disaster of a polygamous marriage for her. Luckily, she was able to get out of it and has spent a good portion of her life helping Mormon women escape polygamy and running programs to help them in the transition. This book is about her telling some of their stories.The first part of this book goes through some of the history and beliefs of the polygamous sects. While she does include some Christian polygamist groups the majority of this book deals with those who associate themselves as Mormon.The next and largest part of the book is the stories of women who have escaped. Eighteen women are interviewed and while they come from mostly different sects, their stories are hauntingly familiar. Abuse, sexual abuse, child marriage, abandonment, starvation, and other atrocities are just some of the recurring themes. Sometimes these women even had to leave their children behind as Utah has some government and local police officials who are polygamists as well and make it hard for them to escape with their families intact. There are also the threats of death and blood atonement as well for these ladies.However, as horrible as their stories are they do give hope that people are trying to change what is happening. Abuse isn't being swept under the rug in the guise of \\"religious freedom\\" in some cases and groups are working to further laws to protect these children and women. While many of the women will carry guilt and problems to work through for the rest of their lives, they breathe a little easier knowing they have freed themselves from a worse fate.I did find interesting that some of these women weren't even Mormon to begin with but fell in with the religion because of the falsities and allure of being accepted presented. It shows what harm low self esteem can do to a person that they would allow themselves to become second class citizens or chattal. But the stories of the women that did that in this book do end on a happy note of them leaving these disastorous relationships.This is certainly a book that will shock and I think its important that these stories be told. No one should be degraded like this or treated with such abuse. No one should have to watch their children be abused in the name of god. Even if it is only writing a book, Moore-Emmett is helping to make these voices heard.Moore-Emmett does a wonderful job of putting together these stories. While her writing can get a bit redundant with tons of names of associated polygamists thrown in and groups listed, the majority of her work is easy to read. She also has spent a lot of time researching and thoughtfully includes those citations as well.My only complaint on this book was that for the most part it didn't really describe the reality of escaping from the sects. From reading other books on the subject I know it isn't easy. However, in most of these stories it almost seemed as if they got up and left when they felt like it. I'm sure this isn't the case so I would have liked to learn more about that aspect.This book definitely made me feel sick at times but opened my eyes to whats out there. I will be doing more research on the subject I am sure.God's BrothelCopyright 2004219 pagesAlso includes a dictionary and reader's guide."},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"God's Brothel / 978-1-930074-13-2For anyone seeking a swift introduction into the heartbreaking world of polygamous cults, \\"God's Brothel\\" is the perfect choice. Well-written, with a necessary light touch given the intensity of the subject matter, this collection of mini-biographies follows the trials and sorrows of 18 women who have lived and escaped polygamy.Unlike the usual polygamy biographies, these individual stories are deliberately kept short and condensed in order to provide the broadest introduction to the reader in the shortest amount of time. This makes for a very efficient means to introduce new readers to this terrifying world of oppression, and means more time is spent on relevant experiences and beliefs, and less time is spent on the daily life details - so depending on what you want from a polygamy biography book, judge accordingly.What is really fascinating about this introduction, is that several of the stories told here come from women who weren't necessarily born or raised to polygamy - several were raised as mainstream Mormon believers, who came to feel that if they were destined to live polygamy anyway, they might as well start early in this life. Also fascinating is that several of the polygamous cults discussed here are not the 'usual' FLDS variety - some of them aren't even Mormon flavored, which was new to me.Although this doesn't have the detail and polish of biographies likeEscape, this is definitely a good introduction to the subject matter and will break your heart eighteen times over.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"God's Brothel: The Extortion of Sex for Salvation in Contemporary Mormon and Christian Fundamentalist Polygamy and the Stories of 18 Women Who Escaped","review":"I read this book last year and I couldn't put it down.The film, BANKING ON HEAVEN, is now available on Amazon.

One would think those who adhere to this lifestyle would want the word used correctly. Demonstrably, education really *isn't* a high priority in their world.)Via the very effective combo of academic discussion and first-person narrative, God's Brothel provides access to an almost entirely closed world of severely limited choices, institutionalized defiance for the law, overtly acceptable child abuse of all kinds, scathing jealousies, and dire poverty--all in the name of religion.So what's new? Such has been true throughout time. Perhaps one shouldn't be shocked that it's happening here and now, as is depicted in this book. After all, people have been folded, spindled, and mutilated in the name of religion since the beginning of settled societies thousands of years ago. Why worry about such a thing happening in Utah, here and now, when it's happening on almost every continent, just as it always has, just as it always will?Personally, i'm outraged at the systematic abuse of the helpless by the polygamous religious cultists as so clearly portrayed in this book because i believe ardently that there are always more people who care, more people who are appalled and offended by such fanatics, then there are people who actually *are* such fanatics. There are more people who want to help, who want to make it better then there are people who want such abuse to continue--wherever and whenever it happens. I believe that.

I have read several other books about polygamy and the many problems it creates. I have no doubt that there is child abuse, child neglect, and sometimes sexual abuse taking place in polygamous families. I am not a Mormon and I do not defend polygamy.That said, this book is boring and hard to follow. The author is well-meaning, but does not do a good job of presenting the material. I read through the first 50 pages about the history of polygamy, and found it really dull, but I slogged along because I thought once I get to the first-hand accounts, they will be interesting. But they were not. The stories were so totally negative that after awhile, I felt the author was exaggerating. She was talking about an incestuous family and all the birth defects and dwarves being born, and she laid it on so thick, that I began to wonder if that was for real. I still wonder.A couple really good books about polygamy are \\"Shattered Dreams\\" and \\"Favorite Wife\\" and \\"Escape\\" and \\"Illegitimate.\\" Those are all first-hand accounts of life in a polygamous family, and of the pain and hardships. Those books don't glamorize the lifestyle, but they do mention that in spite of all the difficulties, there were a few good times.

I only have access to a small health food store and grocery stores. I was not able to find guar gum anywhere and many of Nancy's recipes call for it. This cookbook is better than Dr. Atkin's, in which many ingredients are impossible to find. I would still only recommend it if you have access to a very large well-stocked health food store or are willing to pay for shipping for ingredients ordered online."},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"I have alot of low carb cookbooks, but this one is so practical. Alot of the food you need in this book, you probably already have on hand. I don't need gourmet food, like recipes found in other books. I need fast family food.....this book has it. I have made two recipes out of this book....they are fantastic. (I only had the book one day) I have several more marked to try. Buy this book!! I find the carb counts pretty accurate also."},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"I just can't say enough about this cookbook! Every recipe I have tried has been easy to prepare, deliscious and very satisfying. I also bought the desserts book from the same author. WONDERFUL!!! You wont go wrong with these books. The only thing you have to loose is those exta pounds and inches which I have done with these great recipes!"},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"This is a wonderful cookbook, I have seen the results,before and after, not only with Nancy but with her husbond Ron. also with a great number of my friends."},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"This book makes a Low-Carb lifestyle EASY! I have the Eat Yourself Thin with Fabulous Desserts recipe book, too - I highly recommend both!"},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"Everything tastes very odd, and yes, I can cook, so It wasnt a question of loose nut between the book and the mixing bowl, ha ha. I agree with one of the other reviews, in that there are easier and tastier ways to prepare some of the dishes, BESIDES using pork rinds and guar gum over and over. I was very dissapointed and I am returning this book and the companion dessert book."},{"Title":"Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did!: Quick and Easy Low Carb Cookbook","review":"What is with some of these people? I am proof of the pudding. I'm 120 pounds lighter thanks to eating low carb way. I tried the high carb and low fat way. It worked some but as you reach a point you have to cut calories even more to loose. You starve yourself. That's not right. Fat does not make you fat. Carbohydrates used with fats is what hurt you. Stir up all that sugar in your system. My dad has lost a lot doing the low carb way as well. Low fat diets don't work. In fact, you get fatter. Just look around you. Everyone has big fat bellies etc. Go the low carb way. Get off that notion that fat is the bad thing. One of my favorite cooks is the galloping gourmet. He fixed fatting food but was skinner then than he is now when he switched to the low fat. Low carb is the way to go."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. In general this is good book. It bridges the gaps between many computer science disciplines. Especially OS and programming language. It also touched a little bit on computer architecture and linking process. The text was written in a a very clear way. However, I do have two complains. The author didn't spend enough effort on the relatively more complex and advanced topics. Eg, linking process for C++, advanced topics in memory leakage detection and prevention. On the other hand, author spent too much energy describing linked data structure in terms of serialization. I personally don't think its relevance is higher than the advanced memory leakage issues. For seasoned profressionals, this book can be used to refresh your knowledge. It is a beginner level to intermediate level book."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"An older book that could be helpful to readers interested in this book is \\"Inside the C++ Object Model\\" by Stanley B. Lippman. It was written in 1996. It shows things such as the layout of C++'s organization of (pointers to) virtual and inherited methods."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"The viewpoint adopted by this book is an original one, while the insights range from the elementary to the very advanced. The material is well organized, the writing style is excellent, there are numerous examples and exercises. In a world dominated by C/C++ programming, it is a book that I think every professional programmer/computer scientist/software engineer could read with profit."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"First I would like to state the reason I gave it 4 stars. In my opinion, 5 stars should be very hard to reach. Maybe I would give this 4.5 stars if it was possible. Anyway, I'm a self taught VB 6 programmer with a working knowledge of the Windows API. First year CS student, though I've read many a book on C and a few on assembly. I have a large CS library and this is the first book of it's kind that I've found. It is a little pricey if you compare book size to other, larger CS books, but I don't think it is overpriced. The material is great, though I wouldn't say it is a beginner level book. I had trouble grasping enough of the material that it causes me to think either I've still got a long ways to go in learning (more so than I thought at least), or it is just not for the beginner.I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about a programming career, regardless of the language. The book's relatively small size should not be a negative factor. It is not densely packed with information to the point where interpretation is needed, instead it explains in sufficient detail without dumbing it down by over-repetition and such used by some other CS books. It is aimed at C/C++ programmers, so being familiar with those is a prerequisite, obviously. Like another reviewer said, there seemed to be a little too much discussion on, say, serialization of linked data structures, an important topic with regards to memory yet I felt a little more emphasis could have been placed elsewhere."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"This book was recommended to me by a colleague at work; I'm really glad I listened to his recommendation. While I've been programming in C/C++ since 1990 (other languages for two decades before then) I found the concepts/ideas put forward in this book to be very useful in improving my memory use habits. No matter how well you think you know memory management, you can learn something from this book. I only omit one star because some of the examples were not as clear as they could have been."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"Some people have tremendous gifts for teaching and writing, I believe Franek is one of them, the content of the book is quite basic, but Franek's writing style and the way to ask tricky questions is way above average instructor/teacher, it simply taps your interest for more, another merit is the exercise of each chapter, all answers are published in author's website."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"This is written for the programmer who isn't sitting in front of their computer. Because of this, the book is very readable. If you can go through this book and understand the concepts, you will be worlds ahead of most CS undergrads in their first year. It really ought to be required reading."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"Excellent coverage of all the memory routines. Lucid explanation but could have added a few more illustrations. Nevertheless, a book that which must be read by all professional C &amp; C++ programmers."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"I felt that this book was aimed to first or second year college students. In my opinion,It doesn't teach you about memory as a programming concept but rather the relationship of a program and memory in a computer.I do agree with the author on the notion that most students and many programmers do not understand how their programs run inside their computer. They know the buzz keywords such as process, thread, heap, stack and might be able to define them but in a very obscure shallow semi-taboo manner. This book will help you to understand the role of memory in your \\"Hello, World!\\" programs. I'm not giving five star because I'm not student anymore and the book is a little bit pricey (understandable from an academic publisher), but it is fun book to read."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"The book is an excellent one. The author had made is sincere effort to make the concept very clear.The book is well organised in order to eliminate all ambiguity among topics. All examples are well said with the correct context. I think this book is for practical programmers who love the art of programming."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"I really can't agree with the other reviews. The content of this book is on the basic side of things. It should be purchased if, and only if (big 'only if'), you are in the process of learning C or C++. A programmer with more than just an introductory knowledge of these two languages should be able to figure out all of the implemented programs in the text. The concepts about memory and memory use should have either 1) been taught to you when you learned to program or 2) again, you could have figured it out on your own. Furthermore, the book is incredibly overpriced, however you measure it- page count, content value, whatever- it doesn't add up to the cost.Franek is clearly on the OOP bandwagon. The discussion of C is just a formality, I think, because at every turn he takes a shot at how bad memory management and leaking is in C programs. To me, this says he doesn't really know how to use the language (and/or an IDE with debugging tools) properly. By my estimation, C++ is more prone to memory problems...the joke about shooting yourself in the foot in various programming languages comes to mind.Pass on this book. You can find more and better information elsewhere. Search Amazon for more memory management books, or a book on garbage collection."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"It's always no hurt to read some fundermantal material written by a dumb-proof way by a professional. This book is one of kind.The only regret is that I'd like the book size to be doubled. Maybe assembly language book will cover the material which is missing from this book."},{"Title":"Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++","review":"I bought this book thinking I would get more insight about memory models in C and C++ languages. And how memory is a different resource. With its typed and untyped properties. With discussions about C++ RAII etc.I was very disappointed to find out that this book is actually an weak explanation of how compilers implement the object model."},{"Title":"Holt Science and Technology: Life Science","review":"This book is actually a workbook not the text book that it was listed as."},{"Title":"The Girl from the Diadem","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read - snappy, scintillating, tender, funny, and REAL - Even the most minor characters live and breathe. Ms. Merrill's writing belongs on the shelf right next to Oscar Wilde. Utterly delightful. (I just spent a week in chemotherapy and this book made me laugh out loud in the second chapter, and keep right on laughing... I finished it in one sitting then turned back and read it again! What more can I say? Other than THANK YOU, Jean Merrill.)"},{"Title":"The Girl from the Diadem","review":"Swift pace, enjoyable read. Charming and mysterious male players and a splendid spirited woman. Nice mix!Cover blurb: \\"Make-Believe Love. It wasn't very romantic, but then romance was the furthest thing from Belle Barclay's mind when she agreed to a make-believe love affair with the young Earl of Orsett. Her career in the theatre was crashing to a premature end, and it was money that she needed. Pretending to be the object of the young Earl's affections seemed a simple ruse---until everything became very complicated. Too complicated. Suddenly Belle found herself head-over-heels in love---with the wrong man...\\""},{"Title":"A Durable Fire","review":"Some say the truth is stranger than fiction. Well this book proves it. Virginia Bernhard creates a wonderful piece literature by combining the facts about the early colonists who settled in Virginia between 1609 and 1622 and storytelling. Most of her characters existed in real life, however she expands those facts to create a complex and rich story full of suspense, romance, danger, and hardship. If you want to know the truth about early American relations with the Native Indians read this book. For those true fans of historial fiction this is a must read. I could not put it down.Angela Houston, TX"},{"Title":"A Durable Fire","review":"I read this book years and years ago and the memory of it still lingers. So dang good... especially if you enjoy historical topics tinged with fictional drama! Find this one and read it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"A Durable Fire","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it brought our early American history right into my living room. Although it is fiction, most of it is based on facts, which although were sometimes grim and gruesome, were a part of our history. Some of the romancing got a little ridiculous - an obvious addition that has come from the author's imagination. It was an easy book to read, and difficult to put down.I was somewhat disappointed at the end, because I felt let down. I want to know what happened next. Is there a sequel to this book? If so, would somebody please let us know what the title is. There was nothing mentioned about a sequel in the book."},{"Title":"A Durable Fire","review":"The subject of this story is of major importance to anyone seeking to learn how early Europeans colonized North America. Dr. Bernhard's writting brings the early settlers to life again. The impossible trials and tribulations become real to the reader. Her prose is as easy a reading as I have encountered. This is a book you cant put down and one that you will read over and over. I have lent this book to every person in my family - and it's hard to get back. Get this book - you'll be so glad you did."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"I don't know which book the previous reviewer was reading, but it wasn't this one. Professor Wistrich's book is intended as a reference work, providing brief biographies of important or significant persons in Germany under the Nazi regime. It is not intended to provide a comprehensive biography of every member of the Nazi Party, nor to be a compendium of evil-doers, and it does neither. For example, it includes listings for Bertolt Brecht (playwright and poet), Otto Dix (German-expressionist painter), Albert Einstein (Nobel Prize-winning physicist), and Kathe Kollwitz (Socialist and painter)-- none of them Nazis. The big-name Nazis are there, but so are church leaders, artists, scientists, and business people, of a variety of political and ideological orientations, some of them offering active resistance to National Socialism.The book is a biographical dictionary, providing a ready reference and point of departure for further research by the serious student. If I have a criticism, it is in some of those selected for inclusion-- a necessarily subjective decision, as the author acknowleges.The previous reviewer's contention that Wistrich cites four of his own works in the bibliography again left me wondering what book he had read. In my copy, the author cites a grand total of ONE of his own works. Nor is the book the protracted drumbeat about how evil the Nazis were that the previous reviewer would have us believe it is, though failure to acknowledge the fact would be a falsification of history worthy of an ideologue-- not a historian."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"Wistrich's book is basically a series of very short capsule biographies on leading figures during the time of Nazi Germany's rise and fall, covering obviously political figures of the Nazi Party, but also communists, labor leaders, interwar figures, some generals, war criminals, major industrialists, some artists, and so on. It is not exhaustive - it is much too short to include a truly complete list of names or figures - or dispositive of its subjects.The biographies include the usual dates, births, deaths, sentences, promotions, and major deeds good or evil; a typical bio would be perhaps a page long, with many shorter and several longer. In other words, it will not do to provide a full and complete picture of anyone. Readers looking for major insight will need to look elsewhere for that. Wistrich does, however, by combining so many stories in such a compact space, manage to convey a sense of interrelationship and web-like interests and this is kind of interesting.The book is perhaps best used as a convenient way to look up a name, useful as a guide for a writer of historical fiction or a general historical article."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"If you want to discover that Nazis were very, very bad people, then this book is for you!However, if you are writing a paper or piece of historical fiction, or if you simply want to gain understanding about the political underpinnings and society of Nazi Germany, then this wouldn't be a good choice.This book only features the well-known Nazis, and is very general in scope. You definitely won't find anything new here if you are a history buff. If you need info on a particular influential Nazi, for example Gregor Ebner or Emil Strom, look elsewhere. Only brief (page-and-a-half or so) bios with lists of evil deeds are included--nothing about organizations, timelines, or political relationships. Nothing of any substance. I was very disappointed by the lack of info in this book, and feel somewhat cheated.(It took twenty days to arrive, too.)This book seems to have suffered from the author's passion for the subject. In the bibliography, he cites four of his own previous books, which is bad form for a scholar. I can't imagine how this book could be useful to anyone except for those who need to be reassured that the bastards are still evil after all these years. Most of this book is hot air. One star (two if you need to be reminded that Nazis are not good Volks)."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"This resource book is a must for anyone who reads about WWII; the Russians, the US, and especially Germany. For a begineer its a great resource book to learn exactly who you are reading about. For more formal studiers it gives in-depth discriptions that you might find interesting. This is a reference book not a fictional read. It's good to have handy. It is a big book so you will never run out of people to look up. I keep it on my shelf and use it when reading about Germany."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"For anyone studying the Third Reich, Who's Who in Nazi Germany is a critical reference book to possess. Organized alphabetically, the book presents well written, concise, and objective biographies regarding a vast array of principals involved in Hitler's Germany; everyone from the well known participants such as Ernst Rohm and Walter Schellenberg to the lesser known figures such as Helene Mayer, an Olympic Gold Medalist and Lil Dagover, a German actress and purported friend of the Der Fuhrer.Indeed, for a book of its size, just 359 pages, the number of people covered is rather extensive. At the end of the book, there is a glossary, a comparison between German and Allied military ranks, and a bibliography that is a must read in and of itself for anyone wishing to expand his or her knowledge. But it is important to keep in mind that this is a reference book. It is meant as a quick guide to supplement in-depth research, or perhaps just a good history book on the subject, such as William Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. In fact, for students of the Holocaust, the book is an invaluable resource. While there are many reference books and dictionaries pertaining to World War II, this book focuses only on Nazi Germany and is one of the best reference books available on the subject."},{"Title":"Situk River steelhead studies, 1990 (Fishery data series)","review":"This is a book that I thought I might get little use of. Boy was I ever wrong! This is an excellent companion piece to any book that you may be reading about Nazi's in World War II. I know a ton about the main personalities & some of the lesser known individual's as well. However if you are a student of German history of WWII & read all sorts of books covering the era, you must have this book. For example so often you read a book that is constantly naming others surrounding whoever that person may be. You may know the names, but it's nice to have a book that you can look at to refresh your memory in just a page or two. If you want this for more than a reference book then just move on. I can't express enough about how much use you will get out of this book. My only complaint is that it needs to be minorly updated as just about every single person in this book are now deceased & some facts have been updated w/newer information. Other than that this is a must for wannabe historians such as myself & others who are constantly learning about this. That's really all you need to know."},{"Title":"The explorer, by Frances Parkinson Keyes.","review":"If you were an aristocratic but sheltered poor spinster who caught the eye of Nicholas, a famous explorer, who wanted to marry you on on a moment's notice so he could have an heir but required you to remain home while he leads fabulous expeditions into South America, would you do it? Well, gentle readers, Margaret, our protagonist, agrees and this is the story of his and her separate lives and their emotional growth over time.Although this story stretches from the Beltway to the Amazon, the main locale is Margaret's old family estate outside Alexandria, VA (Virginia being one of author Keyes favorite locales). This story is slightly perverse and very-old school as Marrgaret is a virgin and Nicholas is the domineering sexual aggressor whose \\"appetites\\" must be satisfied. However, our heroine finally does come into her own and the tables actually turn in a most satisfying way.Sadly, I think this kind of Cinderella story is simply out-of-fashion now but it is a great read and I revisit it often. However, I do find the his story/her story to be kinda annoying and so I just read the Margaret and Jacques sections much as I only read the Katherine and Count Almasy sections of The English PatientEnglish Patient 1ST Edition."},{"Title":"On Evolution","review":"The author has gone on to write much more impressive works.This is a grouping of his essays, many of which are not easily followed because of the depth of his mathmatics.Nonetheless some of the essays are worth a read to see some interesting theoretical evolutionary explanations.\\"Game Theory and the Evolution of Fighting\\", and \\"Eugenic and Utopia\\" are particularly recommended. \\"The origin and maintence of Sex\\", is worth a read, but I doubt some of his theories and suspect there have been better essays written on the subject by now."},{"Title":"On God and Dogs: A Christian Theology of Compassion for Animals","review":"I have read virtually everything I can find dealing with theology and animals, because of my strong interest in both, and I find this is the most insightful book in print. Webb offers profound wisdom in his thinking about human/animal relations from a Judeo-Christian perspective, and his analysis of other writers' thoughts is very cogent. This is a serious and challenging book, but it is so well-written that it should be readily accessible to wide audiences.Steve"},{"Title":"On God and Dogs: A Christian Theology of Compassion for Animals","review":"I loved this book, especially the section devoted to after-life of animals. I ride endurance horses, (long distance competitive riding) and KNOW what a bond with an animal is. My champion endurance horse and I completed over 3000 miles together before a blood disease claimed his life in January. I've never felt separation like that before. As I have said many times since then, &quot;There are a lot of people I would have rather buried that day than my best friend, my horse&quot; The author captures many of these solid and two-way relationships. My own pastor has a hard time relating to the grace of God shown between humans and their animals. Animal lovers knew it all along!"},{"Title":"On God and Dogs: A Christian Theology of Compassion for Animals","review":"I have read a whole lot of books in the realm of animals and theology and this is by far one of the best. In terms of theology, it is extremely well-grounded. This is not some pop theology book but a serious work of theology from a serious academic. At the same time, it is very accessible to those with limited theological training. You do not need a graduate degree to read this book, and I think that is its great strength. This is an incredible cogent and well argued book that demands that both people who eat and do not eat animals examine. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"After reading The Female Brain from dr. Brizendine, nothing can surprise me regarding the way that our brain works. Maybe that is the reason I did not find this book to be so mind-opening. However, it shows some very interesting aspects of human view on beauty. It seems we still think like our ancestors did when it comes to beauty, despite all the education and knowledge we have now. If you have never read something similar, I recommend you to read this book, as it could open the whole new world to you."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I bought this book two days ago and read it cover to cover in one sitting. This book puts to rest all of the feminist platitudes about beauty that has become dogma in the last thirty years. Nancy Etcoff demonstrates that the appreciation of beauty is not just a patriarchal tool used to keep women in line, but a genetic imperative that encompass all cultures, societies and races. She shows that while women are more rewarded for their beauty (or punished for lack therof), men are also harshly judged by their appearance. A short, balding guy is as likely remain dateless as an overweight woman. Etcoff also makes a point of comparing and contrasting the differences in what male and females find attractive and the genetic reasoning behind this. Despite the fact that straight and gay males are attracted to different genders, they both share a common trait of placing high importance on the youth and appearance of their partners. And while there is a thriving gay porn market, no such lesbian equivalent exist in the world. Beauty is currency and anyone interested in finding out more about this most human of commerce should pick up this book."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I found this to be informative and readable. Two members of my family are plastic surgeons, so that might have increased my interest above the normal. Anyway, I'd read two other books about the same subject, that were dry and academic. This was refreshingly accessible. (Incidentally, one of the sadder studies mentioned in one of these other books involved girls in a fifth grade class who were asked, individually, who they thought was the ugliest girl in their class. 75% of the girls said &quot;I am.&quot;) The criticisms of other reviews that character isn't addressed in this book are wrong, because Etcoff closes the book with the wonderfully warming story of how Edith Wharton (I believe it was) was an unbelievably ugly woman, but then quotes men that got to know her, and ended up attracted to her because of her intelligence and personality. I just wonder how good-looking those people who give this book high scores are, versus those who give it low scores, because the bit closing the book shows one CAN transcend ugliness with character. Just before visiting this site, I was at the supermodel Heidi Klum's web site. But I did not become a big fan of hers strictly from her fashion lay-outs, but after I saw her talk on TV, and she was utterly graceful and kind and warm. THAT's what won me over. But looks do matter. Somerset Maugham said, &quot;Women are smart, in that they know a pretty ribbon placed strategically in their hair, can mean the difference between true love and no love.&quot; We like to think love transcends all natural laws, but love is made up of petty details. Anyway, those who argue that attractiveness is purely cultural (it is to some degree: Brazilian men love big derrieres and small breasts, the opposite of American men) ignore the study Etcoff mentions of three month olds babies whose gaze lingers longer on photos of supermodels than those less attractive. This is a first-rate book."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This is easy to read but only gives one side of the nature/nurture controversy. It comes down hard on the nature side and limits itself to the evolutionary hypothesis. There are other theories about physical attractiveness. It fails to distinguish between what is said to be attractive and what causes sexual rousal. It offers no solution to the problem of &quot;lookism&quot; or &quot;appearancism.&quot; After reading Grealy's &quot;Autobiography of a Face&quot; one feels that we should at least be discussing solutions. To be fair, the scientific studies are surprisingly few and surprisingly dull.

There were only a couple of customer reviews when I first read the book, and today I scrolled through all of them -- which prompted me to put in my 2 cents worth: I really don't understand the perception of this book as a political statement -- it seems to me in the best tradition of the burgeoning field of evolutionary psychology as exemplified by R Wright, R Dawkins, S Pinker, M Ridley, A Dugatkin, J Tooby &amp; L Cosmides, etc etc etc. Dr Etcoff's book is a unique combination of clinical acumen, breadth of research interests, and beautiful writing style. It's so unusual to read a book that presents powerful ideas first of all, and presents these ideas accessibly to the nonspecialist who nonetheles has read broadly to acquire broad general knowledge. Survival of the Prettiest pulls together all original research literature on the psychophysics of human attraction (including Etcoff's own work on facial recognition), the relevant literature on evolutionary psychology, and an enormously amusing storehouse of illustrations from art, poetry, and literature -- everywhere in short -- not even scorning scandalous gossip if it proves her point. The book is organized to gallop along, yet the text is scrupulously documented in endnotes and exhaustive bibliography. This is a work of real scholarship -- yet without a single turgid paragraph or opaque footnote. Anybody that reads it with even a half-open mind can see that Etcoff has presented a careful and balanced account of the current state of the art. And the research supports her conclusions: like it or not, we are hard-wired to respond to what is called &quot;beauty.&quot;"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"this book was packed with information and facts it made it a very solid and insighful read altho a little bit dull at times which is why i did not give it 5 stars. however it poses excellent arguments and different views to support her views.

Survival of the Prettiest pulls together all original research literature on the psychophysics of human attraction (including Etcoff's own work on facial recognition), the relevant literature on evolutionary psychology, and an enormously amusing storehouse of illustrations from art, poetry, and literature -- everywhere in short -- not even scorning scandalous gossip if it proves her point. The book is organized to gallop along, yet the text is scrupulously documented in endnotes and exhaustive bibliography. This is a work of real scholarship -- yet without a single turgid paragraph or opaque footnote. Anybody that reads it with even a half-open mind can see that Etcoff has presented a careful and balanced account of the current state of the art. And the research supports her conclusions: like it or not, we are hard-wired to respond to what is called &quot;beauty.&quot;"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"\\"Survival of the Prettiest\\", to me was yet more fascinating evolutionary psychology fare. I just love this stuff. Don't be turned off by the introduction. It reads like an editorial and is actually more like a conclusion. It contains few of those juicy research tidbits that makes evolutionary psychology so interesting. The juicy bits of information start in the second chapter and keep going right on into the last. This book read like a page turning murder mystery. If you liked \\"Survival of the Prettiest\\" you might also like the following books: Robert Wright, The Moral Animal: Why we are the way we are, the new scinece of evolutionary psychology; David Barash, The Whisperings Within; Matt Ridley, The Red Queen; Matt Ridley, Nature via Nuture; David Barash, The myth of Monogamy; and David Barash, Making Sense of Sex. Other books on my reading list are: Barash & Lipton, The Gender Gap, David Buss, The Evolution of Desire, and Geoffrey Miller, The Mating Mind."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I didn't like this book. Not only was it poorly edited and organized, but while it did open my mind to the concept of beauty as a biological adaptation, I found that it jumped to conclusions from minimal evidence. Much of the material that Etcoff cited to prove the biology of beauty seemed to clearly indicate that beauty is significantly influenced by culture. Despite these studies, the idea of beauty being at least partially constructed by culture was for the most part denied or ignored. Furthermore, the book often contradicted itself, asserting vastly different ideas from paragraph to paragraph, with no explanation for these conflicting messages. Lastly, some of Efcoff's assertions were just down-right wrong. For example, presumably to illustrate the instinctual power of beauty, she writes that, \\"we do not introspect about beauty or think about other things in it's presence.\\" Really??"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Many of the reviews here complains about this being not a book scientifically strong enough.But even looking at the index you can see what the text is about from the chapters 'the nature of beauty', 'beauty as bait', 'cover me', 'feature presentation' and 'fashion runaway'... since the book is written by someone like Dr. Etcoff, everybody expects the scientific cold point of view evident in every page.But for many other disciplines the text is perfectly able to open wide a huge perspective in the general problem of the perception of beauty, its uses, and the necessity of it.For people into arts, the thing about beauty perception and mathematical relation deeply rooted, not in the software but instead in the hardware, is fundamental in a time were the discussion is always about art not being interested in the aestethic depiction, perception or even consideration.Of course it can be sort of very well known facts what she is saying here about the golden proportion, simmetry and genetic health, the 7 to 10 hip proportion and fertility in women, and even the relation between the mother's perception of beauty in their offspring and neoteny -a concept that certainly you can trace back to Stephen Jay Gould or any other 'divulgative' text, even like the mentioned here 'the selfish gene', etc.But the real problem is context.What this book is really good at, is filling the gap between those kind of books -biology, life sciences, perception- and the kind of studies that really need to approach the subject not only as a problem, but instead as a matter.Not precisely aesthetics, but !fashion!.Even at the very beginning is mentioned how nowadays an entire city can be stopped because Claudia Schiffer is at a starcaise making some photographs, giving us the clue to understand how this whole book can be seen; in a total different light and with such a different use.The fact that every now and then Desmond Morris collides with Sandra Rhodes, Azzedine Alaia meets Darwin, opens the window and let you see the landscape is about the form, perception and construction of beauty as an adjective, as something we worn and sometimes have to endure.So this book belongs in the shelf next to Anne Hollander, Valerie Steel or Alison Lurie. Comprehensive studies about the power of image, fashion and appeareance. And not precisely in the side of the 'scientific' bunch.And it is an excellent entrance to think in the equation beauty, perception, process and representation that is so difficult to see, but so much necessary to really achieve: design with one eye into the biological process, art once again perceiving its duties, and science humanized through the contact with the arts, designs and fashion. Also I think everybody goes to the scientific side forgetting all the good concatenation of historical facts from corsets, wigs, make up, heels, making a very well define line between the subject -the beauty- and its uses.As a companion I think also in the same shelf could it be 'Venus Envy' by Elizabeth Haiken, also a bridge between 'science and consumer culture'."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This book is the most comprehensive in it's analysis of beauty, and takes into account all cultures and evaluations of beauty. Everything in this book made sense, the desire for beauty...to posess it to be around it...is innate, we are all trying to draw closer to the ideal nature of it. She delves into everything from hair, skin, body type, and even pheremones. Nancy Etcoff's work put's others to shame, specifically those that claim ideals of beauty are entirely a cultural construct. Etcoff makes a convincing and comprehensive case for why beauty is so powerful and influencing, also why it is innately desired and utterly compelling. This book is a must for anyone who cares about their own appearance and how to maximize beauty in their life, also for just understanding human nature in regards to this topic."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Dr. Etcoff has created a masterful book which explains the similarities and supposed differences in how beauty is viewed in cultures around the world.As to the similarities all cultures revere youth and symmetrical proportions while at the same time finding appealing womanly signs the mark of an appealing woman while finding appealing manly signs the mark of an appealing man. As to the supposed differences, cultures have found unique ways to emphasize different features in their own unique ways. From the bound feet of Chinese women to elongated necks in tribal Africa specific womanly features have been selectively highlighted in much the same way nature has its own selective highlights.Far from justifying a culture which emphasizes its own selective highlights, Etcoff's book brings us to understand them in context. In short, Etcoff encourages to look up from her book, to look past the obvious, to harken to the challenge of seeing the true beauty in those around us."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This book, basically, reinforces what most of us already know. That the world revolves around the beautiful, that the better looking you are, the more successful you're going to be, and the uglier you are, the higher chance that you're going to be working at McDonald's for the rest of you're life. But more depressing than these facts alone is the phenomena of a higher incidence of child abuse against children that are less than pleasing to the eye. Is this how evolved people are? Apparently so, if we still assume that the beautiful are intrinsically good and the the ugly are intrinsically evil."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"The thing impressed me most, is the way she writes and the easiness she explains difficult concepts. Now let me tell you something about its content.The topic is about the way humans have been considering beauty during these last two hundred years, thewriter draws her attention on woman and the way they use, they feel, and the things they do for the sake ofit. The writer tends to divide the book into to sections: the first deals with the origins and the way humanshad dealt with it. In the second part the writer draws her attention more on the relation exists betweencultures, human relations, religions and the concept of beauty.Towards the middle of the book, these concepts are recalled. By reading this book; it comes out that humanbeauty has always been playing a key role in society, in economy and in humane relations.This book is written by a woman for women; I do think that men should read it as well, because it is worth"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Having always been curious as to why the world is crazy about beauty, I found Nancy Etcoff's account of beauty to be entertaining yet educational. If you are perplexed as to why men preffer blonds, or why cosmetic companies thriving. Read this book."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I LOVE this book!!! Being a person that is very intrigued by beauty,-the myth, the standard, and everything in between- this book is HEAVEN SENT! This is a wonderfully written, fascinating book that provides evidence to back up all the theories we have about beauty. Everything we think we know about beauty is true, and this book takes all those things to a new, factual level. Bottom line, 'Survival of the Prettiest' is FABULOUS! A must-read! Do yourself a favor and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This is a fun read for the layman, but it is not very scientific, furthermore, it is does not stand up to even the most basic scrutiny-don't think too hard if you want to enjoy this one!For example, the idea that women are Darwinistically selected for their beauty is a hard buy. In all species except humans, males compete for the right to mate with females, but females can ALWAYS reproduce and pass on their genes; females do not need to force males to mate with them. Can you imagine a human society where a female cannot have sex and pass on her genes because her cheekbones are not high enough? It is purely laughable, if anyone is selected, it is us males.Also, recent scientific evidence (see human genome project) suggests that sperm competition resulted because of the high levels of promiscuity of human females. This throws into question one of the most popular theories of evolutionary psychology, which posits that men roam and spread their seed while women stay home and take care of the kids. On the surface, evolutionary psychology tries to make sense of us, but in reality, it is like thinking the earth is flat. Let's leave science to the scientists."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"A good book for researching the history of fashion and the way advertising, sexual discrimination, sexism has shaped our outlook on beauty.This author is clearly supportive of the current structure and theme of mainstream advertising, which declares it shows only what people want since people are assumed to know instictively what beauty is. This is the excuse big business uses to rid themselves of guilt for showing ads the re-inforce bad choices and encourage social discrimantion based on things like race and body type. They say \\"this is just a case of supply and demand; people want to see beauty in advertising so we give them it. People buy more when we give them a beautiful picture of a woman with their cigarette ad then when there is no woman in the ad.\\" Mind you no one ever asked an advertisor to put people in ads, nor did any average citizen ask for advertising to occur to begin with. No one ever agreed that the woman used in said ad was considered beautiful by most people. Only through cultural conditioning and manipulation have people been influenced to respond to certain looks and certain types of ads.The author uses studies to prove her points, and the biggest studies supportive of her point our ones done using infants to respond to realizing what beauty is. Ironic, considering advertisers and related companies owned by the same corporation, that also own cosmetic companies, were the basis of funding for studies using infants for the purpose of detecting if beauty is an instinctual response as opposed to a response that originated through conditioning by one's environment. The use of infants does not prove anything since infants, like anyone, are just as susceptible to conditioning, even more so since they are more sensitive and vulnerable to environmental behavior. Just because they can't talk yet to point out their observations, or even understand them, does not mean they are incapable of observing something bad or good that is going on. Therefore there is no way to prove that they are free from any social conditioning that adults go through that influence the way they shape their opinions on beauty. Advertising affects people from day one, the minute they open their eyes. If an infant is surrounded by mothers that have a look that resembles a model or actor on Tv that the mother may watch with their child, they most likely would respond more warmly to that model in the study being conducted to see how \\"instictive\\" the reaction to beauty is. With this in mind, there is no way to prove that their reaction was instinctive and not manipulated. Furthermore, the health of the infants plays another role in these studies that she does not talk about. What about autistic or deaf infants? how do they respond? Were they included in the study too? or was it really just infants that all had similar backgrounds, similar conventional looking mothers, that make them an easy subject to respond to a beauty model that reminds them of their mom? The lack of consideration for those with disabilities or of difficult backgrounds and how they respond to \\"beayty\\" is even a more glaring example of how the author is clearly supportive of the way mainstream advertising discriminates audiences. If you have any type of challenge or difficulty, advertising does not cater to you nor does it care about you so you aren't considered a valid consumer or a valid subject to participate in such studies, because a challenged person may be less able or inclined to accept the environmental conditioning that we have to deal with, living in a world of ads, making them less inclined to give a conventional, easy-to-read response.Something that bothered me considerably about this book was the author's willingess to concede to the very skewed concept of men's attraction to young women being an instinctive response, that the attraction for a 90 year old man to a 13 year old girl is genetic as opposed to mentally or sexually dysfunctional, and is therefore acceptable. Very bizarre considering most of the factors in the way men treat women are CLEARLY due to cultural upbringing and is in no way a provable indication that it has anything to due with genetics. Moreover, Throughout history, misogyny has been one of the most prevalent reoccuring themes. Most of these cultures that allow the treatment of sexualizing a young girl are very misogynistic. So if she says that the sexual attraction is genetic, then misogyny must be considered genetic too. Is it genetic for men to hate women? Following her logic, it has to be, yet she does not talk about that. She uses examples of the past that point out that women were married off early in their teen years, and were considered at their most fertile point to recreate during their early teens--we're talking 12 to 14, people--and that was all due to genetics and has nothing to do with misogyny, oppression, or jealousy of women (women can carry life inside them, men can't) that is so obvious in cultures such as the Middle Eastern ones where they still treat women as nothing more than something to use and abuse, and start doing so at ages when women are especially aware of their own sexuality. What's more ironic is that the men they were married off too were all over 30. Is she saying that the only men that find young women attractive are old men? And that this attraction is soley due to the youth of a woman, and not the fact that cultures that encourage engaging with young women also support full-fledged misogyny? Why is a boy not considered at his most fertile when he too is going through his teen years? Men are at their peak during their teen years in terms of sexual drive. To say that genetically a women is most fertile during that time and say nothing about men during the same age period is discriminatory and oppressive to women, and justifies sexualizing young women by men of all ages. It also leaves no justification to the fact that old women are capable of sexualizing young boys, so if she think's it is acceptable for men to be justified in their attraction, becuase throughout history it has occured, would she declare women's attraction to be justified too? The author leaves many thing unanswered and does not address even more related topics. Old men sexualizing young women is not an instictive sexual response, and many times it's not even based on sexual attraction. it is a method of controlling women before they are old enough to be aware that this treatment is wrong and escape from it.Also, many men throughout history have been pedophiles and other sexual criminals, and if they were rulers of the society during that time, their behavior influenced the behavior of the common people. Therefore the attraction to youth of age group was not by instinct, but by there sexual dysfunction. This factor in determining sexual attraction and the trend it set for men to justify their attractions is totally left out. Why?These facts prove that throughout history, attractions to things and aspects of humanity are not controlled by genetics and trying to prove they are is almost impossible since cultural conditioning plays much more of a stronger role in shaping our outlooks than our biology does. Historically, the conditioning hasn't been much difference so using past examples does not explain anything either. We are way too conditioned of a global society to remove the environmental influence and try to focus on what is only a genetic response and nothing more."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Survival of the Prettiest is an entertaining read with many different studies integrated into it, as well as some classical references (i.e., Plato's idea of beauty). Occasionally the author throws together many different people's opinions / studies without clearly stating her own thoughts on the matter, or seems to give more weight to one researcher than to another. And once in a while, theories she mentions seem strange and somewhat questionable. But, overall, the book is balanced and well-argued and, most importantly, fun. ;-)"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"(...)If you are open minded and are more interested in the truth than a idealogical\\\\politcal agenda, then this book will provide very invaluable insights.The author is a Harvard professor with a PHD in psychology. She seems like a preeminent authority in the field and her book shows it. Virtually every viewpoint is backed up by scientific research or strong rationale. Although few would agree with every single point of this book, even fewer would argue that author's opinions have no basis in fact or science.My only dissatisfaction with the book stems from the fact that the author provides dearth of advice or suggestions on how we should adapt our thoughts and behaviors based on the knowledge. In other words, this is NOT a self help book. Rather it is more like a PhD thesis on the evolution of the human sexuality, but of a high quality."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I liked this book first and foremost because in has tonnes of research data and information for further research when it comes to the topic evolutionary sciences,biology and all other theories on human nature, major experiments etc.I do not read science/biology books and to me this book was semi boring because the way the author wrote it just seemed dry or is it how all science writers write?That was the only thing I disliked about the book so I could not possibly rate the book low because of that. Therefore, there were many things about the book that I loved. She scientifically defended her claims and clearly explained her notions on what she was talking about.The basic premise is the notion that we seek to be beautiful because it helps us survive in a sense whether a good looking person gets hired for example, survival meaning having that job to support yourself and so on.Good book highly recommended to anyone who is interested in the subject."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Great examination of psychology and human behavior. Etcoff has a keen understanding of beauty and its relationship to society and cultural norms. Fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This is an interesting book, if you come into it with an objective perspective. I think it satisfies both the beautiful and the insecure, since it not only admits certain stereotypes and biases, but explains their source. The most valid point is the book is this: Though the media has crammed into our minds an unrealistic view of beauty and perfection, 1/3 of the American population is still obese. Though we may not be content with our bodies and these in-our-face advertisements can make our self-esteem plummet, the majority are not motivated to take action. It's a good read."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Besides being an entertaining read, this book answers questions I have pondered before, like what does it mean to be beautiful and why are people attracted to beauty.I think these questions have been ignored by many because they're not especially politically correct and they may be deemed frivolous and unscientific. But Dr. Etcoff gives these issues the scientific and historical analysis they deserve, and she backs up her statements with hard facts.Dr. Etcoff also touches on related issues like fashion and, my favorite part of the book, scents.It doesn't seem like Dr. Etcoff had any kind of agenda while writing this book. This may be the main thing that sets this book apart from other writings on beauty. It is refreshingly impartial and intelligent."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Firstly, Dr. Etcoff opens her book with a reference to Naomi Wolf; however, her interpretation of The Beauty Myth is deeply flawed, as is much of the book. While Etcoff claims to use &quot;cutting edge&quot; studies, a quick glance through the back of the book reveals that many of the studies cited are decades old. The book lacks cohesive organization; Etcoff cites multi-cultural studies but fails to integrate them into a cohesive argument. Etcoff fails to convince one of her thesis; rather than writing a serious, comprehensive inquiry into the biological basis for beauty, she opted to make a quick buck with this sensationalist, scattered book."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I've always been into evolutionary studies, and this book is a nice addition to the that field. It helps to explain why women do strange things like wear high heels or &quot;exfoliate&quot;. This book won't make many feminists happy, which may be as good a reason as any to read it -- it provides much information to use when contemplating if beauty should be used as a source of power, something feminsts seem to be reluctant to embrace.Read it. Particularly if you enjoyed learning Darwinism."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I've been in trouble for most of my life for my view that evolution best explains human culture and behavor. No one likes to think that thier decisions and desires are as much chemical or instinctual as anything else. I bought this book the first time and saw it and loved it. That we can look at so many behaviors and see a general 'why' that applies to the entire race always fascinates me. Some people are very disappointed with the ideas in this book and this kind of thinking. In thier view 'pretty' or 'beautiful' comes only from personal desire and choice. Etcoff shows that there is so much more than volition going on: that there are cues hard wired into our brains that tell us that the person in front of is is fertile, healthy, and pleasant. These traits, noticed in an instant, translate into 'pretty.' Of course as a culture we codify these traits and call people who exude them pretty.The book is well written and is very readable. It's a great resource for further study and very provacative. Should get a lot of great coversations going."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Consider this an engaging piece of fiction from a Harvard professor usually known for writing dry science grants. In _Survival of the Prettiest_, Etcoff has created a vividly imaginary world in which &quot;beauty&quot; seems obvious and universal to her characters: what people call &quot;pretty&quot; always seems the same and what appears beautiful never really varies because us male breeders always look for the same attributes in our women. Lesser imaginative readers might want to contest some of her claims on the basis that not all of us are straight, white, bourgeois unitedstatesians living in the late 20th century. Others may be tempted to ask Etcoff where a myriad of different counterexamples -- from non-European cultures and different historical periods -- might fit into her &quot;study.&quot; But in the face of the many comforting certainties Etcoff provides, it should be easier to simply go along for the ride. This is an incredibly naive book, too bad public money probably went into funding the research."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Okay, I admit I haven't read this book to completion...but there's just so much ignored. If men prefer light skin...I mean *please* I suppose this means that Mexicans and Africans don't find their women sexy? Whatev. Just think about how many subcultures we have going on in the 90s -- hell, just look at high school cliques. Compare Hustler to On Our Backs to Cosmo. Check out Miss America in the 1950s, the 1970s and today. There have been different standards for eye shadow colors, the fit of pants, hip width, boob size and shape, height, millimeters between brow and eye, lip shape, hair style, the athletic look, the waif look, the vamp look, the bunny look. Doesn't anybody remember Marilyn Monroe? What about Jennifer Lopez's beautiful booty -- those that say it's too big and those that drool?? Yes, human beings have vicseral, inborn reactions to beauty, but there is just so much variation of beauty and we are conditioned to respond to the variation currently in vogue in our life times and in our social group.And consider this...the halo effect also works both ways, and there's been research to prove it. If you hand a group of people a list of good traits and a picture of someone, and hand another group of people the same picture and a list of bad traits, those two groups will describe the same person's looks in very different ways. People assume that nice looking people are also nice people. But when you're attracted to someone because they have personality traits you find appealing, you'll also find their faces and bodies quite attractive."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Some of her \\"scientifically proven\\" ideas do not include the majority of people in the world. By her estimations, white people would be evolutionary (on a beauty scale) surpassing every other race. I like the fact that scientist are studing these ideas but they need to be inclusive in their research. Also a lot of the cultural norms for beauty are cultural norms, not just biological. Why don't men were certain devices to show off their fertility? Other cultures do(exaggerated cod pieces). Interesting book but more research needs to be done before I am just on ship."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"What a remarkably well written and long overdue book! Etcoff's simple and devastating remedy to Naomi Wolf's Beauty Myth hysteria is a readable and thoughtful volume. For razing arch-feminists' shibboleths, Etcoff will no doubt be rewarded with mountains of opprobrium -but only from those whose emotional and political investments are in avoiding the intriguing truths Etcoff arrays for the reader. Cognitive scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, neurobiologists, behavioral ecologists, and those gender feminists brave enough to read the book with an open mind (inter alia) will benefit tremendously from Etcoff's sweeping summation of the science and biology of pulchritude. One needn't fear the nonsensical &quot;biology=destiny&quot; tripe that has pervaded this discussion in the past, nor can critics reasonably (mis)attribute such argument to Etcoff (and if they do, they've not read the book, make no mistake about it!).

When comparing this book to others that Amazon recommends in related subjects, its brilliance becomes even more apparent; concepts are expressed clearly and it is difficult to refrain from talking to one's cohorts about them as a result!

But I would have wished for a bit more exploration of the way beauty also might fool us.

But then she doesn't give information about whether this is true. Are more feminine looking women more fertile in reality? Are they healthier?

It is an example of a way of looking at ourselves that is becoming increasingly of value, both in terms of the insights it affords, and in the way it frees us from the muddled delusions of the past. This point of view is from the fledgling science of evolutionary psychology of which Professor Etcoff is a very persuasive spokesperson and practitioner.\\"Pretty is as pretty does\\" and \\"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,-that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\\" (Keats) are two widely differing attitudes toward beauty, but each in its way contains an essence of truth. However, rather than bring these or other presuppositions to what Etcoff has to say (as some readers have), I suggest we actually read what she has to say, and then draw our conclusions. What I predict will happen is that even the most ardent beauty-phobe will find something of value and enlightenment here.Unfortunately (and understandably) not all readers have been able to approach the subject with an open mind. I noticed that an anonymous \\"reader\\" brought anorexia and bulimia into the discussion and blamed the rise in their instance on \\"media images\\" of beauty. No doubt media images are partly to blame (if indeed these disorders have become more prevalent). But it is more likely that the apparent rise in anorexia and bulimia is the result of the fact that the counseling professions now recognize that these eating disorders exist. In the past the symptoms had no commonly agreed upon locus such as \\"anorexia\\" or \\"bulimia\\" to adhere to, so we really do not know how prevalent they were. But more important in terms of being a public health problem is the enormous increase in obesity in this country, now often identified as an eating disorder due to \\"carbohydrate intolerance.\\" The numbers of obese Americans hugely overwhelms the number of anorexics and bulimics, and obesity can hardly be blamed on \\"media images.\\" We can point to the \\"super-sizing\\" of fast food dispensers if we want to fix blame. However--and this is one of Etcoff's important points--it is not the media or advertizing that is primarily responsible for our perceptions of beauty (or our tendency to eat too much), but an inborn, predisposition that has proven adaptive in the past that makes us find some people pretty and some others not so pretty.Another \\"reader\\" claimed that Etcoff did not consider ideas of beauty in other cultures. That is incorrect, as anybody who has read the book knows. She devotes considerable ink to standards and ideals of beauty in cultures around the world and her observation is that ideals of beauty tend to be culture specific; that is, Ache tribesmen find their women and women of a neighboring tribe more attractive than European women. Indeed Etcoff reports that Asians typically find European and African noses not attractive because they are too large. Ache tribesmen actually made fun of the Caucasian anthropologists calling them \\"pyta puku, meaning longnose.\\" (p. 139) Etcoff concluded that there were differences in standards of beauty, but that there were also similarities, and she goes into considerable depth detailing the studies. (See especially Chapter Five, \\"Feature Presentation.\\")Etcoff is also criticized for her many literary quotes, references and allusions. But to my discernment they are a strength of the book and not a weakness. A very important part of our understanding of human nature comes not from the relatively new knowledge called science but from religion and literature. Etcoff is doubly wise to reference what great writers, statesmen and religions leaders have said about our ideas of beauty, first because what they say is worth knowing, and second because they express themselves so well. The anonymous reviewer who claimed to be a scientist perhaps ought to expand his or her reading to include wisdom from other sources, as has Etcoff. I just wish half of the writers writing today were one half as eloquent and readable as is Etcoff; and I'd settle for one-quarter as wise.One of the significant things that this book does is to show that evolutionary psychology, despite the beliefs of its critics (and even that of some of its practitioners), is not limited to using insights from biological evolution alone, but from cultural evolution as well. Etcoff's book is a splendid example of this wiser, broader, synergistically more powerful employment.--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Understanding Evolution and Ourselves\\""},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"After reading \\"The Beauty Myth\\" by Naomi Wolf and writing for that book a nasty review I felt relieved by reading Nancy Etcoff's \\"Survival of The Prettiest\\". My original outrage in reading Wolf's book and my reaction to Etcoff's book weren't fortuitous as the following excerpt from \\"Survival of the Prettiest\\" shows:\\"The idea that beauty is unimportant or a cultural construct is the real beauty myth. We have to understand beauty, or we will always be enslaved by it.\\"\\"Survival of the Prettiest\\" is not necessarily an original book. Most of what's on the book was previously published on Desmond Morris' \\"The Naked Ape\\" and \\"Intimate Behavior\\" and Richard Dawkins' \\"The Selfish Gene\\", among others. Etcoff's most original contribution is to put the more hardcore scientific views in a cultural context by extensively referencing from Plato to \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\".The book is short (maybe too short) and to the point. It includes the biological context of beauty with the idea of sexually selected handicaps such as the peacock's tail or the deer antlers (explained in much more detail in Dawkins' \\"The Selfish Gene\\"); the historical context of beauty from the Greek and Renaissance canons to high fashion; extremely short sections on the beauty of the human voice and the attractiveness of smells; and results from several studies showing how beauty is perceived and rewarded in our society.It's a very well written book by an author with exceptional credentials. Male and female attractiveness is discussed though with more emphasis on female beauty. I wish the small sub-sections on human voice and smell were entire chapters. There's even a short and funny dustjacket praise by no one less than Cindy Crawford herself!!It's worthwhile reading it but if you want a more comprehensive study you'll have to check the originals such as the ones mentioned above.Leonardo Alves - Houghton, Michigan - December 2002"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"In \\"Survival of the Prettiest,\\" Nancy Etcoff states that beauty is *not* (ahem) in the eye of the beholder. Instead, she claims that beauty exists beyond personal preference, and offers evidence that our \\"love of beauty is deeply rooted in our biology.\\" This argument is quite convincing. Below is a summary of just two of the points she makes:1. While the ideal of beauty changes with the times, Etcoff pinpoints similarities across time and cultures. First and foremost, people are attracted to those who are similar to them. For example, Brazilians might feel that beautiful Brazilians are more attractive than beautiful Asians. Yet when asked to pick attractive Asians out of a crowd, Brazilians will generally identify Asians who are considered attractive by other Asians. So, people who are very different in appearance can still agree on some level about beauty in others! This indicates that preferences are at work which transcend continent and culture, making \\"the role of individual taste is far more insignificant\\" than we want to believe.2. All people everywhere are hardwired to think that babies are beautiful; after all, babies are so needy that their survival depends on their appealingness. Intuitive, yes -- but when the research on infant beauty is juxtaposed with research confirming the worldwide male preference for women who look young, lots of things begin to make sense. For example, it shows that the common male desire for women to be \\"infant-like\\" -- or helpless, weak, and in need of a caregiver -- is part of the same process.These are just a two of the interesting points that Etcoff raises in this worthwhile book. It's well written, enjoyable, and unapologetic about its finding that instinct triumphs over common sense. Thus, although the book is about biology, the analysis it presents is sure to provoke thought among those who are interested in Darwinism, the media, and/or women's issues.Etcoff's conclusion: Although we may be dissatistfied with the emphasis our culture places on beauty, our desire to seek out beauty is neither good nor bad. It just is. And that's a good thing to know."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"The main theme of this book is that the phenomena of human beauty have their roots in evolutionary adaptations. It's a good idea, but a very weak book. I am a scientist, and my working assumption is that every feature of human behavior has its roots -- on some level -- in evolutionary adaptations. But to locate the specific adaptations that underlie a given feature is extremely difficult, and it is very easy to lapse into &quot;just-so&quot; stories which sound plausible but could be hogwash. Dr. Etcoff seems unaware of this pitfall. Whenever she comes across a piece of beauty trivia that can be plausibly linked to some evolutionary adaptation, she mentions it, and the book often reads like a first-year doctoral student's lit survey. But almost nowhere in the book does she consider competing explanations or counterexamples. Dr. Etcoff also has a political agenda, which is to &quot;debunk&quot; feminist concerns about the effect of cultural pressures on girls' and womens' self-image. She seems to think that, since our beauty impulse is wired into us by evolution, there is no room left for a critique of the way our culture instantiates those impulses. One thing that particularly offended me was her smug dismissal of the role of media images in the rise of eating disorders. Her main point is that media images can't be the sole &quot;cause&quot; of eating disorders, since a majority of women (who are exposed to the same images) don't develop full-blown bulimia or anorexia. Technically, she is correct, but she has missed the forest for the trees."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I found this book an interesting compiliation of facts and studies, one of those that you can pick up, open to a page, and find out some fun thing to share with your spouse. However, coming from a biology background, I saw again why biology is still the \\"softest\\" of the \\"hard\\" sciences (and psychology isn't a science at all!)--human beings, and all living organisms, are systems that are too complex to follow hard and fast rules. In chemistry, you combine hydrogen and oxygen in the right proportions and conditions, and you will always get water. But in behavioral biology, you combine a clear-skinned, symmetrical, 36-24-36 20-year-old blond with a slightly older, tall, muscular, well-dressed man...and you're not always going to get even a phone number exchanged. While this book talks about what the average person finds attractive, if sexual selection went strictly by these rules, Marilyn Monroe should have had 10 children (in biology, # of children=fitness) and the toothless potato-woman down the street should have none--and we've all seen how that doesn't work! Etcoff does briefly address the phenomenon of people ending up with others at their same level of attractiveness, but doesn't explain how that happens, and how these end up as happy, successful unions if, according to these studies, neither partner could ever find the other attractive!One thing that did disappoint me is that Etcoff didn't explain the varying \\"fashions\\" of women's body shapes, compared to the consistancy of what's found attractive in men (Venus de Milo looks rather paunchy, but David's still a hottie!). She actually seemed to deny its reality, saying that whether what's deemed attractive in a woman is voluptuous or reed-thin, [spoiler alert!] an \\"attractive\\" female body has a consistant waist-to-hip ratio around .7. That may be, but you can't deny that Mae West is a very different vision of pulchritude than Lara Flynn Boyle, and the one body type wouldn't have been considered desireable in the other's time period. If an idea of beauty is instinctive, we shouldn't expect it to deviate so widely over such a short evolutionary period of time.A former professor of mine, David Wilson, published a study showing that ratings of each other's attractiveness increased after two people had worked together on a task successfully. This is just one of the many ways in which what most people consider attractive is modified by circumstances and interactions. So don't let this be a depressing read if you're a short bald man or a woman over 20 who's had a child and looks like it-- while Etcoff has written an interesting book, and perhaps even a factually accurate book, you need only look around at the couples you know to see that \\"Survival of the Prettiest\\" isn't strictly how things play out in the real world!"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"About: Guide to what humans find beautiful and attractive about each otherPros: Interesting, very thorough, well researched.Cons: Almost a bit too well researched, the multitude of facts and studies thrown about can bog the reader down. You're pretty much guaranteed to feel worse about at least one part of your appearance after reading this book.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Here's the skinny on it:- It's not similar to Naomi Wolf's Beauty Myth. So, if you read that one and didn't like it, don't apply analogy;- it takes an evolutionary approach (which to me, is the only one worth discussing), but with the necessary consideration for cultural influences;- her style is highly enjoyable. It's like a walk in the park;- it doesn't try to either justify or deny the importance of beauty for everyday affairs. Doesn't really try to coerce you into taking sides on the issue, just to explain the facts;- it does make a clear point: we may appreciate beauty. We do not have to be overwhelmed by it.All in all, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"My feeling about this book is that there was little new here; it's basically a compilation of studies that have been reported on widely in the media. Being moderately interested in the science of beauty, I will usually read articles on that subject when they appear from time to time in the science section of the paper. Based on my very passing level of familiarity with the subject, I felt there was nothing here that I hadn't already read somewhere else. Babies stare longer at pretty faces? Check. Clear skin is universally considered attractive? Check. Etc, etc. The information is presented in a straightforward, not especially creative fashion. But if you're not at all familiar with the topic you might find it interesting.To the extent that the author has an agenda, it seems to be pushing beauty acceptance, which seems a bit strange to me. She creates a sort of straw man argument about how feminists think that appreciating beauty is somehow succumbing to the patriarchal agenda. Most of the people I know would describe themselves as feminists, and I haven't really heard this opinion expressed. It seems most humans have quite a healthy respect for beauty, which is, in a way, her entire point. So it seems like she needed to create this straw man in order to have a reason for writing the book in the first place. That seemed a bit academically sloppy to me.The last thing I will add is that the author consistently reports that \\"glossy\\" hair is universally seen as attractive and as the standard people wish to attain. People of African heritage in general do not have that hair type and I thought it was strange that she never mentioned that she was focusing on a racially exclusive ideal. Although she tries to point out that she is not being ethnocentric in her description of beauty ideals, there are several areas in which she does, in fact, report a racially or ethnically exclusive ideal as if it were universal, and I found that somewhat troubling."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Fascinating book that is a must read in the competative environment we live in today. Pretty scary when one realizes that all species on the planet are hard wired to be attracted to the prettiest or the most tall, dark and handsome. Nonetheless, the insights on what defines male and/or female beauty, which body features are the most alluring, how important waist and bust size are and what the right proportions are as perceived by the mind are real eye openers. It has given me a lot of insight I didn't have before. My only complaint is some of it is superficial and not enough footnotes."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This book is readable and interesting. I recall a &quot;20/20&quot; program where they put hidden cameras on a man and woman who were beautiful, and on a man and woman who were plain, and sent them out for job interviews WITH THE SAME RESUMES. The attractive man and woman got MANY more job offers than the plain pair. And these were not fashion-model jobs, but stock-brokerages etc.,I used to work in a plastic surgeon's office. One woman brought her baby in to have a cleft-lip repaired. The mother used to sit and read magazines in the waiting room while the baby cried next to her. After the baby's lip was fixed, and he now looked like a normal baby, that mother never touched a magazine in the waiting room, but cooed and cuddled him the whole wait.BUT if looks were everything, how come John Lennon and Paul McCartney both in 1969--when John and Paul were arguably the most desirable men on the planet--married Yoko Ono and Linda McCartney?! Yoko and Linda were not that attractive!! But they snared two Beatles. I mean, I'm a nobody, and I don't think I'D even go out with Yoko or Linda. To each his own! So looks matter, but they ain't everything.Anyway, this book delves into the appearance aspect of our species in an accessible manner, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I read this book wondering how the science and psychology of beauty fit into our culture today and throughout history. Is beauty really all in your head? I still think that's a matter of opinion, but it was interesting to see the research on our general and individual reactions to the beautiful. I found this book readable, enjoyable and informative."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"\\"Survival of the prettiest\\" is a very provocative title indeed and it is also a very ambitious subject to say the least. I expected from this book an identification of a phenomenon called \\"survival of the prettiest\\" if there is indeed such a thing, and if there is, a robust account of how it can be explained scientifically, because the subtitle of this book is no less than \\"the science of beauty.\\" But, as a whole, this book fails to give us any satisfactory identification or explanation of the so-called \\"survival of the prettiest.\\" In fact, I find the book often drifts away to somewhat trivial episodes of some biological or sociological findings to sustain readers' interest. I don't see how such things can be put together to establish the author's ultimate claim that our biological and sociological existence is so designed that the prettiest have been assured a better chance to survive to form the current world. Chapters are not thematically connected with each other and are not well-organized to deliver what the author intends to get across. I expected somehow solid scientific backing for the author's claim, but generally said, this book is a very light read that may not be called the \\"science\\" of beauty. I have no objection, however, for the readers who just look for some interesting subjects for light talks with families and friends at the dinner table. This book may be a good fit for that purpose."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Dr.Etcoff strives to make two main points in her book. One: beauty has a profound effect on our lives. Two: humans are hardwired in the way that we recognize and react to beauty. She merges findings from scientific studies with quotations from philosophers, playwrites, artists and literary giants to lend credence to her premises. Her exposition is lucid and compelling, which makes the book a fascinating read rather than a tedious academic treatise (which it could have been). Her themes gracefully weave through many aspects and expressions of the human experience yet in the end zoom in on her target point.However, I share the view of several other Amazon reviewers that the author does not delve deeply into cultural ideals of beauty. She does not address well known beauty practices that may seem strange, even grotesque to those who are mired in Western aesthetic ideals. I would have loved to see her perception of, for example, the \\"giraffe necked women\\" of Myanmar and the extreme elongation of lips and earlobes considered a beauty ideal in some African cultures."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This is a pretty decent book but not extraordinary. It brings together many of the current observations relating to beauty (especially the female variety) but is not overly scientific -- i.e., it doesn't get bogged down in technicalities or jargon. Similarly, it relies on a Darwinian framework for interpretation but is not overly adamant about ev-psych's ability to explain everything about human behavior. I especially liked the first chapter, which reads more like an essay on beauty past and present than an intro to a science book.If there was any complaint, it was that the author wasn't daring enough and doesn't introduce any really breathtakingly new ideas. I got the impression she was mainly reporting on others' research, and I think Etcoff missed (in the next-to-last chapter) the interesting fact that in the last decade (or so) fashion seems to have flowed from the lower classes upwards, whereas throughout the rest of history it's been the other way, which is sort of what she presumes to still be the case. This doesn't detract seriously from the earlier material, which showed a touch more originality of approach. An interesting topic pretty well-covered, even if not ground-breaking in any way."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"&quot;Survival of the Prettiest&quot; thoroughly illustrates the power of beauty in our world. It is not simply limited to certain societies. Even obscure tribes in obscure locations on earth have affinities toward beauty strikingly similiar to peoples of advanced societies. Most salient is the erroneous notion that the media, especially women fashion magazines, are responsible for setting an unattainable, superficial standard of beauty. In reality, the media is merely reinforceing what humans inherently find most attractive, beautiful and to varying degrees (via clothing, make-up, cosmetic surgery) strive for and find fundamentally aesthetically pleasing. &quot;Survival&quot; evidences how the beautiful win in countless facets of social interaction. Vanity should not be summarily dismissed for having no payoff. It does.

Many points were made that floored me; the one that comes to mind easiest is that the American stereotypical role-model image of beauty has been changing slowly to incorporate the influences of many cultures.This book would make a wonderful coffee-table reader, as well as a useful read for anyone interested in understanding why attraction and beauty have so much influence on our everyday lives.

Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"This book is both authoritative and surprisingly entertaining. It is Darwinian - it is the survival of the prettiest and most handsome. The author, Nancy Etcoff, proposes that valuing beauty is an essential and ineradicable part of human nature and that it is revered and ferociously pursued at enormous cost in nearly every civilization.This book from 1999 shows how outside the realm of ideas, beauty rules the day. According to the author, in the United States more money is spent on beauty than on education or social services. In fact, according to the author, 1484 tubes of lipstick are sold every minute of every day. There is tremendous power in a young woman's beauty.Also, the facts show that people are less likely to ask good-looking people for help. Our efforts to please good-looking people with no expectation of immediate reward are one way we reinforce beauty as a form of status."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I've always been intrigued by what governs attraction, and I've read several books that detail how attraction is not a choice, but something we are all programmed with, genetically. Since I've read on this subject before, I found that I knew a lot of the more basic material, but Etcoff expands in some areas that helped me expand my knowledge. This book is definitely worth reading, if one is interested in science of beauty and how it affects the choices we make in life."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Coming from a background in psychology, I found the results of many of the studies Ms. Etcoff references to be very interesting and for the most part, ringing true with my own personal experiences. Yes, it is sad...beauty DOES matter and we are all swayed by it in some form or another. That being said, two things about this book really annoyed me. First, Ms. Etcoff really needs to double check some of her facts. Especially near the last few chapters where she begins to talk about the body measurements of supermodels and actresses! Performing a quick search on the internet does not yield the measurements she often cites for this elite cadre of women. In fact, many of the *famous* supermodels and actresses had (or have) hip measurements falling between the 34 and 36 (heck, Marilyn Monroe alone varied within and above these measurements during her time) inch mark. Sorry, but depending on her bone structure and muscular tone, a 5'7\\" woman with measurements in this range is hardly what I would consider as food deprived. It is not as rare and unachievable as Ms. Etcoff would have us believe - provided you can remember a time without *supersizing* any food group, double cheese pizza, and all those chocolates... And, please...the measurements for Audrey Hepburn ....I have several books on this woman's life...never have I seen measurements so tiny attributed to Ms. Hepburn (excepting her infamous 19 inch waist). My point is that this really lends doubt to how Ms. Etcoff has *interpreted* the other studies she cites in this book. Secondly, Ms. Etcoff points out all these interesting studies in her book and attempts to explain the reasons for these results as being a remnant trait built into the fabric of our existence - for breeding purposes, survival of the fittest, etc...but offers no enlightenment on how to really alter our perspectives since sex is now more for recreational purposes than procreative ones. I felt more like this book ratified men's continual desires for skiny yet large breasted lingerie models and women's desires for older, more well-off men as \\"genetic.\\" Her only counter to this \\"spreading your seed\\" mentality is basically telling us to remember that we have a brain and are capable of higher intellect so we must try not to be dissuaded by beautiful people. Hardly what I call advice. Summing the book up... men (and women) are pigs--albeit pigs looking for two different acorns. My Dad gave me that advice a long time ago - and for free."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"A readable book on one of those things that is constant in our lives. I can testify to the &quot;attractive people are given more personal space&quot; phenomenon Etcoff points out. I was staying in New York for a couple weeks. For the first week I was enjoying seeing all the beautiful women in the city, of which New York has plenty since it's both a fashion and entertainment capitol. And then I was taking the elevator down from my room in the Waldorf Towers, a middle floor of which holds an exercise room guests can use, as well as local residents who pay a monthly fee. The elevator was fairly crowded, and then stopped at the exercise-room floor. On to the elevator stepped an absolutely stunningly beautiful girl. One of those so beautiful you forget how beautiful a beautiful girl can be. She had a gym bag and her hair was loose. She set her gym bag on the floor and bent over to bind her hair. The thing is everyone OVERTLY moved back to give her room, struck by her beauty, and she didn't have to signal &quot;please give me space while I bend over&quot; as most other people would require. Everyone just automatically stepped back, deferring to her beauty, and she automatically EXPECTED everyone to move back. She didn't even think about it, nor was haughty at all. She was just so used to being given instant &quot;status&quot; in any situation, she wasn't even conscious of it. In that small moment, I realized how powerful beauty can be."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Nancy Etcoff is the Nancy Drew of Sociobiology!Have you ever wondered why you couldn't win the heart of a certain special person?

A lot of interesting chapters on how we have developed our views about what is or what is not considered \\"beautiful\\" and the experts who orchestrated them."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Many of the reviews stated that this book was an easy read. Personally, I found it difficult. The content is fascinating, but poorly organized. Moreover, I've found Matthew Ridley's writings (Origins of Species, Red Queen) to be more fluid while Robert Wright's (The Moral Animal) are wittier. Etcoff is -- I don't know, but her writing style just isn't compelling. My biggest complaint is Etcoff's penchant for name dropping and quoting. Occassionaly, it works and enriches the perspective on beauty, but many other times, it just seems to be irrelevant and redundant.That said, I'm doubly confused with some of the conclusions other reviewers came to about the book's content. For example, one reviewer said, \\"men will select women who look like x and have waist-to-hip ratio y etc. because this will be better for reproduction.\\" Etcoff didn't say this at all. She argues that beauty is an adapted evolution mechanism and so, our ancestors (mainly men) sought out beauty because IN THE PAST it provided a better-then-average method for finding fertile mates.In fact, Etcoff writes, \\"A woman's peak fertility is between the ages of twenty and twenty-four and remains near peak throughout her twenties. By the end of her thirties, a woman's fertility has declined by 31%, and after that fertility declines much more steeply. Usually by her early fifties a woman has reached menopause. Things are very different for males, who can father a baby naturally at age ninety-four.

It was very informative and liked it so much I did a research paper on it. I skimmed the other books on the subject but I read and finished this one.

For example, how about those African people that do horrendous things to their lips in order to deform them. There could've been a little more information on that kind of subject.

Most scientists don't know when to stop citing colleagues, though they themselves might not have even read the journal papers in question. Professor Etcoff deftly sidesteps these obvious pitfalls to come up with an elegantly written book. It is formal and backed up by science when it needs to be. When it can't be, it is illumined by literature."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"I've been reading this book over the last week and while it makes sense to me based on what she's reporting on, it doesn't make sense to me based on what I see in the real world. Etcoff claims that babies stare longer at attractive faces and that babies, kids, teenagers, and adults of both sexes agree on what is attractive. ??? Has she never watched Howard Stern, when he has a couple of young women strip down to their skivvies and he and his cronies evaluate them? They never agree! I never agree with a certain friend of mine what makes a woman pretty (he likes thin blondes), but my brother and I always do (we like full bodied women with big eyes). I know Etcoff makes a distinction between fashion and beauty, but I think that distinction may be minimal."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Excellent (and obvious) points are made by this book, but you have to stop and think that if this is how our culture has shaped itself - using attraction and appearance to develop its hierarchy - then maybe that's why our society is such a mess because we're consistently and persistently choosing beauty over brains. Through this selectivity, we could dumb-down our culture even further, if that's possible!"},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"Etcoff does not understand the constructionist position and paints a bad caricature of it.

Moreoever, I have a deep interest and, thus, am rather well read in the field of evolutionary psychology myself. My point is this: watching the way the world reacts to beauty -- espectially when the beauty is prominent -- is nothing short of remarkable. I often stand back in public simply watching (which is the very essence of evolutionary psychology) the way life reacts to my wife and find myself wondering if she is living in the Twilight Zone. The answer that this book (one I'd like to think I could have written but couldn't have) explains is that she merely brings the essence of humanity to the surface -- where every word that Dr. Etcoff explains is certainly confirmed by me in observing the things I've witnessed with respects to my wife."},{"Title":"Survival of the Prettiest: The Science of Beauty","review":"'The Survival of the Prettiest' is a thrilling read if you are secretly fed-up of feminist bleating about beauty being completely in the eye of the beholder. I was not offended because I really don't think it is that serious as science. Etcoff is careful to mention personality and intelligence as factors that do attract people when it comes to choosing a long-term mate. However, I agree with the reviewers who talk about the naivety and arrogance of the sociobiological position in general. Etcoff seems to suggest (perhaps being deliberately provocative) that men will select women who look like x and have waist-to-hip ratio y etc. because this will be better for reproduction. I have yet to meet a man who goes around looking at women in the street and attempting accurate measurement, and then saying 'oh, not quite the best ratio for reproduction'! It would be funny to see what sort of review (if any) the book got from men's magazines. In all, her book is an amusing and fascinating read, but because of its sociobiological underpinning does not account for subjective cultural tastes that human beings have with regards to beauty (e.g.what is attractive about 'pre-Raphaelite women', and what about non-white women; most of the world's population is not white. How do people pass as beautiful even though they cover up their defects, etc. now that would be a more human book to write. Dishing up a lot of evolutionary science is interesting, but it is utterly incapable of penetrating the mystery of beauty. As a woman I've always been genuinely puzzled when people get called beautiful, and never worked out why. I'm sure lots of those people do not meet the sociobiological vital statistics! Perhaps leaving the mystery unsolved is best. It is attempting to solve it fully that is dangerous [....]"},{"Title":"Lemegeton, Clavicula Salomonis: Or : The Complete \\"Lesser\\" Key of Solomon the King : The Five Books : \\"the Goetia\\", \\"the Pauline Art\\", \\"the Almadel of Solomon\\", \\"the Artem Novem\\"","review":"This book is a taped cheap paperback that costs $50, but that's not all that is wrong with it, it also has NO index and NO explanations.

It certainly makes a person wonder when something like this happens. Only a few days before I purchased this book, I had the distinct pleasure of talking to Terry Eaton, who just happens to be Evelyn Eaton's daughter. Terry had called me to inquire about a writers workshop I was going to sponsor. Because of the attack on the WTC, the workshop had to be cancelled, but I did talk to Terry a couple of times on the telephone. During our first conversation, she told me she had written and published a book titled &quot;Joy Before Night&quot;. Impressed with her conversation, I looked the book up on the Internet. We talked on the phone a few days later and I told her how nice I thought it was that she had written a book in honor of her mother. Terry said she thought I might enjoy looking at some of her mother's work. She hit the nail on the head. I ordered &quot;I Send A Voice&quot; and after I finished reading it I ordered two more of Eaton's books.I was amazed by Eaton, who was born in 1902, being among the Indians in 1965 at the age of 63 and learning the spiritual teachings of her Indian ancestors. Eaton's journey took her into many Sweat Lodge healing rituals, several Fasts, and even found herself worthy of having a Sacred Pipe. After many years of being active in the Indian way of life, she fell into the political war of Indian against White Man. Indians she had developed a friendship with came to resent her presence and shunned her. Because she was a non-Indian and of white skin, she was no longer accepted. It broke her heart but it didn't break her spirit.Eaton's last paragraph of her introduction to this book pretty well sums up the things she learned during her time spent with the Indians: If we ask aright, with integrity and total committment, the way will be revealed, step by gentle step. So it is for me, so it is for you, so it is for everyone.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"I Send A Voice","review":"Evelyn writes as a long-time sister/friend, who opens her life and heart to you in a way that makes you feel she is sitting beside you in the desert. Her words cause you to feel every step of her journey as your own. Don't even consider asking your elder for the honor of becoming a pipekeeper without understanding the sacredness of this responsiblity. I understand that Evelyn is no longer walking this mortal path, but I am sure wherever she is the adventure is one of Honor. A respectful, and authentic picture of the Native American through the eyes of a woman who will become one of your heros."},{"Title":"I Send A Voice","review":"This is a wonderful story about a white woman that became a medicine woman (winan pejuta).At the beginning of the book Ms. Eaton was living in a shack, in ill health, and barely surviving. A friend suggested that she go to a medicine man (wicasa pejuta) and ask for a healing at a sweat lodge. As time goes by; attends cerempnies, and as more time passes she goes through fasts, and later obtains a Catlinite (pipestone) pipe and becomes a medicine woman, and used her gift to help the people around her until her death in 1983.Unfortunately; she had MANY problems with some indians because she attended the ceremonies, and was a pipe carrier. It did NOT matter to them that she helped the people, she had undergone three fasts, and the spirits had chosen to work with her.This animosity is STILL going on from some indians to whites, and mixed bloods that are not indian enough (in their opinion) to practise this form of spirituality. I have received some very angry E-Mails from people that claim to be indians, and are offended that I am a pipe carrier, and choose to follow this path. One person went so far as to challenge me with \\"Your people stole our land, and how dare you now steal our religion!\\".I am not stealing anyones religion. I am only following a path that works for me. I know there is real spirituality in this path, and it answers more of the questions I have (It even explained the experiences I had 40+ years ago). I have studied most religions from agnosticiam to zen.Now; I do have a few minor problems with this book.1. There are several misspellings in this book.2. She incorrectly assumes that all medicine people or holy people MUST use a Catlinite (pipestone pipe).The spirit helpers choose to work with the person based on their integrity, and sincerity. In 1999; the Bear Totem animal would NOT be denied. The Bear repeatedly showed up trying to get my attention and let me know that it had decided to work with me. At that time I neither had a pipe, nor used tobacco in any way..."},{"Title":"I Send A Voice","review":"I read this book years ago and it had a profound effect on my life. I stopped.

Most other books seem to be unable to get away from the DB2's previous dependency on text based commands.I am recommending this book to several other Microsoft experienced programmers, because those used to working with GUI interfaces built into Microsoft softwares can truly appreciate what this book has done. It has shown the world that IBM has succeeded in bringing its powerful advantage in the enterprise DBMS to the world commonly used to the Microsoft side of things.Thanks so much to the Whitehorns for their great timing in providing this excellent resource to the new DB2 front-end.

The book I relied on, \\"Management of Organizational Behavior,\\" was good but, being an MBA level text, was more theoretical than \\"how-to.\\" The only other book I have seen on Situational Leadership is \\"Leadership and the One-Minute Manager,\\" which was the exact opposite: Too simple.This book combines the textbook's rigor with \\"One-Minute-style,\\" easy to understand case studies to bring the model to life. Further, it is a how-to manual, which teaches you how to lead effectively using the model. You will learn: The development and intervention cycles, how to avoid being a \\"Leave \`em alone, the zap \`em\\" style manager, and how to properly empower a team, keeping control while simultaneously freeing people. You accomplish this by carefully modulating your relating and task-oriented behaviors in response to your report's motivationand skill. A proper match between employee readiness and a manager's approach generally leads to a more productive, harmonious work place.This book is a classic.

While everystep of Claudel's work as a writer and ambassador is documented here, his domestic happiness(and it seems that it definitely was happy) remains something of a mystery.

I had already identified so much with the beginings of Ms. O'Neils spiritual journey, as I have recently started on my own, that to hear her account of how she was called by her soul in the middle of the night, made my own spirit call even louder. This book is a beautiful and well written account of her journey of acceptance and commitment to listening to her soul. It was helpful to hear about the joys and heartache she went through to get to where she is now. Through her story she answers questions about what one might expect on their own journey of soul serching. It's rarely mentioned that a soul journey can be hard and painful, but she shows us how it is definately worth the effort. Others in different areas of life, might relate better to other parts of the book more than I.

These are wonderful stories of great thinkers, and, to my relief, Mr. Simmons walks us through derivations of many famous formulas and discoveries. Do not fear that this is all calculus--much of the book is brilliant algebra, geometry, and number theory, and fully comprehendable by anyone with a good non-calculus high school education. But tasty calculus delights abound for those who are up to the challenge. The second half of the book, called Memorable Mathematics, are proofs and insights into some of the most wonderful discoveries of pre-twentieth century Mathematics. Topics include primes, irrational numbers, perfect numbers, proofs of infinite series involving e and pi, and a marvelous treatise on the cycloid and brachistochrone problems. Interspersed are interesting anecdotes about these great thinkers, including Newton, Euler, the Bernoulli Brothers, and Leibniz, just to name a few.I loved this book, even though I am not a mathematician by profession. The best part about it is that not only are these famous formulas presented, but most are also proven, which goes along way in showing just how amazingly the brilliant minds of these historical geniuses work."},{"Title":"Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics","review":"Gems is the correct word to describe the tales in this book. These are some of the best stories of the people who made mathematics what it is today that you will ever find. The first stories are about the ancient Greeks and that amazing flowering of intellectual achievement that suddenly arose on the shores of the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean seas. We will probably never know what events fertilized this amazing garden, but suddenly the purely intellectual pursuits of geometry, number theory and logic became the pinnacle of civilization.Unfortunately for us all, but an accurate reflection of historical reality, the first set of stories ends at 415 AD and the next does not begin until 1571 AD. However, the pent-up intellectual ferment led to many dramatic changes in a very short time. The germination of calculus could not occur until many philosophical viewpoints were overthrown. Geocentric views of the universe were completely incompatible with the ideas of Kepler and people had to once again believe that the pursuit of knowledge was a worthy task. It was also necessary for the opposition of the established churches to be reduced to a point where at least it was accepted for people to challenge doctrine. This process took over a century, and was not without many conflicts. Two of the greatest minds of the seventeenth century, Blaise Pascal and Isaac Newton, were emotionally unstable and it was manifested in some unusual religious writings. It is conceivable that a longer-lived and more focused Pascal would have invented calculus.After the second start, the development of calculus then became an inexorable movement. Great intellects followed each other, each building a new section of the castle that is calculus. The author weaves the thread of how each required the achievements of those who preceded them. Personalities and their personal lives also form an integral part of the stories, which makes it much more lively to read. The people who created calculus were real people with sometimes unusual traits. What is striking is that while some were clearly known to be prodigies at an early age, others were quite ordinary in their youth. Newton's youth was quite undistinguished and Weierstrass did not blossom until his forties.This is an ideal book for the study of the history of mathematics. Not only are the facts of development put forward in a sequential order, but you learn about the lives and personalities of the people who made it what it is today. They did not always succeed, were from widely different backgrounds and some of them led very unhappy lives. This should show us all that there is not one specific mathematical personality, but one mathematical discipline that can attract a wide variety of personalities."},{"Title":"Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics","review":"The \\"memorable mathematics\\" part of this book treats many interesting things. One is \\"a simple approach to E=Mc^2\\". First we substitute the relativistic notion of mass m=m_0/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) into F=ma=d/dt(mv) to get the relativistic F=ma, which is F=m_0a/(1-v^2/c^2)^(3/2). The work done by the force moving a particle from 0 to x is energy=integral from 0 to x of relativistic force=(change in mass)c^2.Another topic is rocket propulsion in outer space. Consider a rocket with no forces acting on it. Then mv is constant since d/dt(mv)=ma=F=0. The rocket moves forward by throwing out parts of its mass in the form of exhaust products with velocity -b relative to the ship. Since mv is constant we have mv at t=mv at t+dt, i.e. mv=(m+dm)(v+dv)+(-dm)(v-b), which reduces to dv=-b(dm/m) which we can integrate to get, e.g. the burnout velocity for given initial conditions b and fuel/m.But the best topics are two Euler classics. First the summation of the reciprocals of the squares. (sin x)/x has the roots pi, -pi, 2pi, -2pi, ..., which suggests that the \\"infinite polynomial\\" (sin x)/x=1-x^2/3!+x^4/5!-x^6/6!+... should factor as (1-x^2/pi^2)(1-x^2/4pi^2)(1-x^2/9pi^2)... Multiplying this out and equating coefficients of x^2 we get 1/pi^2+1/4pi^2+1/9pi^2+...=1/3!, so the sum of the reciprocals of the squares is pi^2/6. Also, as a bonus, if we put x=pi/2 in the infinite product for (sin x)/x we get Wallis's infinite product for pi.Euler's study of the reciprocals of the squares also led him to the zeta function zeta(s)=1+1/2^s+1/3^s+..., which he saw can also be written as a product: sum over all integers of 1/n^s = product over all primes of 1/(1-1/p^s), as we see by expanding each factor on the right hand side as a geometric series and multiplying out the product, which gives the reciprocal of each possible product of primes, to the power s, exactly once, i.e., by unique prime factorisation, the left hand side. This charming formula immediately pays off by yeilding a new proof of the old theorem that there are infinitely many primes: because zeta(1)=1+1/2+1/3+...=infinity we have also zeta(1) = product over all primes of 1/(1-1/p) = infinity, which is clearly possible only if there are infinitely many primes."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],W={key:0},D={key:1};function q(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(w,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,E)):b("",!0)])}const H=u(B,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-89649e3c"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/51.md","filePath":"library/51.md"}'),P={name:"library/51.md"},L=Object.assign(P,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
