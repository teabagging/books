These books are invariably stunning and are usually bought solely for the strength of their visual appeal alone.Now comes &quot;The Colors of Japan,&quot; which not only meets the photographic and design standards of Hibi's previous books but also includes text provided by a distinguished Japanese scholar. That scholar is Kunio Fukuda, a professor of color theory at a Japanese college of art and design, and it is his writing--not previously accessible in English--that makes this book especially valuable. For readers familiar with Japan and its culture, Fukuda's text brings into focus what they have already observed about the Japanese use of color.

Those that lived (Graves, Sassoon, Blunden) and those that didn't (Owen, Brooks, Thomas) left a literary legacy of war poetry and war prose that is still unsurpassed.The nature-loving, writing-obsessed Henry Williamson is not often included along with his fellow soldier-scribblers and is, indeed, barely known outside of England. Despite a canon well over forty tomes, Williamson's work has drifted in and out-of-print in the United States. His majestic WET FLANDERS PLAIN, which chronicles his somber return to the former battlefields after a twelve-year absence, cost this author (dollar amount) used in paperback and much anticipation as it slowly arrived from somewhere in Australia. Most of his novels are missing-in-action from used bookshop across America and must be ordered from abroad.Fortunately, THE PATRIOT'S PROGRESS is still available (well, sort-of) and perhaps not for long. Perhaps his best-known novel in America, PATRIOT'S tells the story of Private John Bullock and his progress from a boorish London office job to the battlefields of France. Enhanced by the marvelous Masereel-esque woodcuts ofWilliam Kermode, the novel details in sparse verbiage the life of the men in the trenches. Although not as detail-oriented as Blunden or Graves, it is nonetheless of interest to both the reader of literature and the historian and has been taught in university courses on The Great War. Williamson is an extremely important writer whose works certainly deserve a wider audience."},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Sleeping beauty (Disney's wonderful world of reading)","review":"This book, created by Disney, does not follow exactly the same plot line as Disney's movie does. In this version a princess is born, and the Queen decides to give a party. Many people are invited to the party, as well as three fairies. At the party, right after the first two fairies had given their gifts, an evil fairy that wasn't invited bursts in and says the princess will die in her 16th year. Then she disappears. The third fairy, the one who hasn't given her gift yet, changes it so that she will only sleep until a prince rescues her. Sure enough, she pricks her finger on a spindle, and falls asleep until a prince rescues her. No mention is made of her life between the day she was born and the day she pricks her finger, which annoys me, but is not necessary to the plot.The illustrations are very like the animated movie, but slightly simpler. For the most part the illustrations are very expressive, and do a wonderful job of conveying the intended expression. There is one instance however, where it looks as if the prince's horse is trying to flirt with the dragon the prince in trying to slay, and I doubt that this was intentional.The wording is simple, straightforward, and it flows well. The sentences tend to be short, but that doesn't impede the flow much, or at all detract from the book, which is very good.I must give Disney credit for actually having a spindle to prick her finger on. All too often books have pictures of a small spinning wheel with a design that has no spindle. This wheel, while it is a small one, has a spindle on it to help with spinning flax, so it is actually possible for her to have pricked her finger on the wheel shown. Good job Disney!Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Sleeping beauty (Disney's wonderful world of reading)","review":"Having read four different editions, I'm merging the reviews to make comparison easier. The five star rating reflects the highest rating that any edition below has, but each version has gotten a different rating that is noted in parenthesis.The basic story: After years of wishing for a child, the King and Queen finally have a girl who, other than Princess and later Sleeping Beauty, has no name. Fairies (the number varies) come to the celebration of her birth and bestow good things upon her, except for one fairy who wasn't invited (details vary). Her gift to the child is a promise that she will die when she is sixteen years old, after pricking her finger on a spindle. This terrible curse cannot be removed but one last fairy has a gift left to give and softens the curse so that the Princess will sleep until kissed by a Prince, rather than die. Her father's efforts to thwart the curse do no good and the curse comes true years later. The fairy who'd lightened the curse puts the rest of the castle's residents to sleep and grows a magical forest around it to protect them until the right Prince comes along. When he does, happiness and life are restored to the castle and the Prince and Princess marry.ISBN 0394927982Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty (Disney's Wonderful World of Reading)and ASIN B000WPNRK8SLEEPING BEAUTY(5 stars) - Keep in mind that Disney's Wonderful World of Reading books are intended to help youngsters start reading on their own, because this book isn't meant for the advanced reader. The story is shortened and altered somewhat and the text is simplified using easy vocabulary words. The graphics are part of the story in these books, as well, making it easy for young readers to see what's happening as they learn to read. The entire set is standard Disney - bright, beautiful graphics to catch kids' eyes and pull them into the wonderful world of reading!ISBN 0785300252The Sleeping Beauty (Fairy Tale Treasury, Volume 1)(3 stars) -The one thing that makes Jane Jerrard's adaptation for the Fairy Tale Treasury series is the almost pocket-size, perfect for taking along when you're out of the house. The illustrations by Burgandy Nilles are nice and, considering how small they are, surprisingly detailed. They are generally much less vibrantly colored than the Disney illustrations. This version is all right, but just doesn't compare to the Disney edition.ISBN 0736422528Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty(4 stars) - I'm always a little wary of books that cut a 90 minute movie into less than a dozen pages. This one does an okay job, but not stellar. Maleficent put a spell on Princess Aurora that would cause her to fall into a deep sleep, not die, when she turned 16. Nothing would ever wake her again except a true love's kiss. Fortunately, Aurora has three good fairies looking out for her and, when the time comes, they send Prince Phillip to rescue her. They arm him with a sword and shield and he uses these to fight Maleficent, in the form of a dragon, before he is able to reach Aurora. This adaptation, by Mary Wilson, is not flawless. For one thing, it is so rushed that you get the feeling it might be the middle book of a three-book set. It's not, of course, it's just missing any slow paced lead-in and is wrapped up in seconds. The pace, however, feels much faster to an adult, who can read it in under 2 minutes, than it does when you take your time reading it to a child. The illustrations are standard Disney, though surprisingly dark overall. Weirdly, the yellow and white curls that appear to rise from Aurora's sleeping form make it look like she smells. That was a bit of an odd choice, but the rest are all good. The glossy board book pages wipe clean easily and are sturdy enough to take a bit of abuse.ASIN B000MK55MQ Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty(4 stars) - Back cover text: Discover the magic of friendship as the fairies plan a very special birthday for Briar Rose. This story is written by Lisa Findlay. Forget everything you've read in this review so far, because this book is not AT ALL what you're going to expect. Despite having the same name, and some of the same characters, this is not the Sleeping Beauty story you think it is. Three fairies live with Briar Rose, hiding her from Maleficent. They don't use magic because that would give them away, but when they set out to make a cake and a dress for Briar Rose for her sixteenth birthday, they discover that they really need their magic. They take a risk and give Briar Rose the happiest day of her life. The illustrations are typical Disney. It's a cute story, but it is simply NOT the Sleeping Beauty tale and it really shouldn't have been advertised as such because people will be terribly disappointed if they're not previously aware. I give it four stars for what it is, can't give it five because it feels deceptive.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Sleeping beauty (Disney's wonderful world of reading)","review":"WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE FILM AND THE ADAPTATION.This is one of the more interesting installments of the original Wonderful World of Reading series, in that it is the probably the only one I have seen that does not actually adapt the plotline of the movie its based off. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" the movie is kinda notorious for jettisoning much of its source material and inspiration as soon as it hits second reel, so a very simple about a beautiful princess who is cursed to die only instead to fall into a deep sleep for 100 years (during which probably thousands of foolhardy young princes die horrible deaths attempting to rescue her) became a somewhat convoluted adventure story involving attempts to avert destiny, mistaken identities, and the lone lucky prince being someone that is someone the Princess already has a romantic interest (even if she doesn't learn that until the final reel). Oh and that 100 years thing? Only a few hours long in the movie.So how did that transfer to this original book (more on the \\"original\\" part later)? The long and short of it is: it doesn't. In this version, what we have is the characters of the movie (who are all unnamed here) grafted onto the plot of the Grimm Brothers originals. So now the Princess Aurora (who isn't raised as a peasant here) is an attractive girl who finds a lone spinning wheel... pricks her finger... and falls asleep for the full century (albeit for different reasons this time).Now admittedly the writers did take some inspiration from the film's final reel so that the unnamed prince (clearly recognizable as Phillip, even if its not supposed to be him) gets to fight \\"The Evil Black Fairy\\" (I.E.: Maleficent) in her dragon form with a magic sword given to him by three peasent women (Flora, Fauna, and Merriweather, again unnamed). He wins and everybody lives happily ever after albeit somewhat temporally displaced.I recommend this version just for the sheer weirdness of it. Seeing the characters of Sleeping Beauty in a storyline which is not quite the movie and more Dornroschen is somewhat refreshing and surprising. The art isn't nearly as good as some other Disney books (to the point where some characters, namely Phillip appear frequently off-model) so the storyline is the main selling point. Now in the mid-90s Disney eventually did a different version of the book that did attempt to adapt the movie. I don't recommend it, its just not \\"cool\\" enough"},{"Title":"Blood Son","review":"This is a gripping adventure speculating on what might have been, or perhaps already is!What if Adolph Hitler had a son? What if he was spirited away as Berlin was falling? What if a powerful group of ex-Nazi officers was gathered in Argentina looking to resurrect the Third Reich? What if Hitler's son fell among these die-hards?The writing draws the reader into the story, but the mood is ambiguous. Do we want the boy to survive to manhood or be put away as U.S. intellicence officers prefer?Strong character delevelopment and well-documented, this is a worthwhile book for any interested in the end of World War II and its aftermath. The feeling of the expatriot Nazi community in South America seems particularly realistic.My only criticism is that I found the ending hard to swallow. Others, however, may find it inevitable.

Webster has taken a nightmare,the resurgence of the Third Reich, and made it plausible. He takes the reader right into Hitler's Bunker as the Russians are taking Berlin and aactually engenders empathy for the beleagured Nazis. Hitler has entrusted his and Eva Braun's son, Frederick,to two of his trusted subordinates and wants him taken to safety. Ernst Brunner and Hitler's friend and secretary Greta make a hair-raising trip out of Berlin to South America with the boy. Webster's characterization is so skillfully handled that the reader finds himself rooting forthe trio but, by the end of the novel, ardently hoping for Brunner's defeat. The reader, after the exciting climax, is taken several years into the future and finds out what has become of the characters--to a point. There remains the question of Frederick's future. What will he do next? Webster also retires one of the most likeable sleuths in fiction, Adrian Drum. One can only hope that there willbe a sequel, Adrian will come out of retirement, and there will follow further adventures of Frederick. In addition to being a first-rate story, Blood Son is a pleasure to read in terms of style."},{"Title":"A guide to Immanuel Velikovsky's reconstruction of ancient history: 1550 to 300 BC","review":"This is an excellent introduction to the Ages In Chaos series, it includes a poster showing the revised timeline alongside the conventional chronology.

For anyone who has read Velikovsky's books, you know how difficult it is to correlate the 2 histories. Velikovsky documents everything.

I wish the publisher Pi Rho Press would put it back in print."},{"Title":"Like a Bird in a Cage: The Invasion of Sennacherib in 701 BCE (Library Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies)","review":"Lester L. Grabbe, editor of the volume, writes a well-researched 3-part introduction: Judean archaeological data that's dominated by LMLK jar handle impressions, a contrasting review of 19th/20th-century scholarship covering diverse interpretations of the Biblical accounts & Assyrian inscriptions (especially with regard to whether Sennacherib conducted 1 or 2 campaigns to Judah), & summaries of 9 papers presented at the meeting.Here I would note 1 minor correction to his statement in the \\"Tel Sheva\\" section that no LMLK pots were found there: In Aharoni's 1968 excavation, A.F. Rainey discovered a large 2-handled pithos jar with a LMLK stamp, & this remains a key milestone in the history of LMLK research, as nearly all other LMLK stamps appear on smaller 4-handled vessels. It may also testify to activity at Beersheba during Hezekiah's reign (Rainey & Nadav Na'aman have argued over the implications in other publications).Bob Becking concentrates on chronology. After reviewing Assyrian eponyms along with Babylonian & synchronistic king lists, he utilizes the fragmented Azekah/Letter-to-the-God tablet to propose that Hezekiah's controversial 14th year might correspond with an initial campaign of Sennacherib to Azekah & Jerusalem in 715 BC (while still a prince under Sargon), thus assigning the 2nd Judean campaign by Sennacherib (his 3rd general campaign as king of Assyria in his annals) to Jerusalem in 701 BC (presumably Hezekiah's 28th year of reign). He rejects the traditional 2-campaign theory because it has no independent textual support for a campaign towards the end of Sennacherib's reign, but I'm not aware of any texts naming Sennacherib leading Sargon's troops for him. One other problem beckons those who prefer either of these 2-campaign theories: Lachish. Becking avoids it altogether.Ehud Ben Zvi presents a philosophical fence for limiting interpretations of history, referring to it as the \\"malleability\\" of the narratives. He proceeds to analyze the authors of Kings, Chronicles, & Josephus, stressing that none of them could get away with an \\"anything goes\\" style; they each had recognizable boundaries. It's an interesting point to keep in mind, but his chapter is frustrating to read due to extensive footnote excursions, several of which dwarf his main train of thought on the pages.Philip R. Davies also presents a philosophical discussion, but keeps it lighthearted in a somewhat frivolous manner we would expect from modern journalists reporting on the same event in today's media. For example, he says that \\"for the Assyrians Jerusalem was not particularly important,\\" but is that not sour grapes at their finest? The effort it took to destroy 46 cities & obtain 30 talents of gold (plus miscellaneous expenses totaling several hundred talents) might not mean much to Davies today, but I would argue it must have been a \\"particularly important\\" quantity back then!Next, Grabbe delivers his own paper on the mysterious account by Herodotus. He marvels at the coincidence between this record of mice devastating Sennacherib's weapons in Egypt, & the Biblical record of Sennacherib's army being decimated by an angelic massacre in Judah. To help establish some guidelines for historical legitimacy, he compares this account to other questionable stories: the early reign of Assyrian king Ninus, the rise of Darius over Cambyses, & whether or not Sesotris was one of the pharaohs named Senwosret.Ernst Axel Knauf examines Sennacherib's campaign using the Chicago Prism as a primary source. Reading it as a geographical arrangement rather than chronological, he suggests it may have concluded with some sort of peace conference or indecisive stalemate at Eltekeh where the Egyptian army appeared out of thin air, then withdrew just as magically leaving the Assyrians too tired to finish off Jerusalem. He envisions Sennacherib playing the role of Napoleon, who, as his troops were dying by the dozens in Russia from illnesses, proclaimed, \\"The health of his majesty has never been better.\\" Knauf argues that the Assyrian army was weakened, & Sennacherib must have been quite desperate to participate in the battle. Is Knauf's imagination 2,700 years after the event more credible than the ancient Biblical account?Up to this point, the articles sound mostly balanced between reasonably objective middle-of-the-road scholarship & some with Minimalist inclinations. Niels Peter Lemche enters like a lead weight dropping on the scales asking his audience to \\"disregard 200 years of biblical scholarship & commit it to the dustbin.\\" Please don't let this chapter dissuade you from purchasing the book--it's a classic example of how not to conduct scientific research that everyone can learn from. He calls the Rabshekah incident a \\"narrative ... clearly superfluous\\" on one page, then on the very next page rehearses without hesitation Sennacherib's \\"report\\" (Lemche doesn't miss any subliminal message opportunities) of Hezekiah delivering tribute via envoys after the campaign had ended. Sennacherib apparently took a Judean raincheck on good faith! It's no small wonder Lemche accuses others of inventing history!Returning to objective scholarship, another discrepancy escaped the editor's eyes. When Grabbe gave an overview of Walter Mayer's paper, he mentioned the Assyrians engaging Egyptian forces near Beersheba, yet Mayer's chapter never mentions that site; his Egyptian discussion remains limited to possible encounters at Eltekeh in northwest Judah. Aside from that, Mayer asks many relevant questions, & tackles each one by presenting facts & comparing theories with texts. An appendix to his chapter includes recent transliterations & translations of the 11 most important cuneiform inscriptions attributed to Sennacherib; these, together in the same volume with the king lists presented earlier by Becking, make up for time lost on Lemche's chapter.The only correction I would make to Mayer's paper is on p. 177 when he discusses the capture of Eltekeh & Timnah: \\"Although we cannot be sure of the exact location of these 2 cities...\\" The reader can simply turn to Fig. 1 of Knauf's chapter (p. 143) where Timnah is properly located with respect to Ekron & Beth Shemesh at modern Tel Batash, excavated extensively (but not exhaustively) by a team under the direction of George Kelm & Amihai Mazar from 1977-1989.Nadav Na'aman examines the differences between the places cited in 2 Kings 18:34 & 19:12-13, then suggests that the former was written in the middle of the 7th century, while the latter must have been composed towards the end of the 6th century. While his work is professional, impressive, & thorough, keep your guard up when reading someone with a heavy anti-Bible bias who says, \\"We can safely assume...\\" (p. 212) While the information we have today supports Na'aman's hypothesis, gaps exist--little is known about some of the sites prior to Sennacherib's reign, & even the specific locations of some remain uncertain. Nor does he explain why exiled Jews would take circumstances known about sites conquered by the Babylonians, & apply them to a fictitious speech delivered on behalf of Sennacherib. Why pick sites that contemporaries could use to dispute the narrative? Why not invent sites if the narratives themselves were invented? Could somebody today associate Alaska (a northern state) & Hawaii (a southern state) to Abraham Lincoln's \\"Gettysburg Address\\" to boost its authenticity?Christoph Uehlinger reviews the Lachish reliefs from Sennacherib's palace, including their history of discovery by Layard (with reproductions of some of his original sketches compared to later ones by other artists), & attempts to discredit David Ussishkin's theory that they were sculpted by an eyewitness overlooking the attack from the southwest, the presumed location of the Assyrian camp. Although Uehlinger's discussion is based on the artwork, his chapter is the most verbose--more than twice as long as any other. Whether the artist remained in a single location, or recreated the scene from verbal descriptions, is overshadowed by his more important contribution: the possibility of another fragmented relief that may depict King Hezekiah alone in his citadel of Jerusalem like a bird in a cage (possibly even waving a flag of surrender). That portion begins on p. 293; if you're in a hurry, you can skip pages 221-292 & still get your money's worth!Finally, Grabbe summarizes a discussion among the attendees, where they surprise themselves by agreeing that the Bible contains some reliable history. Imagine that! Even after Lemche assured us we could trash 2 centuries worth of Biblical scholarship! Which is more miraculous: that part of an army might suddenly die of unknown causes after a long trek to a foreign land & fighting numerous battles, or that a collection of books written/edited by multiple authors long after the events transpired would actually contain facts resembling accounts preserved by their enemies?Thomas L. Thompson closes the book with the comment, \\"God gave Hezekiah 15 years of life: this is not history.\\" Since Minimalists prefer archaeological data over narrative texts, they should reevaluate the LMLK handles. From the time when this seminar took place, the statistics now indicate half of them were made prior to Sennacherib's attack, & half soon thereafter. If the attack occurred in Hezekiah's 14th year & they were all made during his 29-year reign, then this datum would appear to support the very text Thompson assures us isn't history (29-14=15, doesn't it?). Furthermore, they stamped only a small portion (10-20%) of the jars. So the purpose of the LMLK jars appears to support the 2 Chronicles narrative of Hezekiah's worship reformation, a source mostly ignored at this seminar.More books like this are needed in a mixed-company, open-ideas format; only it needs to be truly open--this one was obviously not. Hezekiah's revolt is a complicated but crucial subject (considered one of the most important events of human history by Military History Quarterly, spring 1998). In conjunction with the Bible, Grabbe's book will be of tremendous benefit to anyone interested in the subject, student or professor."},{"Title":"Small Farm in Maine","review":"This is one of my favorite books.

I had always thought Button was famous for his spins, but he also introduced many new jumps, including the double salchow, the double loop, the double flip, the double lutz, the double axel, and the difficult triple axel (which some men still have problems performing, including the current world champion).The author spins a sprightly history of ice skating (mainly figure skating), starting with the unfortunate Swiss skater who tumbled through a hole in the ice and drowned some time around 3000 B.C. This accident preserved for posterity the first primitive pair of bone skates ever discovered, although historians believe the people of Finland were actually the first to don skates.\\"Ice Skating\\" is a quick, enjoyable read for those of us who would like to learn more about this graceful sport."},{"Title":"Ice Skating","review":"Is just as informative to adults as adolescents as both an outstanding introduction and detailed insight into figure skating. Gutman has virtually every sentence count and wastes few, if any words, in this succinct book. Touches a little of everything only to fire your interest even more. Probably best for countless engaging facts and trivia. Difficult to imagine another book on skating where you can learn any more in the same number of pages. American translation: Lots of fun to read."},{"Title":"Purr and miew: Kitten stories","review":"This is a children's picture book about cats that live like humans, the main characters are the Purr-Miew family who live in \\"a charming little gray shingle house with a real knocker on the door\\". We received it as a gift from a family member who had loved it as a child in the 1920s.I wasn't willing to read it to my children until they were old enough to understand the racism in the stories. I didn't want them absorbing the messages that the Black-Cat family was poor, spoke in nonstandard English and gratefully received help from the more affluent, capable cats. The kittens from both families play together in several stories and things go well for the most part. At one point the Purr-Miew kittens are lost and all the father cats find them.from page 23\\"Pappy and Mammy Black-Cat, and their two pickaninny kittens, Sambo and Mandy, lived in a shabby little cabin down the road. The cabin was very dilapidated and leaned to one side so far that it looked as if it were going to lie down at any moment. It stood in the center of an unkempt yard that was surrounded by a rickety picket fence.The Black-Cat family was very poor, and kind-hearted Mother Purr-Miew often went down the road to the shabby cabin with a donation of cookies, a cake, a pie, or a pitcher of fresh milk. For these gifts the Black-Cats were very grateful.\\""},{"Title":"The Vanishing Pumpkin","review":"What a sense of fun that pervades this delightful, magical story involving old folks, wizards, ghouls, and one big pumpkin! Written by Tony Johnston and illustrated by the inimitable Tomie dePaola, this is a winning Halloween story.\\"There was a 700-year-old-woman. There was an 800-year-old man. They were rocking by the fire as the sun came up.\\" I know old folks (and I mean old folks in this case) arise early, but I get the impression that these two have been rocking all night. A great start!When the old man compares the great pumpkin that has vanished with the rising sun, the sun becomes a character that follows the couple through the day and their escapades in finding that orange orb. That pumpkin was grown to make a Halloween pie and it must be found!On their quest they meet what are typically scary folk -- a ghoul, a rapscallion picking mushrooms, a varmint just sitting around, and finally a snoozing wizard. By this time the sun has gone down, Halloween is almost over, and the old man has not had his pumpkin pie!How the old man gets his pie (for he does, of course) is part of the silly fun of this book. What piques children's imagination are the repetitive word plays, silly searches, all within the framework of a seemingly scary story. The artwork is an equal partner in --yep, this winner!"},{"Title":"The Vanishing Pumpkin","review":"This is my favorite book to share with young children for Halloween.

This immediately sets the tone for the high level of playful silliness the reader will encounter in the pages within!Our heroes have a problem: their pumpkin, destined to be a pumpkin pie, has gone missing suddenly, and on Halloween, no less! Right then, the search (and the fun!) begins. It's not in the coffeepot. It's not in the bed, it's not anywhere! &quot;Snitched!&quot; cries the old woman. &quot;'Great snakes!' croaked the old man. 'Who would dare snitch a pumpkin from an 800-year old man?'&quot;Who indeed...!! They set off down the road to find the missing pumpkin and run into some wonderfully kooky Halloween characters, including a ghoul in stovepipe hat and button boots, a rapscallion picking mushrooms (he is in a heavy cloak with a hooded mask-- my Star Wars savvy students said he looks like a Jawa), a rat-like yellow varmint and finally a wizard in starred robes, spectacles and pointed shoes. All along the way the old man and the old woman play tricks on these funny folk to try to get them to surrender the pumpkin which, of course, they don't have.The illustrations by Tomie dePaola are wonderfully funny in the way that only Mr. dePaola can make them. Though this is a Halloween story, the illustrations are bright and silly enough to make the story much more funny than frightening. The pace of the text flows quickly but is repetitive enough for young readers to stay hooked by the story.All in all, it's a wonderful book, and you shouldn't wait for Halloween to go out and get a copy of this fun, fantastic tale!"},{"Title":"The Vanishing Pumpkin","review":"This is one of my favorite Halloween read-alouds.

His book provides information on hypertension, its detrimental effects on the body, the typical medical approach - medications with their long list of potential side effects, and how to lower one's blood pressure naturally by eating the right kinds of food, lowering salt intake, increasing exercise, and reducing stress. Frankly, it sounds rational and straightforward, but from personal experience, it requires MAJOR changes in one's lifestyle and tremendous discipline to carry out. I do not mean for the previous statement to be negative in its tone, however, I do want to stress this is a total lifestyle makeover that not everyone will have the motivation to do.The cause of hypertension is generally not known, but Dr. Whitaker believes through his experience and research that blood pressure can be reduced and perhaps normalized through the diet and lifestyle program he presents. His contention is that the typical American diet, high in salt, fat, and sugar, all contribute greatly to the development of hypertension. So one's diet must radically and permanently change to promote a blood vessel healthy environment. He presents the different foods that actually lower blood pressure, and then discusses the role of supplementation, and finally he lists a typical diet. In order for his diet to work, it must be tried at least 4-6 weeks, and then if positive results are seen, the diet must be observed indefinitely. With his heavy emphasis on salt reduction, this means no junk-food chips, salted popcorn, and no salt shaker on the table! He recommends replacing salt with potassium chloride, as salt substitute. Lowering sugar intake means avoiding any high-calorie drink or food, such as soda pop, candy, ice cream, (or anything with high fructose corn syrup in it).Exercise is also stressed. He suggests 30 minutes of low intensity exercise (aerobic) at least 5-6 days a week. This can be as easy as going on a walk, swimming, biking, jogging, etc.Reducing one's reaction to stress provoking situations is also paramount. All of us will have stress, but it is our reaction to it that makes all the difference. He gives protocols for stress relief, and how to better manage our reaction to stress.Published in 2001, the concepts presented are as relevant today as they were 11 years ago. What Dr. Whitaker is recommending is a lifestyle change. If one is motivated enough to change one's lifestyle permanently, then this program may just normalize, or at least reduce one's blood pressure. It is well worth the read, especially the chapter on the detrimental effects of anti-hypertensive medications.kone"},{"Title":"Reversing Hypertension: A Vital New Program to Prevent, Treat, and Reduce High Blood Pressure","review":"Dr. Whitaker explains the Real danger regarding hypertension.

After being prescribed several drugs right away, I began a quest of knowledge on alternative treatments. I found Mr. Whitaker's book the most informative and well documented on research literature. His analysis on the different prescribed drugs and their long term effects was the best I have read.He describes the benefits and failures of these drugs that my own doctors did no inform me with.He describes in length the many factors for hypertension which are easy to read and understand.What I liked also about his book is the multi-step programs that one can follow. The reader can do a number of things that will lower blood pressure.

Came on very rapidly. Father had heart problems at 46 years old. I was a person who was exercising quite regularly (4-5 times per week swimming) It was not changing my blood pressure. My physician prescribed atenolol. First 25 mg then when it didn't work 50 mg. I thought that was that for the rest of my life.I was at the library and I saw this book I was not looking for it. March 8 2003 read it and on March 9 went on the plan. Within three months I was down to 12.5 mg of atenolol. BP hovering around 120 over 75. I lost 25 pounds from 185 to 160 in four months. Waste went from 34 to 32. I weigh five pounds lighter than when I graduated HS. I was not expecting this but it was a great bi-product of the plan.Today January 20, 2004 almost eleven months later I have maintained the same body weight 160. I am off all medicine for three weeks and my Blood Pressure is at 120 over 78. If it goes back up I will go back to the 12.5 mg but my Physician is amazed.My Cholesterol was 212 with Triglycerides of 370 in July. At the end of December cholesterol was down to 173 and trig now 125. My LDL has stayed about the same at 110 which isn't to bad. My HDL is still low at 29. Not sure what I will do about that since I continue to swim 5 times a week anywhere from 6 to 10 miles per week. HDL is a much harder thing to move unfortunately and in my case it is familial as my father still alive at 78 has never been able to get his above 30 (tracked since 1972). He had six bypasses at 62 which is what I hope to avoid.No matter this plan has given me great hope that I can avoid or at least limit the drugs. I feel great physically and I feel good about myself having lost the weight. It can be a tough plan to be on but I consider it to be my lifestyle now. One can still eat an awful lot of good food you just have to know what your eating and really avoid the salt and fat.I think Dr Whitaker should market it as a diet plan as well because from what I can see the diet plans out there nobody can stick to long term. More people should know about this and Doctors should be promoting it. Thank you Dr Whitaker!"},{"Title":"Reversing Hypertension: A Vital New Program to Prevent, Treat, and Reduce High Blood Pressure","review":"Many people have \\"high normal\\" blood pressure and what they hear is only the \\"normal\\" and disregard the high. I am one of those.I had a bad reaction two two blood pressure medications and am tolerating a third. My case is a classic one: high bp has caused an enlargement of my heart and the beginning of cardiac disease. My mother dies of an MI at 61 and my father had his first heart attack at 74. I have no desire to follow in their footsteps.This book makes a strong case for hypertension being a lifestyle disease and accordingly, he prescribes serious lifestyle changes as well as a ton of supplements. Some people will not be amenable to the latter suggestion. Dr. Whitaker allows more fat than Pritikin or Ornish and his food program is a bit more strict than the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). It is a sane and sensible program, but not without the need for some clarifications.He recommends herring and salmon, but most salmon sold today is farm raised and does not have the same nutritional content as wild salmon. Herring is almost impossible to find fresh. The bottled herring is loaded with sugar and/or high fructose corn syrup and salt, making it an inappropriate choice, but Whitaker glosses over this. He says it's okay to have decaf coffee, but decaf coffee has the same amount of trans fatty acids as regaular coffee. How come he doesn't know this?It would have been helpful for him to include a chart showing how many daily calories one needs to maintain a specific weight. This book is an excellent choice for those wanting to try lifestyle changes to bring down their bp without drugs, despite my reservations. I am trying his approach and expect to discontinue my medications (including Lipitor) by the summer."},{"Title":"Reversing Hypertension: A Vital New Program to Prevent, Treat, and Reduce High Blood Pressure","review":"Ever wonder about the mechanics of hypertension - what is it and how is it affecting your body? James Whitaker discusses how someone like me who worked out in the gym 3-4 times a week, has eaten right for years and had normal cholesterol readings could have a stoke. You could have knocked me down with a feather when it happened - and I mean that literally.No one ever told me about aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), Angiotensin II, or Nitric Oxide, or the role the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system(RAAS) played in regulating blood pressure. Seems there are at least two types of hypertension and that stress is a major factor that can affect your body and shorten your life. As I never used Cocaine, that must be the cause of my secondary hypertension and why my physician has prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a BETA blocker. (By the way, you might want to read this book for no other reason than to discover the danger of taking a BETA-Blocker with an anti-diuretic for an extended period.Whitaker lists some controllable risk factors most of us need to know more about including obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes, diet, smoking and drinking. I have never smoked and I don't drink alcohol, and I am using a variant of the DASH diet (also discussed in this book).

I didn't know how to express myself without hinting at them, sorry.There is no torture more harrowing than the psychological torture inflicted upon little girls by each other. What adults see as children playing is, to a young girl, a cruel circle of social politics that, even years later, we as women look back upon with varying amounts of pain. In Cat's Eye, the main character, Elaine describes how her disturbing relationship with her best \\"friends\\" affects her thinking as a mature adult.This is the second Margaret Atwood novel I have read, and like the first one (The Handmaid's Tale), I couldn't put it down. It is not a pleasant novel to read; it left me with a lump in my throat. It brought back the feelings of shame and loss of control I myself had as a 13-year-old; the aching memories of being bullied in the 7th grade, by the girls I now realize were themselves sad and abused.Elaine is not a hero, but a survivor. She does not tell the story with the purpose of being admired (actually, there were times when I wished I could reach into the book and smack her). She is more of a character to be understood and related to. She tells her story in increments, going back and forth between her life as an adult and her life as a child.Cordelia, the ringleader of Elaine's social circle, is also very complicated character. Reading her interactions with Elaine really hit home. It is hard for anyone to read this book and NOT realize that they, too, have either known a Cordelia or been a Cordelia- or both. Elaine's fear of her is palpable and understandable. Yet, in a character that could easily be portrayed as one- dimensional, Atwood has created her in a way that you can see, even through the evil, the pain that lies just beneath Cordelia's exterior. Cordelia gets hers, eventually, but I don't see that as a great victory.I'm not sure whether or not the ending was a happy one. Rather, I think it was more true to life.... the story itself is a series of Elaine's victories and failures. In the end, the overwhelming feeling that I had was of loss, for Elaine and Cordelia's happy end."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Simply put, I worship this book.Cat's Eye follows the controversial painter Elaine as she reflects upon her childhood and younger years when she returns to Toronto (the city of her youth) for a retrospective of her works. Her reflections stir up memories of friendship, longing, betrayal, love, hate, and pain. Especially haunting are her memories of Cordelia, a childhood friend with whom she had a complex relationship. It is a truly brilliant story, so completely well-written and beautiful that I just wanted to read certain sentences over and over again. Her story also rouses intense emotions in the reader, as we can all unearth memories of childhood friendships gone awry, awkward teenage years, and failed love.Elaine finds she needs to mourn her past in order to get through the present. Her past is so achingly realistic and personal, that you can't help but empathize and contemplate your own personal grief. That's not to say the book is fully depressing; instead, I would say that it is haunting. There are certain things to which I can relate at this exact moment in my life, which may have caused the book to have a bigger impact on me than it might for others. Regardless, I think this is another brilliant masterpiece by Atwood and would recommend it to both Atwood fans, and those new to her writing."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This book is so colorful!

I really identified with Elaine on a lot of things, and I am sure many of us knew a Cordelia or two who continue to haunt us."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I am really shocked at the negative responses to this amazing novel of Margeret Atwoods, I would recommend this book to all women. The novel concerns itself with various themes and issues, Abuse, Power, Gender, Forgiveness, Time and Justice to name but a few. It is a tale of a women on a journey of realisation and acceptance as she is forced to face and challenge her repressed memories of insufferable callousness at the hands of her childhood companion. I found it highly inspiring and enjoyable. Not only because it paints a vivid picture of the terrors of childhood but because we follow Elaine Risley on her fight to forgive and forget and in the end she wins. Very inspiring in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"In high school, I remember having to read novel after novel about the popular theme, &quot;growing up.&quot; But every single one of them were about a male. When I finally came across this book, I was so overjoyed that someone had captured one of the female stories! Not to say the book is feminist, or even for females only. But it is filled with the aspects of my young friendships that I have come to associate with females. It is an entertaining, wonderful read that I think all people can enjoy on some level. This is an Atwood classic (and I rate it far above her popular novel, The Handmaid's Tale)."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I loved the story it gave a sincere and tantalizing story of girl growing up. I walked from it believing that I understood myself and the world a little bit better. The other reviews seemed to be disturbed that it wasn't a happy book? It was a real book! It was hard to think of it as fiction. The discriptions of what Elaine saw and painted and felt, had me wanting to paint and look and feel my own life. (I wish I could write a better review but I read the book over a year ago and picked it up again yesterday reading through it and it inspired to write this. The book was capturing me just looking through it.)"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's eye is one finest piece of modern literature have ever written. I read this book for my A'levels exam and found it deals with many complex issues and metaphors of childhood to the real world of career as an artist. The only thing is that the heroin tend to have flashbacks anytime , anywhere in the entire book. It will be a bit confusing for a reader to skip a page or two and continue on to the next chapter."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"When reading the last chapters, I had the feeling that the main character's memories are mine. Not all writers can do this.At the back of the edition I read there was a short interview with the author about the book and she mentioned that reading is second only to experience. I think she really meant it. She gives you experience that only your mind can tell apart from your own.I haven't read a book comparable to &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; since Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or Sylvia Plath's &quot;Bell Jar&quot;."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Not confusing poetry, though. This book isnt cluttered up with too many characters, it's a tale of a woman in search of her friend and is enscribed ever so beautifully. I LOVED IT!! Two Thumbs And Three Toes Up!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Atwood is a beautiful and a capitivating writer. She inspires me to be introspective with my experiences and to realize there importance to my becoming a woman. She can make a metaphor, that is so deep, they sidetrack you for a minute just to feel them. I'm so glad my teacher introduced me to her writing."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I enjoyed reading the first part of this part, about Elaine's childhood--and could very well relate to the cruely and power plays which do occur among young girls in our society. In fact, I found the chapters which returned to the present an interruption because they just seemed to ramble on. In the present, Elaine has returned to Toronto, her hometown, for an art show, and these chapters just go on and on as she wanders around town in a jogging suit--with her whining about her flab and middle age, checking out how the streets and ambiance has changed. One chapter could have sufficed.The second part was rather disjointed and monotonous. Here Elaine is a young adult, and again, the story switches back and forth between that time and the present. It seems like Atwood suddenly felt she was in a hurry to finish this up. We get no feeling as to what went wrong in her marriage, why they were &quot;throwing things&quot; and what really was going on. It seems that she suddenly remembers she has a brother, and needs to do something about him, so she kills him off. It seemed totally contrived. She does the same thing with her parents. She hasn't meantioned them for a few hundred pages, and all of a sudden, they die off too, in a few pages. Her marriage to her second husband, and birth of a second child is covered in half a page. We get no feel as to how she evolved into this whining, depressing creature who's now wandering the streets of Toronto, moaning about her friendship to Cordelia.Cordelia is another issue. Right at the beginning, it's hinted that there's something really exciting with this Cordelia issue, that some juicy issues are going to be uncovered. But after her initial torment, at age 9 or 10,there's nothing more to it. She becomes friends with her again in high school, Cordelia no longer has power over her. She runs into her once or twice after high school, and that's it. I was waiting for something more, why this obsession with her, but nothing. I gave this book 2 stars because I liked the first part about her childhood and some of her writing is very good, but all in all, a very depressing book that promises something but doesn't deliver. No plot, no &quot;message&quot; nothing to learn from it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This book was my first introduction to Margaret Atwood and I started out in true awe of her writing power, especially her incredible inclusion of smell and senses.This novel, which reads like a memoir, is about an artist returning to her hometown of Toronto for an exhibition, where she is haunted by memories of her childhood friend Cordelia. The first part of the book, which relates her childhood, is vivid, moving and powerful. It created a tension that kept me turning the pages.But as the main character moved into adulthood, I felt the string holding the story together weaken. I kept waiting for something I felt had been foreshadowed earlier, but it didn't come. Readers don't get to know the adult Elaine with the same intimacy as they know the child. When pieces were left unresolved, I wondered why I had spent so much time reading about her adult life when the core of the book was concentrated in the first half.I was intrigued enough by Atwood's style to try out some more of her work. This book is a good read, especially in the first half, but the second half was a letdown for this reader."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"With Cat's Eye, Margaret Atwood handles deftly two complex situations--the relationships women have with each other, and the cyclical nature of abuse. Often in literature it seems as though women are only affected by their relationships with the men in their lives: fathers, brothers, lovers. Atwood vividly shows that a young girl can be profoundly affected by the friendships she forms with other girls. Elaine is changed and wounded deeply by her relationship with Cordelia; and also haunted by it. But Atwood offers no easy answers; Cordelia has also been wounded. As is the case with a lot of Atwood's work, this book is thick with descriptions of the smells and colors of food and furniture. This only pulls the reader more deeply into Elaine's world. Like a later book of Atwood's, The Robber Bride, (another book about the relationships among women), Cat's Eye is at times bleak, but never hopeless. Atwood looks at the reader straight in the eye, and doesn't flinch."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"When push came to shove, Elaine shoved back at Cordelia the destructive projections that nearly klled her, and became the survivor of the headgame. Though they continually tussled over the next thirty-something years, out of each others' sight but earily never out of mind, Elaine again emerged the winner. I cheered for her each time she drew ahead, and glowed with approval as she leveled the playing field with her caution, compassion and forgiveness for Cordelia. What a friend she would have been to her tragically named counterpart, had Cordelia survived, and what grief Elaine bore at the realization that in some life battles there can be only one survivor. I myself am involved in religious education, and stumbled onto Atwood's book because of its frequent and affectionate mention in Sally Cunneen's book, In Search of Mary--the Woman and the Symbol (1996). Atwood shows that the idea of Mary as a saving mother figure is universally understood and embraced, especially so in the artistic world in which there are no limits to presentations or appellations of her. In Elaine's world, at the juncture when she rejects and is rejected by Grace's (another ironic name chice)family's reactionary style of Anglicanism, her enemy's enemy truly becomes her best friend, and so evolves her receptivity to Cathoic myth and symbol, Mary. Naturally Mary's antithesis is Mrs. Smeath; and I cheered for Elaine as she had her say through her art. I loved Elaine's wonderfully sensitive mother, and her quirky intellectual family, who without religion had acheived an inborn faith. I must confess I know nothing of marbles; so the title Cat's Eye spoke to me instead of an instictive, survivor's gift of night-sight, maybe even ancient Egptian astrologer's wisdom. In the cover picture, the robed figure is not simply holding the eye (truth), but seems in the act of placing it into our hands, our possession. Yes, Elaine had to realize the truth that she was not dysfunctional, only weak and naive, and like the elevated eye, needed to see the whole landscape of her life. What an excelent job Atwood did of illustrating a confused, criticized girl's capability for self-mutilation, a survivor's guilt becoming self-destructve. I would like Elaine to have shared more of her puberty experience and how it was handled in her family, and more about her first feelings of desire, as these were not mentioned. I agree, Amykrug, that ths is an anti-Yaya book, and was thinking that same thought as I read. Let every parent who reads this keep a cat's eye on their daughter and her friends! Lastly, I am impressed by the large number of reviews from far-off places like Malaysia, Argentina, I would like to have read more from the reader from Pakistan. (Please someone tell me what level A exams are)."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I've read all of Margaret Atwood's books, except Alias Grace. I read my sister's copy of Cat's Eye when if first came out and remember thinking: &quot;hmmm, kind of a rehash of themes from earlier books,&quot; specifically Lady Oracle, in which menacing ravines also figure. It seemed a so-so, traditional effort after the more obviously audacious Handmaid's Tale.Recently, however, after 9/11, i went through a phase where I couldn't read, couldn't find a book that could hold my attention, lead me into its world, make me care.Came upon Cat's Eye in a thrift store. Revelation: how much stronger and sure-stepped it seems to me the second time. Atwood's expert handling of the slow power shift between Elaine and Cordelia affected me more deeply this time, perhaps because I've lived longer now and have seen strong friends falter and others, once dismissed as &quot;quiet,&quot; emerge as the real, fierce talents.Don't hesitate. Read it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye / 0-385-49102-6I've read that \\"Cat's Eye\\" is supposed to be Atwood's most autobiographical novel, and it certainly shows. The book is a long one - well over 400 pages - but it flies by quickly. Atwood lingers over lavish descriptions of childhood loneliness and the cruelties which are so often inflicted by children; for readers whose childhood was characterized by a loving home but with unbearable peers, this book will strike a deep chord.As a child, Elaine is constantly berated by her companions. She frequently feels unhappy and yet is unaware of her unhappiness, unable to process the fact that her \\"friends\\" are not friendly to her at all. She develops body dismorphic disorder: chewing her fingers, peeling off the skin from her feet, and developing a small appetite and an inability to keep her food down. Her mother recognizes that her child is unhappy, but feels powerless to confront the underlying problem, and once the damage is done and internalized, Elaine's problems seem destined to remain with her into adulthood.Internalized feelings of self-hate and depression are difficult to exorcise, and even as an adult, Elaine remains conflicted over the years with regards to her rights, her worth, and her defects. Her relationships with men are strained and difficult; her timid approach to feminism is stymied from her fear that she hasn't \\"suffered enough\\" to be included in the ranks. Even her own paintings - hailed as incredible feminist icons - plague her with guilt and doubt.\\"Cat's Eye\\" is a wonderful treatise on the nature of guilt and childhood anguish, and how the scars obtained in childhood can stay with a person forever. No answers are offered, just a mirror to reflect the reader's own doubts back at them.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I read this book every few years because it's a multi-sense experience - I swear, you will smell and taste and feel and BE with the characters of this book. More than anything, it's the strength of Atwood's words that keep pulling me back to this book. Margaret Atwood is a master at manifesting imagery from words. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, slow read that's to be savored like dark chocolate."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I picked up Cat's Eye because I was so consumed by the characterization in The Robber Bride. Imagine a novel which could transport me beyond my strong emotions for the characters in The Robber Bride. Our heroine, Elaine, was a drifter in early elementary school, until she become involved in a clique of girls lead by Cordelia. The pain Cordelia inflicts on the young Elaine is insufferable (but Elaine desperately wanted her approval), and in many ways, it will remind most readers of at least portions of their school-years experiences.The story of Cat's Eye is told in the present tense, when Elaine is a successful artist, and the school-year times with Cordelia are told as flashbacks. This helps the reader, because they know that Elaine survived the torment to make something of her life. Personally, I adore Elaine as an icon, because she sees her works as pieces of art, not as the feminist icons that her fans want to define her by. I wonder how much of Elaine's sentiment about being a reluctant feminist icon reflects Atwood's true feelings about how her literary works are interpreted.Overall, this is a brilliant literary masterpiece, especially for any woman who experienced elementary and junior high school at the hands of a clique of girls. Highly recommended-this is powerful stuff."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is the third book of Margaret Atwood's that I have read, and I must admit I do find her books pretty heavy going, although I enjoyed The Blind Assasin. There is a lesson here for all parents that children should have the company of other small children at an early age, play schools should be an integral part of a young childs upbringing. Bullying is taking it's toll both in the USA and the UK, and I do feel that children that have mixed with their peers at a young age, find their own circle of friends and and can mix far easier Here is a child that has led a relatively sheltered life with her brother as her only companion and desperately needs friends. The problem is that she hasn't the life skills to deal with a bad situation. Sadly, after the initial sympathy I felt for her as a young child, I was left wondering over her actions and sentiments when she reached middle age. I certainly didn't read strength in her character as she was unable to forget the past and forgive Cornelia, when she was needed. At the same time, even at the end of the story, she missed her. I also thought that she used her first Husband and felt no guilt or remorse over her actions, which seemed surprising. I found it difficult to relate to this character, as like others, I found that as an adult she was selfish, rude and rather pathetic. I couldn't see the strength in her character as an adult, as did other Readers."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye deals with the unconfortable subjet of childhood bullying, and the psychological wounds that it inflicts on later stages of life. The novel's main character Elaine, is a conflicted and insecure painter whose friendship with Cordelia has marked her through childhood, adolescense and adulthood. Atwood explores complex childhood issues like the difference between boys' and girls' play and the effects of having a brother, and of course, the bullying itself. This part of the novel is extremely interesting, and the writing of course, sublime. Later on we see how Elaine grows, and we see how underneath the sharp-witted girl there is the childhood angst, still there.What can I say about the writing? Beautiful, poetic, sharp, Atwood proves once again she is the master of imagery. Another gem is the description of Elaine's paintings, with great symbolism. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"protagonist while listening to the adult conversation about the breeding modifications done to the turkey for improved taste and ease of containment realises she is &quot;eating lost flight.&quot;"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I feel old knowing that Cat's Eye is required reading for high school students and a bit jealous. This is my favorite novel. What cinches it for me is not the story &quot;line,&quot; but the careful choice of words, and use of metaphor. Few get it so right. I am pleased as punch over and over reading what comes forth from Margaret Atwood's deft brain. Example: During one Thanksgiving dinner the young Elaine is watching and listening to an adult conversation concerning the turkey's ability to fly having been bred out of it's body in favour of easier containment issues and larger, jucier portions of meat. It occurs to Elaine that she is &quot;eating lost flight.&quot; If that kind of realization doesn't appeal to you, as metaphor, you might not like this novel."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"From the very start of the novel, I couldn't take my eyes off it. It is a psychological tale, but also talks about feminism and many other things. What impressed me most was the way in which Atwood describes Elaine's feelings, like if it was herself. It really is a good book, and -I'm not exaggerating- it makes the reader realise some important things about life. Besides, it goes deep into human feelings. It's worth reading."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Anyone who was once a child should be able to relate to this book at some level. It brought memories back to me that I had long since forgotten about how cruel other little girls can be, but also the lasting impact childhood friends can have on your life. Atwood's beautiful style of prose worked well to evoke an even greater sense of understanding. It was as if the book was autobiographical on some level, as she captured the feelings of the young Elaine so well, I found myself relating to them to a great extent. You wonder if Atwood has in fact experienced this lonliness and feelings of inadequacy, brought on by groups of childhood tormentors. This book is also a great work of prose; as usual, Atwood writes with a great lyricism, that verges on poetry at points. Like &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; it is also a very feminine novel, which deals with female issues without being &quot;anti-man&quot;. I was very moved by this book, and I would reccomend it to anyone who has experienced love/hate relationships, whether as a child or during adult life."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"&quot;Cat's Eye&quot; was a good example of the cruelties that little girls face during their childhood. Elaine, the main character, goes through the first eight years of her life acting like a boy, because she has a brother, and that is the only way she knows how to act. When her parents move to Toronto, she is faced with having to make friends that are girls. Elaine finds some cruel friends that criticize her every move. She is punished in obscene ways like being put down in a hole in the ground and covered with dirt for hours. Her &quot;friends&quot; make Elaine feel that they are &quot;helping&quot; her, and that it is a little girl's game that adults don't know about. When Elaine finds out that the adults were ok with it, she learns to hate. While playing a game of marble's, Elaine wins a cat's eye marble and she honestly believes that it will keep her safe from the girls. As you read the book, you will see how the girls in her childhood affected how she lived the rest of her life. The book was a little confusing, and hard to follow, since Atwood goes back and forth between the past and the present. Overall I would say that &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; isn't a GREAT book, but it isn't bad either."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye gives a clear, if maybe exaggerated, picture of childhood cruelties and the marks they leave. The most interesting part Atwood conveys is the residue in the adult artist Elaine Risely. The scars we cover up that then have the power to affect us, years later. It will resonate with anyone who has tried to go home again. I read this book the same week I saw a childhood friend from years ago and didn't see the friend who had been the third of our trio. It was the best imaginable timing. It's a very complex study of emotional life, and in some ways very brilliant, although the scenes from childhood are excessive and long-winded. Skim a bit, but read it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I gave it a fair shot, but it never really grabbed my interest.

There really wasn't anything that I didn't enjoy about the book, but personally it was a book that I could put down. I'd pick it up after a few days of course, but it wasn't very captivating.One notible feature to the book was her writing technique. Atwood's writing style confronts issues in a sarcastic tone yet with good humor and wit. Though I say 'sarcastic' that doesn't mean that it is cynical and &quot;mean.&quot; I truly suggest reading any of Atwood's works for the sole purpose of getting aquainted wit her writing style. ! Atwood stands out amongst women writers for having a unique writing style. !Though I really don't have anything in specific to say about this book I can say that if you are a hardcore fan of Atwood then I highly recommend that you pick this up. Otherwise, you may want to try reading the Handmaid's Tale instead because I personally find it a tad more enthralling. peace out."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I first read Cat's Eye about four years ago. I loved it then, which was why I picked it up again when I had to write a major paper. The second time around, the book seemed pretentious, and self-indulgent. The character of Elaine, who had seemed so strong the first time I read it was reduced to a one-dimensional weakling.There are always bright spots, however, when reading Margaret Atwood. One of these is her poetic style. (I hate her poetry, but the translation of that same style in her prose is more enjoyable).I wish that I hadn't read Cat's Eye a second time. My opion of Ms. Atwood and her work would have remained more complimentary. I would recommend Cat's Eye to adolescents around the age of sixteen or to those readers who are not looking to read with a critical eye.My suggestions, if you are looking for a novel by Margaret Atwood, are The Handmaid's Tale and Alias Grace -- both better expressions of her talent."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye is a wonderful novel that really shows the harsh world that children live in, influenced by their peers. Atwood does a wonderful job creating for the readers Elaine's strange and lonely world. Her descriptions of Cordelia's cruelty makes one want to cry, and one can really relate to Elaine's suffering and pain. It is obvious that this book is written in autobiographical style, which only strenghtens the novel by bringing it to reality. I think that Atwood's descriptive and heartwrenching writing is fantastic, and Iwould recommend this novel to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I read this book for my A- level course and i enjoyed it. Atwood is a very talented writer and this book is evidence. But i can honestly say that i don't sympathise with Elaine. Cordelia seems to give a reason as to why she bullied Elaine (not that that means she should have) but Elaine had no reason to bully Cordelia herself. She took advantage of Cordelia's deterioration .Everything is in her mind...... and she is a psyco. But the book is very interesting and i don't regret reading it"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"In this rich, nostalgic, yet deeply disturbing novel, Atwood touches upon the special moments and inevitable cruelties that are part of childhood friendships. I was fascinated by the character of Cordelia, Elaine's childhood friend. However, I was distressed to find that, somewhere in the middle of the book, I lost track of Cordelia and her influence on Elaine's life. This made the last half of the book anticlimatic for me because I didn't find the other characters half as interesting as Cordelia.I'm still not sure that I like Atwood's method of storytelling in which she relates the very dramatic parts of her novel in the same even tone as the most mundane event. It's an interesting writing technique, but I don't think it's for me."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I was introduced to this book through my High School novels teacher. We read this as a class and yes, males, also read it. I didn't say they enjoyed it, but I think it made them open ther eyes a little wider.I do have to say that this was the best book I've ever read. I absolutley fell in love with and read it so fast, this is because it reads fast, but I also couldn't put it down. When I finished it I felt like Elaine was my friend and now that the book was over I had lost her forever. So I re-read the book.The second time was even better!

I wish that there were more writers out there with her poetic ability. There is just something about the poetry that catches you as soon as you read the title then your in for good."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I know a book is brilliant when I finish it and feel depressed. A few days after finishing Cat's Eye, I was missing Elaine &amp; Cordiela. They are the kind of characters you think you know (or have known) in real life; they feel like friends or memories from childhood. Atwood has that gift -- she pulls you in. It's a wonderful story of a life that could be mine, yours, or the artist showing in the gallery across the street's. It's a book that proves how being a little girl isn't all Barbie Dolls &amp; sunshine. It sucks regardless if you were a tormented Elaine or vendictive Cordelia. Reading this is like reliving it without the pain."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood once wrote, &quot;Sisterhood is powerful; women are always supposed to get along with each other. It's not true any more than it is for men.&quot; Cat's Eye is basically about jealousy and cruelty between girls, as remembered by Elaine, now an adult, who has returned to her hometown to visit. As Elaine is walking through the city, she remembers scenes that are each centered on a specific theme. Some of these topics include victimization, cultural dislocation, power struggles and violence against females. Atwood's main theme explores how girls can be fiercely competitive and very cruel. Atwood makes it clear that girls are not made of &quot;sugar and spice and everything nice&quot;. In one scene, Cordelia, the leader of the group of girls who torment Elaine, throws Elaine's hat into an icy cold stream and orders her to fetch it, and in turn, almost kills her. In the end, Elaine rises above her tormentors and becomes more socially acceptable than her so-called friends. During her high school years, Cordelia actually tries to befriend her, but Elaine holds control over her now. The last half of the book is then devoted to her life beyond her cruel friends, and also to her guilt for not helping Cordelia. Although this may seem like a fun and exciting plot to some, the intense descriptive language is actually somewhat disturbing. Atwood vividly describes incidences such as Elaine peeling layers of skin off her feet and also how she feels while having sex. I gave it three stars because although Cat's Eye is very long and disturbing, I thought that Atwood incorporated some surprisingly true statements that I had never thought of before. I was surprised at how much I related to some of these statements, like pain keeping people in reality. Cat's Eye is very lengthy and at times monotonous, but I actually like it now that I've finished reading it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This book aroused in me an intense feeling of boredom. It's as boring as the city it's set in. Perhaps the dullest bildungsroman I've ever read. Finished it out of respect for the person who recommended it, but wow, what a slog.

Thanks!!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"\\"Cat's Eye\\" by Margaret Atwood is about Elaine Risley who is an aging artist, and, similar to \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany,\\" takes place when she is older and describes her childhood and experiences with a small group of girls, mainly focusing on the \\"friend\\" Cordelia.Elaine grew up in a less than conventional way, with a father who studied bugs and would have the family on the road often. Elaine finally was able to make friends (besides with her older brother, Stephen) when she was eight years old and moved to Toronto. The group of girls she became friends with, led by Cordelia, began to bully Elaine. Elaine was a pushover but did eventually gain some guts. I'll leave it at that since I don't want to give too much away.Another similarity to \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" occurs when Elaine experiences a near-death experience and is rescued by, who she perceives is the Virgin Mary. In general, \\"Cat's Eye\\" stays farther away from religious topics than \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany.\\"As Elaine grows up, she becomes a stronger individual and we learn about her love life, her children, and her moderately successful career as a painter.This could probably be a mini spoiler alert, so don't finish this paragraph if you want to read the book yourself! I really did enjoy following Elaine's journey through her life, and with her relationships with her family, boyfriend, husband, and on to being a painter. However, I don't really understand the ending. Maybe I'm missing something, but to me, it was a well-written, interesting story about Elaine's trip to Toronto, while in the midst of this Toronto trip, she explains about her childhood. The book begins with her trip to Toronto and ends with her plane ride home.Usually I would not recommend a book where I didn't like the ending, or where I thought the ending was lackluster. But I honestly did enjoy the book, just was unsatisfied with the ending."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood has definitely written a book that will not soon be forgotten. Elaine, the main character, begins her life traveling in the back of a car, and living in remote Canadian locations while her father researches rare insects. She does not have meaningful interactions with others, besides her mother, father, and brother until she is approximately 9 years old. At that time, her family moves to Toronto and moves into her first permanent residence. She enters a school and befriends a few girls her age. Elaine's relationships with those girls appear ordinary and do not become extraordinary until a girl, Cordelia, joins Elaine at school. Cordelia teases, ridicules, and torments Elaine for numerous years until Elaine faces a near-death experience. From then on, Elaine manages restore confidence in herself and move away from Cordelia's influence. While the two girls resume their friendship in high school, the dynamic of their childhood friendship never returns and the balance of power even shifts, over time, so that it favors Elaine.Despite Elaine's success in art and love, she has never come to terms with her relationship with Cordelia. \\"Cat's Eye\\" follows Elaine's search for Cordelia and the path that Elaine follows as she tries to understand their \\"friendship.\\"Elaine herself is a dark character, as she tends to have a solemn outlook on life and never seems to display happiness. Her pensive nature leads to interesting observations on the meaning of her art and how the avant garde work resulted from her early childhood experiences. Elaine's reflections also allow the reader to follow the interactions between Elaine's parents, brother, and herself; her introduction to religion; her first experiences with art; and her experiences with the opposite sex. While this book isn't easy to read, as Atwood writes in great detail and the pace of the book moves slowly, Elaine's reflections are interesting and the way she overcomes Cordelia's evil spell leads one to believe that good can prevail over evil."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Elaine prefers to be called a painter rather than an artist and is in Toronto for a retrospective of her work. This novel is a retrospective of her life, which was happy until her family moved there while she and her brother Stephen were children. Her parents are a bit nebulous and beyond eccentric. Her father is an entomologist who settles his family in Toronto when he takes a college teaching job. After a nomadic life in motels and campgrounds prior to that point, Elaine is not equipped for girl stuff and pays a very high price for acceptance by her so-called friends, led by the enigmatic Cordelia. (Mean Girls would be an appropriate title for this book.) We know from the beginning that Elaine will make it to adulthood, but it's touch and go for a while, and I kept wondering what pivotal event was going to turn the tide for her. There certainly is one, and although she struggles out of more than one destructive relationship, she never comes across as really triumphant or even very confident, despite her success. This is due largely to unfinished business with Cordelia, and Atwood seems to make the point that sometimes resolution has to come from the peace we make with ourselves."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"On the eve of her first retrospective gallery showing, painter Elaine Risley reflects back on her life and the troubled relationship with her childhood friends which created the woman and artist she is now. I have yet to dislike an Atwood novel and that, combined with the fact that I've loved many, is why I so often pick up her work. But between plenty to love and nothing to dislike there's still a gray area for novels I find readable, strong, but not personally as appealing or successful as the rest, and Cat's Eye is one of these. As with most Atwood novels, it's as much a feminist story as it is a personal one, but it isn't strictly a story of men's effect on women--rather, it's about sexism and gender roles in society, and how it effects women and relationships between women. However transparent the focus on these issues, they retain ambiguity and Atwood withholds personal judgement, and so the text never becomes preachy; this somewhat rare, complex, but perhaps familiar view is refreshing and rewarding. Balancing out its broadness is the specific, personal detail of Elaine's life, primarily her childhood and its lingering effects, but covering her entire life and the growth of her art. It's Elaine's art which unites the book: although perhaps artificially reflective of the figures and issues which have impacted her, its rich personal symbolism is not only fascinating, it ties together the book's two aspects and leads to a satisfying, heartfelt conclusion.And yet--while I preferred and enjoyed this take on a feminist history, while I found Elaine's story empathetic and painfully real, and while, as always, Atwood's prose is fluid, wry, and intensely readable--Cat's Eye never quite swept me off my feet. It may be that the book runs long: it's a feminist history, a personal history, near entire and often in great detail, and while it never drags it fails to be tight, sharp, or remotely consise. It may be that the relationship between social history and personal history is more visibility delineated here than it is in some of Atwood's other novels, without being as successful or iconic as something like the blatantly feminist The Handmaid's Tale, and the effect is somewhat artless. Of course, it may just be an issue of personal taste. Whatever the reason, it made Cat's Eye a book I was glad to read but not one that I will need to revisit nor one I love, and that's perfectly fine. There are other books out there for me; meanwhile, I give this one a moderate recommendation."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"The Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood is one of those books that really draws you in. Her description of Elaine's childhood paints a vivid experience for the reader.At times almost disturbing, the story of her childhood memories and journey to overcome them was great. I am not a huge suspense type fan, for a book to keep me engaged through to the end is an accomplishment in and of itself. @herbookreviews"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Some discerning readers spotted that the second half of the book does not live up to the expectations set in the first half. I agree. The first half was captivating. I applaud the author's insight into a vast array of human emotions and her talent for putting these into words, which she manages to do in all her books I've read so far. She has a very 'realist' way of writing, delving into the nooks and cranny that make people tick, pretty much a psychoanalysis, which showcases excellently in Cat's Eye where she gets under the skin of characters from a range of ages. The second half of the book however is riddled with trivial and uninteresting details, and the plot is somewhat gratuitous, such as the affair with her art teacher, the casual fling with her ex-husband, her's brother's death - adding little value to the underlying theme, as if she had lost the plot of the novel herself, and was just writing to fill the pages. We lose sympathy and empathy for Elaine's plight (the lead character) and the connection between us and her emotional state becomes muddled. This part of the story reads like a diary, tracking her past and present until the two periods inevitably meet. It's a fast read so probably worth reading if only for the first half."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Elaine, a painter rapidly approaching old age, has returned to her hometown of Toronto for a retrospective of her work. While there, wandering the familiar streets from her childhood, she flashes back to a time when she was nine years old, tormented constantly by her three best friends, almost to the point of death. With enough time to think about her past, she comes to see what happened to her, and why, how she managed to block out her horror for so many years, and how her experiences came through in her painting.This book was fantastic. It perfectly captured the terror of a girl being bullied by those she considers friends, and the helplessness of not being able to ask anyone for help.I loved the way the narrator of this story started at the two ends of her life, first explaining where she was in the present and the earliest parts of her life, while slowly bringing these two ends closer and closer together, working both backward from her adult life and forward through her childhood in order to eventually give a clear picture of her whole lifelong experience.I also loved the atmosphere of dread in every part of this story, the sinister undertone of nearly everything the narrator lived through in her childhood, and how clear the meanings of her paintings are when you understand her background.Every aspect of this book was well crafted and fascinating, and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"\\"If I were to see Cordelia again, what would I tell her about myself?

First and foremost, Margaret Atwood is an incredible writer. Her deft handling of and the richness found in her descriptions and narrative is exquisite. Cat's Eye is more than a novel about girl bullies - it transcends that simple description. It is about Elaine, an adult woman, taking an introspective look at her life and the impact her childhood played in her development as well as her feelings of inadequacy and loneliness. But Cat's Eye also covers these same feelings as experienced by Elaine as an adult. Cat's Eye is still one of my favorites. Very Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye explores the girlhood experiences of artist Elaine Risley as she negotiates her relationship with Cordelia, a mean girl who bullies her relentlessly through emotional manipulation. There have been many nonfiction books written on the topic of girl aggression in recent years, Mean Girls and Odd Girl Out come to mind, but Atwood's novel gives a gut-wrenching insight into the victim's frame of mind, while still managing to suggest the pressures that may motivate the aggressor. The protagonist never really \\"gets over\\" the damage done to her psyche by her tormentor, and her scars color all her subsequent relationships as well as her idea of herself.The novel has that characteristic Atwood voice that echoes with understatement and deadpan delivery across a chasm of emotional turmoil, never actually getting drawn into it, but suggesting it nevertheless. While this is not my favorite Atwood novel, its characters and situations are memorable and its subject matter is, sadly, not at all dated."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Like many readers, my first experience with Margaret Atwood was The Handmaid's Tale, and she has been one of my favorite authors ever since. Perhaps one of her greatest strengths is her ability to handle different styles with equal skill and grace, from the apocalyptic visions of Oryx & Crake to the layered intricacies of The Blind Assassin. The word \\"haunting\\" is often applied to her writing, and rightly so; Atwood's tales resonate with deeply real and intimate characters, and Cat's Eye is no exception. In Cat's Eye, Elaine Risley, a middle-aged painter who grew up in post-WWII Toronto, has returned to her childhood city for a retrospective gallery showing of her work. Like many of Atwood's novels, Cat's Eye shifts between the past and the present, alternating between the modern reflections of the aging artist and her childhood memories.Like The Robber Bride, Atwood explores the nature of female friendship, but with more sinister themes. In Cat's Eye the childhood antagonist is Cordelia, the ruthless ringleader of Elaine's small group of friends who Elaine fears but is unable to escape. Cordelia's treatment goes beyond simple playground bullying, but is rather a cunning and manipulative psychological abuse that begins to take its toll on the young Elaine. As she grows up in a state of perpetual anxiety and self-deprecation, she eventually comes to confront her relationship with Cordelia. In the process, however, Elaine loses a part of herself to that very same domineering behavior. As the power dynamics between Elaine and Cordelia shift as they stumble towards adulthood, it becomes clear that though the new Elaine is stronger on the surface, she is perpetually unable to escape the old fears and vulnerabilities of the past. As the older Elaine grapples with the clinging threads of her past, she is forced to come to terms with her identity as a woman, a daughter, and an artist.Throughout the novel, Atwood utilizes Elaine's background as a painter not as a character device, but as a way of exploring the adult's processing of her childhood experiences. The paintings are described in detail, but still allowing the reader the liberty of understanding the artist through the art. Atwood's rendering of post-war Toronto is accessible and vivid, and her treatment of the middle-aged Elaine is equally approachable and intimate (for this 25-year-old reader). The writing is lucid and evocative, the imagery understated and lasting. Cat's Eye is more subtle than some of Atwood's other works, but is equally powerful, heartbreaking, and memorable.~ Jacquelyn Gill"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Being male, I found that reading this book along with my female friend helped me to appreciate it more than I would have on my own.

Y'see, the first time I saw this book, I had already read &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;, which was slightly science-fictional (only slightly so) and to see this book, with the definitely science-fictional picture of a cloaked woman hovering over a bridge, flanked by bare trees, holding what seems to be a swirling ball of clouds. Mystical, fantastical, even. Alas, the book was about as realistic as they come and you know what . . . it rules (if such a term can be used for a book such as this). I wasn't sure what I would think about this, but I sure as heck enjoyed it and finished it even faster than I thought I would. Basically this book is about Elaine, a painter (hence the cover, it's one of her paintings, natch) who is back in Toronto for a retrospective of her work. Being back in the city of her youth dredges up a bunch of memories, most of them utterly unpleasant and most of them centering around a schoolfriend named Cordelia, a girl entirely difficult to classify. Elaine has grown up with her family, who aren't traditional folks and hanging around Cordelia and her two other friends enters her into a petty petty world of &quot;improving yourself&quot; and jealousy and mostly either making yourself feel miserable or having your friends do it for you. Or making others miserable. Some of the stuff that Cordelia masterminds, the subtle psychological manipulations, are downright disturbings and while this isn't a gory or even very intense book (it's a bit too distant for that), it's not for the faint of heart, or for those who don't wish to relive your childhood years. The plot weaves back and forth from her strolls around present day (for 1989) Toronto and her life before that, with the constant hellos and goodbyes of life. But it always comes back to Cordelia and Elaine has a fixation on the woman centering on obsession, looking for her around every corner, the woman never lurking too far from her thoughts. Will she run into her old friend? I'm not telling. But Elaine's life is meticulously detailed and her observations are cool and sometimes numb but always poetic, Atwood's writing has rarely been this beautiful, almost every page has an absolutely crystal clear description or poetic phrase. Elaine's life is moving and about as real as they come and while the book is more episodic in nature than plot driven, that's what you'd expect from a book like this. My only complaint is that it's a bit too distant and detached, but I have that gripe with most of Atwood's books, most of her narrators are that way, when she does it right, like here, it comes across as soaring and passionate, if she does it wrong, then it comes across more like dry analysis. Here her prose soars and her observations of women and the human condition are spot on. Not for everyone, grantd, but definitely one of the best books I've read in a long while, don't think of this as &quot;woman's literature&quot;, regardless of your gender, pick it up and give it a shot. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Being male, I found that reading this book along with my female friend helped me to appreciate it more than I would have on my own.

It follows Elaine through a series of events that form her into a painter, and an adult. It isn't a light read, and it definitely isn't a happy one, but the complexity of it creates a map of pain, bitterness, and self-awareness that reverberates through every page.I love the time-line shifts and the individuality of the narrator. She's so alone through the entire novel; her thoughts almost become your thoughts as you read her path through life.The typical relationships that most authors would develop through a novel don't really appear here. Atwood really focuses on the meat of relationships, the actual formation of adults through interaction rather than the interaction itself. It points out feelings in response to events rather than events themselves: the reaction to a mean and spiteful little girl who breaks down another's self-esteem, a daughter's response to the mother who watches the daughter becomes a stranger, the memories of a lover who matters at the time of love, but who fades to black when the curtain is closed.Atwood really has a gift for allowing a reader to see through another's eyes, and shows what real life is really about. There is sex, love and friendship, which we humans thrive on, but Atwood has really made a name for herself delving deeper into what makes a real person tick, she sees the truth: There is no happily ever after.With her barely there humor and her dark sense of life, the irony in most Margaret Atwood novels is like nothing else out there right now. I have probably 90% of her work and she really has gotten better with age. It's interesting to me how her work has evolved through the past few decades. This is my favorite piece. I would recommend this to anyone who is fiercely intelligent and enjoys something interesting rather that sweet. There is truth here, nothing is sugar coated. If fairies and bunnies are your things, I would steer clear from this one."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Sort of an anti-&quot;Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot;, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; is the sometimes brutal, sometimes comical, and always truthful story of the nature of female friendships. While Cordelia et al are a bit extreme in their cruelty, most women can pinpoint at least one comparable &quot;friend&quot; in their growing-up years. And unfortunately, those are the expreriences that most shape adulthood.Atwood again uses her unique blend of humor and emotion to craft a gripping novel. Except for some problems relating the adult Elaine to the child Elaine, the characters are real and engrossing. In addition to the surface story and its exploration of friendship, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; provides an interesting commentary on feminism as both a movement and a lifestyle.One of my favorite Atwood novels - highly recommended for any fan of good fiction."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood's \\"Cat's Eye\\" is a fascinating and immensely detailed work that deals with the interaction between adulthood and childhood, as well as the relationship between art, artists, and interpretation. The symbolic connections within the book are staggering, and unless it is read within a fairly short period, the reader is likely to forget some of the important symbols and miss key insights into Elaine's relationship with her childhood foil Cordelia.That said, this book is not without flaws. Like Ondaatje, Atwood suffers from a serious case of smug narrator syndrome. At times, I felt the urge to groan aloud at the sheer corniness of Elaine's musings, especially in the frame narrative of 1980s Toronto. However, Atwood's rendering of the protagonist's childhood traumas are captivating, and wonderfully excruciating to read. Nine-year-old girls have never seemed so insanely cruel, and the effect of this treatment on Elaine's adult life, as well as her art, is perfectly captured. Navigating art, feminism, psychology, aging, and memory, Atwood creates a kind of fractured bildungsroman in which lessons are forgotten and memories suppressed, only to resurface in the ambiguous medium of Elaine's painting.In terms of criticisms, I would agree with other reviewers that after Elaine's childhood, the narrative loses some steam. While the events of her later life are important to an understanding of Elaine's situation in the frame narrative, there is a sense that the events that allow us to fully understand Elaine as a character occur about mid-book. After that, things begin to drag a bit. Furthermore, the clich&eacute;d narrative voice often gets in the way of connecting and identifying with the protagonist. However, it is interesting to see how the events and symbols of the narrator's childhood resurface in a complex web connecting the past and present.Overall, I would recommend this book, but with a warning to those who already have a bias against Atwood's style. If you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But, if you already dislike Atwood, this book will not change your mind."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Wow. This story touched such a nerve as I read, invoking anger, rage, and sorrow for Elaine. And myself! For who among us has not had her own Cordelia? I've had TWO in my life! Argh.

I was riveted."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"People always say that children are so innocent, and yet most of us have memories of being tormented by other kids at some point during our childhoods. Sometimes we were even guilty of being the young tormenters ourselves. \\"Cat's Eye\\" explores the complexities of female friendships and the effects these relationships have on people's lives.The novel is narrated from the perspective of Elaine Risley, a middle-aged Canadian painter who returns to her hometown of Toronto for a retrospective of her work. From the very beginning of the novel, it is obvious that Elaine has a slight obsession with her childhood friend, Cordelia, whom she hasn't spoken to in years but expects to encounter at the retrospective. The book soon flashes back to Elaine's youth and describes the experience of moving to Toronto with her parents and brother. Young Elaine eventually befriends a group of three other girls, Cordelia among them. There are times when all four girls get along very well, but at other times Cordelia can be incredibly cruel, especially where Elaine is concerned. These childhood relationships have a profound impact on Elaine's life, particularly the interactions she has with Cordelia, which continue into young adulthood. Elaine eventually realizes how her friendships have affected her whole life and helped shape the woman she has become.I enjoyed \\"Cat's Eye\\" very much. Margaret Atwood's portrayal of girlhood friendships is incredibly accurate and painfully honest. It's true that all relationships, even those that ended long ago, have a major affect on people for the rest of their lives, and this book does a great job of illustrating that fact. Personally, I think the book drags a bit in places, and it's not my favorite Atwood novel of all time. However, \\"Cat's Eye\\" is very dynamic, powerful, and emotional. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"CAT'S EYE is a formative examination of one woman's often-painful childhood memories of bullying and loneliness. Elaine Risley returns to her childhood city of Toronto to participate in an art gallery show displaying her work throughout her career as a &quot;painter.&quot; Upon arriving Elaine is at once confronted with Toronto's transformations since her youth and thus she engages in a thorough revisiting of her childhood memories in this city. After the Risley family relocates to Toronto after living a vagabond lifestyle in the north, Elaine becomes acquainted with a group of schoolgirls that are often cruel and unfriendly under their innocent exteriors portrayed to others.Margaret Atwood performs a magnificent feat of displaying the complexity and convoluted nature of relationships between young girls and women. The sections pertaining to Elaine's childhood are often painful and frank in their honesty. While reading I couldn't help feeling empathy for Elaine while simultaneously being strangely comforted in my realization that my own strained relationships with women are not unique. But despite these factors I failed to enjoy this book as a whole. Once Elaine reached high school I felt the narrative lost steam, became unexciting, and was often bogged down with unneccessary details and painful minutiae of the setting resulting in my careful skimming of the last half and a sour taste in my mouth. Nevertheless, although this isn't by far my favorite Atwood book, it is still worth reading for the aspects outlined above."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This novel, much like The Robber Bride, presents how the relationships between women can twist due to certain cultural pressures. I find myself drawn to this book because of the detailed characters. A personal relationship develops between the reader and Elaine; I missed her when I finished! In fact, I almost began to think about how she would react in certain situations! I enjoyed this book because of the detail to character. Mrs. Smeath, Cordelia, Elaine's parents and brother, Carol Campbell . . . . all of these characters exist in our minds so clearly and realistically due to Atwood's detail and sharp observation of human nature."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye remains one of the best works of modern literature I've read. Elaine's life, particularly her childhood experiences, is almost frighteningly familiar.

Atwood uses different colors to describe the world of artist Elaine Risley. And the use of flashbacks was very effective in telling the story. The main conflict of the novel deals with the reconciliation of Elaine with Cordelia, her childhood tormentor. There is an Elaine and also a Cordelia in all of us, always fighting for domination.

It's not as compelling as 'Alias Grace' or 'The Robber Bride' - but it's certainly a book that will stay with you.The premise of Cat's Eye has the protagonist, Elaine, reminiscing about her transition from girl to woman in Canada. Woven into the story is her like/hate relationship with a fellow classmate, Cordelia.I use like/hate because 'love' is not an emotion shared between these two characters - and I think that's what makes the book compelling. It's not often that a novel captures the dynamics between people who don't like each other very much, but are tied together for inexplicable reasons.And that's what Cat's Eye accomplishes. It shows the difficulty of knowing someone that you would make an attempt *not* to know if you were in different circumstances. And it details how sometimes such relationships can have a long-lasting impact on one's outlook and sense of self.Atwood also does an excellent job of providing glimpses into the moments when the child becomes the parent - and has no choice but to accept the sometimes poor choices one's parents made when growing up.There is also a perfectly brief side story about the passing of a close relative of Elaine that is lyrically tragic.If you haven't read Atwood before, it's a good jumping on point."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Good books rarely give me great ideas just vague memories and gut feelings. Often I find it hard to articulate why the book I've just read has moved me as much as it did but I sense it's special power. I first read Margaret Atwood's poetry and was was much drawn to it for so many reasons but especially it's awarness of nature and the use of nature as a metaphore for struggles within human relationships especially the relationship with self. This closeness to nature is also evident in her novel 'Surfacing' which is a must for anyone interested in 'wilderness' Cat's Eye was recommended me by a woman friend as one of the author's better novels. It took me a long time to read (I'm a very slow reader). A year later, and while the detail is extremely fussy the gut-feelings are ever as strong. Despite the drabness and almost deprived lower middle-class backdrop of the Canada of the late 40's and 50's described in the book, Atwoods accounts of her heroine's interralionships are so real, so compelling and so precisely observed that you have to read on. This is not a light book by any means, but it's full of the wisdom of the survivor and Atwoods special brand of black humour; it holds points of reference and insight for all of us. My abiding image/feeling is of the cold water in the creek under the bridge and the the deep inner glow of Our Lady of Perpetual succour (note the cover in this edition). Get stuck in and feel the power of Atwood's writing!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I read Cat's Eye after several of my friends recommended it to me. The book centers around the peer pressure and mental bullying girls can encounter during childhood and adolescence with other girls that often goes overlooked in favor of the typical physical schoolyard bullying that boys endure and how these interfaces can still influence women's self-esteem into adulthood. I feel as though many women can probably relate to the situations faced by the main character, Elaine. Atwood is really brilliant here at weaving in the minute details of childhood that stick in one's memory: a harsh quip from a friend, the one object that you MUST have to fit in with your peers, etc. In that respect Cat's Eye is a masterpiece. Why, then, did I only give it three stars?The book runs out of steam about 3/4 of the way through. I wanted to give up on it after the story shifted gears from Elaine's childhood to her adulthood. I found that I just didn't care about her trials as an adult. Her obsession with Cordelia when she was a child is understandable and empathetic, but her continuing obsession as an adult lacks substance and doesn't really have a point. Perhaps I just had a different experience with my own personal Cordelia than Atwood did.If you're an Atwood fan, definitely pick up this book. Atwood writes so many concise words of wisdom in Cat's Eye that I regret not picking up a highlighter. If you're interested in reading a better story, however, I would recommend picking up A Handmaid's Tale instead."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"When I find an author I like, I read as many books as I can by that author. MY favorite Atwood books are 'Lady Oracle' and 'Life Before Man.' When I read these books, I had the experience of playing &quot;catch-up&quot; with an old friend I hadn't seen in a while. You know...you care about them, they've been away, and you have to hear all their news.Usually, a friend has little endearing quirks you recognize--a favorite use of phrase or an overused word which you see or hear and say to yourself -- &quot;Yup, that's her all over.&quot; With Atwood, I sometime feel my friend has multiple personalities.The protagonist in this book is hard to &quot;get next to&quot; although you care about her. She's the friend who hasn't always been very good to herself, sometimes you want to shake her and say fight back, and sometimes you want to protect her but you know she's got to stand up for herself. Then one day she begins to change and you breathe a sigh of relief because you were getting tired of the beating she was taking.I hand off many of my books to others, but I kept this one (it's a paperback). I couldn't tell you why as I don't think I'll read it again. It affected me on some level, and I'm glad I read it. I still like 'Lady Oracle' better though."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood covers the subject of girl-on-girl bullying with honesty and wit. The tortures extolled by Cordelia onto, not just the protagonist, but all the girls in their group are similar to what happens in girl cliques all over the world every day. When girls bully, it is mean and subversive, while boys tend to be forthright and physical in their bullying. This novel delves right into the manipulative nature of girls and how the girl-group dynamic affects them as they grow into adults.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye is a beautiful and insightful treatment of not only the relationship among girls and young women, but how those relationships may, or may not, evolve and impact a life. This is subject matter I don't often encounter in fiction, so kudos for being the 'Mary Cassatt' of this tiny genre. Like life, the plot can amble in its later stages, however without losing thematic power.The conclusion is a little overwritten, but nonetheless powerful.This should be recommended reading for high school students everywhere."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This was the gripping portrayal of a girl struggling to find a place in the treacherous world of young females who developed strength through her experiences and emerged as a successful artist.The vivid details of Elaine's return to her childhood home of Toronto and her recollection of growing up was insightful and, of course, beautifully written.While fighting the cruelty and games of pre-adolescent and teenage girls, Elaine was also trying to forge an identity and hold her own with parents and an older brother who all possessed a strong sense of self. She emerges as a confident woman, who has learned who she is and expresses both the pain and beauty of her experiences in art that is uncompromising."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I really loved the part of the book that delves into Elaine's childhood & the abuse she suffers at the hands of her \\"friends\\"; I thought it was very convincing and realistic. Anyone who's been the victim of any kind of abuse (whether in their childhood or adulthood) will be able to relate; it is heartbreaking.I found it a tad boring once Elaine grew up; I've read 3 books by Atwood so far, and in 2 out of 3 of them, the adult characters bored me to tears. In this book I found the descriptions of the various artwork (done by Elaine and her friends) way too detailed. Maybe if I were an artist myself I would have been more interested. It just seemed overdone to me, and like she was trying too hard to be deep and \\"abstract\\" or something. Luckily, the rest of the book greatly compensated for this, in my opinion.Atwood's writing style is beautiful and poetic. I'm definitely not easily pleased with most books, but this one's a winner! My sister loved it too!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Despite the casual and unassuming tone of the story, this book has been crafted to the smallest detail. Nothing here is said without a reason. Words are elegantly economized so that what goes unsaid is as important and as clearly felt as the written parts. This creates a sense of subjectivity very befitting, since the narrator is rendered real by the unreliability of her memories and the limitations of her necessarily incomplete knowledge of her own past.No wonder many readers, unable to grasp the many levels on which this book can be read, found it dull. Interesting that even then, many of them acknowledge the authenticity of the narrator's voice, like the one who qualifies it as \\"Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst\\" Well, isn't this precisely the point?I found particularly appealing the underlying thesis that the bullying and the bullied mingle with each other by a constant swapping of their roles, among each other and in their relations with third people. Also the distortions of the memory involuntarily introduced by the mind as a means of survival.Incidentally, I found it very instructive on certain episodes of my life, which were half buried in the rapidly decaying pile of my memory."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Never before has the pain and laughter of childhood been illustrated with such unique and yet accurate detail, at least for this reader. Atwood's writing is impeccable as she weaves a past-and-present story with fluidity and style, and ingeniously blends dark humor into serious themes. The novel is both poignant and bitingly funny, thanks to Atwood's insight, wit, and her ability to create characters who are hauntingly alive. An outstanding reflection on the consequences of human behavior."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This novel interested me because I am both a writerand a visual artist and of course the book was written by theformer and about the latter...the elements of childhood that have shaped her. I enjoyed it but...I gave it four stars because its &quot;shadow&quot;-protagonist - a childhood chum of the main protagonist, the artist, remains just that throughout the book - a shadow. Now, this could be effective under certain circumstances, but Cordelia is so important...she keeps popping up in the artist's consciousness as a particularly important fixture in her early life....but I don't really get a true &quot;sense&quot; of her. Even when the author meets her later in life under strange and tragic circumstances...and her constant searching for Cordelia in ever stranger and on every corner...the character of this...character....doesn't gel. So a major conceit of the book was lacking for me, and I grew weary of it. I wanted to know SOMETHING more substantial about Cordelia, but never felt I really did. Other characters - childhood friends, the artist's parents and brother...were wonderfully drawn. Also the mother of a friend...a hateful, religious bigot who becomes the vengeful centerpiece of the artist's work, are deliciously drawn. But as I said, I feel the writer failed to make the one character who was pivotal come alive."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"_Cat's Eye_ is a novel that speaks to everyone. It speaks to those who moved often in childhood, and those who left their hometowns to escape negative memories. It speaks to artists. It speaks to women, and to anyone who had difficult relationships in childhood. It speaks to those who have obtained a measure of success, and to those that haven't. It speaks to Canadians, Americans, and even to men. It speaks to anyone who is haunted by their past.Elaine Risley is an artist who is returning to her home city of Toronto for a retrospective of her work. Following her everywhere as she moves through the streets is the shadow of Cordelia, her childhood friend, confidant, and finally, her torturer. We learn about Elaine's childhood through highly effective and captivating flashbacks: her father was an entymologist, they moved around often, and when Elaine was finally able to settle and make friends she chooses the wrong girls. We suffer with her through her torment, and sympathize with her as an adult trying to heal through her art.For me, the descriptions of Elaine's paintings are some of the finest points of the book. Each painting is a capsule of Elaine's childhood: the images overlap and symbolize events which she is trying to take out and place onto the canvas in order to purge herself. The reader can envision them clearly, and understand where they came from in the artist's psyche. The paintings are essential to the hypnotic flow of the book (one of them is displayed on the cover).Ultimately, with the help of her successful retrospective and revisiting of Toronto, Elaine does finally emerge from her personal blizzard and into the sunlight. It is a journey well worth taking with her. One of my three favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Kate Nelligan does a superb job reading the story, and the story works very well on audio."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is my favourite Margaret Atwood novel. It reads to be almost autobiographical. The early parts evoke the loneliness and vulnerability of childhood so painfully and beautifully. It is one of the finest tellings of tormented childhood that I have read, outside of children's literature. If you like Atwood, are interested in a feminist writer, who manages to convey messages of humanity rather than ideology, then you can't do better than this."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Elaine Risley returns to her childhood home of Toronto, Canada. Where she is flooded with memories of her past life. None of these memories conjure very fond sentiments. Through a series of flashbacks, Risley chronologically replays her life up to the present time. Intermixed with these flashbacks are interludes into current time. In the current time, Risley is in Toronto to attend a retrospective show of her art. Risley is a controversial painter. She does not use the title artist because she feels that the title painter is more conducive to gaining respect from other people. Throughout the novel, what others think and feel is ultimately important to Risley. Beginning with her early youth, Risley aimed to please her \\"friends\\", a group of girls who tortured her and almost killed her. During the time Risley is undergoing this torture, she finds solace in a cat's eye marble. Risley claims to have always felt uncomfortable with girls, possibly this occurrence is the reason why. Also contributing to her discomfort is the untraditional lifestyle her family leads. Her father is an entomologist who does field research in the Canadian forests, and so the family leads a nomadic life for numerous parts of Risley's life. Risley's only companion during these rootless times is her older brother, Stephen, who entangles her in the world of boys. Thus, Risley relates to the world she first entered better than the world of girls to which she actually belongs. While Risley is growing up, her antagonist, Cordelia persistently follows her. The two temporarily break connection when Risley gains the strength to revolt against the horrible actions Cordelia is taking against Risley. However, after several years, the two girls again meet, only this time, Risley is the stronger one. This being the case, Risley treats Cordelia poorly, just as Cordelia had treated her in the past. Only later in her life (actually the present time in the novel) does Risley come to the conclusion that \\"you should never pray for justice because you might get some.\\" The novel concludes with Risley in the present time missing Cordelia with whom she wishes she could have a relationship with again after having treated her so poorly. In its entirety, I did not find the book enjoyable. Though the plot sounds enticing, the execution was not what it should have been. Too much time was spent discussing the unpleasant aspects of Risley's life, and not enough time was devoted to plot development. Although Atwood's preliminary idea was well concieved, the execution was not. Parts of Atwood's novel contained beautiful language, but the content in which it was presented was not near as masterful."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is a well written book, a page-turner; I like the details of Elaine's past and am interested in what viewpoints formed her as a person. However, I also think it is quite depressing. I read it a couple of times, years ago. When I saw a positive review on it I read it again, and each reading makes it more depressing. Her outlook is bleak, and I really don't see anything positive or uplifting about it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is a story of a woman growing up. The childhood friends that you have, the choices you make/the consequences, and how the past can haunt you. I have read two other books by Margaret Atwood and I liked this one the least. (Oryx and Crake, The Edible Woman) I feel the book was too long for the material covered. Also, the book talked about the children too much and the last half of the book has little to do with the first half. I wouldn't recommend. I also have a friend who read the book who had a different view of what the story was about (feminity/coming of age as a woman in a different time), but she also found the story to be lackluster."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"After reading both Cat's Eye and The Handmaid's Tale, I decided that Atwood's narrative style is just not for me-she's very poetic and deep, but hers is a style that people either love or hate. I found this story to be void of any content I care about."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I had the experience of studying this book for A-level. It is full of uninteresting detail, its heroine is self-pitying. The novel is composed of incredibly long sentences with the occassional very short sentence that is obviouisly intended to be 'significant'. THe self conscious imagery and style make this one of the worst books that I have ever read/"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye: Plot? Purpose? Point?Being the simple-minded high school student that I am, it does not take a lot for a piece of literature to please me. I would have loved Margaret Atwood's autobiographical novel, Cat's Eye, full of symbolism, metaphors, astonishing diction and detail had it not been for the plot or lack thereof. Cat's Eye, a flashback of some sort (it goes back from past to present through chapters), deals with Elaine Risley, an upcoming artist, who is attempting to come to terms with her harsh childhood. Throughout Cat's Eye, Elaine's past and present are illustrated through distinct scenes so full of detail (particularly metaphors) and imagery that the description takes over the main point. Wait a minute, what main point? Throughout the novel there seems to be no main point, no direction, no plot, no beginning, and no ending. What a hit! Adding to that, the protagonist, Elaine is weak and unrealistic. As a pre-adolescent nine-year-old girl, Elaine allows herself to be controlled by three of her so-called friends. And, as an adult, Elaine is still weak, but now she's also pessimistic and somber. She's fifty something and is still disturbed about her childhood even though she eventually stood up for herself (which by the way was the highlight of the book). Elaine, as an adult, seems to me to be a disturbed character who belongs not in a novel but on the television show Frasier where she might be able to get help. I gave Cat's Eye a whole star for the complex, yet easy-to-follow style which to me seemed to be the only good thing about the book."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This book drove me NUTS! I bought it because I absolutely love &quot;The Robber Bride,&quot; but this one just seemed like a big waste. I spent the whole book waiting for something interesting to happen, but the detached voice of the narrator sucks any excitement right out of the story. But all the other reviewers seem to love it, so maybe you should read it anyway and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Horrible. You can't understand a thing. The writing has too much detail which is hard to follow. There are still questions unanswered. There are problems unsolved. This book is frustrating to read. A book that takes forever to read which seems more like an autobiography than a book to read for pleasure. This is a book to read just to say you have another book under your belt. There never is a climax, nothing is really solved. The book seems like a huge run-on sentence that has too many flashbacks. One can get lost going back and forth between past, present, and future. Maybe when I'm older I will understand the thoughts and flashbacks as an elderly woman, but right now this book seems like a waste of time."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Elaine Risley was bullied by her friends as a child and was scarred forever after. Pile up as much philosophing and moralizing as you want, in the end what you are left with here is more than 400 pages filled with a depressing middle-aged woman's memories of her miserable childhood and bullying friends. Paragraph upon paragraph upon paragraph of childhood angst. What twaddle. Dreary, dreary, dreary."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Material which is fresh and immediate in The Edible Woman loses its edge in this rehash of scenes from the Toronto of yesteryear. Retrospective wisdom and insight which might compensate for the loss of intensity is in depressingly short supply. A lazy and derivative book."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood nails down the subtle cruelties that come with growing up female with female peers. From the perspective of adulthood, the narrator takes the reader through memories of her childhood and adolescence with a charismatic and capricious chum called Cordelia. Cordelia is a typical girl bully, charming to adults, but alternately sweet and vicious to her playmates. What is interesting is that the roles between her and the narrator are reversed once they are teens. Compared to the vivid world of the narrator's youth, her scenes in the &quot;present&quot; are somewhat dull, but that is a minor flaw. &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; shows that girls don't need today's glossy electronic trappings to torment someone to the point where they feel completely invisible. It also shows that empathy doesn't necessarily result from having been the object of bullying."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Margaret Atwood has a talent for words ~~ and this book is one of the few books written in the English language that makes you want to read more on science and look up the meanings of the words. It is also a morbid look into the darker side of human nature and relationships between little girls and their so-called friends/tormentors. Atwood used an autiobiographical vein throughout this book ~~ drawing you into the life of Elaine, the main character who has never quite feel in place while young. Uprooted by her parents always on the search for her father's science projects, Elaine longed nothing more than to have a best friend. And when she finally has a best friend, her life changes but not necessarily for the better.This is an indepth look at relationships little girls endure while growing up. It is also an indepth into Elaine's mind as she grows up to be a successful painter. Behind that facade of success is a lonely and terrified woman though she hides it well ~~ with a sneer and sharp comebacks to anything anyone says. Throughout the book, she relives her memories of a childhood that is not so special as she had wished for. It shaped her to be this woman that she is ~~ and stripped her dreams to reality.It is an interesting look into women's psyche ~~ I have to admit that it took me awhile to get into the story because it was so dark and more morbid than I recall Atwood ever writing. But she has a flair for drawing readers into her stories. This is definitely one story that I won't forget so easily. It is a genuine Atwood at one of her best.9-15-03"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This book, as others have stated, is about the way that our childhood impacts the adult we become, and the terrible way girls can treat each other. I did find it hard to get in to at the beginning, but by the first 50 pages, I was captivated. Atwood has an amazing way with words; the book is poetic. The book doesn't have as much dialogue as I normally want from a book, because Atwood is most concerned with setting a scene and creating a mood. It is very internal novel, and it is not linear. Not an easy read, but well worth it. There are so many levels to this book. Every time I read it I see something different in it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I loved Alias Grace and Handmaid's Tale but found this book to be ultimately depressing in an uninspiring way--too much like life in the doldrums or when it lacks meaning and is the most exitential, perhaps. The experiences of Elaine's childhood were deeply engrossing and shocking, but once she moved beyond her friends' bullying the narrator's story lacked coherence for me or any real kind of growth or advanced self-understanding. Maybe I didn't like it because it didn't have anything very inspiring or uplifting or wise to say, and I wanted more from it than concerns about one's dowdiness, cellulite and wrinkled skin and all that is lost. The writing about her brother and the childhood times was strongest to me--the parts about the brother and boys really sang. The older Cordelia did not seem quite real nor did Elaine's about-face. I think it is a fine book and would never put down Margaret Atwood or her artistry but this is a story that bummed me out in the end. Life can be that way surely, but I like to come away with something more than I got here. I did like what I thought might be glimpses of Atwood's own views about her talent and fame--seeing Elaine's art as Margaret's writing."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is the first book os Atwood's that I have read, and am anxious to read The Handmaid's Tale. I was first impressed by Atwood's innovative description. Her eye and ear for detail has a mystical ability to speak to the reader's own thoughts and perceptions about everyday things. The book's heroine, Elaine Risley, takes us through the journey of her life, from elementary school to middle-age, detailing the trials and tribulations along the way. The story switches between Elaine's formative years and her grown-up self, and adds interesting, provocative breaks in the action that keep the reader interested. The book has a strange, misty, ethereal quality, as though the narrator is walking in a dream while recounting her youthful experiences, and this adds a sinister bent to the often-gritty tale. Although not an uplifting tome, Cat's Eye has a Forrest Gump-ish quality in that Elaine Risley is our guide through Canada from the end of World War II to the mid-80s, noting all of the world's changes in the backdrop of Elaine's life. Masterfully told, and an excellent read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Because I was raised in Canada, however during a slightly later era than within this story, I found so much that I could relate to as I read. Anyone who grew up in Canada between the 1940s to the 1970s will find many incidents, thoughts, emotions, and words that they will recognize in this book. I especially understood the difficulty described relating to girls my own age when I was in elementary school and all that ridiculous, silly, and mean attitude females display towards each other when they are supposed to be friends. As the main character, Elaine Risely matures, the same understanding emerges as she describes the way some women act around men in order to get attention, even more ridiculous. Embarrassing if you happen to be unlucky enough to be present during their antics. I can remember secretly rolling my eyes when these young women went into overdrive with a caricature of femininity and pretending they were so helpless but what was even more surprising is how the guys fell for this tripe. But, hey, maybe the guys just wanted to fall for that stuff because it probably got them what they wanted anyway. I shouldn't be so quick to judge a style I could never imagine adopting.I enjoy well-written, emotionally evocative stories that stay with me and make me want to read more works by the author. If I ever decide to write a novel, I want to have a similar style to Margaret Atwood's wonderful ways of making words appear as pictures in the mind - word pictures. She knows how to keep a reader anticipating that moment when you can finally get back to the book and shut-out everything around you and revel in the lives of each character. I highly recommend this book to anyone even if you did not grow up in Canada."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"wow. okay so this isn't exactly on the same level as handmaid's tale or oryx and crake in regards to thinking books, and took me very little time to read by comparison. but i loved it. absolutely loved it, and it was an entirely different type of novel, and it is going right up there in my top 3 list for atwood novels.i felt like i could relate to the protagonist on so many levels. i was engrossed. i know one of the main complaints people had about this novel, when there were complaints, was that the 2nd and 3rd parts of the novel felt rushed to them. i think though that perhaps they failed to take note of some of the scientific references made throughout the entire novel, even in the chapter titles. like einstein's theory of relativity.i was actually able to maintain my composure throughout the entire novel, despite the many parallels i was able to draw against my own life experiences thus far, until the second to last paragraph on the very last page:\\"This is what I miss Cordelia: not something that's gone, but something that will never happen. Two old women giggling over their tea.\\"and then i started crying."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"When artist Elaine Risling returns home to Toronto for a retrospective art showing, she has mixed feelings. After all, her childhood memories still haunt her, with parts seemingly irretrievable. So what will she discover upon her return?Buildings that have disappeared, new businesses that have cropped up to replace them, and the memories attached to the once familiar landscape stand out in stark relief.Elaine's childhood included a gypsy-like traveling about with her entomologist father, and the family camped out in tents. Then would come the months in an almost normal home, but without the normalcy she sees around her. Her fears, her insecurities, and the differences she can feel within must somehow convey themselves to the three girls who call themselves \\"friends.\\" Is there any other reason for the torture she suffers at their hands?But years later, only parts of this history remain in her memory, slowly returning in flashes.The language and images ofCat's Eyewere haunting, unforgettable, and reminiscent of some of my own childhood experiences. Who hasn't felt, at one time or another, the insecurity of not fitting in? Who hasn't been bullied or taunted? Reading Elaine's story, from the past to the present, brought these old memories back in full force.Combined with the visual images of the art showing that depicts many of those childhood moments, the language in Atwood's story had me rereading parts because of the sheer magic of the words. Especially in one poignant scene, when Elaine is remembering a time from her first marriage, as she lies alone in the dark with a sick child while everything is falling apart around her:\\"I crouch in the bedroom, in the dark, wrapped in Jon's old sleeping bag, listening to the wheezing sound of Sarah breathing and the whisper of sleet against the window. Love blurs your vision; but after it recedes, you can see more clearly than ever. It's like the tide going out, revealing whatever's been thrown away and sunk: broken bottles, old gloves, rusting pop cans, nibbled fishbodies, bones. This is the kind of thing you see if you sit in the darkness with open eyes, not knowing the future. The ruin you've made.\\"Throughout this novel, visual images like these totally blew me away with their magnitude. I will not forget this book ever! Five stars."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Ms. Atwood is a tour de force. The give and take bullying in Cat's Eye is so brutal, I almost stopped reading it, except her writing is yet so marvelous, so smart. The other reason I slowed down was because of the over description and the slow pace of the book. For example, there's a scene where our little girl protagonist takes a marble out of her purse and puts it on her bureau and goes out. And I thought, wait, Ms. Atwood, aren't you going to describe where she puts the marble on the bureau so it doesn't roll off and what else is up there and how the light is falling and... you get the picture. It also had a bit too much Christian imagery for my tastes, although the science bits were great. Still, I'm in awe, and highly looking forward to my next Atwood tome."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"A lot of people point to Margaret Atwood's science fiction as her best work but I completely disagree. I am not a big fan of either Oryx and Crake or The Handmaid's Tale. However, this book, I think, is just about a must-read for anybody who wants to truly understand the feminist perspective. It's also a fantastic example of how a good narrative can drive a point home much, much better than an essay. The essay beats you over the head with its points whereas the narrative presents you with a compelling story and the thematic material gets in by the side.It is a pro-feminist book but one of the reasons that I enjoyed it is that it's not a \\"OMG MEN SUX\\" type pro-feminist book. The meanest people in here are all women. The most interesting characters are women. In many cases, the men seem to be just along for the ride. I would whine about Atwood's lack of ability to depict realistic male characters, but she's not half as bad at this as John Irving is at depicting realistic women, so she gets a pass on this for me. But the women in this story just make a great deal of sense. I'm not sure I completely buy the argument that men can't really write about women and vice versa, but if I wanted to make an argument for that, this book would be one of the first on my list.If your experience with Atwood is Handmaid's Tale and you get the idea that she's like a feminist version of Ayn Rand, this is one of the books that will change your mind."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I'm somewhat new to Margaret Atwood, having only read \\"The Handmaiden's Tale.\\" I loved that book, its imagery, and the haunting theme. I had similarly high hopes for this book, particularly since my best friend of 40 years spoke so highly of Atwood.I enjoyed the portion of the book discussing with Elaine's early years, particularly those dealing with her immediate family. Perhaps the portion of the book concerning her school years and friends hit too close to home. It brought back all the feelings I had in junior high of being on the outside looking in, and of wanting desperately to have control over my own life. The portion of the book dealing with her college years was neither a plus or a minus; the balance of the book was okay.This is a well written, intelligent text which is the reason I gave it four stars. If you enjoy taunt psychological stories which disturb you and cause you to reflect on your life, as well as that of the characters in the book, then you will like this novel. If you read for pure pleasure, this probably isn't the book you'd choose for your escape. Personally, it didn't hold my interest enough to keep me reading until I finished it before I started - and finished - two other books - \\"The Toss of a Lemon\\" and \\"The Gargoyle\\". I did finish \\"Cat's Eye\\", but it wasn't a book I'd reread."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This was a book that was loaned to me and I read it to kill some time.

I would suggest this book to anyone that wanted a good rainy day afternoon book."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. Although parts of it were quite disturbing, Atwood refrained from going too far. This book paints a chilling picture of how mean kids can be to each other -- and how childhood hurts can haunt adults -- all against an intricately woven tapestry of yesteryear Toronto. This was the 1st time I'd read Atwood -- but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I have just finished reading this book and think it one of the best of Atwood's books. It is an exploration into the psyche and first hand experiences of girlhood and how it reflects on our adult lives as women. I love that the writing got me enraptured in Elaine Risley's fears and triumphs. Also, I am an art lover and Elaine's paintings are as expressive on paper as if they were real productions in a gallery. Atwood again uses wit and humor balanced with the utmost seriousness to create a spectacular flight from childhood to adulthood."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I feel old knowing that Cat's Eye is required reading for high school students and a bit jealous. This is my favorite novel. What cinches it for me is not the story &quot;line,&quot; but the careful choice of words, and use of metaphor. Few get it so right. I am pleased as punch over and over reading what comes forth from Margaret Atwood's deft brain.

Because this book is thick with parallels between the past and present, every time I read it will be an exhilarating experience."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This was the first book I read by Margaret Atwood, who I dare say is the finest writer alive. Cat's Eye is amazingly well-written...there are no flaws in Atwood's tale of Cordelia and Elaine. As with all Atwood books, the descriptions are exquisite, with a sharp eye to detail and realistic dialogue. I believe this book captures the essence of interactions between women. The message that little girls can be vicious to one another is so true, and these encounters as children can profoundly affect us all our lives. I believe Cat's Eye to be Atwood's best book. I have recommended it to every one of my friends (male and female), each of whom has diverse literary interests, and every one has thanked me for recommending such a wonderful book. No one I've referred it to has regretted reading it! Sure to be considered a classic in the next generation."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"&quot;Cat's Eye&quot; is a tale about Elaine Risley, her childhood memories, her relationships, her accomplishments.The book frankly explores topics like North American society's cultural expectancies, cruelty that exists among children, distorted perceptions of love, and the permanence of experience. As Elaine reflects on her life, the reader discovers that human beings have a persistent nature to strive for social acceptance.The prose is a little choppy at times, but that is only Atwood's trademark. When I finished reading &quot;Cat's Eye&quot;, I had a huge question mark hovering above my head. &quot;Huh? That's it?&quot; I had wondered. But upon further reflection, I realized that something must have motivated me to finish the book -- it was the blunt reality, the uncensored honesty, and the cold truths that made this book so captivating."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I am amazed at the negitivity that the other readers haveexpressed regarding Atwood's Cats Eye.People have been soconditioned that they must expect a structured beginning, middle and end to a story. They must have some conflict that needs to (and will be) resolved by the end of the story. I say look deeper and you will find it in Atwood's Cats Eye.The story was there, it lay bed of rich symbolic nature.Elaine, disturbed and tormented, in her youth, held on to a cats eye marble. The story also told of her in her adult life, as a painter. Her paintings unleashed some of her youth, but it was not until she opened up a hope chest, found her red purse and the glass marble inside...that she had put all the pieces together.You see, she had burried(in the hope chest) her hurt(the marble) so deep in her heart (the red purse)...and left it there...for years. Until she found it.This story came full-circle. I enjoyed the uniqueness Atwood gave, and would re-read it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"CAT'S EYE by Margaret AtwoodIn CAT'S EYE, Margaret Atwood tells the story of Elaine Risley, an avant-garde painter who finds herself reflecting on her tumultuous childhood when she returns to her home town of Toronto for a retrospective art exhibit. It has been many years since she set foot in Canada, where she grew up moving from place to place, due to her father's career as an entomologist. The story is told in flashbacks, as the story of her current life as a painter, on her second marriage, is told in-between the story of her childhood. Two plot lines run parallel to each other, until the very end when both the past and her present collide.Elaine's first years were spent travelling with her family, never having a best friend. It is all she yearns for, to have a real girl friend. All she had during those early years was her brother, who as he grew older drifted away from her, leaving her alone to fend for herself. When her father finally settles down and buys a house, she begins to make her first set of real friends. However, how does one define a friend? Elaine becomes part of a group of girls that seem to be living under the steel hand of Cordelia, the ringleader. Cordelia treats them all as if she was a dictator and they were her subjects, but her treatment of Elaine is totally unforgivable. Elaine is tormented to a point where her own mental health is jeopardized, and at one point one wonders how she ever survived.But survive she did. As Elaine tells her story, we see how she developed from a very insecure and needy young girl to a woman who understands why she made the choices she did as a child, and became a very successful painter, secure in who she was and where she had come from. The key to her understanding is her friendship with Cordelia, the young girl who treated Elaine like dirt, yet towards whom Elaine felt a type of longing for, years after she had last seen Cordelia. It is a psychologically themed book, as usual, layered upon different levels of plots and subplots and characters. Margaret Atwood is the queen of this form of novel, and it is no wonder she is one of the best storytellers today. This was my fourth Atwood novel, and I will not hesitate to read my next. Although not as complex as THE BLIND ASSASSIN, nor as prophetic as THE HANDMAID'S TALE, CAT'S EYE stands alone as a great book that is a must-read for any fan. I give this book 5 stars."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Other reviewers have used the word &quot;haunting&quot; to describe this novel, and I must agree. This book stayed with me long after I finished it, and compelled me to read even when I was too tired to do so. At first, I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. Elaine, the protagonist, does not come across as a strong character; indeed, she is almost painfully introspective and introverted. Her inner life is rich, however, and her ruminations about her family and friends are quite perceptive. So I kept reading and allowed Elaine to reveal herself to me. As a girl, Elaine grows up in a family that is unusual, but loving and supportive of her. Her &quot;friends&quot; are another story. I don't think I've ever read anything that describes so well the cruelty that young girls are capable of. The social and psychological aspects of growing up are no better shown than here. However, this is the strongest part of the book. Elaine's adult life, colored as it was by her past, is not as richly portrayed, but she remains an interesting person. Her art is her catharsis, as personal and as difficult for an outsider to understand as is the artist herself. This book is an eerie coming-of-age tale, told with poetic beauty and sorrow."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Top 50. I've probably read this book three times. The first time, I was about 21 years old and maybe not far enough yet out of the hard kind of high school years that those of us glasses-wearing skinny smart loner girls have if we're not careful. One of the creepiest, scariest, saddest books I've ever encountered. Atwood gets inside the skin of a teenage girl not only scorned, but tortured by her peers. Gripping, and makes huge demands on one's empathy, compassion, and patience for the main character. Great moments of beauty, but real encounters with evil, apathy, and terror."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This multi-layered book about how childhood experiences impact on the rest of life's journey, tackles a subject rarely explored. This subject is how truly horrifying children's emotional cruelty to one another can be. Sure there have been lots of stories about English boys beating each other up, and inflicting nasty physical tortures on one another, but this book is a rarity because it tells of how little girls, as young as nine, inflict emotional torture on each other. There is much more to this book however. Cat's eye explores the whole life journey of a woman after these miserable childhood experiences, and her preoccupation throughout life with the \\"friend\\" who was the ringleader of these children's \\"reindeer games\\". None of what I have written so far describes how magnificent the prose and poetry of this book is. It explores many other topics such as art, marriage and old age. It is very much a novel that is primarily of interest to women which may be why it didn't win the Booker Prize. It's my favorite book in the world, except perhaps for the Robber Bride also by Atwood."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I am a seventeen year old girl and this book really struck a chord within me. The things that the girls did to Elaine sent a chill down my spine but they didn't shock me. At all. I had friends much like Elaine's and I wouldn't be surprised if I had once been a friend like that.The novel was well written and the first half of it had me entranced but as the novel continued on, I felt as though Atwood had grown bored with the plot. I forced myself to finish the book just because I had read two of her other novels (The Handmaid's Tale and Oryx and Crake) and loved them."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I first read Cat's Eye upon it's publication in 1989. I was twelve years old and at that time particularly enjoyed the bits about her adolescence. However, I did not fully understand the painful magic, that is the real beauty in this tale, until the age of 20. This novel is a woman's struggle to deal the demons of her past, her intense love/hate relationship with the elusive Cordelia, and her own life as a woman relating to other women. Although the main charachter, Elaine, claims to &quot; not understand girls&quot; and is openly heterosexual, there is a searing lesbian melodrama that lurks within her obsession with Cordelia. This subtle element provides taut frustration to the story. The grisly description of life in Toronto in the 40's and 50's is also a wonderful, perhaps educational, bonus. Ms. Atwood's clever insights into the cruelty of children, the secret relationships of women, and the workings of universe-according to Stephen Hawking, Physicist and a blurry, unaccepting and somehow unbelievable God- are truly what makes this novel an unforgettable reading experience for anyone, male or female."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I would give this book a 4 star rating if it were possible. What keeps it from being a 5-star is the lack of better editing that could have made some parts less repetitive. However, the book is completely engrossing and well-crafted. Some of Atwood's observations are so poignant and finely shaded, it left me wishing I had written them.I didn't find the flashback scenes confusing. After the first few sections, the pattern of what is the present and what was the past became obvious: the first chapter of every section, except the last, dealt with the present while the remaining chapters of each section were flashbacks/memories.I think most women who grew up with brothers and/or have more guy friends than girl friends will relate well to this book. Being one of those women, I found Atwood's rendering of the intricacies of girls' play versus boys' quite interesting and on the mark. It seems that women who grew up with sisters know how to play these games well while women who grew up without sisters sometimes get tripped up.But while the childhood torment shapes Elaine and influences her life in profound ways, it is by no means the only story. Elaine and her friends grow up. Elaine and Cordelia become friends in high school where the power balance shifts. Reasons why Cordelia, the main \\"antagonist,\\" becomes a sort of emotional bully and why her character, her vitality slowly fades become sadly clearer.At the same time, because her friendship with Cordelia so powerfully shapes Elaine, she feels Cordelia's influence throughout her life even when she no longer sees her friend. At times, she seems even to hear Cordelia's voice and follow in her painful footsteps. The Toronto retrospective of Elaine's artwork allows her to come back and face the memories and figure out why Cordelia needed to emotionally abuse Elaine and why Elaine can understand and forgive Cordelia after all these years. In a way, they needed each other because they were looking for the same thing: friendship and acceptance.The imaginative descriptions of Elaine's art workwere almost too much! While reading the book, I envied how creative Atwood's mind really was. While writing this magnificent book, she also conjured up in her writing some powerful visual images.Finally, Atwood's ability to tell a very real and human story against the back drop of the feminist movement was exciting and nuanced. She illustrated the impact the women's movement had on relationships between the character and other women artists and Elaine and her husband. At the same time, she conveyed a sense of how difficult it was to find a comfortable position in a powerful movement; for example, how does a woman embrace feminism without feeling as if she has to give up all symbols of \\"female oppression,\\" such as wanting to look pretty, shaving one's legs, having a child WITH a HUSBAND? While some may say these issues are dated in today's world, they seem relevant still when women have to justify why they do/don't identify themselves as \\"feminists.\\" Or why they have to qualify the label.This book is superbly written and realized."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Generally, I like to be analytical and logical when writing about literature. This is what we are taught at university, after all. This novel, however, left me so astounded that I couldn't even talk about it to friends. I finished it more than six months ago and, in a way, have been grappling with it ever since. Scenes from it seem to randomly invade my mind. Surely if a mere work of fiction can hold this power for such a length of time, it must be worth more than the sum of its parts.The only point I really wish to make about it, is that there should be no gender discrimination in recommending this novel. Why anybody should feel that it is meant for a female audience is beyond me. Within the extremely rich layers of its narrative, the novel reveals essential truths about the way in which the process of growing up affects everybody. The fact that the main characters are women is simply not relevant beyond the fact that the narrator herself is a woman. Margaret Atwood is far too great a writer to have confined to such banalities.&quot;Haunting&quot; is possibly the best way to describe this work and I am sure that every perceptive reader will be haunted by the way in which Elaine's experiences are eventually reflected in her art. It is, quite simply, one of the greatest novels I have ever read. But then again, every Atwood novel I read (and I have read them all) just confirms my opinion that she is one of the greatest writers of all time."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"In essence, Cat's Eye is a story about the relationship between victim and bully. But in reality, it is so much more. It is a chronicle of an era, a psychological study, and above all, a beautiful piece of writing.Elaine Risley is a successful Canadian painter who comes back to the city she grew up in for a retrospective exhibition. Her return to Toronto, a city she always hated, sparks a chain of painful memories and forces her to confront herself. In doing so, Elaine keeps coming back to Cordelia, her best friend who bullied her mercilessly when they were young. Elaine realises that Cordelia is still a part of her life, although she hasn't seen her for years and doesn't know where she is, and that in order to free herself from her memories, she must also free Cordelia.Elaine's early childhood was spent moving around the north of Canada with her entomologist father, mother and brother. During this time she longed for female friendship, but after moving to Toroto and a permanent school, she realises this is not what she wants. Girls are sneaky and sly. They destroy each other. Elaine feels like an imposter whenever she plays with girls, and has to learn their ways. Boys, on the other hand, are her secret allies. When Cordelia comes into the scene, she almost immediately begins to take out her feelings of inferiority on Elaine. Although Elaine eventually emerges from this bullying intact (or so she thinks), the scars still remain years later. In order to protect herself, Elaine became detached from herself and the events occurring around her, and this continues throughout her later life. This is reflected in the writing style, which can seem cold and clinical in places, but is also incredibly emotive and almost heart breaking as well.Overall, this book is a beautiful account of someone's life and their attempts to reconcile themselves with their past. Although I know many people who absolutely hated it, I would reccomend everyone at least tries it. Interestingly enough, I didn't like this book much the first time I read it, I found it depressing. But second time round, I fell in love. So give it a try; stick with Cat's Eye till the end, it's worth it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye is a descriptive piece about a middle-aged artist recalling her girlhood friendships. Elaine is refreshingly not a pink, fluffy, girly girl (ie the Paris Hilton type). In fact, she discusses in the book how much better she relates to men then women. It is not a suprise, therefore, that she faced challenges in female friendships. As Atwood described the torment Elaine went through during these \\"friendships\\", and the results of it, I could not help but wonder if this was an autobiographical account. Her descriptions of Elaine's self mutilation at age nine were impeccable and turned my stomach, and I felt the same emotions the main character was feeling. But, this is what a good book is supposed to do.The nine year old Elaine is in a position in which no one can help her in. Her mother, brother, father, and teachers cannot help her. The torment the trio of girls inflict upon Elaine is a silent, sneaky one, the type that only young girls can master. They always look like little girls just playing, when in reality the wounds being inflicted are just as significant as a broken bone. The inability of adults to intervene is profoundly realistic. The isolation Elaine feels as a result is what forces her to fend for herself, and eventually surpass her tormenter in strength. After which, they become \\"friends\\" again, and Cordelia gets whats coming to her (although this was very heartbreaking). This tormenter-turned friend and her memory haunt Elaine throughout her adulthood.What Elaine wants more than anything is closure, at this late date. How many of us have unresolved relationships with former friends? Probably most of us. When it becomes obvious that this closure will remain unfulfilled, Elaine's realization of this reality is very well conveyed. I, as the reader, was just as disappointed as Elaine that Cordelia had lost her \\"tendency to exist\\". The subtle but very real tragedy of lost chances to repair relationships comes to the forefront when we realize that our friend is gone for good, and will remain ever after a memory. Will Elaine be able to move on? Like many of us, it appears that Elaine will always carry Cordelia with her as an integral part of her being.This book takes patience, and is not an easy read. However, it is rich in content, description, and imagery. Atwood has a gift, and I can only thank her for sharing it with us."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"What a wonderful novel! Her prose flows like poetry and draws the reader in from beginning to end. It saddened me to leave Elaine in the end."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye brings one to a realm which most of us are familiar of--childhood.

It discusses things that happen, yet no one talks about.The secrets that go on in a young girl's life are now told. Almost eerie, I would not believe it if I had not expirienced the same. Mysterious and breathtaking. Definately one of my favorite books, I urge you to read it."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Atwood recalls effortlessly what it is like to be a preteen girl trying desparately to be liked by your peers. Her memories are so vividly detailed that this book takes a while to get through--you will want to savor it to do it justice.Elaine, a celebrated middle-aged artist, returns to Toronto, where she grew up. While there, she relives her childhood memories through a series of flashbacks. Through these memories she comes to understand herself and her work much better. Elaine realizes, as does the reader, that the things that happen in our childhood stay with us forever, shaping our lives and choosing the paths we take."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"An intreguing plot merging past with present that was studied for a year 11 literature course.

The Madonna imagery is particulary striking. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I had to read Cat's Eye for A'level exam, and I must say that from the first line &quot;Time is not a line&quot; I was captivated. This book not only tells the story of a girl growing up and her struggles, but about life. &quot;Nothing ever goes away&quot; to me was one of the key phrases in the novel. It tells us that in life no matter how much we try to get rid of the past, it's always there , similar to how Cordelia was always there somehow."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is the story of some of the pains that childhood can bring. Very true to life in my opinion. It's the story of a little girl who has never had real friends before and when her parents settle down in a home she is thrown into a life she has never known. She doesn't know how girls are supposed to be treat. So her friends shamelessley bully and torture and this changes the course of her life forever. She becomes a feminist artist and marries twice. She also has an affair with one of her teachers. The girls who bullied her changed her life forever she will never know what it will be like to grow old with friends who are close...an exellent book."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Often overshadowed by its more famous sister, Cat's Eye is a book about coming to terms with one's past actions. One of the things I loved about this book is that no character is cast either as 'the bad guy' or 'the good guy'. Everyone in the book is very human -- petty, selfish, confused and blundering through life just hoping to make the best decisions possible. The book is a complexly interwoven tapestry of time, emotion and thought. I wouldn't reccommend it for everyone, though. Often, this sort of book doesn't have wide appeal. If you have enjoyed previous Atwood books, or would enjoy an intensely introspective book, this is definately a book to read."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This is a gentle story, partly coming of age and partly of interpersonal relationships. It is the story of Elaine Risley.Elaine is an artist who returns to Toronto for a retrospective of her work. Her art work is based on her life experiences so in learning of her life, we get an idea of what's behind her art.The story is divided into parts with flashbacks into Elaine's childhood. Early on, she remembers constantly moving due to her father's position as a forest insect field researcher. When he gets a job as a college professor, things stabilize.As a little girl, her only companion was her older brother, Stephen. She longed for having friends of her own. When the family settled in Toronto, she became friends with three other girls.Cordelia dominated the group. She is a demanding and, often cruel but the little girls accept her. Elaine is vulnerable, fearful of speaking her own mind and goes along with whatever Cordelia demands. Eventually, Elaine took a stand, only to fall back into Cordelia's control.One of the other girls is Grace Smeath. Elaine is often invited to their home for playtime or for dinner. They have unusual rules such as the number of tissues that can be used after going to the toilet.Mrs. Smeath becomes one of Elaine's favorite subjects for her art. In one of her art pieces, Mrs. Smeath is covered with tissues. Later, when Elaine has an art show, a woman enters the room and begins shouting. Elaine thought it might be Mrs. Smeath's daughter bur it was only a deranged woman.Elaine develops a fascination for women's issues and attends women only functions. She has a deep interest in the Virgin Mary and the Virgin Mary becomes another favorite subject of her art.We learn of Elaine through her thoughts, her friendships and interests. Her life story is something that will uplift the reader.Women might enjoy the book and feel exhilarated by Elaine's success in coming out of her shell. Men might read this to understand women better."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's Eye is amazing in it's nuances. Atwood is the queen of creating a story that never peaks, but never quite bottoms out, a steady heart beat the whole way. In Cat's Eye, I felt like I was told a story of the life of a woman, Elaine, who ruminated on all the details of her life without ever becoming insufferable. She describes each person who has touched her life with offhand comments and wit, throwing out quote after memorable quote. Even the characters that are only noticed for a moment, have awesome description, such as \\"She is post everything. She is what will come after post.\\"I felt her unspoken heart break as I read through her youth, occasionally transvering back to her middle age, where she had to deal with the subtle frustrations of the pink elephants of double standard that come with being a woman. Atwood is the master of planting little seeds of thought, and crafting an intricate world of reality around her characters. The book ended masterfully, creating and merging Elaine into an actual person, from her youth to her present, in the starlight. \\"There's old light and there's not much of it. But there's enough to see by.\\""},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I enjoyed this novel. It's a \\"good read.\\" Reading about \\"mean girls\\" that hover around young girls rang true. I remember my two best friends deciding to ignore me one day on a field trip for no apparent reason. They wouldn't talk or seat next to me. Elaine's experiences are much more severe but her state of mind at the time seemed familiar.Don't expect the great North American novel, but do expect a really personal glimpse into the main character's formative life."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"This was a wonderful read about the growing pains that most young women go through and the way that we learn to become functioning adults. I remember girls from my childhood that acted very much like Cordelia and Elaine. I think this would be a great book for girls in high school to read to give insight into their own world."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I've read Cat's Eye four times. Each time, I find the words Ms. Atwood uses and the way she weaves them together a delicious feast. It is rather like being served a many-coursed meal with each tantalizing dish more exquiste than the last. There is also a certain &quot;feeling&quot; I always carry from the story, a feeling that can only be appreciated fully in the mature years of one's womanhood looking back on one's girlhood &quot;friendships.&quot; I love it too, perhaps, because I know that Margaret Atwood doesn't care if I, as a reader liked it, so much as she as a writer, had to write it. It's my favorite Atwood to date and I've read 'em all."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Cat's eye is a view of a life story. Atwood's handling of the parallel narrators, the middle-aged Elaine whose mind wanders back and forth in time, and the growing-up one with her restricted view of her own life is superb. We feel we are growing up with her, from a never-ending looking childhood to a sudden adulthood. Cat's eye is also a record of the passing of time from the 40's to the 80's recognized just in the clothes worn by the characters. Descriptions of smells and colours all through the novel make it so vivid. I loved this novel."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Atwood is truly the greatest. Her female characters are always so multi-faceted and powerful, they seem to bounce off the page.Cat's Eye shows with disturbing accuracy the power roles that exist in the friendships of little girls, and how these relationships often continue to affect women well into their lives.If you liked this book, read The Robber Bride, which is also wonderful, and in some ways, completes the other side of the equation Atwood has begun."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"I love the mood of this book.

However, if you spend most of the novel waiting for Checkov's gun to go off, you will be disappointed.

It does not typify womens' relationships, and it is extremely frustrating to read, because the main character is a real sissy. She's been mistreated by her friends as a child, yet keeps hoping to run into them again. It makes little sense. There is no climax or real story-line.

C.Donkin and G.Powell, two very embittered English students."},{"Title":"Cats Eye","review":"Reading Margaret Atwood -her work, the \\"cats eye\\" was emotive in a vituperative out pouring of all that wants to be seemingly human and ratiocinatively inhuman in torrents that assemble through the whip of the persona in fragment.Novel plods warily, through characters in the guise of the selves. Ambi-orthodoxy of the characters insitu, is grudgingly carried on through discontinuities, leaving the stream of narratives palpitating in discontent. Time seethes through abstractions of vertigo, hanging individual particles to a levy a trend that stays on in a momentum of individuations.There is a pressurized attack to transport the present in abject shocks of being humans, levitating back to a slow development of the past, leaving the beginning so startling and then again leaving the place mellow in a beginning.The consonants of being filially attached to a brilliant paternity and a subdued maternity impinge the elan of growing up to a matrix, which traces the leftovers of what's absorbed in a normative.The vacuum of a needy person wanting to fill a myth to relate the entirety of the self is subverted to an attachment, which tags on to the friend's anglicanised form of worship. The aversion to it forms the terra-incognito of the conscious below thresholds.The repression of the native psyche allegorises the Risleyian development to the \`still of life'. Is life ever still?? No it isn't! Every still is moving. The movement is vicarious in dialogues of celebration. The angst of growing up as a body, to be in a body, to be a body is thwarted in sublimity to subliminal intrusions that stay subdued and the torrent in ferment is forever going on as stills.The body never grows up-only the art does and warps into the canvas as tangled intimations of childhood, maturing the pubic to shades of a black Diaspora.Its disheartening to probe the stellar pores of the male psyche as they tend to stereotype a tendency that atrophies in intellections, objective and diffident to the within and to objectives that divine the anthropomorphic into impastos of arresting Oedipus's.Cosmological nuances and body hermeneutics mingle in aberrations, which keep jutting, thrusting and opening the body into art psychic. It's ironic in jestor-ship to obliterate the ballocks to gyenopathic angst's in simulation.From a sudden juxtaposition of the present, there's a shallow mellowing into the past with patches of present in between. The narratives in earlier development lead the reader guessing, at some point of time later on there would be a momentous union of Cordeila and Risley. But it does not turn out that way and leaves their meeting point as a plot left over in indigestion.The denouement of signification is rather natural in course as though nothing has happened. The only twist of a difference is Stephen's tragic death so unnatural as it stands out quite raving and different from the whole novel.Stephen's descent into eternity to be particles of after life is a mausoleum of digression and existing forever as a story quite different in rite. Whether they add on or diminish the periphery is mooted to introspection.Risley's development into an avant-gardist is buildgrunsroman in effort and kunstlerroman in effect. \`Still Life' is an era wanting to refract in a subjective mortality of being frozen but chaotic and moving to the intimate that wants the immortal"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"It is surprising to me how many people assume that \`On Liberty' was written before or during the American Revolution - Mill was certainly influenced by the spirit of American liberty, which was variously romanticised and adapted in Britain and Europe during the nineteenth century. Published in 1859, \`On Liberty' is one of the primary political texts of the nineteenth century; perhaps only the writings of Marx had a similar impact, and of the two, in today's world, Mill's philosophy seems the one that is triumphant.One of the interesting ideas behind \`On Liberty' is that this may in fact be more the inspiration of Harriet Taylor (later Mrs. J.S. Mill) than of Mill himself; Taylor wrote an essay on Toleration, most likely in 1832, but it remained unpublished until after her death. F.A. Hayek (free-market economist and philosopher) noticed this connection. Whether this was the direct inspiration or not, the principles are similar, and the Mills were rather united in their views about liberty.\`On Liberty' is more of an extended essay than a book - it isn't very long (104 pages of the text in the Norton Critical Edition, edited by David Spitz). It relates as a political piece to his general Utilitarianism and political reform ideology. A laissez faire capitalist in political economy, his writing has been described as \`improved Adam Smith' and \`popularised Ricardo'. Perhaps it is in part the brevity of \`On Liberty' that gives it an enduring quality.There are five primary sections to the text. The introduction sets the stage philosophically and historically. He equates the histories of classical civilisations (Greece and Rome) with his contemporary England, stating that the struggle between liberty and authority is ever present and a primary feature of society. He does not hold with unbridled or unfettered democracy, either (contrary to some popular readings of his text) - he warns that the tyranny of the majority can be just as dangerous and damaging toward a society as any individual or oligarchic despotism. Mill looks for a liberty that permits individualism; thus, while democracy is an important feature for Mill, there must be a system of checks and balances that ensures individual liberties over and against this kind of system. All of these elements receive further development in subsequent sections.The second section of the text is \`Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion'. Freedom of speech and expression is an important aspect here. Mill presents a somewhat radical proposition that even should the government and the people be in complete agreement with regard to coercive action, it would still be an illegitimate power. This is an important consideration in today's world, as governments and people contemplate the curtailment of civil liberties in favour of increased security needs. The possibility of fallibility, according to Mill, makes the power illegitimate, and (again according to Mill) it doesn't matter if it affects many or only a few, people today or posterity. It is still wrong. Mill develops this argument largely by using the history of religious ideas and religious institutions, in addition to the political (since the two were so often inter-related).The third section is perhaps the best known and most quoted, \`Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being'. It is perhaps a natural consequence of Enlightenment thinking that individuality over communal and corporate identity would dominate. Our world today goes back and forth between individual and communal identities (nationality, regionality, employment, church affiliation, school affiliation, sports teams, etc.). Mill's ideas of individual are very modern, quite at home with the ideas of modern political and civil individuality, with all of the responsibilities.Mill states, \`No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions.' He recognises the increased limitations on individual liberty given that we do live in communal settings, but this does not hinder the idea of individuality and individual liberty, particularly as it pertains to thoughts and speech. Mill explores various ideas of personal identity and action (medieval, Calvinist, etc.) to come up with an idea of individuality that is rather modern; of course, this is political personhood that pre-dates the advent of psychology/psychoanalytic theory that will give rise to a lot more confusion for the role of identity and personhood in society.The fourth primary section looks theoretically at the individual in community, \`Of the Limits to the Authority of Society Over the Individual'; the final section looks at specific applications. Mill discounts the idea of social contract while maintain that there is a mutual responsibility between individuals and community. Mill looks at the Temperance movements and laws as an example of bad laws (not only from the aspect of curtailment of liberty, but also for impractical aspects of enforcement); in similar examples, Mill looks at the role of society in regulating the life of the individual, calling on good government to always err on the side of the individual.Mill puts it very directly -- Individuals are accountable only to themselves, unless their actions concern the interests of society at large. Few in the Western world would argue with this today; however, we still live in a world where \`thought police' are feared, and \`political correctness' is debated as appropriate or not with regard to individual liberties.Mill wrote extensively beyond this text, in areas of philosophy (logic, religion, ethics). The particular text I use here, the Norton Critical Edition, has a good annotated text of \`On Liberty', a copy of Harriet Taylor's essay, \`On Tolerance', and a criticism section, including five essays written against Mill's ideas and constructions, and four essays in favour. There is also a useful bibliography and index.This should probably be required reading in civics classes, if not in the pre-university years for students, then certainly in the early university years."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"J.S. Mill has written the best promulgation of classical liberalism in his book &quot;On Liberty&quot; (OL). Although a socialist himself, many of the ideas in OL are actually tenets of modern libertarianism (also called classical liberalism). Mill states that the only reason that force can be used on any man is to prevent harm to others. I consider &quot;focre&quot; to be either social or economic. Mill saw it as only social, which explains his socialism.Not to detract from Mill or OL, the book is a resounding defense of civil-liberties. OL completes modern democratic theory as promulgated by John Locke in his &quot;Two Treatises of Government.&quot; While Locke argues for some kind of democracy reminiscent of Athens, Mill qualifies Locke's point by protecting the minority from the majority. This book should be read by Americans who want to know more about freedom, and by our elected officials.Sadly, it's our elected oficials who probably won't get it."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Few works argue as forcefully and eloquently for individual liberty as this one book. Written by one of England's greatest humanitarians, philosophers, and social scientists, this is one of the great classics in Western political philosophy. This book uses plain reason, clear logic, and objective reasoning to argue that the freedom of speech and its related freedoms such as freedom of assembly, press, petition, and religion, are ultimately beneficial to not only the individual, but to society as well. The latter argument goes as such; society is composed of individuals. Hence the knowledge and wisdom of a society is composed of the contributions of every individual. In order for a society to determine the truth, or best opinions on any particular topic, it must be allowed to see/hear all the opinions possible, which is only possible if everyone is allowed to voice their opinion.This reviewer read this book in high school, and was quite impressed with it back then. It is understandable by most high school seniors. This book should be required reading for all human beings."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This book may appear without reserves and by own right - next to Milton \` s Aeropagitica\\", Locke ' s \\"Essay about the Civil Government\\", Rousseau \`s Social Contract\\" in the enviable gallery of works of political combat that, still determine capital influence on the mankind. This is a vibrant and passionate defense about the thinking and expression liberties, a vehement apology of the tolerance and respect beliefs or dissident minorities, a fearless recovery around the human spontaneity and singularity against the exerted oppression by authorities, costumes or public opinion.Under the lucid perspective of the elapsed years, this was a visionary text whose importance perhaps still has not been evaluated in all its wholeness."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"What J.S Mill proposes in \\"On Liberty\\" is still now convincing and interesting and I believe it should draw more attention than is the case today. True, Mill's ideas are not easily applicable to practical problems and his arguments are sometimes so defective as to be justifiably called \\"fallacies,\\" but still his fundamental principle is noteworthy and defensible: You can think, speak and do, as you like, unless you do any harm to others. Mill claims that this freedom, rather than spoiling our society, contributes to the progress of human beings in the long run, and this in the sense that so long as we humans do not achieve absolute infallibility, it is nothing other than human diversity that prevents us from falling into limited attitudes and courting fatal consequences. I agree from the bottom of my heart with this idea of his, and hope more attention will be paid to the book and its philosophy."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"A very definite view of legal rights, in that no interference from government should be permitted, save for when the actions of one harm others. This, of course, brings in questions about what constitutes 'harm', but all in all, a forceful argument for absolute free speech, unhampered by any law. I think this is interesting given the later restrictions placed on free speech. I was also interested to see how this book is rated on the high end of the 'difficult to read' scale, because I found Mill easy to follow and quite straightforward."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Have you ever tried to read that fun twentieth-century philosophy, especially the Frenchy-continental strain that is so loaded with jargon and neologisms that you feel as if it was deliberately created to make you feel stupid? The alternative is that the arc philosophy from structuralism through postmodernism is obtuse because there is nothing left to say so you have to hide behind \\"Being-in-itself\\" and you have to drink vodka until being becomes nothingness.Mill's masterwork is nothing of the sort. It is a short, structured argument written in defense of a premodern libertarianism as \\"liberty\\". I won't gloss on it too much here, since others more qualified can talk about his ideas. My copy is marked up with individual passages highlighted and !!!ed, but it is not in isolation that these passages have strength. Mill is able to define his conception of Liberty very directly, and he is not utopian since he senses the limits of Liberty as he defines them. These limits necessitate a state structure that in my reading, is incompatible with the modern conception of Libertarianism. The problems were evident 150 years ago, and I read it as more against bureaucracy per se than as against Government as a whole.Overall, readings and interpretations can vary across readers and across time, but this is a very important and interesting book to help build or challenge a world-view."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"An advocate for the development of individuality/ human potentials for social progress, the author believes and emphatically promotes liberty as essential foundation for freedom of conscience, free will as well as diligent exploration of diverse and opposing/contradicting ideas. He warns against mental complacency/laziness/conformity in many forms of public opinions, custom, doctrines and religioius dogmas with underlying notion of infallibility. He calls them \\"despotism\\" that hinders human advancemen and also quotes \\"slumber of a decided opinion\\" as dangers of uncontested ideas. Reading intoductory biography also helps to understand the personal background that influenced his political philosophy. His beliefs in liberty of one's actions are qualified in the sense and context of individual responsibility for self and \\"others\\", for example, he calls it \\"moral crime\\" against the offspring and society to \\"bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able to\\" provide education. In our current culture where McDonald (not individuals or parents) is blamed for obesity and some people claim entitlement about having multiple children even when they are being born into an environment that will most likely cause suffering and cycling through welfare system, John Stuart Mill's ideas of responsible liberty sadly cause feelings of disorientation. A psychologist once said, (perhaps, Rollo May?) we have to choose between \\"neurotic necessity and responsible freedom\\" This was a great read."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force until 1871 in his native country. As for primitive societies we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the growing restrictions on freedom in many Western nations this is a book well worth reading again. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This is Mill's statement of the ' one very simple principle' he wished to establish in ' On Liberty' \\" The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion or control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. The principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively , in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do, or forebear because it will be better for him to do,because it will make him happier, because , in the opinion of others, to do so would be wise or even right... The only part of the conduct of anyone, for which he is amenable to society,is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself , his idnependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.This is in a nutshell the creed of Mill's faith in ' On Liberty ' Gertrude Himmelfarb in her brilliant introduction explains how that faith developed in part out of the personal situation in which Mill found himself after years of close friendship with the - then married Harriet Taylor after her husband died, became his wife. One great controversy relates to the vast credit Mill gave her with being a full partner in every way in creating this work. The social isolation both suffered as a result of their relationship is an important element in Mill's fierce defence of the individual's right to be free of social coercion, and opinion. Another central element in the development of Mill's thought is his reaction to the Utilitarianism his father John Mill and Jeremy Bentham instilled in Mill from childhood. 'The greatest happiness for the greatest number principal' is rejected by Mill as first basis for social action. Mill in effect says that it is not society's business to be a Grand Inquisitor and bring it bread and circuses to make it happy. Happiness is not the first principle any longer in Mill's thought rather individual liberty is. The sole curb on such individual liberty is when it leads to the harming of others. This faith of Mill can be recognized today as part and parcel of the fundamental ideology of democratic societies.This work is thus one of the fundamental political classics which form the Western political tradition. And it is one of those works which should be part of the curriculum of any true liberal arts education. The question of the excesses of this principle and whether Mill in his thought has provided sufficient check to it by consideration of other human values isa very real and debatable one even today."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In the Introduction to \\"On Liberty,\\" Currin Shields, an English egghead, bemoans the fact that Mill's most \\"famous\\" essay is \\"more talked about than read.\\"I'm surprised it is even talked about, and I am very much NOT surprised that hardly anyone reads it. Mill takes about a hundred and twenty pages to say what could be (and was) summed up in an epigram: People should be free to do whatever they want, as long as it does not harm anyone else.Not only does Mill subject the reader to pages and pages of supererogatory writing, but his prose is the epitome of Victorian verbosity, with more modifiers, clauses, footnotes, and parentheticals than there are alcoholics in Butte, Montana.

Mill is the originator of the thoughtless confounding of liberal and socialist ideas that led to the decline of the living standards of the English people. Mill is the great advocate of Socialism. All the arguments that could be expounded in favour of socialism are expounded here. Marx, Lasalle and Engels are scarcely of importance. The blood of 100 million ultimately dripped from his pen (see the black book of communism). Liberty means freedom from taxes, too many laws and respect for property rights not the right to welfare or necessarily to vote. It is no surprise to see neo-con Himmelfarb enthusing over this book considering the Kristol family are fans of the tyrant Trotsky.Of course as an agnostic he advocates that socially, individuals should be privately able to do whatever they like. Unfortunately in order for a society to be free from too many laws the people must abide by unwritten laws and that means the laws of the Abrahamic God. If a village does not want to tolerate homosexuals then they should be free not to and be able to drive them out, it's called the social contract. As George Washington wisely put it 'in order to be a truly free people,we must be a religious people'. J.S.

The book is certainly helpful for those studying philosophy or attempting to gain a better understanding of political tradition. However, this edition is very poor. The footnotes are mixed in with the body of the text, so there's no way to know where they end. The description on the back sounds like it was written by a young student, which makes me suspicious about the quality of the printing. The text is difficult to follow because of its arrangement on the page. The printers divide words whenever possible and use hyphens instead of dashes.My complaints may sound minor, but I have not seen problems like this anywhere else--certainly not from a company that calls itself an authority on \\"classic books\\" or advertises \\"beautiful\\" production.

The rest if their list is undeerstandable, but to lump Mill with Marx and Engels is to say you slept through your Western Civilization classes.Mill is a must read for anyone who wants to know how modern Western Civilization got where it is today, the roots and fruits of a free democratic society; and those who oppose him and it."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"JSM's On Liberty certainly stands among the classic works of the Age of Reason. Mill's encyclical is a perfect example of the tendency of the Enlightenment to believe something to be reasonable if it is couched in the proper language.Mill walks a tenuous path between Locke &amp; Bentham, taking up a defense of liberty, but unwilling to risk his utilitarian street cred. Thus, we have beautiful assertions such as &quot;the unchallenged idea is that which is in most danger&quot;, along side a perverse and logically twisted injection of &quot;duty&quot; into what is otherwise a syllogistic approach.Mill insists on a Lockian sphere of rights approach, then qualifies it in the cases of children (up to whatever age the law defines them), as well as in those societies that aren't developed enough for liberty (by Mill's definition?). Liberty is also to be restricted in such cases as a man might &quot;sin by omission&quot; and &quot;fail to help his Brother.&quot; These wonderful sentiments are followed by more cognitive dissonance, various ad hominem attacks on Christianity (particularly those sinister Catholics), and a lot of hand-waving about polygamy.As an aside, I imagine that G.K. Chesteron had Mill in mind when he wrote &quot;The worst judge of all is the man now most ready with his judgements; the ill-educated Christian turning gradually into the ill-tempered agnostic, entangled in the end of a feud of which he never understood the beginning, blighted with a sort of hereditary boredom with he knows not what, and already weary of hearing what he has never heard&quot;Throughout the work, Mill's passions and prejudices skew his arguments. It is a fascinating display of intellectual agility, to watch him extolling freedom while restraining it; to see him preach tolerance, and even go so far as to tolerate intolerance. Note that this last feat reminds me of the Kobyashi Maru Strategy - win the unwinnable game by changing the rules. The typical cultural relativist will divide by zero when approached with the self-contradiction of the tolerant society. Mill side-steps the issue and goes along his merry way, proclaiming not a full page later that &quot;there is always hope when people are forced to listen to both sides.&quot; It's refreshing to hear a champion of responsible liberty who's ready to practice coercion.Ultimately, Mill produces a monumental work that speaks volumes about more than its subject. His observations are supremely valuable, even when they are irrational, but most of the time he manages to define a system in which the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are balanced to his particular tastes.As a final note, unlike the introduction for Clausewitz' On War (another Penguin Classic), the Introduction here has value. Gertrude Himmelfarb thoroughly ties together Mill, his physical and intellectual parents, Mill's wife, his society, and peers, and manages to wrap the whole thing up in 42 pages."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This Kindle book was clearly created from a text file and little, if any, editing or formatting was done for the Kindle.Paragraphs are fixed width, so unless you size your screen to the paragraphs, you will have lines breaking all over the place.

Many of Mills' words have passed into common usage in the years since the book was published in 1859. To quote one famous example: \\"Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\"Mill writes in a florid, orotund style that often defies the rapid reader. One frequently has to plod through an over-punctuated verbal and syntactic thicket twice or thrice in order to extract the meaning of a passage. In this respect, Mill was perhaps no worse than other philosophical writers of his day - or indeed of any day.However \\"On Liberty\\" is definitely worth persevering with; not only for its exposition of the subject, but also for some wonderful passages of writing. Mill has a gift for simple exposition of complex philosophical questions.Liberty is always under threat, even in countries perhaps best known for valuing and promoting individual liberty - at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, if not in their practice. That might sound incredible, but one has only to reflect on the encroachments on liberty occasioned by the \\"war on terror\\" and the general support of the majority for such encroachments. In this case both governments and governed conspire to deny others liberty; the former by diktat, demagoguery and secrecy and the latter by strident bigotry.But, if I might be permitted a facetious remark, perhaps those countries have taken Mill too much to heart where he asserts that \\"despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided that the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"Such a patronising, indeed ignorant, view is repugnant to libertarians today, but it was a commonplace view among officials and churchmen in the high noon of the British Empire. But lest we feel too smug about the superiority of our own age, I will observe that we can see echoes of similar odious attitudes today in foreign policy, and the same will no doubt be true of future dominant powers yet to come onto the world stage.However, to be fair to Mill, his passing comment on \\"barbarians\\" is only one very minor part of this great book. More to the point, he asserts strongly in the book that views which are considered to be settled truth in one era may often be rejected in another. He goes on to say that conventional wisdom should always be rigorously tested and not merely assumed to be true on the authority of others.There are also large parts of the world where freedom of expression, and indeed freedom of thought, are suppressed. It is to be greatly hoped that \\"On Liberty\\" will one day be as influential there as it has been elsewhere. Mill himself states eloquently (but perhaps optimistically) that while the truth may be suppressed many times, it will ultimately prevail.After an introductory Chapter, Mill discusses liberty under four broad Chapters that I will touch on briefly below.In the Chapter on liberty of thought and expression, Mill has a swipe at the Christian faith. Some believers may be offended by this discussion, but why should they? The truth should be able to withstand the assaults of opposing views - indeed (as Mill says) it should welcome contrary views both as a means of strengthening the truth, and as a means of rooting out error.Moreover, Mill was writing in the middle of the 19th century, just before the publication of Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when Christianity in England enjoyed many advantages and official protections. He quotes the example of a man who went to prison for writing an anti-Christian sentiment on a gate - an exemplary message to others who might be tempted to express their true thoughts.In the Chapter on individuality Mill maintains that liberty of thought and expression must necessarily lead to the desirability of people living as they choose, providing that they do not infringe the liberty or well-being of others. However, the arguments in this chapter are less well-presented than in the former chapter. Mill also makes an assertion that most people would reject today: \\"No government by a democracy.....ever did, or could, rise above mediocrity.\\" However it is important to remember that Mill wrote shortly after the extension of the voting franchise in Great Britain, when fears about democratic government were widely discussed, since experience of democratic government in modern industrial societies was quite limited at that time.In the Chapter on the limits to the authority of society over the individual, Mill makes the point that while the individual is sovereign over himself, the society in which he lives and from which he derives protection and other benefits also has rights over the individual. The individual is not accountable to society for his actions if they affect him alone; but as soon as one person's conduct adversely affects the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it.The wide-ranging implications of this principle are discussed comprehensively and lucidly - with good reason, because the allocation of rights and responsibilities between the individual and society is the most important business of coherent groups of human beings.In the final chapter, Mill discusses the practical application of his ideas, accepting that this is not always an easy matter."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In many ways, one is tempted to think that there is no such thing as liberalism alive in America today. It would do many well to read the work of the Englishman Mill in order to understand much of what is called both \\"liberalism\\" as well as \\"individual liberty.\\" In addition, one of the growing issues of the contemporary political landscape in America is a polarization which is wholly unnecessary when analysis is applied the current plane of consideration. The reason for this conspicuous lack of reason for polarization is made obviously clear when one reads a work on liberal thought like that of Mill's. For Mill, individual liberty is a question both of social and political proportions, demanding a lack of interference by both government and social pressures. Additionally, he is keen in his analysis of the need for humility when it comes to humanity's apprehension of the Truth, thus necessitating free speech as a vehicle for the continual realization of those parts of the Truth which man so often forgets because of personal bias.However, the analysis is weak insofar as it also denies the need for structures to educate humanity in a fallen world. His criteria for legal and social sanctions does overlook the necessity to draw on tradition to properly shape those in the world (while maintaining individual dignity). While he acknowledges that it would be preposterous to deny the necessity of interrelationships and sharing of experience, Mill remains somewhat weak on the necessity of tradition and community as related to individual liberty. However, on the whole, the work presents a decent overview of the need to acknowledge individual dignity through the liberty of the individual. Indeed, all communal criticisms aside, On Liberty does indeed serve as a corrective against crass traditionalism which propagates itself without true individual consent and embrace. Therefore, even in its weakness, it remains strong as a key text on the primacy of the human individual as the recipient and follower of the Truth. In a day when liberty is shouted by groups who have no interest in talking to each other, such a small text would do well to make all groups realize that our American (and indeed Western) goals aren't that different, that we are united in trying to express human dignity through the individuals."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Unlike the clueless and completely contradictory rantings of &quot;white_anglo_saxon_muslim&quot;, this book is entirely in favour of the freedom of the individual - personal freedoms that are entirely opposed to the thoughts of socialism and the notion of a government or body removing those freedoms in favour of a &quot;greater good&quot;.This book argues that it is not the role of anyone else to decide what is best for any one person, but that person's decision.

He believed that some worrying tendencies could be observed in the England society of his time, and tried to warn others about them.The author basically explains his ideas regarding the preservation of individual liberties, not only due to the fact that they are rights owed to everyone, but also because they benefit society as a whole.For example, when he says that liberty of thought and of discussion must be preserved, he tells us that &quot;Wrong opinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument: but fact and arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be brought before it&quot;. How can mistaken beliefs or actions be proven wrong, if dissent is forbidden?. The loss for society is clear: &quot;If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth; if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error&quot;.In order to preserve the liberties included in the concept of Civil Liberty, the author points out that there must be limits to the action of the Government. He says that &quot;The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others&quot;. Any other reason is simply not good enough. Thus, Stuart Mill highlights the rights of the individual, but also the limit to those rights: the well-being of others.&quot;On Liberty&quot; is not too long, and I think you are highly likely to enjoy it, if you can get past the first few pages. The problem is that even though the ideas in this book are quite modern, the language is somehow dated. But then, we must remember that &quot;On Liberty&quot; was written a long time ago...Notwithstanding that, do your best to read the first pages, and you will realize that after a while it will be much easier. This book is well-worth the effort you need to make at the beginning, because it is even more relevant today than when it was first published, in 1859.Are individual rights important?. Why?. Do they have a limit?. You will found the answer for these questions, and much more, in &quot;On Liberty&quot;. What else can I say?. I believe this is a book that will help you to reflect on many important issues... I certainly can't think of a better reason to read it. All in all, recommended :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This Kindle edition has an introduction written more than a century ago that offers no insight into Mill's essay and deals almost entirely with the relationship between Mill and Harriet Taylor. It is therefore primarily of general rather than academic interest.\\"On Liberty\\" is one of the most important books on political thought of the nineteenth century. Fortunately for the 21st century reader it is also one of the most accessible. Mill was a libertarian who chose not to base his defence of liberty on natural rights but on his own revised version of utilitarianism:\\"I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions...grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being.\\"This enables Mill to argue that freedom is needed if man is to be able to explore all the avenues of human development that allow the human race to progress. Total freedom is impossible so what determines the legitimate boundaries of freedom? Mill distinguishes between self-regarding and other-regarding actions. The former should never be interfered with and the latter subject to limitation only if they harm the legitimate rights of others.For Mill free thought is a self-regarding action which should not be curtailed, and free thought is virtually useless without free speech. Mill then proceeds to add a utilitarian argument in favour of free speech: if an opinion is silenced then mankind is necessarily the loser whether the opinion is true or false. He advances a number of arguments to support this, concluding with the claim that a climate of freedom is essential for \\"great thinkers\\" and \\"it is as much, and even more indispensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental stature they are capable of.\\" He has no truck with paternalists seeking to guide people's thoughts in the \\"right\\" direction. He was equally hostile to the idea that people had the right not to be offended; hence he opposed the blasphemy law. The single case Mill gives of an acceptable limitation of free speech is the case of corn-dealers and an excited mob. An opinion expressed in a newspaper that corn-dealers are \\"starvers of the poor\\" is legitimate, but the same view stated to an angry mob outside the corn-dealer's home may be limited if it \\"is a positive instigation to a mischievous act.\\"Mill concedes that actions cannot be as free as speech and seeks to establish the proper limits of freedom of action. Mill proposes that \\"the sole end for which mankind are warranted...in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" Because he rejects paternalism he opposes all interference with self-regarding actions. Mill would not have prevented people from taking drugs and he would have led the opposition to seat belt legislation. Mill even rejects state interference with liberty for the sake of crime prevention, e.g. poisons can be used for criminal purposes. Mill was willing to accept a register of their sale but not the banning of them. Mill believes we must not interfere with the \\"rights\\"of others but these are narrowly circumscribed and Mill makes it clear that \\"rights\\" are not the same as \\"interests\\". Hence cut-throat laissez-faire is legitimate. As for moral decency arguments Mill does say that sexual intercourse in public is unacceptable, and though fornication and gambling are acceptable he is in two minds about whether pimps and casino-owners should be allowed to operate. Mill says it is a difficult case that is on the borderline, but adds that in general we must resist attempts to limit behaviour for \\"moral\\" reasons because any such action is likely to be the thin end of the wedge.Though Mill is a very determined anti-paternalist he makes three exceptions: children, primitive societies and the disabled. Children must be guided until they reach maturity and they must be given compulsory education - something not given legislative force when he wrote. As for primitive societies, we must resist the notion that Mill was a typical Victorian believing in the \\"white man's burden\\" or inherent differences between races. He simply observed the reality of the world in the mid-nineteenth century but made it very clear any intervention in backward societies must be temporary with the aim to bring about self-government as soon as possible.Hence Mill was a much more determined libertarian than most modern writers on the subject. There is just one example where, at first sight, Mill may seem reactionary to modern readers. He wished to restrict the right to have children to those who could prove that they could support them. However, those who today wish others to be allowed to procreate at will do so on the grounds of human rights. Mill based his theories on utilitarianism, and not on rights. There was no welfare state when Mill wrote \\"On Liberty\\" and he was concerned with the well-being of children born to people without the means to support them.In view of the alleged growing restrictions on freedom in many democratic countries this is a book well worth reading. In particular I like Mill's argument that every restriction on freedom is the thin end of the wedge, providing a justification for further restrictions."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In his classic essay \\"On Liberty\\", John Stuart Mill deals with the issue of \\"civil liberties\\" -not the metaphysical issue of \\"free will\\". While most attacks on civil liberties have historically occurred from the right within the context of a tyrannical or an aristocratic rule, Mill deals with threats against liberty from within the institutions of democracy itself. The issue is especially relevant at a time when widespread domestic wiretapping and surveillance violates the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.The aim of early libertarians was to limit the power of the ruler over those governed; Mill, however, identifies a need to limit the power of elected governments and officials as well. Mill is not merely addressing the issue of \\"who should rule?\\", he seeks to establish limits on the power that government may exercise over minorities and individuals. His work is more relevant now than ever.While \\"government of the people\\" is an ideal to be aspired to, Mill argues that such an ideal is often not the case in fact. He argues that those exerting the power of the government -elected officials, bureaucrats, the judiciary -often develop their own interests. They are sometimes influenced by those constituencies in ways that are at odds with the interests and liberties of individuals or other groups.Mill makes no distinction between a tyranny of one and a tyranny of many. A tyrannical majority running roughshod over the rights of individuals and minorities is no less a tyrant because it is a majority, because it is elected, or because it is elected by a majority.While society may not tolerate criminal behavior, for example, society may not legitimately interfere with or suppress all non-conforming behaviors indiscriminately or because a majority may not approve. What then are the powers that society may legitimately exercise over the individual? Mill answers:\\"The only purpose for which power can be rightly exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\\"-J.S. Mill, On LibertyJames Madison -called the \\"Father of the Constitution\\" -may have anticipated Mill's ideas in his draft of the Bill of Rights -the first ten amendments to the Constitution. Implicit in the Bill of Rights is the recognition that the power of the state is a blunt instrument. Abused, it can oppress and repress individuals and minority groups alike. The Bill of Rights addresses this issue by guaranteeing \\"due process of law\\", limiting state power over individuals and groups, guaranteeing that groups and individuals may speak freely, worship freely.The Fourth Amendment specifically is a promise that our government made to us in its very founding:\\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\"-Fourth Amendment, Bill of Rights, U.S. ConstitutionLet's make something abundantly clear: there are no \\"inherent powers\\", \\"Implicit\\" authorizations\\" that would, in any way, overturn, limit, or repeal the Fourth Amendment. Many politicians are not only wrong about that, they may have deliberately lied about it. Moreover, Congress may not overrule the Fourth Amendment with statutory law. Constitutional Law is supreme and provisions in the Bill of Right are valid until amended as set out in the Constitution itself. Widespread domestic surveillance is illegal whatever is done by Congress ex post facto -and until the Constitution is amended, it will remain illegal. At last, ex post facto laws, themselves, are expressly forbidden by the Constitution.Mill is all the more remarkable for his insight into issues that remain contemporary. In every literate criticism of \\"special interest groups\\", PAC's, the gun lobby, the tobacco lobby, the Military/Industrial Complex, one sees the lasting influence of John Mill.On Liberty is essential reading for anyone interested in law, the principles of government, political science, political philosophy, indeed, freedom itself. It is also essential reading for anyone interested in learning about the intellectual underpinnings of Anglo-American civil liberties."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This edition is subtitled \\"Optimized for Kindle\\". I was therefore quite surprised that it lacked a table of contents. What does \\"optimized\\" mean in this context?"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This book deserves to be studied closely; I cannot praise too highly the man or his work. As Mill writes in his AUTOBIOGRAPHY, his education under his philosopher father James was perhaps the most tortuous experience imaginable for a young child, leaving the adolescent John with the impression that he was something of a facsimile of his father. Nevertheless, after much difficulty in assimilating what he was taught and defining who he was, the adult Mill respectfully stepped out from under his father's shadow and went on to make staggering intellectual contributions of his own. In this book, ON LIBERTY, Mill tackles the problem of \\"the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual.\\" With some reflection, it can be seen how important this question is, for its implications touch every part of our social and private lives. Unfortunately, few recognize its importance, and the question is more often decided by unthinking custom or self-interest than reason. With scrupulous rigor, and impeccable intellectual honesty, Mill asserts the absolute necessity of dissenting opinions, of diversity in all things, and the dangers of concentrated power, be it in the form of a dictator or a democratic majority. The problems treated in this short book are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Perennial political issues such as education reform, gun control, abortion, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly; the book abounds with other, more personal, lessons on life as well, not the least of which was later encapsulated by Wittgenstein as: \\"If you want to improve the world, improve yourself.\\""},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"In On Liberty, Mill attempts to define when the authority of society can rightly limit individuality and the &quot;sovereignty of the individual over himself.&quot; He writes that people are not accountable to society for actions that only concern themselves. The only means society has to express disapproval of such actions is through &quot;advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by other people if thought necessary by them for their own good.&quot; He also writes that the individual is accountable for actions that hurt others, and society can punish a person socially or legally as is deemed necessary for such actions. Mill observes, though, that sometimes when an action causes harm to others, such as when a person succeeds in a competitive job market, the general social good is positive, and there is no right to punish people for the harm caused. Throughout On Liberty, Mill's argument proceeds with a discussion of the appropriate level of authority that society should have over the individual, along with particular examples and applications of the theory, to clarify the meaning of his claims. The examples are just as relevant today as they were in Mill's time. Continuing political issues such as education reform, gun control, alcohol, freedom of speech, taxation, the role of government, etc., are addressed either directly or indirectly. Mill was ahead of his time. His book was insightful, thought-provoking and ahead of its time. The questions and viewpoints Mill argued are the same issues in political debates today. When reading On Liberty, I found myself reading the same paragraphs over again to understand his main issues and points. Also, in parts of the reading Mill never really comes across and answers his own questions he argued, but his ideas and arguments leave the reader thinking."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"America's defense department should take some of the billions spent on the stealth bomber or the B1 and spend it to make Arabic and Farsi translations of this book in the hundreds of thousands. We could pack the bomb bays of a squadron of stealth bombers with the translations and carpet the cities of Muslim countries with this treatise on freedom. This is The Book, folks. You cannot read this little book without it changing your life. It is an extended argument about freedom, about true morality, about freeing your mind, about untrammeling the possibility of peace and prosperity in the world. This is the book that lays out the path for treating other human beings with respect and opening the way toward progress in any and all societies. For the discussion of the \\"harm to others\\" principle alone, this book merits the world's attention and praise.Perhaps the most famous aspect of Mill's extended argument about liberty is his discussion of the \\"tyranny of the majority.\\" His argument grows from the long history of religious persecution suffered throughout Europe that led to book bans, bigotry, and even torture and burning at the stake for people who did not conform to the majority superstition, namely the dominant form of Christianity wherever one lived. Mill lived in a time when even the staid and relatively moderate views of the English Church forced people to conform their lives or face public humiliation and financial ruin, and sometimes lynching. The resulting dynamic was that free thought was thus discouraged and progress thwarted. Mill's point is that in such a psychological milieu, people are not mentally free to seek a better way. They are rather trammeled to superstition and the concomitant tyranny of the majority, the majority being emotionally dependent and mentally ham-strung by religion and religious fears and prejudices.America today is witnessing the truth of this dynamic through the virulent and underhanded tactics of the fundamentalist X-tian political right who seek to thwart medical research and impose a legislated theocracy in parts of the country. The effort to put dark-age arguments about \\"intelligent design\\" on a scientific par with evolutionary theory is a perfect and alarming example. Mill's argument in On Liberty was prescient in demonstrating what can happen when people allow religion to influence political life. The brand of literalist religion we see in America has been the bane of societies throughout history and respresents a true pragmatic evil on a scale far worse than any imagined \\"Satanic\\" sinfulness that Christians associate with popular and secular humanism. Fundamentalist religion, especially in the forms of Christian and Muslim extremism, is a societal cancer when viewed through the lense of reason and of Mill's enlightened utilitarianism. No society that allows religion to make in-roads to politics can flourish. Proof is in the failed Middle East, where no country can manage to pull its people out of poverty and squalor in spite of sitting on the world's richest oil reserves. Mill's argument in this small book speaks volumes about why Muslim countries are doomed to failure and why the Christian right in America (the blood cousins of Islamic radicals) represent the biggest and most un-American evil in our country's history. If America represents freedom, there can be no room for the \\"ten commandments\\" in the county court house.Highly recommended as a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I agree, how hard is it to put a table of contents in, it is very frustrating trying to navigate through this book."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty, defines the nature of civil liberty, and most importantly, the harm principl. He aims to give readers a better understanding of the nature and limits of power that can be exercised by society over individuals. The purpose of this book is to inform interested individuals about the rights of individuals and the limitations of the government. This book of philosophy was written almost 150 years ago. By reading the book, the reader is able to apply Mill's message and examples to our lives in America today. The ahead-of-the-times ideas that are in On Liberty can be related to our world because it discusses controversies that are still seen in our courtrooms today. Mill is able to accomplish his purpose because he uses many examples, thoughts, and theories about individual and social rights. He works through each of his ideas, looking at both sides of the issue to enable the reader to make their own informed decision about each matter. This book has a practical meaning because it allows the reader to develop and reason ideas about government power and when that power should be exercised over the people. Unfortunately, this book does have one draw back. Mill was a very educated man and wrote very well for his time. Yet today, our style and writing techniques are not the same as they were in the nineteenth century. This makes On Liberty a difficult book to read. His book is very decriptive, yet his wording is not easily understadable and some paragraphs have to be read two or three times to fully understand what he is writing about. Aside from his writing style, John Stuart Mill has put together an essay full of educated ideas about society and individuals. John Stuart Mill wrote an informative book geared towards an educated audience. He has achieved his purpose for the essay through the use of situations and examples that can be applied to real life cases still today.

Mill's primary concern was to address the potential problem of the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" posed by the emerging democratization of society. His concern was prompted specifically by de Toqueville's account of the USA. Mill is concerned not just with the way government could impose conformity to majority views but also with general social pressures for conformity. In opposition to the dangers of majoritarianism, Mill proposes 2 versions of the Harm principle; the first the basic idea that whatever doesn't cause harm is permitted. The second and more restrictive version emphasizes violation of duties to others. Mill argues his case very well, addressing both general principles and specific problems of contemporary British society. In line with his utilitarian approach, he argues vigorously that human improvement requires the type of freedom and tolerance implied by his Harm Principles. This is also in a real sense the weakness of On Liberty. Mill's version of utilitarianism is not the hedonistic utilitarianism of Bentham and his father, nor preference utilitarianism, but a more vague assertion of what is needed for human progression. Well written, and often quoted, this is one of the accessible major texts in the canon."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"The modern age is a dangerous age, an age in which we might be alienated from that individual independence in work and in mind which defines our humanity. Confronted by this crisis, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill offer the world diverging solutions: annihilate the existing world and march toward communism, or guard against the dangers of the existing world as we further embrace liberal democracy. Despite these divergent paths which arise from differing views on the driving force of history, both systems aim to rescue the supreme interest of our individual humanity-for Marx, this interest lies in reaching absolute prosperity for the material man, and for Mill, it lies in the search for absolute truth for the idealistic man.With its emphasis on individuality and diversity, Mill's theory is in a sense more encompassing than Marx's. Mill's theory, however, is fundamentally flawed in comparison to Marx's because of its ignorance of property as a danger against human liberty.Marx sees in the industrial age the death of the property-less class. This death is brought by the industrial age's five qualities: division of labor, accumulation of capital, competition, financial crisis, and monopoly. In this age, machineries and the division of labor reduce the skillful artisans to the proletariats who merely work on one monotonous element of production. The capitalists who own the machines enlarge their capital by exploiting the proletariat's labor, leaving them only with enough to eat. Competition forces capitalists to lower prices, but this is good only until each factory produces more than demanded and a financial crisis emerges. The small capitalists are reduced to the property-less as millions of workers are swept into deeper hell. Only the biggest capitalist survives, and he becomes the monopolist who can lower wages and raise prices at whim, destroying the lives of all. (Part 1, Bourgeois and Proletarians, Manifesto of the Communist Party)The above scenario is unavoidable because the accumulation of more capital is the only end of capital. If the capitalist stops investing capital for gains he ceases to be a capitalist, and becomes a mere consumer of goods, enjoying the fruits of old exploitations. Tragically, capital can only increase when it exploits the difference of what labor costs and labor produces, as Marx writes,\\"The modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.\\" (Marx p484)The rich man sitting in his patio who has inherited a million pound and who lets others manage his money has not done anything to deserve profits, indeed, since he himself did not work, his profits must come from the works of others who he exploits. In the capitalistic system, there exists no pity, only keen self-interest, \\"all are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use...\\" (Marx p479)The workers might die, but before their body ceases to be exploited, their mind is already died-capitalism has alienated them from their humanity which is defined by their creative productivity. This alienation from our humanity was Marx's greatest worry. Animals make nests and produce goods just as we do, however, as Marx writes,\\"...a bee would put many a human architect to shame by the construction of its honeycomb cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax... Man not only effects a change of form in the materials of nature; he also realizes his own purpose in those materials.\\" (Chapter 7, Das Kapital)In order to freely produce as the creativity of his mind directs him and as his productive ability allows, the material man must be endowed with control over the means of production. In the world of private property, however, the workers have turned from the master of production to the slave of the machine-they are reduced to programmed animals that produce merely for the end of survival.The proletariat can only reassert his humanity by violent overthrowing the capitalists and through the \\"abolition of private property\\" (Marx p484). Once in communism, the workers will own the means of production and enjoy the full produces of their labor. He will be motivated to constantly transform the world into a more prosperous kingdom. As Marx writes, \\"In communist society, accumulated labour is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the labourer.\\" (Marx p485) The abundance of material goods will allow man to work not for survival, but for his own enjoyment. In this society, there will be no family and nor religion, everything is made for the love of all and enjoyed by all. Any vestiges of private interest would result in the return to capitalism with all its evils.To Mill, the modern life is also threatening because the voice of the majority might alienate men from their individuality. The differentiation of society is essential for the vitality of the society, and this vitality empowers men on their search for truth.Political debates, according to Mill, have been about striking the balance between the ruler and ruled. It is necessary for the ruled to have a ruler in order to preserve peace and law, yet the elected or unelected ruler's power must be restrained so that he does not abuse it against the ruled. In contrast to Marx's class struggle, this \\"struggle between liberty and authority\\" (p59) from Mill is more amiable. In the current era of democratic nations, however, since the ruled are also the rulers, the opposition no longer exists. People feel that all actions taken by the people's government will be good for the people, and hence they lose the old vigilance against the invasion of public power into their private spheres. The voice of the majority becomes the equivalent of the truth and justice.Mill is worried that this majority voice will obstruct man's search for truth, the attaining of which is the goal of life. Truth is not reached once and then preserved for eternity, it is an organic being with a thousand facets whose survival requires continued inputs of each person's active mind. This truth is the individual treasure of each being, fitting perfectly to his taste and preferences; yet it is also a truth for the whole community, since it is only through the struggles of different truths that humanity as a whole reaches a higher truth-a higher level for the activation of the mind. As Mill writes, \\"There is always need of persons not only to discover new truths and point out when what were once truths are true no longer\\" (p71) If the majority religion is the only religion and taste the only taste, then people will no longer think but simply follow; society will be bogged into the swamp of mediocrity with a mind that is dead. Marx also feared the death of the mind, the mind of the creative worker. Despite the differences, both philosophers are concerned about the destruction of man's defining qualities.To counter this, Mill proclaims that the only defense for \\"interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.\\" (p68). The government must be restrained in the sphere of public affairs, and individuals shall live as free as they want to following their individual passions.Marx and Mill both want to regain humanity. In one case, the enemy is the benumbing effects of majority rule, and man's mind for truth is debased forever into mediocrity, in the other case, the enemy comes from the benumbing effects of subjugation to the machine, and the man is turned from the master of production into the slaves of capital.The core difference between the two theories in practical operation arises from their different views on individuality (both systems serve individuals as their ends, however, individuality, allowing people to be different, are treated differently). For Mill, we must preserve individuality to bring truth (Chapter 3, On Liberty), but for Marx, the destruction of private property is the only task. The communistic society will be a union in which man can \\"...hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner...\\" (The German Ideology). This free life of a communist in communism is all good until one day the comrade does not want to be a communist anymore-but he must be one, there is no choice. In Communism, one does not have the individual liberty to have families, nor try to build a little store of private wealth.On the other side, if someone in Mill's world decides to be a communist, he has the full right to do so. He can even segregate himself away with his friends and enjoy the life of a commune. In another word, Marxism can not destroy Mill's democracy-it will just be one of the many ways of thinking allowed by the system-but Mill's cry for diversity will destroy Marx's world within a second.Confronted with the above, Marx would reply like he did in the Jewish Question, that the so-called liberty and freedom of the capitalistic world are nothing other than man's desire to keep himself a self-sufficient nomad. As he writes, all the rights of man are simply \\"the right to enjoy one's fortune and to dispose of it as one will; without regard for other men and independently of society.\\" (Marx, p42) Marx will say that only seeing the superficial political liberation is not to see the deeper human liberation which could only be achieved with the abolition of private property. Marx might not be completely right, but he does stand at a higher ground than Mill in this analysis of property.Mill in On Liberty is focused solely on avoiding the abuse of power through government, but he ignores the abuses that property owners are capable of against the property-less. In an agricultural society where everyone is equal and land unlimited, the government might be the only thing capable of suppressing individual liberty, but when one sees child-labor and 12 hour work day in modern industrial society, there is no doubt that capital could be a pitiless monster. Even when one ignores the industrial age, and tries to give Mill credit for drawing the best possible life for the pre-industrial man, one still can not avoid noticing the subjugation of the slaves, the suffering of the serfs, and all the other dark stories of the property-less in all the ages previous to the industrial one which Marx gives a full account of.Marx and Mill were faced with the same modern phenomenal, the danger of been alienated from the defining quality of humanity in the face of a new economic and a new political system. Marx might not have made the best analysis, but he did have a deep understanding of history and the problems in history. He stood at the level of the common people and tried to solve their problems caused by their material desperation. Mill did not stoop to the common people, he looked up into the sky of truth and tried to preserve the march toward truth first embarked on by Plato."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"On Liberty by Locke was very interesting and analyzed how humans see the world.

Those are opinions of an indeterminate validity. Socal intervention may only be used to protect someone from restriction of their liberties. What Mill lacks in rigour, he makes up for in persuasiveness. He has some great lines in defense of liberty, a pre-dominant value of human life. Although, it is to be noted that the book can be somewhat tedious in areas which it is repetitive. This book also illustrates what can be seen as a fault in utilitarianism. Utilitarianism takes no notice of other values, or of a conflict of values, such as liberty of existence over the majorities happiness, in which ethics slides into absurdity."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Mill's inconsistent treatment of liberty is so schizophrenic that is seems to be written by two different people, a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde. His flashes of brilliance are marred by his incongruous forays into authoritarianism. It is incredible to me how anyone can read this book and come away viewing it as a legitimate defense of liberty. Mill is clearly guilty of wanting to have his cake and eat it too, and the resulting work is a litany of completely irreconcilable rules for civil society.The brilliant:\\"If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"How elegant. But Mill is a double-edged sword:\\"Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end.\\"And:\\"Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce social obligations from it, every one who receives the protection of society owes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders it indispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line of conduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring the interests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either by express legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be considered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to be fixed on some equitable principle) of the labors and sacrifices incurred for defending the society or its members from injury and molestation. These conditions society is justified in ENFORCING, at ALL COSTS to those who endeavor to withhold fulfilment.\\"Mill at once complains about expected group conformity, then turns around and suggests that community scorn is a justifiable weapon to be used against non-conformists. He talks of liberty, then of the duties we owe for the \\"general welfare.\\" On Liberty could as just as well have been written by a Marxist theorist."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"John Stuart Mill was a liberal's liberal or a socialist's socialist- ahead of his times (or just hanging on Karl Marx's coattail.) His utilitarian socialist philosophy was a real u-turn away from the classic liberalism preceeding his times. What is particularly disturbing is that this book is passed off by academia to represent classical liberalism. This book is good for its historical value and studying political theory, but don't be fooled into thinking 'On Liberty' is at all faithful or indicative of the classical liberal or libertarian philosophy on liberty.Get Liberalism in the Classic Tradition by Ludwig von Mises to understand true classical liberalism."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I would certainly rank John Stuart Mill as the most overrated philosophical windbag of all time. I don't find it a coincidence that Mill was described as a \\"very ladylike person.\\" That seems to explain a great deal of his writing style, which bespeaks a certain dizziness of the mind.Roger Kimball summed up Mill well:Together with Rousseau, John Stuart Mill (1806-73) supplied nearly all of the arguments and most of the emotional weather - the texture of sentiment - that have gone into defining the Left-liberal vision of the world.Mill's peculiar brand of utilitarianism - a cake of Benthamite hedonism glazed with Wordsworthian sentimentality - accounts for part of his appeal: it provides a perfect recipe for embellishing programmatic shallowness with a cosmetic patina of spirituality. It is a recipe that has proven irresistible to those infatuated with the spectacle of their own virtue.Another large part of Mill's appeal rests on his \\"feminism\\" - his conviction, put forward in The Subjection of Women, that differences between the sexes were accidental and that, as Leslie Stephen put it, \\"women could be turned into men by trifling changes in the law\\". Both are indispensable elements in the intoxicating potion that constitutes Mill's appeal and makes much of his thinking seem so contemporary.Mill's arguments and pronouncements about man as a \\"progressive being\\", the extent of individual autonomy, the limits of acceptable moral and legal censure, the importance of innovation and (perhaps his most famous phrase) \\"experiments in living\\" are all familiar to the point of invisibility. Likewise his corollary insistence on the poverty of custom, prejudice and tradition. Mill's contentions on these subjects are nowadays less objects of debate than of reverence. But the public success of Mill's teaching (especially in his manifesto On Liberty) says nothing about the cogency of his arguments. In fact, Mill's central arguments are open to - and have from the beginning been subjected to - serious criticism. Yet they have raged like wildfire through the Western world, consuming everything that stands in their path. Which means, among other things, that they exert an appeal quite distinct from any intellectual merit they may possess.As for the nature of Mill's arguments, consider, for example, his famous plea on behalf of moral, social and intellectual \\"experiments\\". Throughout history, Mill argues, the authors of such innovations have been objects of ridicule, persecution and oppression; they have been ignored, silenced, exiled, imprisoned, even killed. But (Mill continues) we owe every step of progress, intellectual as well as moral, to the daring of innovators. \\"Without them,\\" he writes, \\"human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist.\\" Ergo, innovators - \\"developed human beings\\" is one phrase Mill uses for such paragons - should not merely be tolerated but positively be encouraged.The philosopher David Stove called this the \\"They All Laughed at Christopher Columbus\\" argument. The amazing thing about the success of the Columbus argument is that it depends on premises that are so obviously faulty. Indeed, as Stove observes, a moment's reflection reveals that the Columbus argument is undermined by a downright glaring weakness.Granted that every change for the better has depended on someone embarking on a new departure: well, so too has every change for the worse. And surely, Stove writes, there have been at least as many proposed innovations which \\"were or would have been for the worse as ones which were or would have been for the better\\". This means that we have at least as much reason to discourage innovators as to encourage them, especially when their innovations bear on things as immensely complex as the organisation of society. In On Liberty, Mill presented himself as a prophet of individual liberty. But if liberty was always on Mill's lips, a new orthodoxy was ever in his heart. There is an important sense in which the libertarian streak in On Liberty is little more than a prophylactic against the coerciveness that its assumption of virtuous rationality presupposes. Mill hoped that liberty would replace the reign of prejudice with the reign of reason. In fact, it has had the effect of camouflaging prejudices with rational-sounding rhetoric. The effort to unseat customary practice and belief has resulted not, as Mill predicted, in encouraging a drift towards unanimity but in increasing chaos.Nor is this surprising. As Mill's great critic James Fitzjames Stephen noted, \\"the notorious result of unlimited freedom of thought and discussion is to produce general scepticism on many subjects in the vast majority of minds\\". Such \\"paradoxes\\" (to put it politely) show themselves wherever the constructive part of Mill's doctrine is glimpsed through his cheerleading for freedom and eccentricity.Mill claimed a monopoly on the word \\"rational\\". So long as that monopoly remains unchallenged our paralysis will be complete. The antidote to the moral helplessness that Mill's liberalism generates is not to be found by digging deeper in the trench of liberal rationalisation. On the contrary, it begins with the recognition that no \\"one very simple principle\\" can relieve us of the duties we owe to the inhabited world that we, for this brief while, share with many others.See Kimball's excellent November 1998 article in The New Criterion entitled \\"One very simple principle\\""},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"I don't really like the fact that Mill wasn't religious- I don't believe you can have a just person who doesn't believe in a higher power, but the economics in On Liberty and the politics are amazing. It comes down to this: No one should be prevented from thinking or doing anything except that which harms others. In other words: government needs to get out of our bidness!"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Mill's book, On Liberty, tries to answer the question of what is the legitimate power that government can exercise over the individual . His main argument regarding personal liberty is the harm principle, meaning as long as the individual's actions do not harm other individuals, they shouldn't be restricted from that action. However, Mill doesn't only focus on the philosophical aspect of the role government should have in the individual life, but he also tries to answer more specific issues such as government policies concerning drugs, gambling, prostitution, public education versus private education, the importance of freedom of speech and more. If you're interested in such questions, this book is for you."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"As stated by Mill the topic of On Liberty is the role society should take in interfering with the liberty of an individual, that is, the amount of power that society may legitimately exercise over its people.The sphere of Mill's inquiry is the system of a democracy, where the main danger to individual liberty is that of the \\"tyranny of the majority,\\" in which minorities are subjected to the whims of the majority such that the \\"weaker members of the community\\" are \\"preyed upon by innumerable vultures.\\" Mill's argument is that \\"self-government\\" is not \\"the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.\\"Mill's main thesis is that society and the governing bodies have no right to interfere with the liberty of thought, action or individuality in any person save when those liberties may cause harm to others; that \\"over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.\\" This is to say that society is unable able to interfere with individuals unless they're harming somebody, not including themselves - a person has every right to do harm to themselves and society may not intervene simply for the good of the individual.Apart from this, Mill also believes that keeping away the \\"tyranny of the majority\\" is good not only for the individuals and the minorities, but for society itself as well; that the argumentation/discussion which leads from freedom of thought is pivotal in the development of the society and truth. It is only in this that societies can avoid stagnation and people can truly learn; they must be able to see both sides of the argument (from people who truly believe them) and the ideas must be allowed to clash, thus, \\"genius can only breathe freely in an atmosphere of freedom.\\"In arguing for freedom of expression Mill argues that because the opinions of the individual may be true (or at least contain some portion of truth) and because human fallibility makes it so there are none fit to judge whether the opinion is true anyway, full freedom must be granted; not only this, but because there are none fit to judge, [according to Mill] there is no absolute certainty.This is all to lead into a sort of Hegelian system which Mill puts forth, noting that both sides of any argument generally only contain a portion of the truth and that it is only by bringing these two ideas together that the full truth can be found; a balance must be found between the ideas. The ideas must clash and in this clashing the synthesis between them will be found.Overall Mill's text is a good read even for people today. The ideas being presented are just as relevant now as they were during Mill's time, such the fact that the voice of third parties is all but crushed in the US's two party system or the discussions over gay marriage, abortion, or even something as small as free speech zones on college campuses. All of these feed back into the issue being discussed by Mill, that is, how much power society should be able to wield over its members and just what is the nature and extent of our liberty.Memorable Quotes:-\\"The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people.\\"-\\"He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.\\"-\\"If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind.\\"-\\"What was not wanted was that the rulers should be identified with the people, that their interests and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will There was no fear of tyrannizing over itself.\\"Specific CriticismsFrom a secular standpoint I'm not sure how much can be critiqued of Mill's ideas. From a Christian standpoint there are two chief issues which may be taken.The first issue that may be taken is with the idea that \`over himself the individual is sovereign.' This is exactly the mindset which Scripture rails against and sets up as the original sin, to think that we are our own sovereigns, to usurp the sovereignty of God over his creations.The second issue which may be taken is with lack of any solid judge for truth. Simply put, the Christian would argue that God is the standard against which we measure truth, and due to his immutability he stands as a very good standard by which to judge. There is still the factor of fallibility which Mill notes, however this is not to say that truth cannot be discovered or that no statements can be set as entirely false.More reviews at ellipsisomnibus.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"Good and Fast . ... ....... ... .. ..... ........ ...... ....... .. ....... .... .... .. ...... ... ....."},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"This is the only version of &#34;On Liberty&#34; that I own.

While the Russians were carrying out pogroms against Jews because of their intolerance, Mill was able to provide an intellectual defense for tolerating the emerging Latter Day Saints (despite his obvious dislike for them). The beauty of this book is that the arguments are still relevant and directly applicable to the issues. Whereas Marx required armies of Soviet intellectuals in order to stay relevant, you can pick up On Liberty and fully appreciate the arguments. While it can be tempting to accept some infringements on liberty, I think it's necessary to have a philosophical framework through which to understand what limitations on liberty are justifiable and which aren't.Jorge"},{"Title":"On Liberty","review":"When J. S. Mill published ON LIBERTY in 1859, he was then but the latest in a very long line of liberal theorists that stretched back to Plato and continued intermittenly for the next two millennia. These theorists as did Mill attempted to ascertain what if any was that fine line between the rights of the individual to live unimpeded from the caprices of a ruling state and the duty of that state to maintain the civil order necessary for those rights to exist. That we today still have not defined this line is a testimony to the never ending struggle of thinkers like Mill to present arguments of which each succeeding generation must be made aware.From the day it first appeared in print, readers have been entranced by the clarion call for unrestrained liberty. Mill wrote ON LIBERTY in such a manner that to argue against it suggests that to do so renders one as either a tyrant or a boor. Further, those who question Mill must walk a fine line between not supporting the very tyrannical state against which Mill rails and carrying out the the logical conclusion of accepting his definition of liberty at face value. I question Mill's underlying if unnoticed logic even as I applaud his cheerleading.Mill sees society as a perpetual repressor of the liberty of its citizens. For him, liberty consists of the ability to think and do as one pleases. Barring certain exceptions this liberty is the very foundation of any society that dares to call itself free. Society, then, must bend over backwards to ensure that all possess it. The chief stumbling block in this quest lies less in the individuating traits of people and more in the the tendency of rulers to rely on the heavy hand of custom to maintain its own existence even at the cost of denying liberty to their subjects.Mill sees \\"custom\\" as a dirty word that is all that is wrong with society. Nowhere does he concern himself with any positive connotations. He limits its use only to describe that which has the potential to stamp out every last smidgeon of creativity that might otherwise emerge. He fears that it will be the ruled, and not the rulers, who wish to crush dissent. To protect individuals from custom, Mill states that only those who are daring enough to defy society may do so. He calls such dissenters as \\"eccentrics.\\" For him, it is a term of praise that brings to mind heirs of a very long line of liberal thought from ancient Greek days. Just as Mill ignores the reality that custom has two divergent senses so does he similarly ignore the same about eccentrics. Clearly, if history proves anything, it is that those who have differed in ways that are bestial are about as numerous as those that are beneficial. When Mill champions the absolute right of eccentrics to challenge custom, he opens the door to tear down the bonds of society and not erect anything of a compensatory nature. When he argues that liberty must not be used to harm others, he is using a red herring to divert attention from the grim realization that to be different means far more than than saying so."},{"Title":"Do You Think You'll Like the Wind: The Story of a Dublin Family's Life in County Clare","review":"Anyone who has been to County Clare will enjoy this book (all the more if you have a trip planned in your future!), as will anyone interested in modern-day Ireland.

Took about 5 minutes of setup and then all my students were able to work with it under their normal developer rights.There is only one downside I've found, and that's the binding. For a book that's designed to be read while doing exercises on the computer, it should have a spiral bound rather than normal book binding. The book does not want to stay open, the margins are too close to the binding, and after several times of forcing it open the bindings are wearing very badly after just a few months.

This Scholar's Bible translation begins with an extensive introduction including conclusions by the Jesus Seminar about the identity of Mark's author and the cultural atmosphere of Mark's &quot;war-time gospel.&quot; Then with the inclusion of the original Greek text on each facing page, and extensive foot notes at the bottom of each explaining variances from traditional translations of Mark, Schmidt allows us to see for ourselves how differences in translation may radically shape the conclusions we reach from this first extant record of the historical Jesus. Be warned; careful reading of this Gospel of Mark is likely to cause an intellectual inquiry into the nature of biblical revelation...and I have concluded that with Schmidt the reader is in good hands to conduct it. Schmidt writes as he teaches: lucidly, insightfully, and with evident passion for his field. This book merits taking some time to discover Mark all over again."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Scholars Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"This is the Scholars Bible translation of the Gospel of Mark, and it is well done. The commentary and apparatus comments are VOLUMINOUS, however, so I'd caution you that this book is for serious Bible study only. I'm not particularly happy with the translation used, but I suppose that's because we all have our favorites, and this one doesn't \\"sing\\" very well for me. What it probably is, is a much more accurate translation of the text. Be prepared to be completely immersed in the subject with this book, but be aware that it's not suitable for a casual bible study group; it's for veteran theology buffs."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Scholars Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"As the first gospel penned about a man who would command the attention of a third of the world ... as the book that would form the foundation for the next two gospels written ... the influence of Mark's Gospel is undeniable.With Greek on the left page, a translation dubbed the Scholars Version on the facing page, and the bottom portion of both reserved for verse-by-verse commentary, Schmidt's work glows of authenticity. It's like you're reading the words the day after they were written, as if you are the person they were written for. This is not an in-depth study (at least, not alongside some of the tomes you'll find in university bookstores), and outside the 39-page introduction there's no topical coverage, which leaves primarily the simplicity of the Gospel translation as its selling point. I can't even say the translation is terribly precise; it just rings to me of the proper flavor, as much as today's English can allow.Recommendation: Just read the translation through in one sitting to savor the Gospel story; then, go back and review the commentary."},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Scholars Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"I chose this book in anticipation of a research project on the gospel of Mark. With a title like Scholar's Bible, I was expecting a lot of good commentary and a very good translation of the text to work from, with adequate notes about nuance in the Greek text. While the commentary is alright, it was not nearly as fulfilling as I was expecting. Very little of it was new to me. This might just be a result of my level of involvement in reading on this gospel, but I expected to run across at least some interpretive or narrative comments that would shed new light.The most disappointing aspect of the text is the English translation itself. I expected from a scholar's translation that it would be formal equivalent, but this translation most certainly is not. Overriding this is the desire to produce it in common language to match the character of the original Greek text. In doing so, though, it often strays from the greek text in ways that really bothered me, such as translating 'beloved son' as 'a son who was the apple of his eye'. I can see no real reason to justify such an expression to render the words huion agapeton.Also bugging me was using the phrase 'son of Adam'. I understand that it is an attempt to render the phrase as it is in Aramaic in Daniel, but the author used the LXX, and so whether it was still understood as such is hard to say. Son of humanity would have been a far better rendering. I ended up just reading the greek and skipping most of the English - so at least it was good that they had the Greek as well!"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Mark (The Scholars Bible, Vol. 1)","review":"The Gospel of Mark was written to the general public in the common vernacular.

Let's just say it's not an easy read. His words do not flow smoothly. The title of the book is also a bit misleading. While the book does begin with a general overview of the history of Native Americans and the wrongs inflicted on them by Europeans ... the rest of the book then takes a DEEP dive into New Mexico and Oklahoma. The title of the book should more accurately reflect a deep focus on Soutwestern Indians, as that is the primary subject of the book. Bottom line, it is clearly an extremely well researched book, but a poorly written book. Much like sitting down on a Sunday and reading Case Law transcripts. The beginning chapter gives an interesting insight into the events that shaped the laws governing Indian Gaming, but unless you're interested in the minutia of New Mexico or Oklahoma, then the rest of book is pretty much a sleeper. I wouldn't recommend buying it."},{"Title":"Indian Gaming: Tribal Sovereignty and American Politics","review":"I saved a nice piece of change, .A definitive work for anyone pursuing a degree inCasino Gaming technology.A required text for Native American Gaming."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a good book on the kernel.only thing lacking is Linux 2.6...guess it must be hard to write an Uptodate book on the kernel."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"My interest Ranges from admin to security to &lt;big focus&gt; drivers.This book (or tome in many peoples eyes) is the utter definition of 'internals explained'.

The code examples seem to run through a non-deterministic preprocessor -- the code is supposed to describe 2.4.18, but the code snippets don't quite match the actual code (while generally working the same way, the algorithms/loop structure are often rewritten and the macros are sometimes expanded). I find it very useful when books comment on actual code examples, this is \\"kinda massaged code\\" -- I found it very frustrating when I actually looked at the kernel tree when they had snippets in the book.I often found it necessary to look at the actual code to give more context (but the code rarely matched verbatim -- very strange). And when they did rewrite algorithms, I found the kernel 2.4.18 source to be MORE lucid.The explanations without code were adequate, and I found some to be illuminating. Perhaps since the book has two authors, different authors wrote different chapters? (I liked some chapters and didn't like others).If you want a general understanding of how kernels work, Andy Tanenbaum's \\"Operating Systems: Design and Implementation\\" where he elaborates on Minix is very useful -- with a complete Minix system (Minix is more of a teaching tool, which it does well, Linus looked at lMinix and wanted a more useful system, hence Linux).I found Robert Love's \\"Linux Kernel Development\\" very good (I read the 1st edition, still need to read the second edtion). And Linux Device Drivers (Corbet and Rubini) is very good and has excellent examples (but the examples may need some work to build on a current kernel -- had this problem with the 2nd edition)."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"Oh yes! This Second of Edition of &quot;Understanding the Linux Kernel&quot; featured a variety of new additions. The most significant being the inclusion of all those attributes, which distinguished the 2.4 kernel version from the 2.2 one.This new edition also revised some of the staples of its predecessor, like: individual components of data structures, programming pathways, and interdependent algorithms. Its pattern is just as dynamic as that of the First Edition: with expanded elaborations on all those programming and performance tips.In all, this is a good book to consider, if you are seeking Linux Kernel knowledge. But, if you already own the previous edition, and do not plan to adopt the Kernel 2.4 version, then there is no wisdom in spending on this one."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"As the title suggests, the author explains conceptsin the linux operating system by using C code.You need to be able to read C code inorder to understandthe material in the book.It can get a bit tiring after a while considering thatthe author really wants YOU to know LINUX.The effort is worth it!"},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"If you read and understand most of what is in this book, then you will be an expert on the internals of the Linux kernel. This book goes into great detail on all aspects of the kernel. I would recommend this book, as well as \\"Linux Kernel Development\\", to be used as supplements to a college course taught on operating systems where Linux is used as a reference OS implementation.The book does a good job of making complicated concepts accessible, but the reader may need to noodle over some concepts a bit more than others in order to fully grasp them.

Although I do not favor that approach, I would accept it if \`UP' was ever reached.Reader is encouraged to look at the code while reading this book, however, very few references to the code is found, it's mostly talk, talk, talk, and you just lose it long before you're able to get a big picture.I just couldn't believe how much space was wasted in the first part of the book explaining things that you ought to know before you even think about buying this book. I wish that space was used for more code/examples instead.There is hardly any code in this book, and on the other hand it tried to chew so many subjects that are impossible to fit in this book and deserve (and have!) books on their own. I don't need a book on how CPU works, just show me a piece of code in Linux and try to explain it assuming some theoretical knowledge on the readers side that has to be assumed.If you expect Stevens-like masterpiece from this book, you will be disappointed.

Very detailed, explains not only how kernel works but also why it was designed this way.This is an exciting book for anyone seeking advanced insides into Linux Kernel. I rated it 4 for lack of clear separation between Linux and hardware responsibilities. I also wish the author would have conducted a comparison study with Windows, another POSIX-compliant OS."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"This book doesn't just talk about Linux; it talks about how a modern OS sitting on a modern architecture functions, in real detail. I have seen many OS texts, and this one is unique in that it does not attempt to teach theory, or academic examples. Want to understand scheduling, interrupts, file system abstractions, address spaces? Read this. Even if you don't use or care about Linux particularly. It will demystify these critical topics, which you can then apply to whatever platform or code you're working with, especially if you work with kernel or related components.I am a professional software developer who works in drivers and OS subsystems. Although I have some exposure to various Unix flavors, I don't use any of them regularly-- I have most exposure to the NT architecture. This book has been invaluable in shoring up my fundamentals. The Windows book that most closely resembles this is Windows Internals from MS Press, which is a great book but doesn't (and cannot) delve too far into actual internal structures.Note, though, that this book does not aim to teach you all this good generalist stuff-- it only does that by accident. It will gloss over the intro material in some cases to get into the code, which works for the explicit charter of the text (Linux kernel specifics), but might require the reader cross-referencing with an OS text."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"There are two type of programmers, those who start with papers and those who start with code. If you are like me, who start with code, this is the only book you need to learn about linux kernel and to use it as a quick reference."},{"Title":"Understanding the Linux Kernel (2nd Edition)","review":"I didn't like the first edition of this book, and I still don't like the current edition, though I admit I'm having a hard time understanding why.I think that part of the problem is the deliberate \\"bottom-up\\" approach: this starts out in the first chapter dealing with memory addressing at the hardware level and goes on from there. I tend not to like bottom up explanations: give me the grand picture first and then drill down. But that can't be all of it: The Magic Garden Explained effectively starts there too, and I enjoyed that. Frankly, this approach probably is the best way to handle this subject matter in spite of my preferences.Perhaps part of this is that I'm not playing by the rules. There is a strong implication in the preface that one should be looking at the source code while reading. One of the reviews at Amazon.com says the same thing. I didn't do that, and that may contribute to my vague dissatisfaction.I certainly can't complain that this is incomplete or badly written. It covers everything that should be covered, and it is current as of the 2.4 kernels. The writing style is lucid, and I think that in general the writers have done a better than average job of explaining the why and wherefor in addition to the how.I think maybe I've just lost my interest in this level of detail. There was a time when I found it fascinating in the most literal sense, but that was years ago. I just don't have any burning desire to understand kernel internals anymore.You, of course, may still have that interest.

It was taken over by the Government and made into an aerodrome. It was a fighter base, part of the defenses of London for almost fifty years. This book is a collection of photographs from in and around the air field, along with a small amount of text.Most of the pictures in the book is concerned with World War II. During that time it was a Spitfire base. Lots of pictures of the Spit in every situation imaginable from flying in formation to scattered around the countryside in pieces.This is kind of a specialized book, but I found it quite interesting. It shows a side of life during war time that you don't often see."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Good plot/story but I was a bit distracted by some of the implausible events in the book - for instance, if the US bombed a prison in German occupied France to attempt to kill a captured US Army officer who knew the details of the coming D-Day invasion, why would they send another officer who also knows all of the details over there to rescue the captured officer. Anyway, 3 stars is all that I can give this particular novel because of these types of implausibilities. In my opinion, I prefer the books by Alan Furst and David Downing."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Don't believe the reviews! Contrary to the rave reviews this novel received on Amazon, I found the characters to be poorly developed and the plot very predictable. The pages were difficult to turn from the weight of the numerous cliches. I could not associate or sympathize with any of the characters and the plot was somewhat implausible. We all know that D-Day was a success and this story never had me in suspense that the landing in Normandy was jeopardized. I managed to slog through the story hoping for some form of redemption...wrong. If you want to read a poorly constructed, Jr. High level of writing, then this book is for you.

After 10 pages, I was struck by the appallingly poor quality of the author's prose style, and wondered if he would be able to maintain his average of at least one tired cliche per page, so began keeping track. 75 pages in, when I gave up counting, he was still on track.For those who are content with purely plot-driven books, are undeterred by inherent implausibilities, demand nothing beyond stock (and stick-like) characters, and are not given indigestion by sheer bad writing, this may be your cup of tea. But a 5-star book this is not."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"This is a very good mystery and a poignant story of Europe in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"I'm always looking for a new voice in the spy/thriller genre, and the fact a work is self-published or put out by a small-imprint house detracts nothing from it's value. My appreciation of a work such as this one is based solely on the quality of the writing (plotting, characterization, dialogue) and the depth of the historical research and undertsanding. And it is in precisely these areas that Mr. Horner, despite his unquestionable passion for the material, fails. WARNING: SOME SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW.The central cast of fictional characters are one-dimensional. The interpersonal conflicts aren't even worthy of an episode of Grey's Anatomy. The plot is paper-thin, and moves forward only on the basis of incredible coincidences and idiotic choices. (The beautiful English girl the American hero loves is also secretly the SOE agent who travels to Occupied France as regularly and easily as to the market; the captured Allied officer who must be rescued from the Gestapo just happened to go to school with the same American; the English girl's best friend happens to be the daughter of the British intelligence official running the deception program, who also happens to be privy to SOE operations well outside his purview, and also happens...you get the idea.)Even worse, key plot points are simply ridiculous. For instance, the aforementioned American prisoner must be rescued because he knows secrets which, if revealed, will almost certainly cause the D-Day invasion to be a disaster. The author's brilliant solution? Send another officer with the same secrets to rescue him! Seriously!?! It doesn't take years of counterintelligence training to know that plan would at least double the chances of the Germans discovering the secrets.That kind of scratch-your-head illogic runs throughout the book: in the climactic scene the English traitor (a British Army officer living in England), is trying to fend off the American hero and his pals while trying to send a pigeon (I kid you not) to his Gestapo controller the morning of the D-Day landings; to do so he pulls a \\"Mauser 45\\". First of all, the Mauser is a German weapon; what kind of an idiot spy would posess a firearm made by the enemy when, as an army officer, he had a perfectly valid reason to carry any number of British or American-made weapons? Secondly, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS A MAUSER 45! And before anyone nitpicks about how pigeons were soemtimes used for communication, the point is that the pigeon is being sent off ON THE MORNING of the invasion! No information it carried could be a threat when it arrives a hour before 10 Allied divisions. Also, the pigeon was only carrying the word \\"OMAHA\\", which the author intends to imply is the reason US casualties were so high on that beach. However the word OMAHA would be meaningless to the Germans unless they already knew the plan well enough to recognize the code-word for a landing area; and, of course, if they knew that much already the pigeon (and the agent) are useless anyway.There are dozens of historical and technical errors scattered throughout this book, such as completely inaccurate (and ham-handed) depictions of figures such as Eisenhower and Group Captain Stagg; or that the Gestapo officer, in a completely pointless sublot, loses his uniform and has to dress as an army corporal, which causes him no end of difficulty because all the German soldiers he orders to assist him during his spy chase ignore him because they don't believe he's a Gestapo officer. Again, even the most cursory research would reveal that, regardless of his attire, the Gestapo man would still have the silver identity disk and identity papers Gestapo (and some other SD) personnel were required to have upon their persons at all times. Finally, this same officer is responsible both for Gestapo countersubversion and counterintelligence operations in Normandy, and also running a top level source inside British intelligence. Not only did the Gestapo not run top-level foreign agents (this was the job of the Abwehr and various elements of the SD) but is also like suggesting that neursurgeons also do dentistry.I'm afraid there's really very little to say about this book, except to reiterate that the author meant well. He seems to be trying to write romance novels as much as thrillers: perhaps he should stick to that and leave this type of book to veterans like Higgins or more serious newcomers like Furst."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Having soldiered on and finished this book, I remain perplexed by the glowing reviews bestowed upon this book by fellow Amazonians. Where others see a classic, I see boring, two-dimensional characters.

I'm guessing the glowing reviews of this book came from folks who have not read far better examples of this particular theme such as vintage Jack Higgins and Ken Follett. If you've read those author's books set against the same historical backdrop, this book feels like a knock-off from a wanna-be. This author's attempts at authenticity are sincere and admirable (research was clearly done), but the execution feels too heavy-handed. For example, the French characters speak so much French it ceases to be \\"flavor\\" and becomes a distraction where you feel the author's unwanted presence. Conversely, the Germans don't speak any German beyond military ranks and the occasional \\"dummkopf.\\" All the correct genre elements are here down to the clich&eacute;d characters, but their actions don't quite ring true -- particularly those of the Gestapo chief Richter, and the British traitor who, in true Bond-villian style, conveniently tells his captives his plan (thus giving them the opportunity to thwart it) rather than just shooting them dead. Ultimately, the book's convoluted plot line(s) hinge too heavily on too many implausible events (little girls and carrier pigeons) and a slew of rather baffling character actions. Sorry. I wanted to like this, but the bar has been set higher by better writers who tackled the subject when it was fresher, and who did a better job keeping your disbelief suspended."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Hard to believe that a book about WWII could lack ANY thing significant to write about.

In addition to Hitler's espionage network, the Germans even had the good luck to stray into an Allied operation (Operation Tiger) that was practicing beach assaults in England shortly before D-Day. The heroes and heroines that guaranteed the safety of the secret feature in A.R. Homer's tightly-crafted and well-written novel of war and love, along with an English traitor of unknown identity, a consummately evil SS commander, and a Resistance leader with disturbingly puzzling loyalties. In \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins,\\" Homer deftly weaves the strands of their individual stories of love, courage, betrayal, and suspense into a rich pattern, and the novel culminates in two spectacular denouements. Through it all, there is humor, longing, romance, and an adorable nine-year-old French girl.The title of the book comes from the first line of a Verlaine poem (\\"The long sobs of the violins of autumn\\") that was broadcast by the BBC to France to alert the Resistance that the invasion was imminent, since preparations for the big day were happening on both sides of the Channel. Scenes within chapters alternate between England and France, and I enjoyed the fact that each chapter of the novel is one day in the two week time-span preceding D-Day. The story moves forward rapidly; there is little let-up of tension in this book.History may tell us that success in epic ventures like the Normandy invasion was due to troop movements and battles fought. A.R. Homer's beautifully-written novel reminds us that all noble undertakings consist of the actions of individual human beings, many of whom were - like the characters in this book - fighting wars within their own personal lives. As in his first book, \\"The Mirror of Diana,\\" all of Homer's characters live and breathe. I quaked, fought back a tear, and rejoiced for the heroes and heroines I met in this fine novel. I think you will, too."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"At a time of bitter debate about the worth of shedding American blood, it is gratifying to recall a time when the justification for decisive action was crystal clear. That time: D-Day, evoking patriotic visions of brave men in battles that ultimately decided the course of history. Equally miraculous, however, was the safeguarding of the D-Day secret - where and when the invasion would take place - from desperately prying eyes, ears, and stealth as over a million American servicemen waited in England to cross the Channel.In A.R. Homer's stirring novel, The Sobs of Autumn's Violins (the title comes from the Verlaine poem broadcast by the BBC to tell the French Resistance the invasion was imminent), we learn that the D-Day secret was protected by an elaborate offensive campaign of deception, described vividly in the novel by none other than General George S. Patton. Defensive tactics were fallen back upon when things went wrong as Tom Ford, an American intelligence officer and the protagonist of the novel, finds out when another officer, privy to the D-Day secret, is captured by the Germans during a rehearsal for D-Day off the coast of Devon, England (this bit of plot is based on the April, 1944 Operation Tiger disaster, kept secret by the American government for decades). Jeanne Busson, a British agent courier, on the other hand, is unwittingly mired in the campaign of deception when, parachuting into occupied France, she finds she has been betrayed. Perhaps by Philippe Josse, French Resistance leader, who double-deals with both the British Secret Service and with Richter, an odious Nazi Gestapo boss.But where were all the German spies? As Homer relates with historical accuracy, they had all been captured early in the war and either executed or \\"turned\\" to aid the deception effort. But what, poses Homer, if there had been a sleeper spy embedded in England before the war? The author gives life to such an agent: through anonymous diary entries, we learn the plan to steal the secret and get it to the Nazis in France through ingenious means.In this historical adventure are fascinating depictions of the mores of the time. Tom, married, laments his hasty marriage before his posting to England: he is one of thousands of American servicemen who chose - or were led into - quick weddings before shipping out. His love affair with an Englishwoman spotlights cultural differences between the Yanks and the Brits, as when Tom is introduced to an English dessert called \`Spotted Dick.' Then there is the friendship between an upper-class Englishwoman, who has joined the WRENs (Women's Royal Naval Service), and a working-class English serviceman. Homer shows the effects of war on that rigidly class-divided society of 1940s England, when debutantes hung up their ball gowns to don uniforms and venture into the unfamiliar world of hard work and danger in the company of those who might have been their servants.This fast-paced and beautifully-written novel involves several simultaneous themes playing in counterpoint on both sides of the Channel and resolving in two stunning climaxes. In the end, everything that precedes is pulled into sharp and surprising focus."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Those who love historical mysteries and secrets should pounce on this new World War II thriller. It plumbs the historical secrets surrounding one of the greatest moments in all of history - the invasion of Western Europe the world would know as D-Day - and invents a few \\"what ifs\\" of its own.The time and place of D-Day were kept secret for obvious reasons by an amazing program of deception that involved everything from the Allies' building a vast but phony encampment in eastern England out of plywood and rubber balloons to getting \\"turned\\" German spies to radio all sorts of useless information mixed with misinformation back to the Fuhrer.The fascinating characters who populate this gripping novel are largely driven by the times in which they live. An American intelligence officer is set adrift in an alien and baffling country (England) even as he wonders about the girl he left behind. A French-speaking Englishwoman parachutes into France on hair-raising missions to deal with a member of the French Resistance whose loyalties are suspect. An upper-class Englishwoman has donned a uniform to mix with her social inferiors and do her bit for England. And a working-class lad, whose expertise in radar has advanced him in the ranks of His Majesty's forces, harbors a bitter grievance because his family has been forced to move out of their farm in Devon to make way for the Americans to practice their assault landings.Homer fashions this rich history and cast of characters into a day-by-day saga of the two weeks preceding D-Day by interweaving actual history with \\"what if\\" hypotheses: Britain thought it had \\"turned\\" all German spies early in the war. But what if one had been missed, and what if he or she was in a position to steal the secret? And what if the Germans wandered into a D-Day rehearsal (which, as the world found out decades later, actually happened), and what if they picked up an American officer who was privy to the D-Day secret?The characters, who would never had met had it not been for the war, are thrown together to laugh, to fall in love, and, ultimately, to dip into unknown wells of personal courage to save the secret. If you are a lover of historical fiction, this is a book you should not miss."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"In A.R. Homer's second novel, \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins,\\" he wields superb story telling talent that places him alongside Ken Follett, another author who brings human sensitivity to World War II intrigue. This novel set in England and Normandy during the two weeks that precede the Allies invasion of Normandy in May 1944 is an oxymoron. It tells both a touching and thrilling tale that spins yet another version about the \`decoy' used to confuse Hitler on the exact location of the expected invasion: Operation First Violin. Along with wartime intrigue and betrayal, Homer pulls out all the stops in his orchestration of secret lies that force ordinary people, including a wee French orphan called C&eacute;l&egrave;ste, to become extraordinarily brave as he depicts love in its greatest glory surviving in the midst of cruel evil. Homer even achieves arousing the reader's fleeting sympathy for the sleeper German spy set to turn the tables on the brash Americans and snobbish British. Weaving true bits of history through a maze of subversive riddles as he peels open layers of character and story establishes Homer as a master plotter--a star among stars. \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins\\" is a book you'll waive sleep to finish and then recall its vivid images for days afterwards. A remarkable feat, utterly fascinating, and totally credible."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"Author A. R. Homer creates a captivating story of the D-day invasion and all that leads up to it by mixing actual historic facts with both real and fictional characters. His novel, \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins - A Novel of War and Love,\\" is a wonderfully creative and devious mixture of history and imagination.Although this is only Homer's second novel, he is already being viewed as one of the more credible and exciting up-and-coming mystery, thriller writers of his generation. This book is not just a story of WWII spies and espionage; it is laced with great interplay between characters and is partially a love story as well.Actual facts are weaved into and throughout the storyline which adds a touch of realism and believability to the plot. The only thing lacking for this book to make it to the best seller's list is marketing and being \\"discovered\\" by the media. This book is a must read for all avid readers of thriller or WWII books. This book is destined for greatness and gets the MWSA Highest Book Rating - FIVE STARS!"},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"With \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins\\" - his second book - A.R. Homer is fast establishing himself as a master of historical fiction.Like \\"The Mirror of Diana,\\" this tale is fast-paced, with devious twists and turns that captivated me throughout. But it is the characters that make the book come alive: Tom, an American intelligence officer, caught between his hasty wartime marriage and Gwen, a woman so English. And Jeanne Busson, a French-born English special agent, who battles with her conscience during an undercover mission in France.The defense of the vitally-important D-day secret - where and when is the invasion to come - is the theme of the book. Set in Devon, England, and Normandy, France, it covers the twelve tumultuous days leading up to the invasion. Of course, there are those who seek the secret for the enemy: an unknown spy in England, who seeks to betray his own country by striving to inform, Richter, the odious Head of the Gestapo in Normandy. And Josse, a dubious French resistance leader, seems to hunt with the hounds and run with the hare.The story throbs through every hour of every day leading up to the invasion. There are even roles for Eisenhower, Montgomery, Patton, and, indeed, Hitler in this tale.But, for me, the French waif Celeste sits at the center of the story - she captured my heart. Other novels would entrust the D-day secret to generals, special agents and macho men. But in \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins,\\" it is placed in the hands of an eight-years-old orphan, already battered by the blasts of war that have killed her father and made her mother insane.The author is carving his niche in this genre because of his unusual technique. As in his previous work, he takes a historical event and makes you ask: Why? And how? In \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins,\\" for example, he introduces a known historical event that was suppressed by the authorities for thirty years - Operation Tiger, a practice exercise that resulted in the deaths of seven hundred U.S. servicemen. But apart from the huge loss of life, the novel shows how it could have jinxed the entire invasion.Of course, everyone knows the outcome of D-day. But, \\"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins,\\" will still keep you asking: How? And the amazing double denouement will tell you."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins\\" engages us fully from the first page. As with Homer's previous work, \\"The Mirror of Diana,\\" he weaves together a fascinating story that not only keeps us on the edge of our seat, but that informs us and makes history come alive. We learn what it must have been like to be a member of the resistance movement in World War II, and the lengths to which these heros would go to preserve the freedom of their countrymen. Sadly, we also experience the egomaniacal, hateful motivations of those that oppose freedom for their own selfish reasons. This is a love story on many levels, as well -- between friends; man and woman; husband and wife; parent and child, existing within a setting of devastating war and intrigue. Each character is depicted so vividly that it is impossible to stay uninvolved. We are kept in suspense until the very end of the story, about who the evildoers are -- no easy feat! I highly recommend this spectacular second novel by A.R. Homer. It is without a doubt a page-turner......a story you will long remember, and may yet read again and again."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"As an author of historical fiction ('The Augustus Conspiracy\\"), this is one of the best stories from WWII I have read. It's one of those books that you do not want to end because it is so engaging."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"If you are interested in World War II stories, this book is a must read for you. It is concerning D-Day and the two weeks preceding it. D-Day was such a monumental military decision. This discusses some of the little known details setting up this manuever. The book is fiction; but is based on true events. From the French resistance workers, the English Military Intelligence and the American forces; the story comes alive with more history than I had learned in school.From the phantom camp of General Patton to the weather advisors of General Eisenhower, nothing was overlooked to secure the success of D-Day. Equally important are the thoughts and deeds of the German Gestopa. Trying to keep Hitler and the Nazis from learning the true details of the Invasion is the main idea with this story. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Sobs of Autumn's Violins","review":"This novel tells the story behind the days leading up to the historic D-day invasion in 1944. Although I am not a WWII buff, I was captivated from page one when a female assassin is landed on a French beach to eliminate a supposed Nazi collaborator. Once hooked, I was impressed with everything about the novel: the clever plotting, the interesting and totally believable characters, the suspense, the love story woven seamlessly into the war story, the rapid fire chapters that never gave a minute of boredom, and, of course, the diligent scholarship that made a momentous historical event so effortlessly come to life. Although I was sure that history got it right about the actual timing and success of D-day, there were moments as I read this book that I questioned how it would all come out. I mean it when I say that it is a better novel than most of the \\"best sellers\\" on the NY Times list. I look forward to your latest book."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"This book is another of the excellent books that provides a Liturgy of the Hours that is more accessible to laity than the official texts - one need not spend time flipping pages. The prayers cover morning, midday, evening and night prayer and are based on traditional themes, psalms, scripture and prayers. The prayers are Celtic prayers - in contrast to the Latin prayer formats of the official text. What sets this volume apart is the use of litanies - in lieu of hymns and canticles. The result is a very effective communal prayer book - which encourages truly participation. However, the use of litanies makes its use as a solitary prayer less powerful. For those with a specific love of Celtic prayers or for small groups wanting a gentle way into morning/evening prayer this is an excellent volume."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"This little, easy to use prayer book has the fresh turn of phrase and love of the natural world we have come to expect from Celtic spirituality. Easy rubics lead a group or an individual through the prayers and readings selected for each day. I used David Adam's Rhythm of Life at a Celtic Day of Prayer group experience and found it a powerful part of an introduction to the Celtic way of spirituality."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"I've been handing this book out like popcorn to people who are new to the discipline of the daily office--junior high kids in confirmation class, vaguely spiritual but unchurched boomers, old-fashioned evangelicals, just for example-- and everyone is loving it. It's not fussy or complicated--four offices are presented for each day of the week. The prayers are a nice blend of old and new (users learn that there's a treasure trove out there, but that they can compose their own prayers as well). There's an unchanging core, but appendices note that there can be seasonal changes--another hint of worlds to be explored. The best of its kind."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"David Adam weaves his own adaptations of classic liturgical structures with Scripture perfect for times of reflection. Each day focuses on a specific theme which is repeated in the four different prayer times: morning, midday, evening, and night. The liturgies balance worship with petition and centering prayer. I highly recommend this helpful prayer book."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"For anyone with Celtic roots, especially those who are Christian, or who resonate with Celtic spirituality, this book will provide the tools to immerse oneself in ageless prayers and timeless religious practice. The book can be used as a kind of devotional with prayers and readings for everyday. There are two complete sets of readings that can be used for morning and evening devotional time. The first part of the book contains outlines for prayer time in the morning, during the middle of the day and in the evening."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"David Adam brings a holy hush to my day. I am able to set aside the worries and concerns of my world and enter into a peaceful existence. There is a holiness in these prayers that calms the soul and brings your heart back to God. Highly recommended, as are all his books."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"Looking for a simple weekly prayer guide based on the Celtic Way? This is it. The author does a nice job giving each day a particular theme as morning midday and evening prayers are offered in the Celtic tradition. Soul-nourishing stuff!"},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"I have been using this beautiful little book in my daily prayers for several years and it never grows old. With morning, midday and evening prayers, it allows the reader to centre on God at meaningful intervals. I find it particularly helpful in helping to express my heart when I cannot find the words myself."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"This is a wonderful compilation of prayers by day of the week. Each day has a theme (Monday- Creation, Thursday- Community, Friday- the Cross, Sunday- Saints, etc). Each day has a morning, midday, evening, and night section. The prayers include scripture readings, psalms, traditional readings, the Lords Prayer, etc. I find these prayers so helpful and beautiful, and the sections are short enough to pray together each day before meals, at bedtime, or upon awaking."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"I have been using The Rhythm of Life by David Adam as my daily prayer guide fairly consistently for nearly a decade, and I would recommend it very highly to anyone who desires to deepen their relationship with God through daily prayers.Structurally, The Rhythm of Life follows a weekly cycle, from Sunday to Saturday, and is arranged theologically in seven themes -- Resurrection, Creation, Incarnation, Holy Spirit, Community, the Cross, and the Saints. I find this weekly theology cycle enriching and stretching. The diversity and wholeness of the theological themes expand my narrow imagination in prayer, which tends to be focused on my immediate needs and concerns. They gently remind me of the greatness of God's kingdom and the extent of His concern.For each day, there are four offices -- Morning, Midday, Evening, and Night. Those who have time only for one office a day can choose any one of the four as these prayers are not confined to a specific time of the day.Each office follows the same pattern -- Affirmation, Silence, Response, Psalms, Scripture, Canticle, Kyrie, the Lord's Prayer, Intercession, Collect, and Affirmation. During the Kyrie, there are opportunities to bring before God those who are dear to us and those we are concerned about.The prayers are short, meditative, and repetitive. When they are said aloud, they have almost a chant-like quality. I appreciate this aural simplicity. It allows me to hear the resonance of each word within my soul.For me, one of the greatest strengths of this book is that most of the prayers are based on the language of Scripture, the Psalms being the main source, but also derived from various parts of the Old and the New Testament.The physical size of the book is just about perfect; it's small and light, easy to be carried around. I also like the fact that the fonts are of decent size and the text is well spaced.If I were to recommend a single prayer book to friends, it would be this one. Even after having lived with it for nearly a decade, the prayers feel fresh and continue to be meaningful."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"I have found great nourishment in praying the hours from various sources, in particular, the Divine Hours volumes by Phyllis Tickle, Celtic Daily Prayer from the Northumbria Community, and now, The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer by David Adams from the liturgies inspired by the worship on Lindisfarne Island. I love all of these resources.The title Rhythm of Life speaks to a profound truth about life, nature and humanity, that is, that the recognition and celebration of the cycles of life can bring great harmony to the spirit and bring great comfort and a sense of order to our hearts. All of the resources above address this fact implicitly by way of the Liturgical Year, cycles of readings and so forth. I love this volume in particular, because each day of the week (each day having 4 services comprising the Office of the day) is given a thematic emphasis (which is influenced from ecclesiastical tradition). Each day also resonates with a season of the liturgical year or cosmological time (Sunday -- Resurrection -- Easter; Monday -- Creation; Tuesday -- Incarnation/Christmas; Wednesday -- Holy Spirit/Pentecost; Thursday -- Community -- Communion; Friday -- Passion; Saturday -- All Saints/Advent). Therefore, as we travel the week, we enter the stream of the whole history of God's working in the world. As it teaches in the preface of this little volume, God is eternally active, eternally present NOW, and this is what we celebrate when we enter into a rhythmic devotional life. Every day becomes a celebration. Every Sunday is a Feast of the Resurrection; each week beginning anew with our hope and assurance of eternal life."},{"Title":"The Rhythm of Life: Celtic Daily Prayer","review":"Whether or not you're Celtic, Irish, or a mixture, this book of prayer will bring you deep peace.

MGM was certainly worth the wait.As I had hoped Scotty, Colin & Frank had established a m&eacute;nage &aacute; trois with Colin & Frank living in the upstairs apartment. Now the new guys are going to experience their first Mardi Gras which no one in his right mind would miss.The plot begins when Scotty goes to his trusty dealer to get some hits of ecstasy. In spite of ex-Special FBI Agent Frank's concerns, he decides to join them using the party favorite.They have a great night watching the parades and catching the throws of beads & other goo-gas that are traditional followed by a night of heavy dancing at one of the Quarter's better Gay Dance bars. Unfortunately, when they slowly wend their way home in the usually bedraggled state; they are met by the two officers of the New Orleans finest who inform them that Scotty's dealer had been murdered and he was known to be the last to see the victim.Unlike one of the other reviewers, I refuse to put in spoilers so I will just say that the plot unwinds with even more twists and turns than Herren usually gives.I highly recommend that you read this book even though you may not have read the preceding two \\"Scotty\\" books, though that would help.MAY THE GODDESS SMILE UPON YOU!"},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"Former go-go dancer and personal trainer turned amateur private-eye Scotty Bradley is back in \\"Mardi Gras Mambo.\\" Again based in New Orleans (as is its author Greg Heren), this third book in the series was delayed due to the author's forced temporary relocation from that city, although the author wisely avoids including the hurricane in the book, since this is very much about the \\"party hearty\\" New Orleans that may take some time to come back, but hopefully will.This time around, Scotty is in the private eye business with his two lovers, former federal agent Frank and the mysterious Colin, both of whom entered his life in the last book. The fourth main character of the book seems to be the drug Ecstasy, which all three of them find to as necessary as a gym-toned body and a hot costume before going out to party in New Orleans during Mardi Gras. When Scotty's Russian-born Ecstasy dealer turns up dead, shortly after he leaves the dealer's apartment, Scotty becomes a suspect and starts an investigation of his own, with Frank's and Colin's help. What they find is a strange story involving a gay porn site, the Russian mob, a suspicious charater watching their apartment, and a three-for-all filling in another story about Scotty's strange family history.Like the previous ones in the series, this book is not for everyone, but is a highly enjoyable purely escapist novel with a passable (though barely plausible, compared to past books in the series) mystery content to hold one's interest. I like Herren's style, and although I'm sure his depiction of the rampant drug use in New Orleans, especially during Mardi Gras, isn't far from accurate, I wish he would have not made Ecstasy seem as socially acceptable and tolerated as an occasional joint, since it is a message I would not have wanted to send to younger gay readers sure to pick up his novel. I give the book an overall four stars out of five, but was contemplating taking away one star because of the endorsement of that drug."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"In New Orleans, former b-dancer turned private investigator Scotty Bradley returns home at daybreak after a wild night of advance celebrating of Mardi Gras. However, instead of hitting the sack to prepare for Carnival fun with his two boyfriends Frank Sobieski and Colin Cioni, two detectives interrogate Scotty re his being seen in the French Quarter with Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; Misha Saltikov, the source of the sleuth's illegal drug usage. Not long after they were seen talking, someone killed Misha.Though he prefers to stay out of the police investigation, Scotty begins making his own inquiries using underground links that would never talk to a cop. To his shock, Scotty finds his own zany relatives are somehow involved as well some odd Russians who might be Mafioso. At the same time he conducts his investigation, his affairs with Frank and Colin abruptly collapses when the former is abducted and the latter vanishes without a trace leaving Scotty with a second and perhaps third personal case to deal with that is if nothing ties together and so far nothing has.In his third appearance (see BOURBON STREET BLUES and JACKSON SQUARE JAZZ), Scotty is at his beleaguered best coping poorly with cops suspecting him in a drug deal turned bad and even worse with his lovers gone. The investigation is terrific as the hero pays homage to the city he cherishes while trying to prove his innocence, save his lovers, and celebrate Fat Tuesday. MARDI GRAS MUMBO is a fabulous gay Noir.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"When I was in junior high and forced to read some boring Victorian tome, my mother advised me to read the first 50 pages, the middle 50 and the last 25 and call it a day. I'm giving you the same advice about this book if you feel compelled to read it.The book opens with some lengthy exposition for those who did not read the earlier volumes, which is entirely worth skipping. Scotty then proceeds to tell us about his menage with Frank and Colin and describe a role-playing sex scene in which he watches Frank and Colin through a window. That, however, is the sum total of the sex scenes between the three men which seemed like a ridiculous waste of a good set up!The plot begins when Scotty visits his drug dealer, Mischa, to score some Ecstasy because, as Scotty says, you cannot possibly have a good time at Mardi Gras without alcohol, pot AND Ecstasy. Sure. Okay and you don't have a drug problem, Scotty. Not at all. The three men don their costumes, all take a hit of the drugs and set off to have a high old time. On their way back in the wee hours of the morning they are met by Scotty's old cop friend, Venus who informs them that Scotty was the last person to see Mischa, who is now dead due to murder.At this point, the plot line and the plot devices became increasingly convoluted and finally, utterly ridiculous. By the time the author introduced identical triplets with rhyming names, I was ready to throw the book against the wall. At the point where the author has his own characters talking about the \\"incredible coincidences\\" and the ridiculous aspects of the events, you know that the author has given up even trying to create anything remotely rational and believable. I now skimmed the rest of the book and by the end wished I'd never wasted ANY time on this self-indulgent, drug-fueled mess of a book.Finally, I freely admit that I had a problem with the excessive amount of drugs Scotty used on every possible occasion in the last volume in this series because it seemed to me he had a serious problem and no one was acknowleding that fact. In this volume, however, the drug use seemed to escalate as did the problems resulting from said drug use -- involvement in a murder, kidnapping, violence etc and yet no one ever suggests stop using drugs. Frank, the formerly-straight-arrow FBI agent, even begins using drugs because he decides he needs to loosen up, even after he's been part of a potentially-fatal kidnapping. I not only did not find that Frank's decision to start using terribly believable, I found it disturbing to watch a scene in which he smoked pot, took a hit of Ecstasy and then went to a bar for drinks and this is portrayed as just fun, reasonable and normal. If I were Frank's family/friends I'd be asking him what had become of him since he hooked up with Scotty? Murder, mayhem, and drugs... Surely he can do better than Scotty.As can we all."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"\\"Last night I dreamed it was Mardi Gras again.\\"I admit that I was a little skeptical of the idea of a psychic go-go dancer PI. But if I can accept the idea of some little old lady in England solving murders or a ghost helping to bring his killer to justice, why should I draw the line at an ex-exotic dancer with a hotline to The Goddess?In the diverting third book of the series, PI Scotty Bradley sets out to discover who killed his drug dealing crony, and stumbles over a number of disturbing secrets--a few uncomfortably close to home.I'm glad I gave this one a shot. Main character Scotty Bradley is a likeable scamp with enough vulnerabilities to make him interesting--and the dynamic between S. and his lovers, former FBI agent Frank and cat burglar Colin, is solid...right up to a rather disconcerting twist at the end (though I'm guessing not as disconcerting a twist as it would have been had I been following the series all along).The mystery itself is amusingly preposterous--it's all done in broadstrokes--for the most part.Herren's affectionate portrayal of doomed New Orleans gives the book a certain poignancy--underscored by the REBECCA-like opening. So despite the laughs, in the end, MARDIS GRAS MAMBO touches heart as well as funny bone."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"\\"Mardi Gras Mambo\\" has wonderful insider details about Carnival in New Orleans and a rip-roaring, action-filled conclusion.Fans of the series should certainly read this entry, but fans of gay mysteries or New Orleans mysteries should probably read the earlier two books first, in chronological order, because they introduce characters and themes carried forward here."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"This is my third murder mystery I have read by Greg Herren. He delivers a fast-paced story, interesting characters and good plot development. The characters are all hot! I love Scotty the main character and all his off-beat family. It makes for a good read. The 'almost' love scenes were continually interrupted by an event or somebody is too tired. Even when it's three people! I found this to be tiresome and repetitive part in his books. But the story line is very good and not disappointing. Looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"Full of twist and turns. When you think you know it all , you are suprised to find out you don't."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"This book was a great read as I recall it was the very first of many books I read by Greg Herren, he has a very good way of writing and the two series he has going are great to follow in the lives of each individual in them. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes gay fiction and gay mysteries."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"I love a good mystery. Greg delivers another one in this book. This time, the mystery centers around the Bradley family's secrets. The murder of Scotty's drug dealer sets him on an investigation that keeps coming back to an uncomfortable truth: that even people we think we know well have hidden lives and agendas. Scotty finds out that his parents have withheld information about his grandfather's secret second family. That doesn't sit well with Scotty, because he was raised to believe that his family was open and honest. But his parents aren't the only ones holding back the truth, and as bodies start piling up around Scotty, more people who are close to him reveal their secrets. Some are devastating betrayals, but some repair strained relationships. I don't want to say any more about the twists and turns this story takes, because that's all the fun of reading a mystery.There are several things that make this book enjoyable. Scotty loves life, and his irrepressible determination to enjoy himself makes him unique as a detective. Greg's love of New Orleans simply shines through the book, and he makes you want to love his city too. And, of course, it's a damn good mystery with well paced action and humor that keep you turning pages right to the end."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"Greg Herren is a fun writer that is very entertaining.

I would recommend reading these in order so that you can grow with the character of Scotty. I am glad to hear that Greg is not done with Scott Bradley but only took a break from him for awhile. I can not wait for number four."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"MARDI GRAS MAMBO is an enjoyable and brave novel. I'm glad Greg Herren has decided not to retire Scotty; I'd hate to see the last of such a likable character who gets into such interesting scrapes. And I say that as someone who absolutely loathes both Tarot cards and (most) Goddesses. Scotty is a bit of a ditz, and his defensiveness and self-consciousness about it are endearing. Nonetheless, he generally manages to make the best of his many bad situations. Memo to readers: You needn't share the characters' beliefs, personalities, politics, sexualities, or attitudes to enjoy a good story. Reading is about broadening your horizons, which doesn't happen by insisting only on characters exactly like yourself."},{"Title":"Mardi Gras Mambo","review":"Greg Herren presents his 3rd Scotty Bradley novel, and although this one isn't quite up to par with the previous novels, it is still a good read. It's fast reading and fun.I did find the writing a bit loose and wandering at times, and the characters a bit difficult to follow as well. The story line was a tad bizzare but it fit with my concept of New Orleans during Mardis Gras.I was saddened that Storm ended his use of \\"my queen\\" to endearingly tease his brother. I found that term to be sweet, fun and showed the acceptance and caring of one brother to another. Mr. Herren indicates that the Publisher (who must be incredibly constipated) insisted he drop usage of the term. How sad.I also had a bit of a problem with the excessive hard drug use in this novel. For someone carrying a license and in an area of law enforcement (sorta) risking your entire career to recreational drug use is stupid. I expected much more from Scotty. And then to seduce your lovers into the same hard drug use arena, and from the sound of it, making them addicts to the drug really is uncalled for IMHO. Interestingly, I didn't have the same feelings about the pot use...I too would recommend reading the other books in the series first to really get the character development. I anxiously await the next volume, due to be released in May."},{"Title":"Juan and Juanita","review":"Evidently this must have been a book of value in its day, with gilded edges and illustrations by Henry Sandham.

As terse as Emerson is expansive, Bacon's &quot;Essays&quot; are perhaps the most truly Classical (in spirit) prose in the English language. Fans of the Leo Strauss school should have a fieldday reading between the lines of the essays &quot;On Atheism&quot; and &quot;On Superstition&quot;; for the rest of us, nobody can come away from even one of these essays without gaining invaluable insights. Though Bacon is rightly heralded for the radical newness of his pragmatic methods, he is ensteeped in history-- those mindful of Napoleon's dictum that history is the only true philosophy will certainly respond enthusiastically to Bacon's approach. From the post-Machiavellian insights of &quot;Of Empire&quot; to the pre-Enlightenment ethics of &quot;Of Goodness and Goodness of Nature&quot;, one will find in reading Bacon's prose what the youth of Athens must have found in following Socrates: the presence of a benevolent, worldly-wise, supremely rational mind determined to show you the order of the world."},{"Title":"Essays","review":"A collection of 59 essays by one of the shrewdest bipeds (some would say a brilliant rogue!) that ever walked this stale promontory of ours .

The word \\"essai\\" in French means a trial or attempt, and this was at one time the normal meaning of \\"essay\\" in English; Bacon was the first to use the word in its current literary sense. His \\"Essays\\" were first published in 1597, although he was to publish revised and expanded editions in 1612 and 1625, a year before his death. In its final form the work includes 58 essays; these are published here together with an unfinished fragment, \\"Of Fame\\".Bacon's \\"Essays\\" are meditations on a range of subjects, mostly on weighty general subjects such as \\"Of Truth\\", \\"Of Death\\" or \\"Of Love\\". Although a vast amount could be written on almost any of the topics he treats, the essays are nearly all very brief, some less than two pages in length. All 58 essays together account for well under 200 pages in total. And yet Bacon is skilled in the art of saying much in little, and however brief one of his essays may be it always contains food for thought. He is a master of the pithy epigram or \\"aphorism, such as \\"\\"Men fear death, as children fear to go into the dark\\", \\"\\"He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune\\"- the first known use of this phrase- or \\"Fortune is like the market where, many times, if you can stay a little, the price will fall\\". He often supports his arguments with quotations from the Bible and from Classical authors, Tacitus and Seneca being particular favourites. (He generally quotes Roman authors in the original Latin, although Greek ones are always translated).Although Bacon wrote a book, \\"The New Atlantis\\", describing an ideal society along the lines of More's \\"Utopia\\", the world-view which emerges from the \\"Essays\\" is far from Utopian. His essays on political subjects, which are generally among the longer ones in the collection, are less concerned with questions of an ideal society, or even of political morality, than with giving advice to princes and rulers as to how they might best retain and consolidate their power. On such topics he was clearly influenced by the Italian philosopher Machiavelli, an approach which has struck some commentators as immoral, or at least amoral. In his introduction the editor Michael Hawkins quotes William Blake's view of the \\"Essays\\", \\"Good advice from Satan's kingdom\\". On religion Bacon generally takes a moderate position; he is critical of atheism, but still more so of \\"superstition\\", a word which in his usage would encompass religious fanaticism as well as superstition in the modern sense. (\\"It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such an opinion as is unworthy of him\\").Not all the essays are of the same interest to the modern reader; \\"Of Love\\", for example, reads like the musings of a cynic who has never been in love with anyone, and \\"Of Building\\" and \\"Of Gardens\\" say little of general interest, being merely a description of an idealised princely palace and its surroundings. My main criticism of this particular edition (\\"Everyman's University Library\\"), however, has nothing to do with the essays themselves, which remain thought-provoking and pertinent four hundred years after they were written. I felt that Mr Hawkins should have provided greater assistance to the modern reader, especially as this volume is presented as part of a \\"university library\\". He provides a glossary of obscure words and those which have changed their meaning since Bacon's day, and translations of the various Latin quotations, but there are no footnotes to explain Bacon's many allusions. To take an example, he translates Caesar's epigram \\"Sylla nescivit litteras; non potuit dictare\\" (\\"Sylla was ignorant of letters; he could not dictate\\"), but he does not explain who Sylla was, nor the occasion on which Caesar uttered these words, nor what Caesar meant by them.This matters because Bacon was clearly writing for the educated reader, but many allusions which would have been easily comprehensible to any educated reader in the early seventeenth century have, with the passage of time, become much less so to an educated reader in the early twenty-first. For this reason, therefore, this is not an edition I could recommend; anyone with an interest in Bacon would be well-advised to seek out a more scholarly version."},{"Title":"Essays","review":"Will Durant's - The Story of Philosophy - Chapter on Francis Bacon.Bacons' finest literary product, the Essays (1597-1623), show him still torn between these two loves, for politics and for philosophy. In the \\"Essay of Honor and Reputation\\" he gives all the degrees of honor to political and military achieve-ments, none to the literary or the philosophical. But in the essay \\"Of Truth\\" he writes : \\"The inquiry of truth, which isthe love-making or wooing of it; the knowledge of truth, which is the praise of it ; and the belief of truth, which is theenjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human natures.

Rarely shall you find so much meat, so admirably dressed and flavored, in so small a dish. Bacon abhors padding, and disdains to waste a word; he offers us infinite riches in a little phrase; each of these essays gives in a page or two the distilled subtlety of a master mind on a major issue of life. It is difficult to say whether the matter or the manner more excels; for here is language as supreme in prose as Shakespeare's is in verse.Durants preference is for Essays 2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18, 20, 27, 29, 38, 39, 42, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54.----------Purchased this book Dec 2012.

The modern scientific method owes an enormous debt of gratitude to Bacon's induction method. Bacon bases his induction method on observation and experiment. His Essays - this book - makes observations about life in all its varied dimensions. As an economist my reading focused on essays with a material content such as the essays \\"Of Innovations\\", \\"Of Riches\\", \\"Of Customs and Education\\", and so on. However, I have browsed or will soon browse other essays of the book.Overall, it is impressive that one person did so much that has remained so insightfully informative for so long!

Bacon's epigramatic wisdom has a power , a poetic condensation. I do not know the essays as a whole , but I do have the sense of Bacon as a powerful intellect capable of providing insight into diverse areas of life. I do not however have the sense of a self , and one with humor irony charm of a kind one has with Montaigne who is a far more appealing figure.I also believe the sometimes contradictory, and often ' broken' character of the essays do make them at times feel as if they are collections of individual apercus rather than whole constructions.On the whole though this is a classic work one which I intend to look in and reread again."},{"Title":"Essays","review":"A magnificent combination of style and substance. Every essay is memorable, thought provoking and a sheer pleasure to read. As wise a book as was ever written."},{"Title":"Essays","review":"There is little doubt that for the modern reader, usually the college undergraduate, reading Bacon's essays is a challenging obstacle. It is not simply that his essays were written more than four centuries ago and that the English language has evolved considerably since then. The problem lies more in the style in which Bacon felt most comfortable. His erudition was immense. His audience was not meant to be the ill-trained lower class tradesman still fumbling with the rudiments of Basic English. Rather, he wrote for readers much like himself, highly conversant in history, literature, foreign languages, and philosophy.When Bacon first began to write his essays, his primary model was Montaigne, who wrote in the highly personalized, discursive style that Bacon felt ill-equipped to emulate. Bacon was one of the first of his era to write in the terse epigrammatic style in which much is said in few words. Today, many of his sentences read as if they were taken straight from Chinese fortune cookies. Bacon favored the use of balanced phrases and parallel construction. Such writing calls attention to itself, even to the point where the means may overwhelm the message. Much of his work is replete with references to classical writers of antiquity. He often drops a vague reference to an unnamed Greek or Roman, whose identity must be supplied by editors in the form of helpful footnotes. The cultural illiteracy of modern youth is evident since it does little good to know the name without also knowing a great deal about the life and times of that writer, most of which cannot be squeezed into a footnote. Bacon also uses highly Latinate sentences with wild abandon. Since most readers today have trouble recalling their high school Latin, footnotes are again necessary.Bacon begins his essays with a helpful one sentence summation of his thesis. Sometimes he takes a definite stand as in \\"Of Parents and Children\\" and in others as in \\"Of Marriage and Single Life\\" he does not. The reader must ascertain which essay provides this definitive result, and with Bacon, this is not always an easy task. Part of the problem that readers today have with plowing through Bacon's essays is that they have been trained to look for ideas in the context of the whole paragraph, which usually boils down to main idea, supporting detail, and conclusion. Bacon, however, did not achieve his fame in that manner. The persistent reader will discover that the key to Bacon is to look for meaning not in the macroscopic world of the paragraph but in the microscopic world of the individual phrase or even the solitary word. Bacon's penchant for the pithy phrase and illusive word often carry the linguistic day. The rest of the paragraph is often no more than a refutation or support of that word or phrase.Adding to Bacon's aforementioned writing quirks is yet another: his use of antithesis, which refers to statements for or against a topic. Bacon often wrote his essays as if he were setting up both sides of a debate, thus necessitating giving evidence from both sides. Since his observations frequently dealt with generalized assessments of human life and how it should be lived, the reader had to assimilate these contraries, sometimes without even knowing which stand Bacon favored. And it is here that Bacon connects style to content. Since Bacon favored the inductive method of thought and research, one that proceeds from evidence to conclusion, it made sense for him to observe the world by noting both sides of a controversial issue. The reader, then, in the absence of Bacon's blunt support of one side or another, had to examine the evidence before reaching his own conclusion. Since the target audience was the seeker of power or the man about town, Bacon wanted to train that man to look beyond the obvious, to coolly and deliberately assess his position before advancing. This presupposed a mind much like Bacon's own. Modern readers are not used to such a cold and calculating approach to life, and it is as much this as any linguistic device that renders Bacon's essays both challenging and discomforting."},{"Title":"Essays","review":"Awesome book, especially considering when it was written. Bacon apparently was one of the first Europeans to re-introduce the materialism of Epicurus that had been suppressed by organized religious fanatics, aka the Church.

Listen","review":"In my lifelong search for answers to the questions many of my peers seem to find unimportant I have read a great many new age and metaphysical works. Among them was 'Conversations with God' (1, 2 &amp; 3) which I found interesting. However, sometimes I had the feeling that there was significant interference on the line to God and at times it even went dead and NDW just filled in the blanks. At the other end of the spectrum, I also have a copy of 'A Course in Miracles' and again there seem to be many kernels of truth in it but they are so wrapped up in Judeo-Christian mumbo jumbo that it's hard to sift the wheat from the chaff (to borrow the Bibilical terminology).With this book,&quot;If a Rock Speaks or a Stream Sings....Listen&quot;, there seems to be little of the personal overlay which accompanies so many works of this kind. Despite the limitations of language as a communication tool, the message comes across with great clarity. As you read you constantly find yourself saying, 'A-ha!' I have returned to the book time and time again (especially the first couple of chapters)and every time I find something new to think about.

It is a China that never was but really ought to have been."},{"Title":"The wallet of Kai Lung","review":"I'm a big fan of Kai Lung, but this installment disappointed me rather. The pseudo-Chinese is a little too twee, with the puppy-pies and the cute-ified but insufficiently disguised English cliches (the \\"well-known exclamation of the Emperor Tsing on the battle-field of Shih-ho, 'A sedan-chair! a sedan-chair! This person will unhesitatingly exchange his entire and well-regulated Empire for such an article'\\"). Kai Lung himself is much less prominent than in other books I liked better, such as his \\"Golden Hours\\" and \\"Unrolling His Mat,\\" merely the storyteller here never a character in an overarching frame story (there is one story he claims to be telling about himself, but it's hardly the real K.L.)--and in the last several stories, he isn't there at all even as the teller, they're just unconnected little vignettes.So my first reaction was: a much later and lesser work, Bramah really got sloppy after a while. Not so, it turns out: according to Wikipedia, this was the first of the Kai Lung books, and by a good long head start, like 20 years. So it wasn't that Bramah got worse with time, instead he greatly improved. Which I find a happier thought. But even so, this book only gets only a couple stars, where later works in the series are clear fives.Should also note that Bramah lets some real satire peak through from time to time concerning the literary and publishing world.

Smith published 'The Wallet of Kai Lung' in 1900, after a failed career as a farmer, and went on to write many more Kai Lung stories, as well as other genre fiction that influenced a wide range of authors in the early part of the century. But it is probably for these stories of a China that never was for which he is best known, especially after two later collections were reprinted in the old Ballantine Adult Fantasy imprint edited by Lin Carter.I suppose they are a particular brand of fantasy - especially with their occasional inclusion of gods and dragons - but it is above all for the dry wit that Bramah infused into their narratives that makes them worth reading. Written as if translated from the Mandarin, the resultant, often tortuous, renderings are full of subtle fun that refuses to call attention to itself, and therein lies much of the charm of Bramah's style. Speaking in a highly refined and polished manner, Kai Lung and the characters he tells of are so cautious of giving offense that the conversations dance and twist around one another until it becomes nearly absurd. No brief example can really do Bramah's style justice, but here is an attempt anyway. At the conclusion of one of Kai Lung's stories, a group of brigands who had been enchanted away from a planned robbery by the storyteller's spell are at first infuriated, but then find out that their plans had been known anyway, and would surely have been caught and hanged if they had carried out the heist:'At this intimation of the eminent service which Kai Lung had rendered them, the nature of their faces towards him at once changed completely, those who only a moment before had been demanding his death particularly hailing him as their inspired and unobtrusive protector, and in all probability, indeed, a virtuous and benignant spirit in disguise'.Also scattered throughout the stories are scores of invented proverbs and sayings, my absolute favorite of which is 'Although there exist many thousand subjects for elegant conversation, there are persons who cannot meet a cripple without talking about feet'.Altogether, 'The Wallet of Kai Lung' is an enjoyable diversion; unfortunately it can also be a bit taxing. Sometimes Bramah's syntax is so convoluted that I had to read it over more than once to get its meaning. By the end of the collection, I was ready to move on to something a little more clear. Still, for its charm and subtlety, I can safely recommend Ernest Bramah to those who appreciate those things, even if it might best broken up into smaller doses instead of read straight through."},{"Title":"The wallet of Kai Lung","review":"Ernest Bramah is , in my humble opinion, one of the greatest weavers of tales ever. He has the ability to make me swoon with his wonderful use of words, his wit and humor."},{"Title":"The wallet of Kai Lung","review":"This collection of stories is a jumble of humorous anecdotes, not well connected or introduced. The only unifying elements are an over-elaberate mocking of Chinese literary conventions in English and a common narrator in Kai Lung. This is as a hut made of ill placed and random sticks. Some of the sticks may be interesting, but as a whole they do not provide much shelter."},{"Title":"William Faulkner A to Z: The Essential Reference to His Life and Work","review":"If you are more than a casual reader of Faulkner you will want to refer to this to find out when and where characters appear and how they may have changed from one novel to another.

There are other benefits, but the basic outlines and character descriptions are the most valuable to me."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is a classic book written by an iconic writer over 100 years ago. They were a little wordy in those days. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"A fantasy written long ago in 1887, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea started almost an entire genre of fantasy with submarines like the Tom Clancy novels. In this story ships all over the world claim to have seen a mysterious shifting black reef. Many thought it was just a rumor until it bore a hole into the hull of a steamer that had been able to make it back to shore. Pierre Arronax, a French biology expert, and his servant are invited on a ship going to hunt this creature. When the ship sunk, they found themselves captive on the creature that turned out to be a submarine, and it captain, Nemo, a genius who despised human society, showed them the wonders of the depths.Slow and plodding, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea does not match the excitement of more contemporary fantasy fiction. One reason that this book did not appeal to me is that, compared to the other fantasy book that I am reading, The Fires of Heaven by Robert Jordan, the characters and events are dull and boring. For example, a protagonist in The Fires of Heaven, Mat Cauthon, has two intriguing aspects. One is his incredible luck in games of chance. The other, most fascinating aspect, is that he has vivid memories of lives lived in the distant past. there is no character in the Jules Vern novel that can compare to such a riveting figure.Jules Vern's novel is flat and unimaginative in contrast to Robert Jordan's work. I was told it was a classic, but I was disappointed by its quality of creativity. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy fiction."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"okay i think this is a pretty good book but it's not that intresting.

The men are taken prisoners of the strange creature and have to find a way to escape! Jule Verne was a great author born in Naotes, France in 1828.

The author was very good at detail and I was able to see what the author was talking about in all of the different parts of the oceans, and the ship, which they worked and slept, and ate in.

But the sea creature turns out to be a submarine, the Nautilus, and they're joined by the harpooner Ned Land in being rescued/captured by its crew when their attack on it fails.I definitely encountered this book far too late to fully enjoy it. Like when I tried re-reading Tolkein a couple of years ago, I found I lacked the patience to read through pages and pages of interminable description. There were several times when I just couldn't stand it any longer and I'd put the book down and go do something else. Only sheer stubbornness made me finish it.The story itself was interesting, though the style of the times was a bit of an obstacle. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is never fully explained, nor are the professor and his two companions. It's left up to the reader to fill in the blanks. The professor's unconcern about his imprisonment on the submarine is partially explained by his fascination with the undersea worlds he encounters; the complacence of his assistant and Ned Land are less understandable. Ned Land does try to escape occasionally, but he's portrayed as narrow-mindedly violent because of that, which I found peculiar.I do see why films were made from this--condensing those descriptive passages into scenery would make the action and adventure parts of the story stand out more. I've never seen one, but I'm thinking of adding one to the Netflix queue. Any suggestions of which version to try?In short, I'm giving this 4 stars for the story, but 2 stars for the pain of reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Unfortunately, \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" shows its age. While the story is, actually, quite good, the language is somewhat stilted and the book takes a while to really get going. I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better. I think that the Walt Disney movie is a much better bet if you want to expose your child to a story that was a true classic.

But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book was an amazing book that I could not put down after I started reading it.

Bad translations have cut and mangled Verne's writing, often making his style seem arthritic, his plots disjointed, and his thematic content insipid. Therefore my reviews of Verne's novels usually are concerned with a particular edition of Verne.This is a review of the 1962 Bantam Classic edition of _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_ (1870). It contains an introduction by Ray Bradbury comparing Captains Nemo and Ahab. (Nemo is mad north-by-northwest, but Ahab is _really_ crazy.) The translation is by Anthony Bonner, which is generally rated as \\"above average\\" by Verne scholars. Bonner does maintain some errors from the older (and much inferior) Mercier Lewis translation. For example, Nemo still says that the steel plates on the _Nautilus_ have a density of .7 to .8 that of water. If this were true, the steel would be lighter than water! What Nemo actually says in the original text is that the specific gravity of the steel plates is 7.8. What a difference a few decimal places can make!But on the balance, the Bonner translation does very well in allowing Verne to exercise his scientific knowledge without cutting or mangling it. The discussion by Professor Aronnax of sea pressure and the type of creature that would have to withstand it, the details of the electrical system of the _Nautilus_, the shipbuilding figures for constructing the submarine, the calculations of the formidable Black Stream... all are detailed and concrete. (Though admittedly, there is electronic information that is withheld from us.) And there are underwater sights such as these:The sun's rays struck the surface at a rather oblique angle, and, refracted by this contact as if passing through a prism, they tinted the edges of rocks, plants, shells and corals with the seven colors of the solar spectrum. It was a marvelous feast for the eyes; colors criss-crossed one another in a veritable kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue-- the entire palette of an enthusiastic colorist! (113)And again, during an undersea funeral near a coral forest:The light [from our lamps] produced a thousand charming effects as it played about these brightly colored branches. I thought I could see these tissuelike cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the wavy motion of the water. Small, fast fish would would dart past like flocks of birds. I was tempted to pick the coral's fresh flowers and delicate tentacles, some of which had just blossomed and others scarcely yet opened. But if my hand drew near these living, sensitive flowers, an alarm would spread throughout the colony. The white blossoms would dart inside their red cases and vanish from sight; the shrub would change into a block of stony bulges. (175)The enigmatic Captain Nemo (sometimes vindictive and villainous, sometimes noble and heroic) promises his three involuntary guests: \\"You will travel through a land of marvels. Your mind will be in a continual state of astonishment and stupefaction. It will be difficult to get bored with the continual spectacle that will pass before your eyes\\" (71). And do you know, the Captain is right. The voyage of the _Nautilus_ is truly a grand adventure-- almost the archtypical extraordinary voyage-- from the undersea hunting party, to the encounter with the giant clam, to the visit to Atlantis, to the battle with the squid, to the use of Nemo's thunderbolts.Some modern readers grumble over the length and detail of Verne's descriptive passages. But remember: Jules Verne wasn't writing for an audience that had seen dozens of underwater movies. His task was to get people who had _never_ seen such a sight \\"to enter a new element\\" (71) and experience it for the very first time. He did this. And if you give Verne half a chance, he will do it again."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Almost twenty years ago, I took hold of this book and remember reading it in a day (though we all know how memory can trick you). I didn't recall much more of a narrative other than a general knowledge when I took it again, but I remember avidly my childhood experience and feelings which went hand in hand with this book. It was all about mysteries, about adventure, about submerging into the unknown depths on a strange vessel accompanied with a mysterious figure of Captain Nemo. I recall reading, after lengthy search, sequel of this novel, trying to fulfill the urge for finishing of the tale, and being astonished with events on mystery island that summed up the story. Verne was one of my first authors and first guide to the fantastic world of science fiction. Much has changed since those days. In part, I blame it all to growing-up, other parts would be too lengthy to mention. I picked this book again about a month or so, hearing the praise of this translation of Naval institute press, wanting to remember some of the experiences I had as a child. Effect was quite opposite. I was bored to death. And I saw too much. Somehow, when you're innocent in reading, when your voyage through world of books is only at its beginning, world seems much simpler and you take your story for granted. You're easily marveled by plot, by gadgets, by effects, by sheer promise of something unknown that unravels in front of you, failing to notice all of the work that lies somewhere behind. When you loose your virginity, when you spend countless hours studying the mechanism of narration, the idea of fiction and storytelling, those hidden things come before your eyes. And you start to see faults and errors, bad phrases and filler paragraphs, you begin to see colonialism, glorification of science, problems of liberty and equality and rhythm of the text and somehow it all falls apart. Instead of the wondrous book that you remember from childhood, you hold before yourself gigantic block of text without almost any kind of value other than historical one. Reader that exists today, one that grew distant from childhood innocence, keeps noticing the cramped language, keeps comparing Verne to other authors of the period and finding him outmatched, keeps noticing hasty structure with uneven tempo and failing rhythm, keeps noticing typified characterization and obsessiveness about scientific detail which painfully slows narration and cannot avert his gaze from all of that. It existed before, for sure, but being unaware of it, made \\"20 000 leagues under the sea\\" a fond memory. Today, it stands for concept of bad literature. I am aware that many of the Verne's fans out there could debate me on numerous points here but I do not wish to start a debate here. This text talks more about me as a reader than about the book in question, but in a way it is accounting of an experience and personal voyage through concepts of literature. If your views are similar to mine, it is likely that you will also be disappointed with this book. Maybe this should come with a stamp - not suitable for those above 14. And maybe, once again, I'm failing to see something of importance. Maybe another decade or so will shed some more light on it. Oh and, by the way, edition and translation is great."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book looks very nice, it is great to have the whole map on the cover so you can actually follow the travels.

Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative.

In this classic book he takes the reader through the unexplored depths of the ocean on a fantastic and breathtaking voyage fraught with excitement and danger.I have read several reviews of this book from a variety of sources. The biggest criticism that is offered by the reviewers is that throughout the book Verne, through the words of Professor Annorax, lists and describes a multitude of sea life, both flora and fauna. Many reviewers find this distracting and boring. My personal opinion is that the reason that many readers and reviewers criticize this is because they are comparing the book to the very poor Disney film interpretation and adaptation of the book.In truth, the book would suffer greatly without the detailed description of the flora and fauna observed by Professor Annorax. Why? I believe that many of the readers and reviewers misunderstand Verne's intention of who Professor Annorax is. Professor Annorax is a world renown naturalist and specialist in sea life. That is exactly what makes this story so wonderful. Verne takes the worlds foremost expert on sea flora and fauna and throws him into a world previously unknown to him. By observing the many life forms never before documented Annorax realizes just how much he does not know and becomes an even greater expert than before. The documentation of the many species is the natural response an expert naturalist would have to the sudden discovery of a whole new world of flora and fauna.Clearly, Verne had a vivid imagination by describing a functioning submarine well before the concept of a submarine had ever been dreamt of. The detailed explanations of how the submarine works and how it is able to produce electricity and power from nothing more than sea water is perhaps the best kind of science fiction, the kind that has a basis in fact. I have to believe that when the first submarines were being built that the inventors had to have made a serious study of Verne's Nautilus. To have come up with such an intricate, detailed, and scientifically sound description of a submarine in his time is absolutely astounding.Finally, the accuracy of the never before seen flora and fauna when coupled with the scientifically accurate description of the design and functioning of the Nautilus has to make one wonder if Captain Nemo and the Nautilus are really science fiction or if by some miracle they did actually exist and instead of fiction this story was a summary of a real experience Verne, as Professor Annorax, actually experienced."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was one of the best books of it's time and it's legacy still continues today. The author Jules Verne is able to create a world that is fantastic and believable at the same time. However there are moments in which the details become repetitive and rather insignificant.The main character Captain Nemo, it is never obvious if he is the protagonist or antagonist, has a personality that is quite paradoxical. He believes that mankind has wrecked the earth and has given up on the human race as so decides to escape it by traveling the seas in his submarine. However, he is compassionate towards his crew members. At most times he is emotionless, but it is his emotional trauma that bothers him more than anything else. He is a complex character who is interesting, mysterious, and quite interesting to analyze.The story line is intriguing and Verne's imagination adds to the impact of the plot. The story begins with a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner looking for a giant sea creature that has destroyed several ships. It turns out that this creature that they are looking for, and find, is Captain Nemo's submarine. Verne is also able to create a wonderful world full of different creature of the sea as well as the submarine it's self. At the time the book was written sea travel was common but submarines were unheard of. The description of the vessel and its ability must have wowed readers of the time.However, it's Verne's over usage of description and unnecessary plot that tends to ruin the pace of the story. For pages on end there is a constant rambling of encyclopedia-like information. Is it really necessary to know the name, size, origin, composition, weight (etc) of some random mineral that naturalist happens to find?Unfortunately these random occurrences make the book a little hard to follow, but in the end it is still a classic that everyone should end up reading."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Twenty Thousand Leagues under The Sea by Jules Verne is one of the bestscience fiction books.

Sure, \\"20,000 Leagues\\" seemed bigger than the others I'd read, but I thought it would be the classic excitement and drama of Verne all the way. Well, I was nearly right.Professor Arronax leaves a \\"normal\\" life in France for the US, taking his assistant with him, to investigate the matter that has taken all the attention of the \\"modern\\" or \\"known\\" world. Joined by the egotistic harpooner, Ned Land, they seek adventure, and they find it.Again, I see Verne's classic touch of the dramatic as the threesome find the monster - the Nautilus - or rather, as the Nautilus finds them. They awaken to an interminable adventure under the sea. The Professor is fascinated, or perhaps, intoxicated with the endless wealth of life in the sea and spends hours, days and months observing and recording. The tireless taxonomist takes in all the eye can see and with the help of his assistant, classifies it all. This is where the tedium began for me as the reader. Pages upon pages of pure taxonomy.The accounts of the undersea explorations in specially designed suits offers some relief. The enigmatic Captain Nemo is in charge; incidents and never accidents. Everything about him is shrouded in mystery - pondering on the life of Captain Nemo offers some useful distraction and provides the fuel to consume more and more pages.However, you can never miss Verne's climactic scenes, where he brings drama and suspense to their peak. The almighty Nautilus is trapped inside a huge mass of ice at the South Pole, and for the first time, Captain Nemo shows signs of worry, however subtle. Yet, he goes on with a steely determination. Things are looking very desperate, but as usual, the day is saved. However, I found myself following every detail, sharing all their fears, their toil, their despair. Their ecstasy was mine when the Nautilus broke free. I was totally drawn in......The irritable Ned Land sparks the fire of escape. He's sick and tired of submarine life as Nemo shows no signs of releasing his charges. The adventure ends with the escape of the threesome back to terra firma, or does it? I guess it continued with Captain Nemo and his longsuffering crew until his death, burying years of useful knowledge and resources under the sea. Or did he live forever?A highly challenging but rewarding read for the discerning reader or Verne fanatic."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Oh my gosh, this book is so cool! And so very important in understanding Verne's place in literary and scientific history. This large format book is an annotated version of the most widely circulated English translation of t he Verne classic. And because of the annotations, we learn how HORRIBLY Verne's work was translated from the original French. A great example comes near the beginning of the book when the delightfully detailed annotation in the margin points out that the common edition translation talks of the narrator returning from the \\"disagreeable territory of Nebraska.\\" We learn from the annotation that this is a huge distortion of the narrator's personality and experience. Verne's original writing spoke of the \\"badlands of Nebraska\\" and actually had a favorable attitude toward the region. We learn from the annotations that there were dozens of such awful, misleading mistranslations throughout the common edition that so many people have read, with the author often criticized for errors the he should not be held accountable for. Some of the mistranslations are comical in retrospect. For example we learn in this edition that the common edition includes the phrase \\"at the expense of my loins\\" when, in fact, a more accurate translation would be \\"hurting my back.\\"Verne's book is so filled with cutting edge science of his day and the annotations enlighten us so much about them.

The main characters of this book are Pierre Aronnax, Counseil, Ned Land, and Captain Nemo. Pierre Aronnax is an assistant professor at a natural history museum and Counseil is Aronnax's 30 year old servant. Ned Land is an expert Canadian harpooner with an instinct to kill. Finally, Captain Nemo the mystifying captain of the ship takes them in and does not release them. The French narrator of this story, Pierre Aronnax, while intrigued by Captain Nemo and their many underwater excursions knows that he is still a captive and is planning to escape.Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land were all summoned to the Abraham Lincoln a ship designed to pursue the monster who was tormenting voyagers on the seas. They encounter a large and swift object in the sea and all three of them are thrown over board. The three men find out later that it was a submarine that attacked them and the commander of this submarine Captain Nemo brings them aboard his vessel. Nemo gives them a grand tour of the vessel. He still treats them like captives but grants them some mobility. Their first adventure with Captain Nemo is the Pearl Fields. The Pearl Fields are fields filled with pearl oysters but Nemo doesn't stop for any of them. He takes them into a huge cave and eventually leads them to a 7-foot long oyster with a pearl the size of a coconut. Nemo does not take the oyster but leaves it to grow. The next encounter is with a gigantic shark. The shark is preying on a helpless fisherman when Nemo jumps in to stab it in the belly. The shark overthrows Nemo but Ned Land is quick to defend him by spearing the shark through the head. The waters are foggy with blood but Nemo manages to bring the fisherman back to his boat and revive him. While these men are thrown together by chance they still show devotion to each other and acts of bravery and humanity. Still Arronax continues to want to escape. The last adventure these men have together is just off the American Coast when seven giant sea monsters that resemble squid attack their submarine. Just as they open the hatch a giant tentacle swirls down into the ship and grabs a hold of a defenseless sailor. As the squid's arm is slinking down Nemo cuts it off with a hatchet. They all fiercely battle the monsters as Ned Land barely escapes the jaws of one squid with Nemo's help. They soon fight off all the enormous squid and are on their way again. They come upon a whirl pool and as they frantically try to escape, a life boat is ripped from the submarine and Pierre Aronnax's world goes dark. What becomes of Nemo and his crew, Ned Land, Aronnax and his humble servant Conseil is the last part of the book.I thought this book was a great read and kept me guessing all the way through. It is not all violence and gore most of the book is about these adventurers discovering nature and the sea. The characters are interesting and very different from each other. Nemo is the caring yet stern captain of the ship while Pierre is somewhat shy and curious. I like both of these characters equally but respect Nemo more because of his strength and convictions. Ned Land is a hostile maverick with the instinct to kill while Conseil is gentle and barely expresses his personality except for his devotion to Arronax. I think Ned Land is a dangerous person to be with but he could save your life if you run into trouble and I admire Conseil's unflinching loyalty to Aronnax. The discovery and respect for nature is an underlying theme throughout the book and I was fascinated by this point of view because it was written so long ago. I can't compare this book to any other book because it is unique but probably the closest book would be Journey to the Center of the Earth which is also an adventure book. Anyone who likes a creative book with lots of adventure, action and heroics would find this book extraordinary."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition. It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder. Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning. If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller. That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint). Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues. This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is without a doubt the best translation of Jules Verne's 1870 science fiction classic &quot;Vingt mille lieues sous les mers&quot; (&quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot;). This translation by two Verne scholars, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, takes all the knowledge available on the book and its author to not only make an accurate and readable complete text (early versions often omit a full quarter of the French original) that fixes the many errors of earlier translators, but also purges the text of many mistakes that were made by the original French compositors. The research and work that went into this translations is really quite stunning, and the result is a text that really lets Verne's genius shine: &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea&quot; is not only a brilliant piece of scientific prophecy, but also a thrilling story with superb, subtle characterizations.The plot is familiar: Captain Nemo, an enigmatic figure who has withdrawn himself from the world, tours the oceans in his submarine called the Nautilus. We see this journey of 20,000 leagues (approx. 43,200 miles) through the eyes of Professor Pierre Aronnax, a scientist who is both Nemo's guest and prisoner. Also aboard with Aronnax are his manservant Conseil and a gruff ship's harpooner, Ned Land. The Nautilus encounters many wonders and obstacles on its long voyage: underwater forests, giant clams, attacks by huge squid, imprisonment in ice at the South Pole, monster storms, a war with a pack of sperm whales, and the discovery of the lost continent of Atlantis. But as something deep and destructive gnaws away at Captain Nemo, his prisoners seek a way to escape from the miracle ship.In the English-speaking world Jules Verne has rarely received in the praise he truly deserves as a writer. People applaud his scientific foresight (while criticizing him for errors that were usually the fault of the translators), but shrug off his writing as inconsequential, with cardboard characters and plotless stories. If only these critics would read this translation of Verne's best novel...they would have to re-think their position on the great French writer! His genius for blending adventure, comedy, and psychology burst through in this translation. The book does veer into lengthy descriptions of marine life in places, and modern readers are likely to skim these parts (Verne even provides clues in the text to indicate when he's about to digress), but as a whole the novel is absolutely engrossing, throwing one stupendous adventure after another at the characters, while developing a mystery around Captain Nemo and increasing tension onboard the Nautilus so that the many different incidents hold together as a single plot. Even though submarines are commonplace technology today, Verne infuses his story with such awe-inspiring wonder that you can't help but feel the same sense of amazement as Professor Aronnax when he finds himself cruising the depths of the world's oceans. Real wonder never gets stakes, and no one was better at creating wonder than Jules Verne.Aside from the excellent translation, this edition contains numerous extras (if this were a DVD, it would be labeled as a Special Edition Director's Cut). The lengthy introduction explains Verne's background, education, the development of the novel, the many things that Verne accurately predicted, the book's unsung literary qualities, the different French texts, and the problems with earlier translations. All the original illustrations from the original French edition are reproduced in the text, and generous footnotes give the reader a guide through Verne's more obscure references and shed light on the author's scientific genius. As a bonus at the end of the book, the editors include a new translation of the relevant passages from &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; that discuss Captain Nemo's background (just in case you're too impatient to go read &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; for yourself to solve the Captain Nemo mystery). There's also a table of the measurements used in the novel for those readers who really want to test the author's scientific accuracy.There really isn't any other choice when it comes to translations of the &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nothing comes close to this: it will appease hard science readers, and it will open people up to Jules Verne's overlooked literary talents. With the wealth of background information available, this edition does better by Jules Verne -- ANY Jules Verne -- than has ever been published in the English language."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Most of Jules Verne's works were hastily translated, with many &quot;improvements&quot; made in the process, such as deletion of scientific exposition, as well as deletion of many moments deemed by the translator as dull.This, the Restored and Annotated version of 20,000 leagues, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions. The translation is very well done, and the annotations explain what has been changed and what previous translations accomplished.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"If you want to read the novel itself rather than a &quot;version&quot; based upon it, I recommend the relatively inexpensive 'Bantam Classic' edition of 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. Although the foreword by Ray Bradbury is negligible, the Anthony Bonner translation is a graceful compromise between the 1870 French and modern American English, catching the flavor of the period without burying the reader in pseudo-Victorian turns of phrase.That said, readers who come to LEAGUES from either text, audio, or film adaptations of the novel are likely in for a shock, for the original novel is quite different. Some basics, however, remain the same: Professor Arronax, his valet Conseil, and harpooner Ned Land are coaxed into assisting the United States in a search for a sea monster said to be terrorizing shipping lanes--but the monster is not flesh and blood. The three soon find themselves in the hands of the mysterious Captain Nemo, who has created a machine that glides beneath the surface of the ocean: a submarine named Nautilus.But there the similarity ends. While there are very clear similarities between the novel and the various adaptations it has spawned, the Verne novel is less concerned with story, characters, and adventures than it is in creating a plausible vision of something that simply did not exist at the time Verne wrote: a fully functional submarine capable of navigating even the most treacherous waters. Consequently, the bulk of Verne's text is concerned with detailed descriptions of the Nautilus and the sealife it encounters.Many modern readers may find it uphill work, particularly when Professor Arronax determinedly notes the sealife he sees to the point of scientific classification. But even so, and while it may not reach the level of &quot;great art&quot; literature, LEAGUES is a fascinating novel to read--fascinating as much for itself as for what it tells us about the world of the 1870s and what was believed to be possible. The vision that Verne had would indeed come to pass: there would be submarines, and they would strong enough to brave the polar seas. It is an impressive accomplishment--and a tremendously fun read.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is Jules Verne's classic tale of undersea adventure, as best I can tell based on the 1873 translation by Lewis Mercier. Since that's been the standard English translation for over a hundred years, it's probably the one you remember reading way back when, and the edition you'll be familiar with.Re-reading this as an adult, and an adult who's spent twenty-plus years since then reading science fiction, I did have to remind myself more than once how amazing the then-future technologies Verne describes, like electric rifles, undersea diving suits, electric motors, etc., would have been to his contemporary readers; the book was first published in 1869, a mere five years after the Confederate submarine Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy warship (and sank itself in the process). At times I found myself mentally substituting \\"outer space\\" for \\"under sea,\\" just to help me analogize the situation. Despite that, the plot and action were as riveting now as they were when I first read it twenty years ago. I did find myself, now as then, skimming over much of Verne's extensive scientific descriptions of undersea flora and fauna, etc., but that might be my own failing as a reader -- when I did take the time to read Verne's descriptions, I did sometimes catch the same sense of aquatic wonder I remember from watching films like _The Life Aquatic_.From what I've read, the Mercier translation this is based on contains a number of translation errors, cuts out about 20% of the text, etc. Corrected, completed, updated ebook editions of this classic are available on Amazon, but they cost money -- I've been unable to find an out-of-copyright, corrected, complete, and free edition. For readers on a budget, though, this is probably the version you remember, and if read in the right way -- keeping in mind the era in which it was written, and skimming whenever the science gets too dry or detailed for you -- it's still quite entertaining.Verne did write a sequel, _The Mysterious Island_, also available in the kindle free store; the better translation is available here:The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I could not believe this version of 20,000 leagues under the sea.

When I think about the movie by Walt Disney and then remember the book I realize that the movie was about 1/4 of the books adventures.All the adventures that I never heard about before like the hunt on the sea floor with the electric bullets, the Arabian tunnel under the sea, Santorin Island the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanoes of the Mediterranean, the Bay of Vigo with all the treasures, the size of the mountains in Atlantis, the adventure at the South Pole, the fight with all the sperm whales, his home Island and the production of salt to run his electric engines.There is so much more to this story than what I have heard before and in this edition the foot notes are excellent. I especially like the story of Arachne and how the name of Arachnid came to mean spiders. The footnotes explain all the literary references which are helpful to understanding the characters. There is so much information here about the sea world in an adventure that makes each moment exciting.Verne must have done so much research for this book to get all the scientific information correct. I never thought they knew all those things about the sea at that time.I was surprised by the character of Nemo who never seemed to go after anyone unless he was attacked. The whole idea that he chased after all forms of warships was something made up in Hollywood. Nemo never seemed to want to even deal with people. The story of Nemo's life at the end of the book explains many of his behaviors.The description of all the types of food that they were constantly eating was interesting you never knew what they were going to catch in the Nautilus' nets.I thought the adventure at the South Pole was the best of all with the predicament that they got into. It was the most adventurous and had the most suspense.I do not know why a book like this is not required reading for high school kids they would learn so much as well as adults. There is so much science geography, ichthyology, astronomy practical uses of physics etc.I would recommend this book to everyone who likes science and adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"One of the great problems with Jules Verne is that in the English speaking world he is relagated to the category of &quot;Boys' Own Adventures&quot;. On the Continent, however, he is considered a brilliant social commentator, and biting satirist, AND a man who predicted the future. This is a volume that helps set matters to the right.If you know of &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; already, you will find little different at first. The plot is still the plot. Nemo is still Nemo, Prof. Aronnax is still pompous and fascinated by the Nautilus and Ned Land....Ned Land is a flaming socialist.This is one of the major shifts between the original French and the &quot;cleaned up&quot; English editions. Most of the science of the day was pulled out as a &quot;dull read&quot; and all the Socialism, anti-English remarks, and other commentaries of a &quot;questionable nature&quot; were excised. We Americans have unfortunately been until only very recently only able to find these poor early translations, or translations based on these poor translations. There is much more to Verne than submarines and diving suits. He is a man with a vision of his times, both scientific and political, and his books underline this strongly.English readers, demand your Verne well-translated! Do not allow yourself to be fobbed off with bowlderized versions! To be able to read as he wrote himself (well, in English, for those of us who don't read French...) is a greater pleasure than merely an amusing old science-fiction story from the 19th century. Reading this book, as Verne /meant/ it to be read, if a pleasure, but also a struggle to understand ourselves and our relationship to the oceans themselves."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is Jules Verne at his best, creating the enigmatic character of Captain Nemo.The setting is the mid-nineteenth century. Deadly and mysterious calamities continue to befall ocean-going vessels, with wild reports by survivors that the culprit is a sea monster large enough to ram and sink ships. French professor M. Aronnax finds himself aboard the Abraham Lincoln, a ship charged with finding and destroying the beast. Accompanying him is his loyal servant, Conseil. The ship succeeds in locating the leviathan, but it, too, falls victim to a deadly attack. Aronnax, Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land are the sole survivors--rescued by none other than the \\"monster\\" itself, which turns out not to be flesh and bone, but the world's largest and most technically advanced submarine.They meet Captain Nemo, the owner, inventor, and sovereign leader of the flag-less ship, Nautilus. He explains that they're now his prisoners for life, though they will be treated well and are free to roam the ship. Thus begins an underwater tour of the planet, narrated by the fascinated Aronnax. With today's knowledge of the seas, some of the action is laughable, but at the time this was leading-edge science fiction. Verne's vision of submarine technology, the use of electricity, scuba operations, and various other things is uncanny and typical of great science fiction writers' ability to foretell the future. The ridiculous episodes include traversing an underwater tunnel beneath the Suez to the Mediterranean; a visit to Atlantis; and a trip to the South Pole under the ice, where they break through the surface for a look-see. This would be difficult, considering that the ice is more than a mile thick with a continent of solid rock below. But remember that when Verne wrote the book in 1869, Antarctica had not been explored and remained a virtual myth.The enduring lure of 20,000 Leagues, though, is Verne's Captain Nemo. It takes the entire book (and then some) to learn who this genius Nemo really is. What horrible ordeal has produced such a cynical man, one driven to build the self-sustaining Nautilus, to swear off all contact with the \\"civilized\\" world, never to touch land again, and to ruthlessly and brutally defend himself against any perceived threat? At one glance we see a maniacal scientist worthy of a James Bond thriller. But at closer inspection, Verne has captured the timeless personification of angst over the errors and excesses of Man's interminable war against Nature and himself. Aspects of this same character can today be found in political and environmental activism throughout the world. Actually, it strikes a cord with us all; everyone wants at some time to build what today would amount to a spaceship and shove off from this screwed up planet, saying, \\"Adios, idiots. It's your mess now.\\" --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Big Ice."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is the &#34;classic&#34; old translation by Louis Mercier most of us read and loved. But a good bit of the novel was left out, not so much that the story was greatly altered, but still not as Verne wrote it and intended it to be. Fortunately, there is another free public domain version available which I would encourage you to also download and read; this is a modern translation by F. P. Walter and it is unabridged. It may be found in the Kindle store by typing: Vingt Mille Lieues Sous Les Mers English (or simply: Verne Vingt Mille English). The title is French but don't worry, the book is entirely in English with an informative introduction by Walter. This great new translation is wordier than the old one, but it comes as close, in English, to what Verne actually wrote in French--and it is complete. I would strongly urge you to compare them--especially if you are a true Jules Verne fan."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a masterful science fiction classic and the crowning achievement of Verne's impressive literary legacy. While the story itself is absorbing, it is the character of the enigmatic Captain Nemo that makes this novel so successful. Many of the characters we meet in Verne's fiction are one-dimensional; while eccentric, a man like Professor Lidenbrock in Journey to the Centre of the Earth is easy to understand, seemingly driven by science and nothing else. In contrast, Captain Nemo is an incredibly complex man whom neither the reader nor the protagonist is ever really able to understand. He has forsaken all of humanity and retreated beneath the sea, yet he shows great compassion to his crewmen and to the poor on earth; he is generally self-absorbed and emotionless, yet we see glimpses of an emotional trauma that constantly afflicts him and is capable of destroying him. He has suffered a great loss at some point in his life, and his sorrow is matched only by a drive for vengeance against his unnamed oppressors. Captain Nemo is one of the most interesting, delightfully mysterious characters in all of literature.As for the story, a naturalist, his assistant, and a harpooner join a party in search of a giant sea creature which has attacked a couple of ships. They are knocked overboard and find themselves saved by the monster, which turns out to be a submarine manned by a mysterious crew of sailors. Captain Nemo requires them to stay on board the Nautilus permanently because he wants to keep the existence of his submarine a secret from the world. The three men sail on the Nautilus for ten months, exploring the world's oceans and seas. They marvel at the animal life under the waves; explore underground forests, oyster beds, deep trenches; gaze with somber eyes at great numbers of sunken vessels; fight off giant squids and dangerous sharks; cast their eyes upon the sunken continent of Atlantis; and burrow underneath the polar ice caps to emerge at the South Pole. All the while, they hope to escape and return to their homelands, although the naturalist hesitates to leave his traveling laboratory until such a time as Captain Nemo's emotions become dangerously unbalanced.All in all, this is an incredibly rich, fascinating novel with a poignant yet powerful conclusion. Contemporary readers must have been overpowered by Verne's descriptions of this unknown sailing vessel and the exploits the sub was capable of. That magical element is missing from modern reader's reactions, but this does little to hinder the overall effect of the story. There is one negative aspect to the book--the naturalist and his assistant go out of their way to name and catalogue virtually every animal, mineral, and plant they discover. This is interesting to a point, but the plot often finds itself bogged down for a couple of pages while the reader is bombarded with a veritable encyclopedia of scientific names which are virtually unpronounceable and largely meaningless to his/her ears. These interludes are the only things slowing down the story, however. It is a joy to read the adventures these men have under the sea, and it is even more fascinating to ponder the mind of Captain Nemo. Even the unseen depths of the sea cannot offer the reader a mystery as deep and powerful as that of the Nautilus' exceptional captain."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book is completed destroyed by errors in printing. The text is unreadable at points; various spelling errors litter the book. The chapters are not separated, and even worse, are sometimes still in the same line as the sentence before it! Do not buy the black and tan cover, printed by General Books. I wish I had looked through the books closer before the return window expired."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The original story is lush with great vocabulary and detailed description, a little work, but well worth it. I'm reading it aloud to my 10, 9, and 6 year olds. The DK illustrated abridgement is a good supplement too."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"It is really a shame that Amazon pushes so many editions together in the same group of reviews. This review is of the complete edition (not the bowdlerised children's version) and references the translation by Mendor T. Brunetti.This was a reread for me. I read most of the Verne books when I was quite young, and lately wanted to revisit some of my favorites. When I was younger, I was very much (like Captain Aronnax) taken with the catalogue of undersea marvels that Captain Nemo and his Nautilus enabled us to visit. Reading it this time around, I was quite struck with the political picture of Captain Nemo. As a man from an unknown country who has lost everything at the hands of men, Nemo becomes what we would today call a terrorist. He funds freedom fighters. He takes his revenge on the men from the countries who hurt him and his. The portraits on his wall: John Brown, Kosciusko, Daniel O'Connell. I think that I'm going to add The Mysterious Island to my list. I had never read the sequel in the past, and I understand that it provides more background about the mysterious captain.Readers who aren't familiar with this book are encouraged by this reviewer to rapidly amend this sad condition. I also have to say that I first read this when I was nine (the full version, not a children's edition) and I can't imagine what really needs to be cut to make it suitable for younger folks. I'd hand them the whole thing with a confident heart."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I loved this classic French novel by Jules Verne and found it to be very entertaining from start to finish! I was very surprised that I would enjoy this book as much as I did.... I figured \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", like many classic novels, would be boring, but Jules Verne is a marvelous storyteller. He imbues this novel with lots of intrigue and mystery as you wonder how the story will unfold... There is lots of adventure and interesting predicaments, and of course, many unforgettable characters one comes to care about during the course of the novel. Also if you like science fiction then this is the novel for you! Jules Verne seems to be ahead of his time in terms of technology and creates quite a wonderful piece of classic literature that has stood the test of time.The attention to detail that Jules Verne used to capture the readers attention is marvelous... This book is written in the 1st person through the eyes of Assistant Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Paris Museum of Natural History. Professor Aronnax unfolds the story to the reader of this novel about several sightings of a mysterious object seen around the world by many different people.... Some believe it to be an island, others seem to think the object is a floating reef, a large whale or other large mammal and so on. It isn't until Professor Aronnax and his faithful Flemish assistant, Conseil, take part on an expedition aboard the Abraham Lincoln to seek out this unknown object once and for all. Eventually, it is discovered that this unknown object is a submarine named the Nautilus, on which Professor Aronnax, Conseil and Canadian harpooner, Ned Land, spend the remaining part of the novel sailing on the Nautilus through the various oceans of the world along with the crew of the Nautilus. What adventures they have while sailing on the Nautilus!! And the exquisite detail in which Jules Verne imparts is wonderful. One feels like they are truly reading the actually travel journal/diary of Professor Aronnax. Professor Aronnax writes from a scientific/natural history perspective as he is very much interested in the under water world of the worlds oceans.The only draw back I had with this novel was that some of the descriptions were a bit overdone or a bit too much to take in (like classification of animal species or various nautical terms).... These descriptions aren't overwhelming or occur that frequently, I'd just find myself skimming through these parts rather quickly."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"My husband bought this book for our son at a visit to an aquarium, even though I thought it was too advanced for him because he's only four and half. I was wrong - my son LOVES this book! I know the age range on it is 9 to 12 and I have no doubt those ages would also enjoy reading the book themselves, but my son is constantly wanting me to read this to him and is always begging for me to read one more chapter because we usually only read one or two at a time (I will admit, I tone down the scarier parts just a bit for him because he's only four). The illustrated pages help hold his attention while I read to him even though there is a significant amount of text per page, and even my two and half year old can manage to sit through a chapter most days. I love the combination of illustration and text that allows me to read my sons more involved and advanced stories without them becoming bored because there isn't enough to hold their attention to the story. My older son loves asking questions about the pictures, especially the ones in the inserts that have information related to different aspects of the story, and I have learned a lot from those too! I definitely recommend this book and am currently looking into buying my son some more books from the DK/Eyewitness Classics series."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The Easton Press edition of Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one case to judge a book by its cover. Two other Easton Press editions: From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon are two more examples of this rule. To me, Easton Press has outdone itself with these gorgeous Verne covers. To brass tacks on the 20,000 Leagues edition: the English translation is by Mercier Lewis with an introduction by Fletcher Pratt and illustrations by Edward A. Wilson. One may have wished for one of the more modern translations, but the cover IS stunning."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"If you have been hunting for books with sea adventures, then the book 20000 Leagues Under The Sea is the perfect book for you. It's a bookwith two main characters named Captain Nemo and professor Monsier Pierre Aronnax. The professor studies about underwater living. He finds a large submarine which he thought to be a whale. Captain Nemo named it The Nautilus. The captain has a strange vow not to put foot on land people have been on land people have been on. He also explains that he only uses things that are from the sea. For example, his bed was made of soft eelgrass. On the voyage, the professor learns to hunt for pearls and sea animals. This book is also suspenseful because it leaves you in one question is captain Nemo still alive?I really liked this book because it had a leveled amount of description even though it is first person narrative. I would recommend this book this book between ages of 7 and 11. This book is also suitable for people who like to read. You won't feel disappointed after you read this famous book"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Who would have thought that a major contribution to the world of literature would come out of the Naval Institute Press! Normally, they come out with things like \\"An Illustrated Design History of the United States Destroyer.\\" I'm not casting any aspersions on such a volume, and I may own a copy or two. But Jules Verne, is an a class by himself as one of the great inventive masters of literature. He stands up there with Homer and Chaucer and James M. Cain. And what a superb edition this is, the translation impeccable and the annotations which include technical and historical explanations of the text and are invaluable. I have to confess, it is one of the few times (not including Nabokov) I actually read all the footnotes in a novel (or any book) and found them to be supremely enjoyable.

Just imagine you're on a ship trying to destroy a sea monster. When that exact sea monster has sunken huge ships, small ships, and even war ships. One second you are asking a question, the next thing you know people are screaming, the ship is flooding, and you're knocked overboard with the beast. Get ready for whirlwind of an adventure!Professor Arronax becomes famous from his studies, but he never tells anybody about Captain Nemo or what they call a sea monster, but is actually a submarine. The professor after a few days figured that he has to get off the monster seeing the captain is nearly insane, but he refuses to get off because it is his. Those are not the only characters. Others are Ned Land, Consiel, cannibals, Commander Farragut, and crew men.Three-fourths through the book, people are going crazy. Worst of all, Ned is going so insane; he wants to swim thousands of miles to shore. He feels he just has to get off the beast, even though he's being well supplied with food. As days go on Professor Arronax is seeing Captain Nemo acting weirder and weirder every day, until finally Captain Nemo resorts to yelling at the Professor for no reason.I would recommend this book for ages eight and up. If someone is reading 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea aloud, it would be exciting for any age. If you like drama, mystery, action, or creativity, this book is for you. In my conclusion, this book is amazing and suspense holding. I loved it and would rate it ***** (out of 5 stars).

I decided to give the book a try having just read (and enjoyed) the author's other classic 'The Time Machine'. '20,000 Leagues...' is a far more ambitious novel and, overall, even more enjoyable.The story is set in the late 1860s when the book was written. Due to unusual circumstance (..no spoilers here) three men (a naturalist, his manservant, and a whaler) are taken against their will onto a (then unheard of) submarine by the enigmatic Captain Nemo. For many months they circumnavigate the globe and cross all the oceans. Along the way the encounter the fantastic, some dramatic episodes, and even fleeting moments of comedy. The author goes into great detail of describing the wonders of the submarine. While of course much of the science he describes is a bit silly most of it is remarkably true to life. I am especially amazed at his foresight into electricity years before the lightbulb was invented. Monsieur Verne was truly a genius. And thankfully, he was a pretty good writer.But this book doesn't hit all the right notes. All the in-depth descriptions of amazing underwater flora and fauna gets rather repetitive. The middle third of the book is a bit of a tedious read. Thankfully the story tightens considerably towards the end, with a very surprising climax.Bottom line: an often overlooked classic that will probably bore younger readers but will enthrall adults. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Verne's prophetic masterpiece still thrills readers over 100 years after its publication. In this adventure, French naturalist Pierre Aronnax is taken aboard the Nautilus, a secret high-technology submarine capable of high speeds. Aronnax meets the enigmatic Captain Nemo, a renegade against society with a strong desire for revenge against the enemy that drove him under the sea. This novel is one of the first examples of modern science fiction. The world of science fiction owes Jules Verne a great debt.This edition is particularly valuable. Most people aren't aware that the standard English translation is filled with lots of translation errors which botch the science of Verne's masterpiece. Also, the standard version cuts about 25% of the original French novel. This translation fixes the errors, and returns 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea's scientific accuracy (for that time). Also, the cut parts have been restored, so we can now enjoy reading a complete version of Verne's novel.If you love classic books, and you're interested in reading about one of the greatest characters in science fiction, you have to read this. Also fans of science fiction should read this to understand where their genre came from. If you've read the old standard translation, you have to read this edition to see it the way it was meant to be."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"My (10 year old) daughter got interested in '20,000 leagues' after reading the \\"Wishbone\\" version (go ahead and laugh). I went searching for the real thing to read with her, and came across this edition. With all of the missing content recovered, plus the annotations to fill in all sorts of additional information, the result is fascinating for adult readers. If you read the usual (butchered) version as a kid, you really owe yourself this one. All of the critiques of Verne over the years that tried to belittle his knowledge of science turn out to have been based on translations that whacked out what Verne really said -- they thought it was too dry and boring. Reading what he really said, plus the extensive footnotes that describe the state of knowledge at the time, make Verne's brilliance all the more astonishing. Just consider that he wrote about the Nautilus at a time when the Hunley was the state of the art!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I havent read many books in my lifetime but I'd have to say that this is the best one I' ve ever read. Jules Verne takes you on an amazing journey through the worlds oceans and to some places where man still hasn't been. I was sad when I had read the last page and the books was over. I found myself wanting to be on the Nautilis, meeting Captin Nemo, and see the ocean depths with my own eyes. The book defintly sparks your imagination; I guess that's why it has remained a classic for many years."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Jules Verne is widely recognized as the father of science fiction, and &quot;20000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is his most famous work. This fantastic tale of the adventures of an under-sea craft (written BEFORE their actual invention) fires the imagination of readers young and old. Verne's genius was his ability to create incredible (in his time) machines, around which he'd write believable stories with admirable characters and meaningful morals. As with the submarine Nautilus, many of his machines have since become modern realities."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, \\"too\\" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the \\"kid\\" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the \\"adult\\" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly \\"who\\" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a \\"deus ex machine\\" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the \\"bargain\\" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from \\"quick & dirty\\" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the \\"bargain\\" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is a story about three friends aboard the Nautilus, a cantankerous submarine-like vessel that is commandeered by Captain Nemo, an elusive figure with a mind of steel and a impenetrable purpose in life. Captain Nemo has long ago turned his back on the world, building this vessel with the intent of making it his home, staffing it with the most loyal of crews, and arming it as though it were a fortress. And a fortress it is. Captain Nemo and his crew live beneath the sea in this fascinating underwater vehicle as solid as stone. They never touch land, and are prepared to spend the rest of their days living underwater. The world has learned of this vessel, but rumors of its nature abound. Most think it is a sea monster of sorts, and the great ship the Abraham Lincoln sets out on a voyage to find and destroy the Nautilus. On board are Professor Aronnax, underwater expert, his loyal subject Conseil, and a Canadian whale harpooner named Ned Land. These unfortunate characters are tossed into the sea while heavily engaged in a confrontation with the mighty Nautilus. Hours later, they are picked up by the Nautilus, having been clinging to it's topside for safety. They are held prisoner within, but never have prisoners of war had such luxury and freedom. What follows is Monsieur Aronnax' account of the adventures that abound as he travels around the world underwater, seeing sights never before seen, engaging in activities he once only dreamed of, and enjoying times never meant to be had by man. When his companion, Ned Land, becomes restless and wishes to escape the Nautilus, the story heats up. Throughout, Captain Nemo is a mystery you will wish revealed. The story has many dull parts too, and many unfamiliar words and expressions that may bore you. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating and marvelous classic - if you have not yet read this, you should."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The story gets 5 stars but this free Kindle version only ranks three stars.I am about 20% through the book and have decided to order a different version.

For many years \\"20,000 Leagues...\\" was available to us only in Louis Mercier's abridged version. It was not bad, but it was not as Verne intended it to be. But in recent times, we now have three wonderful modern and unabridged translations from which to choose: F.P. Walter's, Anthony Bonner's, and Mendor Brunetti's. Walter's is more readily accessible (both for free and for purchase) because at least one version of his translation is in the public domain. To read it go to the Kindle store and type in: Verne Vingt Mille English. The other two are both copyrighted and limited to their respective publishers which makes them more difficult to locate and definitely not free. Having said that, Brunetti's translation is particularly readable. The true Verne fan (as in fanatic) may wish to read all three to compare. Just don't expect major differences; they mostly differ in style of expression. I first encountered Bonner and liked his translation. But then I discovered Brunetti and later Walter, so now I really don't know which is best.

It is definitely not a fast read by modern standards. Not that TLUTS is not a great read, but it is hard work for an average reader and should not be required of the inexperienced reader.

There's many more, though; you could do worse than reading this book and discovering it's hidden treasures for yourself. There may be perhaps a bit too much of 'zoophytes' in it, but the book will hold it's own as a classic, regardless. For Verne's prowess was not how he told his stories, but WHEN.

In this submarine, they go on millions of adventures like: tunneling through blocks of ice in the antartic, zooming through tunnels from sea to sea, and seeing every different kind of fish you could ever imagine. The only problem is the scientist's sidekick joins with the big sailor, Ned, and together they try to escape.

The wonders of Verne's tale of adventure, as well as the tension and sheer terror contained therein, have never before been made so real in any performance of any adaptation of this novel. It becomes easy to empathize with the plight of the narrator, and, indeed, to share in his feelings and frustrations, save one -- the listener may not share the narrator's desire to end the adventure and go home. Ellison's vocal work is outstanding, and the direction of the adaptation is flawless.

Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vain as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nationless man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. All that Nemo needs is produced by the Nautilus.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing of the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, it wasn't the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. The people could have been better provided for by encouraging production and industry.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more than a narcissist. Racing back and forth across the oceans is an act of conspicuous and selfish consumption.Nemo's goal is conquest of the sea, to make nature a possession, something no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world, as if that's possible.Though Nemo suffers great loss, he blames the world, not himself. He sees himself as virtuous, as a victim of industry and progress. He is a paradox of the world.His is a world running from machines and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world from which he takes freely, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.All of this is lost to Nemo, an obscurity of self, hidden behind his anger and self exile. Reckless abandon seems to be his only motive. His disgust with society has robbed him of all virtue, all concern for others.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovry there is, what it means to be human."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"If you have second thoughts about buying or reading this book, it's a must for all children interested.

Some of these sightings are far apart from one another. With no other logical answer, some fear that it might be a sea monster.An expedition is established under Captain Farragut, with the U.S. Naval frigate, Abraham Lincoln. They are firm in their resolve to find this monster.Professor Pierre Aronnax of the Museum of Paris had written articles about the phenomenon of a possible sea creature and he is asked to join the others, as is, his man, Conseil, and the Canadian harpooner, Ned Land.Once they are out to sea and have traveled far in their search, something is sighted. Ned, Pierre and Conseil take a small boat from the Abraham Lincoln with Ned's harpoon. Ned tries to harpoon the object but their boat is overturned and they are picked up by the submarine, the Nautilus under Captain Nemo.They are held in polite captivity as the Nautilus travels the world. Captain Nemo has constant proclamations of where they are and Pierre tells the reader the importance in history of what they are seeing, such as, a sunken ship with riches in it. The men are anxious to be free and have their escape at the earliest opportunity.The writing style is dry and without much emotional comment. The style is so different from much of today's literature that it is challenging to get into the story line and become involved with the story.It is interesting to see Jules Verne's ideas of deep sea diving equipment and his idea of 20,000 leagues under the sea-which is more than the circumference of the earth. It is also noteworthy to see where literature and adventure fiction has come to in the last one hundred years."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This review is for the Easton Press leather bound 1977 edition of the Mercier Lewis first english translation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne.Anil Menon notes in a 2006 examination of 'The Politics of Nemo' that, \\"Verne liked to place his human characters in enclosed, self-contained, unique spaces of one kind or the other-- heavier-than-air flying machines, isolated islands, floating cities, villages on tree-tops, the earth's core, cannon-balls to the moon, steel submarines 20,000 leagues under the sea-- and send them out for a spin. For the most part, his people are two-dimensional cross-hairs; their main role is keep track of places in the reader's mind.\\"Most English-speaking readers are familiar with the image of Captain Nemo as an escapee from human society driven by hatred to live a life separate from humanity in general. Verne appears to have endeavored to use his story as a vehicle for some sort of political message or commentary on the conditions of his era though. One quote in the book offers a glimpse of this dark motivation: , \\"I've witnessed the destruction of everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife, children, father, and mother! There lies everything I hate!\\"Due to the politics of his time in France, Nemo fails to properly identify precisely who inflicted the personal pain on him. It is speculated that Nemo originally intended to point the finger at Tsarist Russia for their victimization of the Polish people, but France was friendly with Russia at the time so Nemo chose to leave the identity of his victimizers to speculation. That is unfortunate, because it causes Nemo to be more of a 'stick-figure' for the story than might otherwise have been the case.Regardless of this, the story of Nemo and his submarine continues to this day to intrigue readers as it always has. The problem for us English speakers however, is that Verne wrote his original story in French and the numerous English translations differ widely in terms of how accurately they reflect Verne's original story. Unfortunately, Easton Press chose to use what is generally considered to be the worst possible English language rendition of this famous book; the Mercier Lewis translation.Mercier Lewis went after Verne's story with a scalpel, cutting and removing entire sections and altering the meaning of many French words and ultimately, the story itself. When he was done, Lewis had removed over 20% of Verne's manuscript, paying particular attention to the removal of any comments that might contradict the Christian Bible. The result is that the reader of this translation is far less likely to gain an accurate appreciation of the original novel.There are other, much more legitimate English translations available. One generally considered to be the best current English translation is the Walter James Miller & Frederick Paul Walter version completed in 1993 and published by the Naval Institute Press. Unfortunately, that version presently only seems to be available in paperback. The Easton Press leather-bound edition looks much nicer sitting on the bookshelf and that is the main reason many continue to purchase it. But if one is interested in genuinely exploring the world of Captain Nemo, the Navel Institute Press version by Miller & Walter is the way to go."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I loved it so much that I want to read it all over again!

I have to say that this translation beats them all.The book shows Verne's genius which is tough to translate, the characters come alive on the pages and the adventures they go through are exciting. The comedic tone and even psychology show well in this wonderful translation.As in the previous versions I have read, there are many \\"lists\\" and descriptions of the ocean life. I have to say that I did skimmed through the lists but read the descriptive parts enthusiastically. With the exception of intricate scientific names, which lend credibility to this fantasy, I found the book absorbing and engrossing. I'm glad I read it again.While submarines today are common place and almost anyone of can go and visit one (there are several older submarines which one can go on), the fantastic voyages and imagination are inspiring today as they were in 1870.What I love about this book is that the translators took their time to write an excellent introduction and, best of all, wonderful footnotes which, as I said time and time again, make a translated book into a cultural experience and raises the level of enjoyment by multiple degrees.Not many people are aware, but almost a whole quarter of the book was literally lost in translation. This wonderful edition, translated by Water James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, restores those pages as well asIf you ever wondered what the big hoopla is about Jules Verne, read this version and you'll find out."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"My exposure to science fiction is embarrassingly limited, so who better to remedy it than Verne? Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea was a groundbreaking work. It particularly established hard science fiction at a time when technology could not help but change the way we looked at the world.And therein lies much of my criticism. With its frequent calculations of the size of the submarine and what not, it sometimes reads like a math textbook. Sadly, I do not take the same interest in the science as Verne so obviously did and other readers may. The descriptions of life at the bottom of the sea, on the other hand, make me want to visit an aquarium post-haste. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is very much the type of science fiction that revels in the \`science' part.That is not to say that Verne does take advantage of speculative fiction to use the \\"speculative\\" portion to explore human nature. Captain Nemo is as fertile ground as Captain Ahab for this. And our narrator has even less to say about his captain--he is consistently nave, to the point that the subtleties of Nemo can be at first lost. However, over the course of the novel it becomes apparent that all is not well. We are never told what great sin civilization has done Nemo, rather we must wrestle over whether any sin could justify his actions. The action is quite light and the plot slow-placed. Most of the book is devoted to a tour of the wonders of the deep, with Nemo's gradual, swirling decline in the background.The titular \\"twenty thousand leagues\\" refers to the distance covered by the Nautilus over the course of the book--well over twice the circumference of the earth--not the depth to which it sinks. There is no good reason to think the latter, but I was nonetheless confused on this point for years.Of course any book this old will not age evenly. Captain Nemo's conservation instincts are a bit off-base. Shortly after chastising the whaler Ned Land for seeking to hunt southern whales, which he describes as \\"inoffensive creature[s],\\" he gleefully slaughters a herd of \\"cruel, mischievous\\" sperm whales. Hardly sustainability at its best. But perhaps Verne too expected us to recoil with Land at the bloodbath (how odd it is to side with the whaler over the conservationist).Verne is as successful as any science fiction writer at his predictive science and technology. Sometimes it's incredibly accurate--Verne describes a light bulb a decade prior to its invention, the crew of the Nautilus communicate with an invented language a little under fifteen years before the invention of Esperanto, the South Pole is on a southern continent, and the Nautilus is largely built and operates like modern submarines (especially the double-hulled design). Other times, it's less so--a workable electric bullet has yet to be invented. Verne also repeats errors of his day--e.g., the misplaced notion that malaria was caused by \\"foul air.\\"Verne wrote at an exciting time. The south pole had not yet been reached and the first trans-Atlantic (telegraph) cable had recently been laid. We were just beginning to understand electricity. The ocean remained a great, unknown frontier.Verne frequently uses archaic or technical terms for the sea creatures encountered. Sperm whales are called cachalots, walruses are called morse, and sea horses are called hippocampi.I read the Kindle version of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea offered free through Amazon. There are a handful of typographical errors, but not enough to be overly distracting and none that cause confusion. Most bothersome is the degree symbol is replaced by a question mark throughout--a common error as the submarine's latitude is frequently given. It includes neither a foreword nor an afterword. I also own an old Educator Classic Library edition from 1968. It contains numerous added illustrations and helpful definitions and explanations throughout the text (directly next to the relevant text in the margin so they do not affect readability like a footnote or endnote would). These are particularly helpful for an older hard science fiction novel. It also contains a \\"backword\\" with helpful information about Verne and the history of the submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I did enjoy this book and I'm glad I read it but ... the introduction by Ray Bradbury was the best part of this book. If you are going to get a copy to read - get this one - specifically for the introduction. As for the book itself, well, the action parts and story line are great. The problem is that Verne seems to have felt that he needed to include every single bit of background research he did into the book. He didn't seem to waste anything he had found in in his research.. He goes on for several pages listing the types of fish that can be found in a particular area. Whenever we come across a sunken ship we are treated to several pages of the history of the ship and the ships that preceded it into whatever cove we are in along with who actually made it back to make the report. Some of this stuff is interesting, but mostly, it's unnecessary filler. I found myself skipping over the taxonomic lessons and skipping to the actual story line.The story line is great. Totally enjoyed it. Spoiler - they get attacked by 10 giant squids, not one. They also get trapped under the ice at the south pole and have lots of other adventures you don't see in the movies. All in all a worthwhile read, but it is a bit tedious because about half of the book is devoting to listing fish and their attributes (this one had a spotted tail with a blue underbelly, the next one had rings and a white belly and on and on and on.)Do I recommend it? Well ... yeah - good story, better then what they show in the movies, you just need to gloss over the endless filler."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Fantastic!!

What he does do is travel a distance of 20000 leagues while submerged under the sea inside the mysterious vessel.Boats and fishermen all over the globe have reported a leviathan attacking ships. Professor Aronnax accompanies a warship to attempt to destroy it, but falls overboard and ends up inside the sea animal. The \\"monster\\" turns out to be a secret submarine build by Captain Nemo. As a passenger aboard Captain Nemo's craft, Professor Aronnax is witness to the wonders hidden beneath the ocean waters.Written over a century ago, Jules Verne creates a fantastic setting that leaves even today's readers fascinated about Captain Nemo and his Nautilus. Detailed descriptions about underwater life fill a majority of the book and create a rich setting, but can drag on at times.Water makes up the majority of the earth. As humans, we have only a mere understanding of the creatures and life forms that dwell within the depths of the oceans, and Verne expands on this unknown realm to create a powerful and lasting tale.Maybe it's a coincidence that I've read a lot of novels with aquatic settings (Life of Pi, The Old Man and the Sea, Moby Dick), but 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is another watery classic worth reading.8/10 -> 4/5"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is a very attractive edition of this book.

We follow him as he explores underwater forests, goes hunting dangerous sea monsters, takes from the sea what he and his men need to live, visits the South Pole and even shows us Atlantis.The problem is that about one third of the book is Jules Verne explaining EVERY tiny detail, from the family trees of fish and other sea creatures, to page after page on how the Nautilus works. The fight with the school of squid is only a few pages long.On the other hand, Nemo is not shown as a man trying to force mankind to improve as much as he is trying to live without contact with it (even when he helps some parts of it to fight back by giving rebels gold he finds on the seafloor). In the end, it is mankind who forces him to fight back, by hunting him down with warships.My book had an introduction by Ray Bradbury, which was very interesting, but did little to help the story itself.A good book for fans of Jules Verne, classic adventure stories and anybody interested in the sea."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Who is Captain Nemo? Is he the antithesis of a 19th century capitalist? Is he the result of capitalism, using technology to gain the liberty of a higher standard of living, which it allows? Is he despot, savior, evil or compassionate?Nemo epitomizes a vision of humanity, which is arrogantly attempting to create a peaceful world through technology. The battle is clearly in vein as the characters are hindered by the passions of their natures.Nemo is the rebel, the nation-less man, who has turned away from the machine mentality, dollar diplomacy and imperialist expansionism of his age.Verne creates a self-contained world for Nemo, one in which there is no dependency on capitalism. The Nautilus produces all that Nemo needs.This freedom is decadent. The Nautilus produces no surplus value other than to provide for the whims of Nemo, a person dehumanized by the progress of the developing western world. A world he doesn't understand or is in touch with.Even in his act of political intervention against imperialism through the financing the liberation movement of the Cretans from the Turks was decadent. The money came from the sea, it was put back into circulation, and it was not the result of production or creativity. There is no net gain to society by this action. Encouraging production and industry could have better provided for the people.Though Nemo was creative enough to produce the Nautilus to escape his world of torment, he's nothing more that a narcissist!When Nemo brings the Professor on his trip, it becomes a conquest of the sea. Nature becomes a possession, no longer mysterious and otherworldly, but just a part of the humanized world.It is Ned alone who sees the vanity of the voyage, but to no avail. All aboard become trapped in the world of Nemo.A world running from machine and science in a machine. A world free from governments and country in which he governs. A world free from captivity in which he holds others captive. A world which he takes freely from, but gives nothing to in return. Nemo is everything he disdains.In making his journey of discovery around the world, Nemo fails to make the most important discovery that there is, what it means to be human!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you do not like to read classics with everything that goes along with that (such as long-winded language that seems outdated to us today), then you should stay away.For lovers of classical and relatively easy to read literature, this is a good book. A lot of things are amazing, considering how long ago they were written and what overall level of scientific knowledge was at the time. Some of it just boggles my mind.At the same time, the book is long winded and in the end, not quite as much happens as one would expect. Dan Brown's DaVinci code has more things happening in the first 20 pages than Verne has in his entire book. But that is OK in a way, because when I read a classic, I do not expect to compare it to modern standards. The entertainment is due to different factors. In fact, the way the book is written is part of the entertainment and not just the story.I do not give this book 5 stars however, because I was disappointed in the end, since not enough of the story really comes to a conclusion. I do not want to spoil the book for you, but there are a lot of unanswered questions, and getting those answers really was what kept me reading. There is quite a bit of build-up, and then in some ways, the book just ends. (I noticed that style in many books of that time, where the narrator just says \\"here is what I know... but I do not know the whole story...\\").Also, to some extent, I agree with some of my fellow reviewers that gave a lower score, in that it is too much of a narration rather than a real story. I do not complain about some of it being like a log book, but I would have wished to get a bit more information about the daily life on board. I just do not buy that the 3 travelers just stayed in their room. They must have found out a bit more about other parts of the boat. Or at least attempted it, and that would have been interesting to read about, without breaking with the overall style of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea was a very complex book. The authors word choice was what made it so complex, the author used words like \\"Vexed\\" \\"Zoophytes\\" and \\"Connoisseur.\\" The majority of these words were Old English, which added to the complexity of the book. The sentence structure was similar to the word choice, it was also very complex sentences, the sentences were usually not to long but not to short, at times they could be quite long though, and they were old an English style. The book itself is about Three Human beings chasing after a giant \\"Narwhal\\" as the author calls it. These three characters are known as Professor M. Arronax, a genius Professor from France whose passion is to study, Conseil, a teenage boy who devotes his life to serving the professor, and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Conseil and the Professor accept an invitation to the boat the Abram Lincoln, the goal of the voyage is to track down a giant Cetacean, or a sea creature. This creature has apparently been reeking havoc across the world causing all sorts of deeds, and so the 3 meet up at the boat. They pursue the creature for over a month, when they finally catch up with the lightning fast Cetacean they pursue it, however when the creature strikes back Ned Land, Conseil, and Professor Arronax are thrown into the ocean, and separated from their boat, they awake to find they are in the supposed cetacean, to find out that it is not at all a sea monster, but an amazing Submarine named the Nautilus led by Captain Nemo. They then learn of Captain Nemo's plans, and embark on a Submarine Hunt on the bottom of the Ocean, they Discover Atlantis, they venture to the south pole, and even fight among Poulps or Cuttlefish of enormous size, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is full of adventure.In 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea The Brilliant minds of Captain Nemo and Professor Arronax save them in times of danger, Captain Nemo's knowledge of the sea allows him to guide his submarine across the world, confronting the sea's greatest beauties and threats. Jules Verne does a very good job of telling the story and making out every last inch of the amazing journeys taken place on board the Nautilus. In my opinion this was a very good book, there are times in the book were discussions between the captain and the professor take place that are extremely difficult to comprehend, but in the end I would say this book is definitely worth the money. However as I've said before almost every page has Old English in it and is hard to understand, the sentences are very difficult and there are some words which I'd never heard before in my life, so because of the books complexity I would have to say that only someone 13+ can read this, this would be great for adults even, but I don't think anyone below the 7th grade could fully understand it, a 6th grader could but not get the full detail of the book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"In this book there are three main characters,Ned Land, Professor Aronnax, and Captain Nemo.

The only SOMEWHAT interesting parts of the story was when Professor Aronnax is in danger of being attacked by natives, but Jules Verne just HAS to say it in the most boring way. Jules Verne also spent entire pages describing totally boring conversations between Captain Nemo and Professor Aronnax. These conversations were not only boring but confusing. Jules Verne used way to many technical words, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong- I have a big vocabulary range, but that was ridiculous. And who cares about finding the Nautilus's exact location on a map using latitude and longitude lines? Why couldn't Jules Verne just say, &quot;IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN?&quot; If I were you, I would stay away from this book.

Not reading it truly means a hole in the education. It might seem a bit old-fashioned to the \\"MTV-Generation\\" (Which I personally a part of.) but yet, it is a very interesting book. The thing that I remember the most, from the first and last time I read it in the 3rd or 4th grade, is the food. In a world where submarines are a regular part of our lives, there was nothing unique for me in the idea of a sub. Yet, the food facsinated me, they were eating things that I've never heard of, and they seemed so exotic, that I still remember them: The sea Cucamber, the squid, the sea-weed, the fruites of the bread-tree. I think that this book is a great gift for your child. However, buy it for him or her when they are still very young, before they are 'corrupted' by the TV and the idea that reading is \\"not-Cool\\". This book would also make, in my opinion, a great bed-time story for a kid that is old enough to understand complex and sometimes scary storylines, and yet young enough to be charmed by the wonders of technoogy and nature, and sit with mouth and eyes wide open when the giant squid is catching the Nautilus."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book is one fantastic read!

The only fault with this book is how the main character continually rambles on about the classifications of the species of the ocean. I found it odd how he would somewhat drift off into the sub-class, genera, etc. of a cod during some of the most exciting parts of the book. Nevertheless this is a great read.

The creature was believed to be 100 feet long with a long thick, sharp, and strong tusk that could break a steal hull. The group finds out that the creature is a submarine called the Nautilus. The group along with Captain Nemo went on many adventures such as visiting Atlantis. The Famous Maelstrom hits the Nautilus and the submarine can't escape. The group tries to escape from the Nautilus. The group gets knocked unconscious, when they wake up they find themselves on land.I first heard of this book when one of my friends gave me the book along with many other classics. I think that this is one of my favorite books. Some other books I like are Robin Hood, Mutiny Aboard the HMS Bounty, and Kidnapped!. I like this book because it has so much adventure. I like anything that concerns with the ocean. I also like Mystery stories.My favorite part was when the group asked Captain Nemo if they could go and hunt on land. To their surprise he allowed them. When they landed and were cooking their meat a bunch of cannibals came and started to attack. When the group returned captain Nemo opened the hatch and kept it open. The cannibals then tried to enter, but then every time one tried to enter they would run away screaming. Then the professor finally understood; the ladder, hatch, the hull, and most of the rooms were electrical, so the captain could stop anyone he did not want there."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Jules Verne was one of the founders of the Science Fiction genre, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is one of his best known works.

The story is generally gripping and the character of Captain Nemo is an interesting and nuanced one - neither truly villainous nor heroic - but Verne gets bogged down in some of the details. Yes, I know the main character and narrator is an ichthyologist, but do I really need all of the \\"World of Fish\\" moments where he describes - in excruciating detail - ALL of the fish and other marine life that the crew of the Nautilus encounter whilst journeying around the underwater world on their anti-colonial crusade? I signed up for an adventure novel, not a Jacques Cousteau special. Oh well, when it works it works well and Verne will have you interested to the very end.

I love science fiction and classic novels so Verne should be perfect for me, right? Well... I can't say that Verne wasn't influential and his ideas are spectacular which is why so many movies have been based on his books but I have yet to read a Verne book that exceeded or even met my expectations.First, all his characters, despite different names and motivations, are all the same; perfect English gentlemen. This is not uncommon for writers from this era but when a Canadian harpooner like Ned Land uses phrases like \`By Jove' it rings false. Rudyard Kipling wrote Captains Courageous 27 years later and created sailors that felt absolutely authentic. Verne's characters seem to be created for a specific purpose. Captain Nemo is there to explain in detail the working of his Nautilus and other inventions while Professor Aronnax's role is to gush over Nemo's discoveries. I don't believe that any of the other members of Nemo's crew ever say a single word in the book and are simply window dressing.The second big problem is that Verne's science is often dubious. I'm not talking about science that was still questionable in Verne's time but established science and physical facts going way back. Verne seems completely unaware of things like encumbrance or the effects of high elevation. In this book Verne's consistently and often dramatically increases the size of sea life. Also, it can be somewhat dull reading constant facts and figures about the speed, depth, volume of air etc of the Nautilus. The book just goes on and on with Nemo relaying fact after fact while M. Aronnax listens in rapt attention. It also spends a near eternity describing all of the flora and fauna and without an actual plot to pin it to it gets very dull. The layout of the Nautilus is very unrealistic with no apparent attempt to maximize the usage of space. Nemo has a full size organ in his spacious cabin. Actual submarines are very constrained spaces.In order to create a compelling story Disney greatly expanded on Nemo's quest for revenge which is barely mentioned in the book. Disney also greatly expanded Ned Land's role to the improvement of the story and did a very nice bit of casting having him played by Kirk Douglas. The famous scene where the Nautilus is attacked by a giant squid (multiple squids in the book) only occupies a couple of pages. Mostly the book is just the Nautilus cruising all over the world occasionally getting stuck. That's about it. It's as if Verne couldn't come up with a plot to wrap around his idea of a mysterious captain and his incredible machine.I have read quite a few of Verne's novels but this one may have the most anemic plot of them all. 20,000 is leagues is much more serious than \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and \`In Search of the Castaways' (which I really didn't enjoy) but it's not particularly compelling. This is a rare occasion where I think the famous movie version was an improvement over the book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"It was really good.

Aronnax, Consiel, and Ned Land partake in were vividly portrayed in the book. Also the Nautilus was really amazing, in two ways. First in how powerful the ship was, and second how Verne could have created the idea for such a vessel for the period of time he wrote the book.From the underwater forests of Crespo, to the Manaar Bank, then to Atlantis and the South Pole, the book made it feel as if I was traveling along with them. In addition to the locales, the Nautilus itself was amazing, with it's speed, strength and technology. On top of that, there was also, the walks on the bottom of the ocean which were described with amazing detail.Capitan Nemo was the most complex character I've read about in a long time. Throughout their time on the ship, Aronnax, Consiel, and Land never see much of Nemo, and when they do, he's not a man of many words. He is, however a man of great intelligence, skill, and wealth, who decided to sevre all ties with civilization, for reasons that appear unknown to us.Professor Aronnax began thinking some monsterous narwhal type beast is destroying ships in the ocean at the beginning of the story, so himself, Consiel, and Ned Land set out to discover what it really is, and find themselves amidst something completely different.This book was a treat to read with all it's adverture and exploring.

This new translation based on the original French texts is amazing, it moves quickly and I discovered things that I had never read in other English versions. You get more of Verne's politics here than in earlier translations including such memeorable phrases as: \\"The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.\\"The characters are well developed and you can indentify with all of them and how they view their effective captivity aboard the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is a wonderful character and Verne gives the reader just enough information about him to keep you enthralled but not enough to remove the mystery. The intro relates that Nemo was supposed to be a Polish aristocrat, getting back at the world for the the atrocities the Russians had commited against his family. But when Hetzel his publisher balked at the idea because of the new Franco Russian alliance Verne decided to remove any trace of nationality.What else can be said? The English is not archaic!! This restored and annotated version, is a VAST improvement over previous English editions.

There are also black-and-white illustrations - as there are in William Butcher's OUP edition (ISBN 978-0199539277) - which are of the period (but not necessarily thereby of great artistic merit). The dustcover of the Evertype edition shows - for some inextricable reason - a modern photograph of a stingray (where a squid, at least, might have had more relevance to the book).If I were just interested in reading the story I would probably buy the OUP edition which - like my copy of OUP's \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\" (also translated by William Butcher) - could be expected to brown-up within a year or two as it's printed on cheap paper (the same as the Penguins of old). If I were buying it as a gift I would probably be tempted to select the Evertype hardcover translation by Frederick Paul Walters (even though I don't know what quality of paper it's printed on or whether the pages are sewn together in quires or just glued together like a cheap paperback)."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is actually my favorite book of all time next to Ivanhoe, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Man in the Iron Mask, and The War of the Worlds. I read this book in fourth grade and absolutely loved it. Now that I'm 3 years older, I appreciate it even more. Though there were some hard words, I loved the dialogue. There is even humor when Professor Aronnax explains how pearls are made and says, &quot;Yes, my boy, oysters can produce many sharks&quot; because he is scared to go shark hunting. Captain Nemo is a mysterious yet interesting character. My favorite parts are when they are at the sunken ship in the Mediterranean Sea, when they fight the giant squid, and when they are at Ceylon. Some of their other travels take them to the lost continent of Atlantis, a tunnel under the Suez Canal, and through the Great Ice Barrier. This is my favorite Jules Verne book, though it has some competition from Around the Moon and Journey to the Center of the Earth. This book is a must-have for science lovers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and the ocean. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"It's a great story, no question.

Not only is it a riveting novel with a brilliant plot it is also an accurate prediction of the future. I have never read a book that is so flawlessly combines the disparate worlds of science and story telling. Verne's writing style grabbed me from the get go, yet he never sacrifices any detail. Verne pulls you into another reality and where you never know what is going to happen next. Even in its most technical moments Verne's masterpiece demands your attention. Most people know the gist of the story. Three men are held captive in an extraordinary submarine vessel, the Nautilus, led by the Captain Nemo, a man who has left the human world to live under the sea. If you read the book you will find that there is much more to this story than you originally believed. Verne is also very accurate in predicting how a submarine would work. His Nautilus uses many of the same devices as the real submarines of the future!Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"In English speaking countries, 20,000 is considered a classic boy's book, but in France, it is considered a work of literature. The two translators of this version have gone back to the original French, and made a new translation. Turns out, the common translation that we are used to is full of mistranslations and ommissions of anti-English sentiments. Frankly, I didn't think the new translation adds that much more to the story, but I really enjoyed the footnotes and annotations. The translators take a boyish glee when they find and error or ommission that, to me, added a bit to the story. I'd recommend this version over the older translation. If you've read this story before, I think you will enjoy the annotations most."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Jules Verne wrote this book in 1870. It has startling technological references (even in the concept of the submarine) but even more stunning was the Nuclear Reactor on board.I feel that some episodes of Star Trek (the original series) are models on Jules Verne, because behind the backdrop of the technology and adventure, there exists the social evils of slavery, colonialism and nihilism as well as genocide.The story is about Captain Nemo who is epic, driven and something good that is so strongly polar he is actually lead into a path of destruction - and his crew. The story is told through the eyes of Professor Aronnax. The usage of an observant intellectual to explain the dark pathos of a main character was rather popular in that era (think Watson and Holmes).In this instance it is important because Nemo destroys a vessel with all hands and then bows before a picture of his wife and children. The implication is that his family where kidnapped (or killed) as slaves.At anyrate, if you love steampunk culture, Star Trek social complexity, and classical literature you will love 20000 Leagues Under the Sea."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"For some reason, even after reading this book, my brain still translates \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" to mean 20000 leagues DOWN instead of a DISTANCE. What's wrong with me?Anyway, this book was a treasure. Jules Verne, the grandfather of science fiction, again shows that his is much more than a scientific mind. Verne is a grand storyteller, and this novel is his masterwork.Our heroes, Professor Arronax, his faithful compatriot Conseil, and the salty sailor Ned Land find themselves together in a hunt for a giant, mysterious undersea creature which has been causing havoc among shipping lines as well as towns along the coastline. Setting out to sea on top-of-the-line sailing vessel, the three men and the crew encounter the creature, only to have it sink their ship like so many others. However, as you probably know, this is no creature at all, but the most spectacular vehicle ever created by man. It is the Nautilus, a gigantic submarine, and the proud creation of the enigmatic Captain Nemo.Captain Nemo holds the three as his prisoner. They are instructed that they may never leave the Nautilus, yet will be treated with hospitality and respect by Nemo and his crew. The Captain keeps his word, and treats the Professor and his fellows to all the wonders of the ocean depths. Captain Nemo has made the sea his home, vowing never to return to the distasteful world on land. The Nautilus has everything you would need to live and prosper; infinite supplies of water through its seawater processing machines, and an abundance of exotic seafood dredged up from the deep.Captain Nemo himself is as mystifying and brilliant as his creations. He is one of the greatest villains ever put on paper, and Verne's skill as a storyteller brings him to life. Nemo's motivations are clouded in mystery. I can't stress enough how excellent this character is, and the sly way Verne allows for Nemo's true motivations to remain as unfathomable at the end of the novel as it was at the beginning.The Professor doesn't want to leave the Nautilus. He is enthralled by the sea life and the wonders of Nemo's brilliant submarine. Conseil goes where the Professor goes, and is pleased to assist him in their adventure. Ned feels like a prisoner. He longs to walk on firm ground again, and considers his imprisonment as a violation.The action is blended well alongside the exploration and discovery. This book reads and feels like a grand adventure in ways few books can equal. The language is crisp and clear and so is the humor, which is a unusual for a novel written well over 100 years ago. It flows perfectly in English as a result of a superb translation. If I were to single out one thing I disliked about it, it would be the detailed discussions of sea life in the undersea world. I still found Verne's descriptions of multitudes of ocean species fascinating, but some readers may not. What helps alleviate the (possible) boredom is to remember that readers back in the 1800 had NO TV and few had any way of experiencing the wonders of the sea as Verne describes them.\\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\" can be read by all ages. Most of Verne's books are recommended to younger readers, but there is no indication that they were WRITTEN for the young crowd. You certainly never feel like you're reading a children's book, not by a long shot. Anyone with a sense of wonder and appreciates the fantastic would enjoy the ride. I know I did."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was one of the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated. Such an annotated volume can prove to be very helpful to teenagers getting acquainted with Nemo and his submarine."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The other reviewers have noted how the editors...both experts on Verne and the Victorian era science that guided him.. have gone back to the original French manuscripts, collated them to use the best, most reliable, paragraphs and phrases from each, and annotated the book to reflect on Verne's social, political and technical background as if affects the story.If all this sounds like the book is some kind of dull scholarly treatise, rest assured that the novel as STORY is not harmed, but actually improved by the editors' restorations and fix-ups.My own path to Nemo and the Nautilus was watching the Disney film version when I was 11, then getting the Classic Comics version, and finally going to the available butchered translation. Even that version captivated me, and sent me to the dictionary to decipher some of the hifalutin 19th century phrases.Now, as then, I gloss over the endless catalogues of marine biology classification --- Verne as well as Victorian science fans were captivated by the then new interest in categorizing flora and fauna into genus, species, sub-species, varieties, etc. This stuff can be skipped without losing the story.What interests me is the adventure under the sea, and the way in which these fellows are able to watch the wonders of the deep through the window of a plush 1860s salon. I am also interested in how Verne envisioned the workings of the sub. Interestingly, in 1904, just before his death, he wrote an article for Popular Mechanics in which he updated his thoughts on the future of the submarine, based on the Simon Lake and John Holland boats of that day. He had to explain to readers that he was NOT the inventor of the submarine, as popularly believed.All in all, the editors have done a wonderful service in bringing the real \\"20, 000 Leagues\\" to light. I hope it will attract the interest of many bright and curious young boys and girls of the 21st century when the Sea Wolf and Virginia class subs of the USN have finally equalled the performance of the Nautilus of 1870."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is one of the most famous novels by Verne, and justifiedly so. A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"For some reason, a few of Verne's many works have become famous in the English speaking world and have even gained some kind of \\"classic\\" status. Unfortunately, these are in my opinion his more superficial and uninteresting novels. 20000 Leagues Under the Sea is a perfect example.Most people would have heard of the idea through some part of culture - the story of Captain Nemo in his submarine (Verne's alleged prophetic vision) and how one outsider is forced through circumstance to join Nemo and his crew on a host of adventures across the seas. This is fine, and that's what the book is. BUT, unlike many better Verne novels, this is ALL it is. It's an adventure story mixed with a description of the various wonders of the udnerwater world (including Atlantis). Don't get me wrong, Verne is good at describing all these things and it's interesting and certainly makes you think about worlds other than your own.What I love about Verne's works such as the Mysterious Island and the 500 Millions of the Beguma is that this is used as a vehicle for some deeper or more interesting messages. Here, the main \\"deeper\\" message is the study of Nemo as a recluse from society - a kind of conscienscious objector (or even hater of humanity if you will), surrounded by his cold machine-like submarine and the predator-like amoral underwater world. In the hands of most writers, this would be sci-fi schlock and it is only Verne that makes it into a good book - but this should not be the work he is renowned for.This book is actually the 2nd in a trilogy, the 1st being In Search of the Castaways and the 3rd being Mysterious Island and I reckon they get progressively better so read the third one!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book is about a man who finds an underwater secret boat.

To be frank, I wavered for about 4 minutes on how to rate this book. Was it a 3 or 4? In the end, I chose the 4 star rating. This book had a wonderful story line, the characters, and the setting where also both wonderful. The things that really drug this book down where Verne's consistent descriptions of things that really, in actuality, could have been left out. He goes on and on classifying fish and giving very, very detailed descriptions of the submarine (The Nautilus), the way it worked, and the things on board. I guess I can understand this, I guess Verne was just trying to give a believable and complete description of the things the characters saw on their journeyIf you could, somehow, get an abridged version, I would reccomend it. This book is great and truth be told, it was worth my time reading it. I just think that unless you're a marine biologist or are just, for some reason, very interest in the classification of oceanic plant and animal life, that 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea would be best read, and probally more enjoyable with some of the 'unimportant to the story' detailed descriptions of the above-mentioned things ...in frank, LEFT OUT. Now, this is not to say that you shouldn't read this book, you should. I'm just forewarning the prospective reader that they will find some parts of the book to be 'boring' with VERY in depth classifications and descriptions. On the other hand, the story is one of great splendor and excitement. Try to remain focused on the story line and keep a clear mind that the descriptions are just Verne's way of trying to give the reader the most in-depth and detailed assessment of the voyage. Now, I know that what I have written so far is not a 'review'. I'm just trying to let people know what kind of a read they will be in for, if they so choose to read the book. Now, as for a real 'review' on what happens in this book? ...Nahhh, read it yourself. I will say this, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea takes you to places,in your mind,betterthan any book I've ever read. You will become attatched to the characters every move and sit in anxiety, with great with anticipation, eager to find out what will happen next in this Sci-Fi classic. So, with all the above information on how the book will lag a bit at times ...I finish with this, Verne's descriptive writting leads many modern day readers into boredom and complaint. If you really open your eyes and embrace Verne's descriptive style, you will learn to enjoy this work, and have an admiration for this classic story and classic storyteller almost unequaled in all of literature. For what it is, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea couldn't have been written better by anyone, ever. Keep your mind open and don't give up on it.

Outside of the three captives, no other characters were well-developed. I would have liked to have gotten to know Captain Nemo a lot better, and what happened in his past that led him to isolate himself from humanity. Since his character is never developed, Captain Nemo ends up being a one-dimensional character with an inexplicable aversion to civilization. The ending is a big cop-out, where no explanation is given in how the characters arrived where they end up.

And how dare Verne take us to Atlantis and spend less than two pages there? None of the characters is any different by the end of the book, and we never really find out what it is that makes Captain Nemo the way he is.That said, the nineteenth century science fiction is wonderful.

But, of all his novels, the most wondrous, the most well known, the most popular and the best is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea.The book's plot is pretty well known to the literature world: Captain Nemo has built an underwater ship called the Nautilus. Three people land on the ship and are taken aboard: French Professor M. Aronnax, a famous French scientist, Conseil, his servant and Ned Land, a Canadian Harpooner. Some of the highlights of their incredible adventure include getting trapped under ice in the South Pole, battling giant squid, exploring lost shipwrecks as well as the lost city of Atlantis and encountering the undersea forests of Crespo.What is most amazing is that Verne's predicted how subs would work years later. Also, the U.S.S Nautilus went under the South Pole almost a century after Verne's Nautilus. The book is however not problem proof. It takes a while to develop. The Nautilus is originally mistaken for a sea monster. So a few are spent looking for this \\"Sea Monster\\". But this is forgivable.

But that's perfectly OK, because the rest of the book has plenty of things going for it. Jules Verne had a very good imagination. His depiction of the submarine turned out to be quite accurate with regards to what actually was turned into reality during the 20th century. This book is a lot of fun, and if you like it then I strongly recommend that you also read its sequel MYSTERIOUS ISLAND."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"&quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is,I must say, one of the best novels written by Jules Verne. begins to wreck ships.

From the outside, this edition is very nice; as other reviewers have noted, it's great to have the map on the front cover. However, the print inside the book is VERY small. I'm not sure what the publisher was thinking; I've never seen a published book with type this tiny before.

Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is arguably the first technical thriller, launching a genre which has since grown wildly in popularity and includes most of Michael Chricton's work. It is a very imaginative book, the story of the mysterious Captain Nemo -haunted by an implied but never explained past - who has built for himself and his crew the submarine Nautilus to be free of the laws of man and to live successfully and sustainably on the bounty of the world's oceans, which he intrepidly explores in all its wonders. Inevitably he is chased by the main characters, Ned the Harpooner, Mr. Arronax the professor and Conseil his man-servant, in the frigate USS Abraham Lincoln. Unlike the movie the story is told entirely by Mr. Arronax and Ned is more a minor character, and a stolid Canadian as opposed to the boisterous and fun loving American in the movie. Also unlike the movie the Nautilus does not sink the Lincoln, but in a duel vents it with steam that throws our three main characters overboard whom are then rescued after the Lincoln, ignorant to the fact they are no longer onboard, retreats from the scene.Thus begins a promising story of mystery and adventure, the possible drama of Captain Nemo being chased by worldly forces in his incredible Nautilus, the tension between the captives who are experiencing the amazing wonders of the ocean depths firsthand and their captor who cannot ever let them go without losing his own freedom, and the chance for exciting adventures. While all of these things are delivered in the book, they are done so very anachronistically (obviously), with the drama, tension and adventure being there - and being very creatively crafted - but also being very subdued and literally drowned in an ocean of Mr. Arronax describing the latin names of the sea life he sees outside the Nautilus's window. This captures the fascination of the age with Natural History versus today's focus on excitement and adventure in these types of novels. There are many times were the book gets very, very dry as the author rattles of names that you have no idea what they refer to, and even if you google them the only hits you will get are the passages in the book itself! Based on this, the fact that this translation cuts out some 20% of the book is probably not a bad thing.Nonetheless there are some great moments of natural beauty and adventure. Jules Verne showed some incredible predictive power in describing the structural design, diving operations and maneuverability, and life support systems of a submarine, being basically spot on before anything beyond the Turtle of Revolutionary War heritage had ever been put to sea. The myriad undersea \\"terrains\\" the characters experience are particularly cool and fun. Relative to the movie the giant squid attack is underwhelming, but a much better scene that never made it to the film is one where after discovering the south pole (something Verne got wrong obviously) the Nautilus is caught in between two icebergs and must dig itself out before its air supply runs out. But there are some drawbacks too. There are some shockingly dark moments for a book aimed towards younger men from the 1860's which seem to imply they are leading somewhere and could have been great plot tension builders, but they are never fully fleshed out, and neither is the character they are supposed to be windows into, the reclusive, tortured yet brilliant Captain Nemo. The book ends quickly and inconclusively, feeling like a great set up for a story that ends as more travel log than character story or adventure yarn. Nonetheless the book is short and relatively easy to read despite it's older grammatical style which can sound very strange today.The job the publisher did however is spotty. The cover design of the book is very well done, but the editing is poor with many glaring typos throughout the text.All in all the movie is much better as a movie than a direct adaptation of the book would have been, with Ned Land turned into a main character that an American audience can connect with (unlike the highly intellectual and uninspiring Mr. Arronax as main character of the book or the turgid Canadian version of Ned Land), Captain Nemo is more explained as a character and pitted more against Mr. Arronax as two opposing sides of a moral coin, and the movie has a more solid story and conclusion. But the book has it's own advantages and overall is worth reading, especially for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This one of the best Jules Verne books. It is a must read for everyone. Even my teenage daughter enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Verne is the original, there's no question about that. Frankly, Verne is science fiction for people who don't like science fiction.

Also, he imagines something very much like real-life diving equipment for the scenes on the sea floor and dealing with the squid."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS STORY TO ANYONE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GREAT UNDERSEA ADVENTURE BOOK.

Not only does this book inspire interest in marine biology, but it also makes one think about social and psychological issues, leading the reader to evaluate what and why things are right and wrong.

Aronnax and his assistant Conseil are asked to investigate ships that are being mysteriously rammed from under the water. Aronnax's conclostion is that the ships are being attacked by a giant narwhale. He is asked to come on the USS Aberaham Lincon. So he accepts the invatation and with in to weeks he is abord the newest ship in the American Navy. When on the ship he meets the canadian harpooner Ned Land. After a while they see a glowing green light this is the light the witnesses discribed before being attacked. Even though the men abord the ship are shotting the \\"narwhale\\" it didn't seem to have any effect. Suddenly they are rammed sending Conseil, Land, and Aronnax over board and puts a giant hole in the Aberaham Lincon. Then they are captured by Captian Nemo. This is probaly my favorite begining in any book I have ever read. Then Nemo gives Aronnax a tour of his submarine. It is the size of Moby Dick and is run by electric motors. Later in the book Nemo take Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned Land walking on the bottom of the sea. If you look at the origanal pictures in the book thier diving gear looks like modern scuba gear. After taveling thousans of miles under water Nemo lets Aronnax, Land, and Conseil go hunting on a small island. Here they are attacked by savages luckly they all get back to the Natilus saftly. When they get inside the boat Nemo tells them to open the hatches and lets them come in when the savages are running down the stair way the are all electicuted.

I highly suggest this book to everbody."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I read a rusty 1954 edition of this book and found it splendid. Even though this book was filled with information about electricity, how it gets it from the sea, how much the \\"Nautilus\\" weighs in tonnes, how the \\"Nautilus\\" can reach the speed of 50 miles per hour etc. it still was a marvellous book. Jules Verne puts stacks of information into this book. But here's the amazing bit of this information. This book was first published in 1871. 1871?Why 1871?Nothing like electricity was invented in 1871. Or other stuff. Jules Verne imagined science when hardly any of it was invented. None of it. None of it at all. That's why, 20,000 leagues under the sea and other of his novels were amazing.Also, the characters in this novel are likeable. The nature and the stuff Captain Nemo, Pierre Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil see under the sea seem so real while reading this classic. The peculiar but wonderful character of Captain Nemo makes this book wonderful to read.This book appeals to children and adults.In 1866, a strange thing at sea captures everybody by surprise. It is some sort of peculiar monster or floating reef. The \\"Helvetia\\", \\"Columbus\\", \\"Scotia\\" and \\"Shannon\\" all spot this creature. People wonder what exactly is it. Pierre Arronax, Proffesor of the Museum of Paris is called by Captain Farragut of the \\"Abraham Lincoln\\" to capture this gigantic cetacean with all these harpooners, especially one called Ned Land. Ned Land is strong and full of uncommon skill. He is also a Canadian. When Pierre Arronax falls off ship, after Land aims his harpoon at the creature, jets of water spray on the bridge of the ship which throws many people off into the dangerous waters. The propeller and rudder are broken. Two other people who join Pierre are Conseil and Land. The creature was actually a submarine called the \\"Nautilus\\". It takes the three into it where they meet the mysterious Captain Nemo...Further on they meet savages, giant octopuses and indulge with the wonderful sea life which makes this wonderful tale enjoyable. But all with Captain Nemo. The four take on a ride of their life. Thanks to Jules Verne people have been excited since. Buy this and treasure forever.

The story is still fresh and informative. To be sure, Verne got some of the technical things wrong, but considering how technology has advanced and more is known, he got it mostly right. I've wanted to read this since I was a kid, and I am sorry I waited until I retired. Some of the biological naming discussions get somewhat tedious, but as a whole the story is great! However, don't think it is quite like the Walt Disney movie version, because it is not. It starts out that way, but proceeds through the story in a somewhat different way, and ends differently.

In the end of the book they find what their looking for but I can't give that away.My opinion on this book was it was good. It had lots of action and if you like adventure books I think you would enjoy this book. Their aren't very many boring parts of this book, and it almost never annoying.

I thought it was a waste of time back then and still do but apparently lots of folks don't. The blue prints of the Nautilus feature in Clive Cussler's book Valhalla Rising.

If you get a chance, read The Mysterious Island."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Jules Vernes captures our imaginations in his tale of adventure and science. The narrator, Dr. Arronax, is a French naturalist who goes on an expedition to hunt down a mysterious sea creature spotted by many sailors. However, in an interesting turn of events, he finds out that the enigma that roamed the oceans is in fact a futuristic submarine (the Nautilus) built by Captain Nemo. Dr. Annonax, along with his Flemish companion Conseil and Canadian harpooner Ned Land, are held hostage on the Nautilus and through their time aboard they experience the great wonders of the seas. Giant squids, ice caps, pearl hunts, close calls with Papuan natives, are only a fraction of the exciting events they experience.Using Arronax as the narrator, Verne gives us a look into the mysteries of the deep seas. While Arronax often gets carried away labeling and categorizing sea life, it makes the narrative seem more authentic. I felt a little cheated about not learning the life story of the brilliant and enigmatic Captain Nemo. We learn that he is driven by revenge, yet we don't know exactly why and who is his unfortunate target. However, this lack of revelation allows the reader to create his/her own theories, which can be quite fun.This book may not be for action junkies, as shown by previous reviews.

They travel on a boat called the Abraham Lincoln, which is sailed by Captain Farragut. There they meet Ned Land, a master harpooner. The Abraham Lincoln is hit, and Ned, M.

Swim with them in this watery book!Opinions:1. This amazing book tells a tale of adventure with a subsurface of mystery. There are ocean bottoms hit and secrets kept, poles reached and mysteries left unsolved. What really kept me going while reading this book was the sheer anticipation of what was yet to come. It is wonderful material for people like me to get their hands on. I like to learn a little bit about the world while still reading a book that is fictionous and fun to read. For example, it talked about the main characters going inside an extinct volcano while describing the chamber of the volcano in explicit detail.2. The book tells the reader a bit about what life was like 1866 while still being an adventure-themed and fun to read book. It described many daring actions and risks, while still giving facts on geography I never even knew about. It told me about how a boat was run back then and also spoke about some species of fish through Conseil's classification.3. Jules Verne never explained why the title mentioned 20,000 leagues. The Nautilus never went farther than 4000 leagues down under the waves.4. I believe that this book is meant for people ages 10+ because some of the things in there might not be comprehensible to a person aged 9 or lower.RecommendationI would recommend this book to people wanting to be oceanographers because it talks about some things you may not have known about the sea. Unearth more details in this 1866 novel!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I have been a Jules Verne fan since I was a kid. There is something to be said about his incredible imagination and his grasp of scientific principles that were well ahead of his time. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is the voyage of Prof. Arronax, along with his companions Ned and Conseil, who have found themselves on board the Nautilus, an incredible submarine designed by the mysterious Captain Nemo. The Nautilus crew lives esclusively in the oceans and seas, surfacing only to replenish oxygen. Throughout the journey, they experience breath-taking sights, heart-pounding adventures, and perilous obstacles. Jules Verne does a beautiful job constructing this submarine world, even inventing new sea creatures to fit into his story. Scarcely a chapter goes by without some new or legendary creature sneaking in to liven up the seascape. However, I think where this story falls short is in its flow. I understand that the story is written from Prof. Arronax's point of view, which is that of a scientist, but each chapter contains several paragraphs of virtually useless information, be it readings from the nautical instruments or long lists of aquatic animals (including their class, genus, and species). This detracts from the overall flow of the story and I believe could have been left out. However, at four stars, this book is still very much worth reading!"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Sheer adventure narrative for the aquatic zoology and oceanography nerd.

Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context.

Not some flat two-dimensional characters who not feel and just act. It's easy to see why it's a classic. The book has a lot of action and adventure and even some mystery and lots of suspense. If you love any of these things, you should read this book. I found the way Conseil talks strange. Talking always in the third person I mean. Who actually goes around calling themselves by their first name? Looking up all the different animal and plant names that appear in this story must have taken forever as well as knowing where all these places were. He amazing he can fit all this information into one book an make it interesting. From reading this book, it refreshed my memory of the places in the world. The time from they were captured until they escaped only lasted six months. It seems to see all that they did see would have taken over a year. They did travel 60,000 miles. 1 leauge = 3 miles.

Can't go wrong."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This is Verne's classic novel about Captain Nemo and his submarine Nautilus. What really fascinated me when reading this story and other Verne novels was not only Verne's contributions to the science fiction genre, but his founding of a whole new genre, one that, as far as I know, he has never been given credit. I think Verne was the first to write the techno-novel, a work that is filled with technical details ala Tom Clancy. For this novel, Verne did considerable research to describe what was known as accurately as possible. Professor Arronax and his servant Conseil board a U. S. ship that is searching for a monster that has sunk a number of other ships. They discover that it isn't a monster at all but a submarine, captained by a mysterious man known only as Nemo (Verne will present readers with Nemo once again in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;). Arronax, Conseil, and an American harpooner named Ned Land travel with Nemo and see many wonderous things and have many adventures. Verne's &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; has gotten some very poor reviews over the decades since it first appeared in 1869. In many cases, it was because of the translation and not because of Verne. A number of the early translators inserted their own sections with their own ideas and opinions and deleted much of Verne's own words. So, readers should be aware of the translator. I read an excellent translation by Walter James Miller that was also annotated.

The hardcover is strong and the silk bookmark is useful. The only thing that bothers me (and is somewhat minor) are the footnotes. The translator added footnotes throughout the book to explain some words, names, and cultural references from long ago. Some were useful, but others were so painfully obvious and still part of modern cultural memory that I wonder why the translator even took the time to footnote them. Also, the translator mentions in one footnote that he chose to omit a passage where Jules Verne explains in great detail the books which are in Nemo's library. In English classes I was always taught that one of the most interesting aspects of a book is what the author had the character(s) reading. It may have been a long and painful passage, but I would have rather had the choice as a reader to skim over an unending list of French titles from the 1800's rather than have the translator make that decision for me.Additionally, there are questions included for discussion at the end of the book. Without getting off on too much of a tangent, the questions remind me of all that is wrong with shallow and inane stock questions in books. I'm tempted to cut the last few pages out of my copy.Despite my views on the footnotes and questions, I love this book and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I highly recommend it.---Alex"},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"20,000 League Under the Sea begins with the world's seas being menaced by an unknown force. After several shipwrecks, the Abraham Lincoln is dispatched to kill what the world believes to be some kind of animal. After a battle with the \\"creature\\", the three main characters, Professor Aronnax, his servant/research assistant Conseil, and Canadian \\"King of the Harpooners\\" Ned Land are swept overboard. When they awake, they find that they are prisoners aboard the Nautilus, a submersible vessel under the command of the mysterious Captain Nemo and his equally enigmatic crew.Captain Nemo refuses to allow the three men to leave his ship, but otherwise treats them well. They are allowed the run of the ship and Professor Aronnax soon becomes quite taken with the research opportunities afforded to him by the submarine. His assistant Conseil is happy to do whatever his master wishes, but Ned Land becomes increasingly agitated and determined to escape as the story progresses. Dominating the tale is the figure of Captain Nemo, a man who has forsworn his allegiances to country and humanity to command his own destiny under the world's seas and oceans.The Nautilus takes the men on many strange and exciting adventures. Verne peppers the story with scientific detail. It's mostly fascinating, although the multiple listings of fish, fauna, and flora can become cumbersome at times. The novel is at its best when Aronnax is wrestling with the mystery of Captain Nemo and his motives, as well as his own conflicting desires to remain on the Nautilus and explore the reaches of the deep or to join Ned Land's quest for freedom.Stirring in places, the story of Captain Nemo and his amazing undersea vessel shouldn't be missed by any fan of science fiction/fantasy. After all, Verne helped create the genre. The version of the novel I purchased was the Signet Classic series translated by Mendor T. Brunetti, who also provides a foreword. Walter James Miller provides a fascinating afterward concerning the inaccuracies of previous translations."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days.

The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated.

The story starts when a strange type of sea life surfaces and a crew is sent out to find what this creature is. When the creature is found, the crew immediately attacks it. The strange creature succeeds in destroying the ship. Two passengers, Ned Land and Pierre Aronnax, survive and board the strange creature, which ends up being a submarine, named The Nautilus. Ned and Pierre meet the captain, Captain Nemo, and they discover a whole new life under the sea, with the help of Captain Nemo. Captain Nemo hates war, and throughout the book.

In this book, the reader is taken on an unbelievable journey aboard the Nautilus, an ingeniously built submarine, venturing the mysterious waters of the world. Jules Verne chooses to describe marine life in incredible detail (or maybe even overboard in detail) in this fictional novel. One may wonder how much research Verne did on the ocean in order to write this story. I believe readers who find life under the sea interesting will best enjoy this book, but the rest may still be fascinated. Not only is this novel a great learning experience of the sea, it is also packed with surprises, which includes a visit to the legendary, sunken Atlantis. Verne even decides to include a bit of mystery in the story. During the sea-voyage, the submarine undergoes a mysterious collision that the captain refuses to tell. I found myself dreading to speed through the pages to complete the book, hoping the author would reveal the solution to this mystery towards the end. Even though I was greatly fascinated by this novel, I still admit that I was disappointed in some ways after completing it. After finishing the book, I had discovered that the title of this book might have been a little misleading. Instead of descending a total of twenty thousand leagues under the sea, the Nautilus actually travels a total of twenty thousand leagues submerged in the sea. One may even find the ending of the story a little too spontaneous and shortly written. As a conclusion, I must say that, even though I did encounter some disappointments, I enjoyed reading the book and I do not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I really enjoy books that revolve around science... especially when they were written during the 1800s and early 1900s. It is very entertaining to discover what these people believed and to compare their beliefs to ours in modern times. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea is entertaining in this fashion. Jules Verne is suprisingly accurate in his depiction of a modern-day electric submarine and its workings... although he doesn't go into the minute details that I was hoping for. The ending of this book is a tremendous let-down with regards to the character of Captain Nemo. Throughout the entire book, the Captain's background is built up to be a giant mystery... which simply begs for resolution. I couldn't wait to reach the end of the book in order to find out why Captain Nemo was the way he was. This resolution never comes. Never. This left me with the opinion that Jules Verne simply wasn't a talented storyteller, and never bothered to fill out and completely think about the character of Captain Nemo. Anyone can think up fantastic situations and theories... but the real talent comes in explaining them in a plausible way to the reader. It's akin to watching a movie where lots of incredible things happen to the main characters, only to have them wake up stating that it was all a dream."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The begining of this book, really attracts and I read it excited thinking that the rest would be interesting, but as it continued I really was getting bored, so I just read the last part and quited reading it.

I think many young readers will be puzzled by the vocabulary and will be bored. Eventually, the story picks up. However, I was bored in the 1950's and cannot imagine that today's youngsters will do much better.

Conseil was just about as skilled as the professor as far as classification, and knowing so much information about just about everything. One day, the professor got a letter that invited him to go on a select trip to hunt the killer narwhal. Mysteriously, several ships had been rammed, and had a triangular shaped scar on the spot where the uncanny shipmates had decided that the narwhal hit. So Professor Arronax and Conseil went to examine the accidents.They get on the ship and meet a Canadian harpooner named Ned Land. He told them that he was the best at what he does, and that he was ready to take out the narwhal. After a while, they come across the infamous narwhal. They find it strange that the narwhal is about three times as long as the ship they're on, and that it glows. The professor's ship is attacked, and they are stranded in the ocean, they climb aboard the narwahal to find out that it is in actuality a submarine. They finally meet a strange man named Captain Nemo, who explains to them that it is his ship and that the professor, Conseil, and Ned Land can stay as long as they go with him on a trip around the world in his submarine, the Nautilus.

Somewhere near the middle its narrator captures the essence of the book with the following unintentionally prescient sentence: \\"To anyone but myself, who had a great love of the sea, the hours below must have seemed long and monotonous.\\" That's an excellent summation of Verne's story of the almost magical electric submarine The Nautilus, it's imperious and mysterious Captain Nemo, and the three outsiders who circumnavigate the globe in it. Basically, unless you have some kind of strong interest in marine biology, it is an incredibly tedious read. Granted, it is an impressive feat of imagination for its time (the 1860s), but the amazing technologies described don't pack any kind of punch for the modern reader, and the exotic locales are now the stuff of the Travel Channel.The story is very simple. There is some kind of large creature menacing sea traffic around the world, so an international expedition is launched to try and find it and capture or kill it. Among those joining this voyage are the famous French naturalist Professor Aronnax, his heroic servant Conseil, and legendary French-Canadian harpoonist Ned Land. When the American frigate leading the expedition finally encounters the beast, combat ensues and they are thrown into the water, only to wind up the prisoners of the Nautilus. Captain Nemo decides that having seen his vessel's interior, they must remain prisoners for life. Thus, they embark on a grand tour of ocean with this man who has forsaken mankind and its evil ways.Alas this tour turns out to be a barrage of naturalist classifications of everything they see, complete with Latin names and various characteristics. This is fairly evocative the first time, but by the third has gotten repetitive, and by the tenth just downright sleep-inducing. Not to mention a litany of latitudes and longitudes to mark their path, as if one were reading in one hand and following along with an atlas in the other. Which is not to say that stuff doesn't happen, it does--it's just not very interesting. They visit underwater forests, the South Pole, Atlantis, coral reefs, famous shipwrecks, encounter danger from a tricky passage, icebergs, giant octopi, and fierce island people, and yet none of it is particularly dramatic or well done.Matters aren't helped by stilted scenes where Professor Aronnax asks Nemo how some aspect of the submarine works and receives a lengthy lecture outlining the scientific basis and processes for how such and such works. There are far too many instances where Aronnax is simply playing the straight man to Nemo's genius: \\"Gosh, we're really in a jam now Captain Nemo, what are we going to do!\\" \\"My dear professor, yet again you underestimate the capabilities of the Nautilus, all I have to do is....\\" etc. In that sense, Verne's imagination is deployed in a relatively wooden manner which does little to make it compelling for the modern reader.Finally, the central conflict of the three captives versus their captor is lame. They're stuck, they can't do anything to escape, and that never changes until the merciful end, where they are whisked away yet again. Again, no tension or drama. The one really intriguing character is Captain Nemo, who rails misanthropically about mankind and refuses to divulge his nationality, and speaks to his crew in an unrecognizable language. Throughout, one keeps waiting for a revelation as who he is and why he hates the world of men, but other than brief allusion to his having had a wife and child who were killed, there's no payoff! This final straw is an infuriating end to a stultifying book. Sometimes the \\"classics\\" ain't what they used to be."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"So, nearly 150 years have passed since this book has been published... and much of it has become just boring.

However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This version is Verne's original and it is the best. I love the book! Also it is nicely done, easy to read and I think probably the best version out there."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"This brilliantly crafted novel of epic proportions, tell of the adventures of Professor Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Ned Land, a Canadian harpooner, as they are held captive aboard a submarine by a mysterious man who goes under the name Captain Nemo. Although they are in a sense prisoners, they are allowed to use all the facilities aboard the submarine. This submarine, powered by nuclear energy and christened the Nautilus, is one of Verne's many brilliant predictions of modern life made throughout many of his works. This like may others was correct. Through out the book, the reader gains a vast knowledge of marine life, and the lives of people in distant lands.The book begins when Professor Pierre Aronnax, the narrator of the story, boards an American frigate commissioned to investigate a rash of attacks on international shipping by what is thought to be an amphibious monster. The supposed sea creature, which is actually the submarine Nautilus, sinks Aronnax's vessel and imprisons him along with his devoted servant Conseil and Ned Land, a temperamental harpooner. When they are returned to their senses, the find themselves inside a dark, gloomy, desolate, endless, predicament. They are locked in a cell. However they soon meet Captain Nemo who agrees to let them move about the ship freely on one condition. They must remain aboard the Nautilus. So begins a great adventure of a truly fantastic voyage from the pearl-laden waters of Ceylon to the icy dangers of the South Pole, as Captain Nemo, one of the greatest villains ever created, takes his revenge on all society.The detail that Verne pours into this book is amazing. This is one of the few books that are capable of making the readers feel that they are actually there. His descriptions of how the Nautilus operates, how Nemo's crew harvests food and his account of hunting on Hawaii are excellent, and the plot never falters. The characters are wonderfully scripted; each one having their own unique personality, and they are weaved flawlessly into the awe filled spectacle.This is the book that predicted that there would be submarines, and that submarines would eventually go to the South Pole. It predicted the development of the SCUBA suit; it even predicted nuclear powered ships. The technology used in this book makes it easy to understand even today. This book is widely recognized as a classic- in my view, correctly."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Submarines as we know them didn't exist in 1869. But Jules Verne had an almost eerily prophetic knack for knowing what technology would be used in the future -- and he put it to work in \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,\\" a slow-moving adventure tale with plenty of proto-steampunk and almost fantastical undersea life.Ships in the middle of the ocean are suddenly seeing -- and being attacked by -- \\"a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.\\"Eventually the US government sends out a ship to capture the object, and during a sea battle Professor Aronnax, his manservant Conseil and harpooner Ned Land go overboard. Soon they're picked up by the Nautilus, the vast submarine that has been causing all this trouble, and introduced to Captain Nemo -- an intelligent, charismatic man who belongs to no nation.Aronnax becomes fascinated by Nemo, his ship and his library -- as well as the amazing underwater adventures that Nemo introduces them to, like pearl-hunting and fighting a giant squid. But the captain's free, lawless life has its dark side, and the three men begin to realize that they must get away from the Nautilus no matter what.It's actually rather amazing that Jules Verne not only dreamed up the idea of a semi-modern submarine long before they existed, but thought out the applications, the stealth, and the vast size. And since nothing like the Nautilus existed at the time, there's a slightly fantastical, steampunk flavor to \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.\\"And as usual, Verne painstakingly studies everything about his imagined world, filling it with science (although he obviously didn't know about water/air pressure) and lovely descriptions of the Nautilus and the eerie underwater world (giant oysters, forests, Atlantis). The only flaw is that he tends to ramble on about exact measurements and travel details; there are boring patches here and there.But Captain Nemo is probably one of Verne's most fascinating characters -- a charismatic, embittered man who is a sort of noble sea pirate. He does some stuff that is totally unacceptable (sinking a random warship), but he also has little spurts of kindness and generosity towards poor and powerless peoples of the world. He's scary but fascinating.Giant submarines, charismatic pirates and an undersea world just waiting to be explored -- \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\" is a fascinating sci-fi classic, if you can get past the dull patches."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"this is William Robson's translation, which was published around 1853.

As the story progresses you will discover Verne's view on society in sentences like &quot;The world needs no new continents, it needs new people.&quot; As for the storyline, you will never guess what happens next. Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Jules Verne's, &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; is one of the best books I have ever read, possibly the best. The book is so easy to follow and read. The book seems to just flow as you are reading, for there are many stopping points in the book; unlike some books which contain 30 paged chapters. This book has a total of 46 chapters, none of them being more than fifteen pages long. I enjoy these kinds if books because it lets you read 5 or 6 chapters at a time, and not make you go so into extreme detail so you do not get bored. The main character, Professer Aronnax, tells the book. He is a very intelligent individual who is a Professor of Natural History in Paris during the late 1800's. He and his faithful servant, Conseil, are assigned to an expedition with many other chosen men by the French Government, including a Canadian Harpooner named Ned Land, to rid the seas of a little known and terrifying sea monster.

The worst thing about the book is the length/number of pages. It contains 371 pages and if one is wanting to read something quickly this is definitely a book that will take some time. So plan ahead and take an exciting adventure."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"The hardcover version of the Sterling edition is bound and printed nicely. Jules Verne's story is enthralling and full of detail. However, the translation in the Sterling edition is very old and can be rather tongue-twisting when read aloud. The word ordering in the sentences often reflects the original French a bit too much. Likewise, the numereous names of various flora and fauna are rendered in Latin form, rather than the more common names I'm familiar with. I've found Frederick Paul Walter's newer (and also unabridged) translation to be much easier to read:Amazing Journeys: Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Circling the Moon, 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas, and Around the World in 80 Days."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"Regular readers of [...] won't be surprised to learn that the first book I read on the Kindle was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. There's something so right about reading a century-old tale -- whose narrator is enthralled with the power of electricity -- on a device that's a pretty darn enthralling use of electricity.That said, in exploring how the image of technology and the future has changed over time, few books are as influential as this one. Some observations:1. Captain Nemo's built himself a utopia. Consider that he says the Nautilus is out of reach from tyrants and built so well that it can't be damaged by nature. Nemo says he's never been as free as when he put himself inside the sub. There's a library with nearly unlimited information. The ocean provides an unlimited amount of food. Everyone's healthy thanks to the constant temperature and fresh sea air. Electricity, described as providing light \\"more uniform and continuous than the sun\\" and behaving \\"more obedient than gas\\" provides an unlimited amount of power. Sounds like every other golden age longed for through time, but this one is all thanks to technology--and especially electricity.2. The constant use of extreme detail in the book, going on for pages and pages about what the fish look like and rattling off measurements, give the fantasy parts of the book much more credence. It's a lesson on the benefits of getting granular when selling a vision of the future.3. There's a great passage where, on behalf of science, Verne snobbily says, \\"It was Tasman who discovered this group in 1643, the year Torricelli invented the barometer and Louis XIV mounted the throne. I leave the reader to decide which of these events has been more useful to the human race.\\" This wasn't the first time an innovator scoffed at a politician, but it's certainly one of the sharpest. Food for thought for those innovation v. public policy debates that break out every so often."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I thought that the book had one of the best plot lines I've ever seen, reguardless of the fact that there is only slight building up to the climax. The only thing that I didn't think was that good about the book was that about every other page, Jules Verne would go into a paragraph description of the animals. For example, he would say something like: I just saw a tuna. But not the normal tuna, it was yellow-bellied, had dorsal fins that went at a downward angle, etc.\\" Otherwise, I thought it was a great read and well worth the money. I will be purchasing more of Jules Verne's books very soon. I highly suggest for you to read this book. Another thing, if you enjoyed watching the 1954 \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea Film,\\" I highly suggest the book because the movie only gives a small picture of what actually occurred during their submarine venture and the book tells you everything, and the occurrences are just amazing.The novel basically tells the story of Professor Arronax, Ned Land and Conseil who get taken aboard the Nautilus and experiences many adverntures, such as going to Atlantis, an underwater hunt, getting trapped in an ice block and much more."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I don't pretend to be a literary know-it-all. I know about as much about classic literature as I do about moose hunting...and that ain't much. For whatever reason, I thought it might make me a more cultured and enlightened person if I read some of the old school fiction. You know, the authors that nobody ever mentions unless you're in an English class. They may be crusty, but they're considered to have written some of the greatest novels ever.While my trek through the classics is still at its infancy, I decided to take that journey 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea that Jules Verne has been begging me to take ever since I was a wee lad. I've always noticed the various covers of this book over the years, often featuring a giant squid attacking either a submarine or some guy in an old-timey diving suit, or even both. Sometimes there's a treasure chest involved, too. It's no wonder that the book has always peaked my interest. How could you go wrong with such an inviting cover. It was about time that I figured out what was up with this Captain Nemo guy I'd always heard about.Through virtually the entire book, you have basically only four characters. Captain Nemo, of course, is the one everyone's heard of. He's the mysterious commander of an astonishing vehicle for its time, an electric submarine called The Nautilus. Professor Arronax, his servent Conseil, and Ned Land, a noted French-canadian harpooner, end up as captives aboard Nemo's strange vessel and are taken along for a voyage across the globe. The sights that they encounter are incredible. Creatures never imagined, lost treasure, undersea eruptions, and long-sunken vessels. The adventures are high ones, as they take the dangerous trip beneath the polar ice cap and even visit the lost city of Atlantis.I guess you could call it high adventure, but surprisingly, it's not all that exciting. The journey 20,000 Leagues Under the sea is a slow, plodding one. Sandwiched in between a fairly compelling beginning and ending is a wordy, overly explanatory middle filled with obscene amounts of nautical and technical jargon, yet devoid of much stimulating drama.I have no doubt that in the 1800s Jules Verne's descriptive prose awed readers to the wonders of the sea and underwater travel. In this day and age, however, the bar has been raised considerably and the story itself is very underwhelming for the modern read. The average person has been able to witness for themselves much of the stuff that Verne describes in such painstaking detail, either through television or trips to aquariums and the like. Much of the book simply isn't as extraordinary as it was 100 years ago. While the sea still holds great mystery, it's not near as foreign to us as it was back then.If you're not aroused by the technical workings of a submarine, or of the many food dishes that you can make out of sea life, there's not much else there for the average reader. The plot is more centered around situations conceived to further describe Captain Nemo's crazy contraption, The Nautilus, than it is to actually weave an interesting story. After the first few chapters, I was bored, save for a few bits here and there, until the last few chapters when it began to pick back up again.I trudged on, however, anxious to finish so I can get to the next book, hoping that it will be less yawn-inducing. If you're like me and wanting to tackle those classics, save 20,000 Leagues for the end. Pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World or War of the Worlds instead. Both are far superior. Heck, I'd even rather read Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, at least it was shorter. But like I said earlier, I'm no expert in the classics, maybe I just missed the boat, err...submarine, on this one."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"I first read this book when I was in the 5th grade. I am a big reader so I like challenging books. The beginning was a little slow and dull, but after the men were captured by the Nautilus it became MUCH more interesting.Life abord the Nautilus was quite interesting. Instead of meat (which they could not get) they ate many kinds of fish and sea plants, which, unless you were told, were indistiguishable from land- raised meat and vegetables. Thoguh they were prisoners, the doctor and his friends were treated like guests. They had many great adventures before finaly escaping.All in all, very good.

The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done.

The United States Government sends Professor Arronnax out to sea on the ship called the Abraham Lincoln to search for the monster. Professor Arronnax and his servant, Conseil, set out on the adventure.Professor Arronnax soon learns that the monster is really a steel-plated submarine, called the Nautilus. The Nautilus crashes into their ship and Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ned, a harpooner, fall into the water and are captured by Captain Nemo. On the Nautilus, Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted watch Captain Nemo as he explores the under water world. On the Nautilus they visit many places including the lost continent of Atlantis, the South Pole and the Great Ice Barrier. They search for treasure and have fights with unfriendly sea creatures. Captain Nemo, however, rams the Nautilus into other ships when they get into his way. Nemo rams the Nautilus into a war ship one day because he believes the people on the ship are responsible for killing his family and taking everything away from him that he loves. Professor Arronnax realizes that Captian Nemo is crazy and that they must escape. Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted plan their escape only to learn that the Nautilus was caught up in the Maelstrom, the most violent whirlpool in the world. No ship had ever escaped the current of the Maelstrom! Do Professor Arronnax, Conseil and Ted escape the Nautilus and the violent whirlpool or do they drown in the whirlpool and sink to the bottom of the sea?I chose to read this book because I like adventure books and this certainly has adventure and excitement in it.

He is certainly a master in mixing scientific facts with literary fiction. A true visionary. Although I have seen various movie versions, I was still surprised at some of the events in this story. The book seemed to move along well besides a relatively slow begining. It has everything a great story should have. Mystery, adventure, action, exotic locations and even a bit of romance, albeit it is with Nemo and the Sea.This particular version was an &quot;audio book&quot; performed by Harlan Ellison. His narration was inspired. I also enjoyed his voice characterizations, especially the impersonation of James Mason's Captain Nemo. It had a reminiscent quality. Music and sound effects would have been a nice touch as long as it wouldn't be distracting. For me, the book ended too quickly. I wanted to hear more of their adventures and would have also liked to have read more about Nemo's past. Although, Verne does tell us more in &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;.

Depending on a period and country, even a incontroversial author like Jules Verne suffered from closed-mindedness. That totalitarian regimes see fit to burn books, or to actively block publication and distribution of some books, in hope that the nation will not see the uneasy point of view often expressed in books - that fact does not surprise anyone anymore nowadays. But that such practices have been utilized in the land of the free and the brave - makes us wonder how different these two systems are. What had poor Verne done to deserve censorship? \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" was censored prior to publication, and the original manuscript never saw the day during Verne's lifetime. Against his will the author had to cut the social commentary from his trilogy, of which this novel is the first volume. By today's standards, the punishment was incomparable to the guilt, but even then it was disturbing that a work of fiction, a splendid tale of adventure written for the purpose of entertainment and education of the reader, not a political pastiche, mind you, had to have been censored. In particular, the crucial part of the novel had been cut, one in which we learn what were the origins of Captain Nemo, his motivations and heritage. Only years later, after Verne's death, the original manuscript was published, to reveal that Verne originally intended Nemo to have been a Polish nobleman, who escaped his Vaterland after the failure of the 1863 uprising against the Russian Empire. Nemo decided to remove himself from the society, literally from human view - by constructing the famous Nautilus, a submarine, in which he cruised the tranquil abyss of the oceans, where no hand would touch him, and where he wouldn't have to stand the pettiness and cruelty of his fellow human beings.Thus, if you happened to have read the censored version, you would be genuinely puzzled as to the motivations of the Captain. Today, many abridged versions of Verne's novels appear in print, where most of the content is done away with, and what is left is the bare-bones action storyline. To mutilate the book in this way is to commit an unforgivable crime in general, and to hurt the author and readers in particular. \\"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\\" deserves to be widely read just as it had been intended by the author, with its wealth of scientific and prophetic information left untouched, with the commentaries and philosophical musings intact. Only then, within the grand context, the adventure makes sense, only then it is art. I have read this novel circa twenty times; I have admired Captain Nemo for years; I have held my breath in the depths of the Golfstr&ouml;m in the Norwegian Sea during the storm, and during many thrilling moments in the book, not to mention the unforgettable conclusion of the novel; I have tried to solve the mystery of the waterborne ship made of steel, with its many complicated instruments; I have followed the arguments hurled between the Captain and the involuntary passengers of the Nautilus; and finally, I was trembling all over whenever I reached the culmination of the adventure. Verne was a genius, and Captain Nemo was his most original character creation, one I am very fond of for personal reasons, as is I am sure the case with many other readers of the prophetic French author."},{"Title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Thorndike Press Large Print Perennial Bestsellers Series)","review":"THIS IS A CLASSIC THIS IS A CLASSIC.

The story is a 1st person meta narrative concerning his meeting with the poetess Elizabeth Smart, the subsequent abandoment of his then pregnant wife, and so on. Dead Seagull is one of those odd, pratically unknown books that will strike you mercilessly with its unparalleled poetic pyrotechniques , relentless and uncompromised honesty,all written with the hand of a masterpoet in a state of delirium. Barker is truly one of the unknown poetic giants of 20th century English prose, (as well , the poetess Elizabeth Smart, who is the focus of Dead Seagull). Why was a talent of this stature passed over by the general reading public? Perhaps the reason is that while much of Barkers poetic and literary technique follows the conventional metre of the period, his obsevations and expression are purely individual, and beholding to no-one, on a topic where society demands a rigourous attention to conventionality. READ THIS BOOK. Also read this novels subject, Elizabeth Smart's equally dazzling 'BY GRAND CENTRAL STATION I LAY DOWN AND WEPT'. You will be astounded that these works are not central to any discussion of mid 20th century poetic literature. The surpise and curiousness that works of this calibre, on par with any ot the great or greatest literature of the modern age, can lay pratically unknown beneath the waters of the general top 20 newspaper book lists, will only be surpassed by your amazement of the blinding talent suggested by this novel, and E.Smarts corresponding novel (incidently, as Barker scrys Smart and her mythological element, so scrys Smart...these two novels are as convenient as they are breathtaking).

His novel the Dead Seagull brings to mind all the things that make good writer great: Fierce intellect, vivid imagery, a distinct and unparallelled criticism on the very nature of love and its long lasting effects on the human soul, and a self-deprecating narrative that reminds one of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Notes from the Underground. The language is effortless, confident, and a thing of sheer beauty. Anyone concerned with becoming a writer must make The Dead Seagull an essential prerequisite. Elizabeth Smart whose By Grand Central Station I Sat down and wept is also an amazing and perhaps opposing perspective on several of the most imperative aspects of the human condition such as remorse, survival, and ultimately Love. Together these masterpieces make a pair of near cosmic importance. I find it purely criminal that some of the most amazing writers and poets are conscripted to a near legionary languish that is only defeated by those weapons known by most as Ignorance and Anonymity...To recapitulate: George Barker, interpersonal relations aside, is a wordsmith to be venerated...and feared."},{"Title":"Portes Ouvertes: An Interactive Multimedia Approach to First Year French (French Edition)","review":"This text is French instruction gone berserk. Students will have to go through so much visual junk and marginally relevant contextualizing that they may be exhausted by the time they actually get to any substance. There are dozens of typefaces and colors, formats, sections, subsections, boxes, icons, references to tapes, to videos, to CD's, differently colored backgrounds and edge shadings, ad infinitum, to say nothing of pages of full color pictures of smiling multicultural young people and so on which intellectually impoverished American students are presumed to require in order to &quot;relate&quot; to the material. The book is supposed to be a totally integrated multimedia approach to teaching French, based on people in a city (Besancon) in France. I wonder how many French instructors succumb to handing over classroom hours to passively sitting and looking at the videos around which so much of the text is based rather than stressing needed drill and interactive instruction? Why couldn't the video-based sections have been broken out as a separate text for teachers who want it, so that students wouldn't have to sprain their wrists and pocketbooks lugging around so much irrelevant material? But it is clear that all this packaging isn't really intended to benefit students anyway; rather, it is aimed at textbook selection committees. Look at the very first page of the book: a flow chart, in extra thick paper, showing how carefully edited the manuscript is. Is this useful to the students who had to purchase this flowchart? Where is the table of contents? If the student wants to look up where something is discussed, he or she will have to leaf through pages of flow charts, prefaces, maps, dedications and so on to an indeterminate section about an eighth of an inch into this massive hunk of marketing to find it. Want the index? Well, you have to ignore the four pages of credits in big type at the back of the book (how else inflate the page count and price heft of the product?). In my opinion, a French text ought to contain grammar and exercises to learn it. All the rest can be brought in optionally. Maybe it's time to start going back in that direction. One can only hope that this dinosaur is the end point of a trend destined for extinction."},{"Title":"Portes Ouvertes: An Interactive Multimedia Approach to First Year French (French Edition)","review":"I've attempted to use this book to teach first year French, and ended up spending obscene amounts of time supplementing it with personal materials so my students will have SOME idea of what things like relative pronouns, compound tenses, and locutions triggering the subjunctive are. The students HATED the daher exercises, the CD crashed all computers at the language lab, and the kids ended up frustrated, linguitically stunted, and angry about the monumental amount of money they had to spend on a worthless textbook. The book is a travesty, and is sure to damage any students subjected to it in place of real language instruction. Multimedia for multimedia's sake is just damned stupid, and has no place in a thinking, caring faculty: as a teacher and someone who wants the best for my students, I would NEVER touch this book again."},{"Title":"Portes Ouvertes: An Interactive Multimedia Approach to First Year French (French Edition)","review":"I have used this book througout college and I have found it to be the easiest to use out of all of the books I have looked at and tried using. Vocabulary they present is useful in real life settings, and the grammer explinations are complete and easy to comprehend."},{"Title":"Ladyhawke","review":"The book delves in to the emotions of the characters so much more than the movie. I read the book first and loved it. The movie didn't hold my interest and so much of the story was lost in the translation. This is a fantabulous piece of fiction."},{"Title":"Ladyhawke","review":"I have only seen parts of the movie, which is why i wanted to read this book. Joan Vinge is an excellent writer and, in my opinion, adds to this beautiful tale of forbidden romance. I can't say whether you'll enjoy it as much as the movie because i don't know, but it really gives one a sense of the emotions drive the characters. The epilog is an amusing and quaint surprise as well."},{"Title":"Ladyhawke","review":"I always enjoy the extra scenes, character thoughts, etc that can be found in a book vs a movie. This book delivers those extra moments."},{"Title":"Ladyhawke","review":"It's the adaptation of the screenplay for the movie of the same name. It was a rather cut and dried exposition. It just described what went on in the movie without adding much more depth to it. It was probably done from a different version of the script, because there were minor differences from the movie. All in all I was rather disappointed with it."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is vintage Alton Brown. For example, on page 43 you can find these words....\\"Gelatin contains eighteen different amino acids joined in sequence to form polypeptide chains called 'primary structure.' Now, three of these polypetide chains join in a left-handed spiral creating the secondary structure while in the tertiary structure the spiral winds and folds itself into a right-handed spiral, which results in a rod-shaped molecule known as the protofibril.\\" ---- I kid you not!Now, if you're like me, this is great stuff. Alton takes the complexities of baking (which is unforgiving compared to merely cooking) and explains why various ingredients and processes work or fail. I am an accomplished cook, but could never produce great baked goods before reading this book. I have now had success with more than a dozen of his great recipies and basked in the warmth of praise from my family and friends! In fairness, AB does admit that a lot of the information in his book is useless to the home baker.So if you're not like me, and just want to bake some really \\"good eats\\" from the oven without all the scientific explanations, skip the first 90 pages or so and just jump into the recipies. They'll work fine, if you follow them religiously and make no substitutions. Indeed, the ones I've made are the best I've ever eaten. Hands down.But if you enjoy AB's sense of humor and wit, at least give the opening sections a look-see. I'd love to spend some time with this man. He must be a hoot in person.Oh yeah, the book is divided into easy to understand \\"methods\\" for creating the five types of baked goods AB has identified as a grouping plan for all things from the oven (a few recipies can be done on the range top). These logical taxonomies teach how \\"food x mixing + heat = baking\\" to produce the best darned grub you've ever had. In short, good eats!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I really hated giving this book a one star rating because I've been a big fan of Mr. Brown for years. I've made several of his recipes from his show Good Eats, and I've ate up every single detail of food science and history he's ever offered. However, I feel that he really \\"phoned it in\\" on this one. Yes, this book contains some excellent scientific explanations about baking that are handy to know, but half of my expectations about this book were the recipes. Specifically, his bread recipes were not very well tested. I've attempted his Whole Wheat bread and Everyday bread recipe in this book several times. After carefully weighing each ingredient and precisely following every direction, I was disappointed by the batter-like mass at the bottom of my mixer bowl. Yes, it's easy to blame a cookbook when a dish turns out bad, but I've wasted several hours of my time and money reattempting these recipes only to be met with failure. Moreover, I've come to the conclusion that the bread starter recipes call for way too much liquids, which is causing the bread dough abomination at the bottom of my mixer bowl.I would also like to add that the recipes are sometimes presented in a very complicated manner (I'm looking at you, Brioche recipe, which is located on pages 240 to 248. His elaborations on this recipe were completely unnecessary). The irony here is that AB lists in this very book a famous Einstein quote which states \\"Things should be as simple as possible, but not any simpler.\\"I'd probably give this another star if there was some sort of official forum for discussing and troubleshooting a recipe contained within his book [...]. Heck, I'd even settle for AB's email address so I could at least get some recipe corrections."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"When this book first came out it had so many errors that it was recalled and reprinted and supposedly corrected. (Or so I read on a message board). I own the 2nd printing.I really like Alton Brown. I admire and respect him. I think he's a wonderful person (I've met him), a great educator, and a good cook. But this book makes me embarrassed for him. I have the version that is supposedly \\"corrected\\". Yet each time I make a recipe there are so many mistakes I'm scared to make another. I've made the bread recipes and each and every one has \\"issues\\". I have written myself a note in the book to not make any more recipes but to use the book as a reference and a learning tool. As a \\"why does this happen\\" book, it's great. If you make any of the recipes, proceed with caution. The Focaccia recipe on page 260 is great, if you add an extra cup of water. Eat is right out of the oven. Yum!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"If you are an Alton Brown fan, like me, you must have this book. Not only does it provide clear explanations and illustrations for you to keep of the many things he explains on his show, but it also encapsulates his own unique and quirky brand of humor. Unlike so many other cookbooks, this one is a great pleasure to read. I can sit down and read this book like a novel, just for the enjoyment of it. The book, of course, contains good explanations of how and why things work and makes it all seem so simple that OF COURSE you must try it; all delivered in his wry, tongue-in-cheek style. This is a must-own book, get yours today!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I don't generally buy cookbooks, the Mennonite Community Cookbook being the exception, since it's the food I grew up on (it's a cookbook I highly recommend), but when you find a cookbook that spends the first quarter of the book explaining the science behind baking, down to a discussion of the molecular structure of flour, it's hard to resist. I'm a big fan of Alton Brown's Food Network show, Good Eats, both for it's style (the guy was a cinematographer, he set out to make a cooking show that was entertaining as well as informative), and because it explains the \\"why\\" behind cooking. Cooking is chemistry, and when you start thinking of it that way, suddenly it all makes sense. For example, for years I've wanted to try my hand at candy making, but my mom would always tell me that it was too much trouble because you had to be careful or you'd end up with grainy candy (not good). I still wanted to try, but because I thought it would be trouble, I never had sufficient motivation to give it a go. Well, then I watch the candy episode of Good Eats, he points out that what you're doing when you make candy is working with supersaturated sugar solutions, and suddenly candy making was demystified and now it makes perfect sense why candy can get grainy and how to avoid that from happening (don't introduce any seed crystals or poof, it will all crystalize instantly). In the book, he introduces a basic recipe for the baking technique he's covering in that chapter, explains how the techinque works using that recipe, and then follows with a series of other recipes using the same technique. The book is worth it just for the understanding of baking alone, not to mention the recipes. It's simple enough that if you know nothing about baking, it will explain it to you step by step, but if you already are a good baker, you'll still learn new things. Brown's first book I'm Just Here for the Food, looks handy too, from the time I spent looking at it in the store. It teaches some of the basics of cooking, so it would be especially useful for someone who's clueless in the kitchen. They'd also be good for homeschoolers, especially for the reluctant science student, or for home ec. And, in any case, you can't go wrong with a cookbook that on top of all that, names a recipe \\"Cheesy Poofs\\" in reference to South Park, and makes a Pulp fiction references, among other pop culture references--if nothing else, it's not a boring cookbook. If nothing else, from what I learned from the book, I'll be able to adapt my grandmother's cookie recipes into a format that anybody can follow, which will be good because I hate to see those lost to future generations."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"\\"I'm Just Here For More Food\\" is a wonderful book that explains baking through science, in a funny manner, by none other than Alton Brown!Alton Brown is the creator of the Food Network's \\"Good Eats\\", as well as the author of two other books. He used to be a director of commercials and music videos, but his passion for food took over, and sent Brown and his wife to Vermont, where he attended culinary school. Upon completion, he decided to use his media experience and make a cooking show that was entertaining and educational.By analyzing the process of baking through science, Alton Brown creates wonderful baked goods. His recipes are easy-to-read, easy-to-prepare, and the scientific reasoning behind each process makes so much sense. Knowing what is happening when I am making cookies helps when I am preparing a family favorite recipe and modifying it from Alton Brown's study!Like Alton Brown's previous books, there are no color photographs, but rather, sketches and side notes hinting at Alton Brown's witty sense of humor seen on his television show.You have to try the cherry scones! They are fantastic!This is another fantastic book by Alton Brown, and should be added to your collection!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I learned cooking by watching my mother and grandmother. I cooked the same way for years, with the same family recipes.A year ago a I learned about Alton Brown from friends, and watched an episode. I was immediately hooked by a cooking show in a way that only Father Dominic and the Two Fat Ladies have been able to hook me before.Within weeks my entire approach to cooking had changed, and I began to realize that I could make small changes to the old recipes and methods that would make them even better, and now I'm sharing my newly learned techniques with mom, and dad heartily approves.All of this is a long way of saying that you should buy this book, and every other one that Alton Brown has written. The recipe layout can be a little difficult getting used to, and some of the techniques may add a bit of time and bother (mirpoix? why should I bother making a mirpoix?), but the extra effort is well worth it."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"The first thing I attempted to bake out of this book was the pillow bread recipe. Read the philosophy, tool requirements, got stuff together - done. Bread rose. Wonderful! Bread baked. Not so wonderful. Was actually quite raw in the middle. This was intensely disappointing. I re-read the directions. Yep - everything is where when and how it should be. I look back at the reviews and hello! There are typos in this book. I thought it kinda weird that I should cook a great huge loaf of bread for no more than 25 minutes, most especially when my other bread recipes call for 40 minutes on much smaller loaves. I do not think this is Mr. Brown's fault. I do think it is the suspicious typo drama. Mr. Brown's other book is magic. No worries right off, wonderful food. The roasting methods are particularly accurate and pleasing. This book was a huge bummer. Perhaps if I had tried a recipe sans typo, I would not be typing this review. Oh well. I will forgive Mr. Brown if another edition comes out that redacts the terrible typos. Until then it's Martha Stewart and me, again."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I bought this book for my wife as a Christmas gift last year. We both absolutely love it. How many books explain in illustrate the science behind making \\"cheesy-poofs\\"? Alton has written yet another cookbook that puts complex culinary concepts in an easy to read and understand format. Great (and comical) pictures are spread throughout the book. Highly recommended for those who love to understand the \\"why\\" when working in the kitchen (or just love interesting goofy cookbooks)."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I picked up this book just because I love AB, but wasn't too sure what to expect. I thought at the very least I'd get some good recipes since I'm a pretty lousy baker (my son's b-day cakes were a prime example of my lack of skills in this department) and I NEEDED to learn more. The first chapter I found a little tedious. I mean, why do I need to know all this stuff about protein, starches, etc? Boy, am I glad that I stuck with it since this chap. really was the foundation for the rest of the book. Just after reading \\"The muffin method\\" I was able to modify what I used to think was a pretty good muffin recipe (it was really a cupcake) into an outstanding one! I took the\`modified version with me to church and had tons of people ask for the recipe. I had never had that happen with a homemade baked good of mine!I already finished reading the whole book and I am much better baker because of it. And I've also learned that I actually ENJOY baking, unlike before when I used to dread it. I still have lots to learn but baking is no longer intimidating.I definitely recommend this book to anyone who's not really sure where to start with baking as well as those that want to know all the mechanics behind it and what each ingredient contributes to the overall product (even if they are good bakers already). This book can only help you improve even if you are a seasoned baker!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I really loved this book by Alton Brown.

He started learning with Frugal Gourmet and I did also, \\"even though the \\"Frug. has a past the man could teach\\". Alton Brown has a simplistic approach to cooking and that's the way I like it! You will find the major portion of my reviews rate the product high.

Brown has not only compiled several recipes in this book, but he has also taken the time to explain the cooking process. Brown has always taken a scientific approach to explain cooking on both his television show and in his books. There are a lot of fascinating facts, background information and sidebars that are normally not found in cookbooks. For example, Brown spent a lot of time explaining the egg because the book is primarily focused on baking. He goes into great detail to describe the anatomy, quality and role of an egg in cooking. He even describes the best way to crack an egg and why.Brown has provided recipes for many popular baked goods such as chocolate chip cookies, pound cake and pie crust. The ingredient quantities are listed by both weight and volume. The recipes are step by step and easy to follow. There are also diagrams throughout the book to illustrate techniques such as cutting cake layers and lining a pan with parchment paper.I recommend this book is for anyone who wants to learn more about the process of cooking. The book is appropriate for both the novice and the experienced cook."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Alton Brown is known for his keen attention to detail. Obviously someone failed to pay attention in the making of this book. I cannot believe this was allowed to the general public before a more thourough check was done.I have owned this book for 6-8 months now and have had mixed results. Some recipes are excellent and then there are others that just don't work. I tried and tried to make the brownie recipe with nothing working. Come to find out there are about 10 recipes in this book that were written with wrong ingredients or measurements were wrong/left out. How frustrating! I rather enjoy Alton's show, although I could do without him on Iron Chef, but someone should have gotten fired over this book. Search elsewhere if you are looking for a good baking book. I would suggest The Professional Pastry Chef by Bo Friberg or The Simple Art of Perfect Baking by Flo Braker as excellent reference books."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"True to form, Alton Brown provides an educational culinary journey in his newest cookbook. Laden with witty-humor, he diligently demystifies the world of baking. He provides the science-based explanations (although repetitive and tedious at times - and this is coming from a biology teacher!) in easy-to-understand terms and analogies. He classifies recipes by technique - his focus is to teach you the method, and then apply the method. Once you learn the basics, the foundations if you will, you can build upon them. That's the best part of this book I think - you really learn what it means to cream, to not overmix, etc. The recipes are practical - they won't break the budget, and they won't send you on a frustrating ingredient hunt only to come up short. He demystifies the world of vanilla extracts - and doesn't make you feel like a poor, unrefined schlub for not using William-Sonoma's finest for every recipe. He provides a voice of encouragement - like the little engine who could. It's nice to know that even accomplished chefs experience frustrations and that not every recipe they attempt turns out perfectly the first time. He encourages learning from your mistakes, and successes. He shows the evolution of his recipes. Don't most things get better with time? He provides many insightful tips that even \\"accomplished bakers\\" (read - my mother) didn't know. I feel like a much better baker after going through this book, and highly recommend it to the novice and experienced cook alike.My only major complaint is that there are a lot of typos in this book. Many are subtle and inconsequential (for example, the element nickel is misspelled). But I sometimes wonder how that translates over to the recipes. I have yet to encounter problems with the products though. Some people may be put off by his style of recipe writing - it is very similar to a formula...and people who feel more at home with Betty Crocker style recipe writing may be a little uncomfortable. But I think after you get past the old-school notions of how a recipe/cookbook should look, you'll find that these are readable and useable."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"\\"Update 8/20/07: recipe corrections -http://www.goodeatsfanpage.com/ABFP/ijhfmf.htmAlton Brown is known for the unconventional. Yet instead of being heretical he always makes you wonder why you weren't doing it his way in the first place. This book is a fine example of that. Organizing by mixing method is not new. Complete devotion to it is. Carrot cake a problem for you? Maybe it's because you never thought of it as a muffin. AB keeps drilling in and underscoring the importance of this type of classification to make you a better baker. I love that he refused to repeat the mixing directions for each recipe. Learn them or if you must, use the nifty flaps to remind you.As with \\"I'm Just Here for the Food,\\" the material is dense, but he tries to make it digestible, pun intended. Quirky drawings and humor do their part. This book is for the curious baker; there's a lot of science here. It works better in the TV show, but the book is still accessible. There is a large number of recipes and they are pretty versatile.I wouldn't buy the book for a novice cook, unless I knew he/she was into food science. I think it's great for the intermediate or advanced baker.

If you're interested in science and cooking, it's a great combination, giving you lots of background information on why things work. Most cookbooks are only a step-by-step formula for making a list of things, assuming you're patient and precise enough to get the recipe correct. Alton Brown shows more of how things work, which helps not only to improve ease of making existing recipes, but also adapting, modifying, or creating recipes.This book isn't a textbook or primer for those trying to learn baking.

There's so much in here that you would have a lot of trouble picking up on your own, let alone from one single book.Everything in here is a gem such as his equipment recommendations and his explanations of seemingly unimportant tasks (e.g: sifting). His journey from pizza dough to brioche is not to be missed!I've only made a few recipes so far: Old-school muffins, chocolate muffins, banana bread, and carrot cake. I'm saving everything else for when I get my Kitchenaid pro 600 which is coming tomorrow. (another AB recommendation.)Both the carrot cake and banana bread have gotten me \\"That's the best I've ever had\\" comments. The chocolate muffins came out a little too dry, and the old-school muffins were decent.The only gripe I probably have with the book is that every recipe seems to require I get \\"just one more piece\\" of equipment. It seems like I can't make a recipe until I buy all the requisite pieces. I'm actually a little blown away by how much I've spent on baking equipment in the past few weeks with this book.Also, sometimes Alton will be very specific describing one aspect of a recipe, but gloss over some other obscure parts which can sometimes be confusing.Buy it now!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is Alton Brown's third major culinary book, and it is, I believe, the best of the three. Alton successfully apples his scientific approach to baking, but he has done the ultimate scientific task of illuminating great explanations of baking techniques by classifying them by mixing method. Alton has compounded this insight with a novel device in the design of his book that prints the \`master recipe' for the eight mixing methods on flyleaves that can be folded over pages to appear beside the details of the individual recipes. Many major cookbook writers, most notably Julia Child, have employed the \`master recipe' device to good effect. So, this device is not totally new, but the flyleaf I have simply never seen in any other cookbook, so I give full credit to Alton and his Stewart Tabori & Chang publishers for creating something new under the culinary sun.Just as the master recipe technique is not new, the proper classification of baking techniques is also not entirely new. Good writers on baking have been grouping quick breads with pastry crusts and cheesecake with custard pies for a generation. What Alton has done is similar to Mendeleev's achievement in building the periodic table of the elements. Before Mendeleev, chemists were all very familiar with families of elements corresponding to horizontal and vertical clusters in the full table. It was obvious that fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine had a lot in common. Mendeleev gave us the organization that brought out all those similarities. This was a stepping stone to the early atomic theories which identified electron rings that went on to explain periodic table behavior. This explanation of why different mixing methods give different end products is at the heart of Brown's contribution to the literature on baking. None of this is new. Great baking writers such as Flo Braker, Nick Malgieri, Sheri Yard, Peter Reinhart, Joe and Gayle Ortiz, and Shirley Corriher have been writing about this stuff for years. Alton does the true scientist's job of tying it all together.I am just a bit suspicious of the fact that there is no bibliography and there are no acknowledgments to baking writers in the book, as I sense a strong family resemblance between Alton's book and Sherry Yard's recent excellent book \`The Secrets of Baking'. The difference is that Sherry is a world class baker who happens to have a knack for explaining. Alton is a journeyman baker who has a genius for classification. If science and AB's jabbering about using a food processor to sift flour doesn't interest you, you can do much worse than to get Yard's work.The eight mixing methods which are the heart of the book are for muffins (soft chemically leavened quickbreads), biscuits (scones, grunts, dumplings, crackers, streusel), pie crusts (a variation on the biscuit method), creaming (cakes, cookies, brownies, bran muffins), straight dough (yeast breads, including pizza, brioche, focaccia, and all those other things the French and Italians do so well), egg foam (meringues, souffles, angel food cake), custards (quiches, caramels, zabaglione, mousse, cheesecake), and miscellaneous (mostly pate a choux). The high point in all these chapters for me is the exercise that shows the underlying similarity between pizza dough and brioche. On the surface, they seem quite different, but by a series of demonstrations, AB shows how they really use the same basic method and differ only by the change of a few major ingredients such as butter, eggs, and milk.In practical terms, the most valuable part of the book is the excellent illustrations of really great techniques, done with well-chosen words and very effective line drawings. I have seen AB do his rolling a pie crust in a plastic bag trick and the next procedure of fitting a crust to a 9 inch pie tin, but I have never had the guts to try it using nothing but my memory of a scene from \`Good Eats'. Seeing it all in black and white and color gives me the courage to try it now.Alton is a great exponent of both metric measurements and of weighing in place of volumetric measurements. I cannot agree with him more completely. In spite of being a klutz around most things manual, I am a very good novice baker because I was a professional chemist and can sling kilograms and milliliters with the best of them, and, I have great practical experience with making accurate measurements. So, if you are unfamiliar with metric measurements and weights, I can testify to their efficacy. Once you get used to them, they are really easier and give a greater chance of good results.I was also pleasantly surprised to see recipe amounts written in the form of formulas, as a professional baker may use. If you are familiar with Joe Ortiz' \`The Village Baker' or Peter Reinhart's \`Crust & Crumb', these should be very familiar to you. The best part of these recipes is they give all major components measured by volume and both metric and English weights.I must say that many people will not bother to read this book unless I assure you that all of AB's classic humor is here to be enjoyed. This mix of self-deprecation, scorning ignorance, and obscure pop culture references is eminently entertaining. I challenge you to find the rather cleverly hidden reference to the movie \`Blade Runner' hidden among the Star Wars references and Waffle Iron recommendations.If I were to take issue with anything in the book, it would be the analogy between baking and architecture and the elevation of classification as the ultimate role of science. Baking in theory is much more like chemistry than it is like taxonomy and baking in practice is much more like metallurgy than like architecture.Otherwise, this book is a hoot I will check out Nick Malgieri or Flo Brakker for a new baking recipe, but I wouldn't miss this book for the world to help me make sense of it all."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I'm a huge Alton Brown fan, so I wish I could give his book 5 stars and rave endlessly about everything he does. Alas, this book has its shortcomings, but if you understand them, it's definitely worth the purchase.The editorial errors are endless and frustrating. The recipe fixes were available online on Alton's site, but the last time I checked his new site, they hadn't shown up. The page with the changes was still available, but was not linked to his new home page. You can find them online with a quick search--one of the easiest ways is to input the mysterious \\"tk\\" found in the brownie recipe with other good key words. There are some inconsistencies where he seems to contradict himself from section to section of the book, and some vagaries in a few of the recipes can be frustrating if you don't have a lot of experience in the kitchen.That being said, I wouldn't go without this book. I've always been great at improvising with food, because I go off of taste and adjust and play--not so with baking, because all the leavenings and ratios can seem like a mysterious formula. I'm not making up new baking recipes, but with the great science and explanations that Alton gives, I can now take a baking recipe and adjust it to how I like it without throwing it off so it no longer works. The whys and the hows and the science still can't be beat--that's all classic Alton. I love the cracker recipes and my son calls Alton's pancakes from this book his favorite pancakes of all time. I changed the 'base' of the chicken dumpling recipe, because we prefer a thicker--more gravy-- base than broth, but the dumplings themselves were heavenly. We were so content after the meal that we were seriously contemplating if world peace could be achieved if everyone sat down together and had a dish--Don't buy this book for the recipes, but definitely enjoy the recipes within. The techniques learned will make all of your other baking endeavors so much better."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Alton Brown's new book \\"I'm Just Here for More Food : Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking\\" is just as great as his first one \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\". Once again Alton Brown doesn't only tell you what to do he tells you WHY you do something in a recipe. He teaches you techniques and applications, giving you the tools to create your own recipes. A normal cookbook gives you detailed instructions you follow like a robot. Alton Brown's cookbooks instruct you how to achieve a type of cooking (or in the case of this book baking) result. Knowing the how and why of doing something allows you the freedom to apply what you learn creatively. There are plenty of great recipes in this book but they should be used to understand the technique primarily.I say this with all honesty...both of Alton Brown's cookbooks are MUST haves for any aspiring chef. They are superb teaching tools. They are a great gift for someone who wants to learn how to cook.Highly, highly recommended!!!!!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Have a first printing of this book.... and very, very mad at it. Sure, it's great, explinations are wonderful, love the layout of the book... but they must have spent so much time on all that, and overlooked the recipes. The errors in this book make me very disappointed. I write instructions for a living, and totally wrong ingredient lists and instructions are inexcusable, for any cookbook and more so for something with Alton Brown's name on it. The first recipe I tried out of this was the pizza dough, which was so filled with errors (that I learned after the fact) that it was a disaster. If you do buy this book, check out AB's website after you get it and make sure to correct everything you need to."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is a beautiful, informative, and engaging book, but beware the pizza dough recipe.It calls for 8 cups of flour instead of 4. This was the first recipe I tried and let's just say it wasn't a nice thing to do to my brand new KitchenAid mixer. I had to consult another cookbook to fix the pizza dough. I later found AB's website and LIST OF CORRECTIONS. Subsequently, I have used AB's corrected recipe a couple more times and it's the best dough I have made, compared to other cookbooks I have. As mentioned by another reviewer, do check out all the corrections before proceeding, (and so you don't have to use AB's esoteric Vitamin C source in the pizza dough recipe.)What I got from the book was a greater understanding of which methods were appropriate for which type of baking product. I've found this useful when following recipes from other cookbooks. Both of AB's books have helped me to cook more flexibly, sometimes winging it, because I know what the ingredient or process is meant to do and can make appropriate substitutions.If you give this book as a gift, make sure to mention that corrections are available on AB's website."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Alton's a teacher so except to read to learn. If you're already a baker, you might learn some stuff you never knew before. But this book is aimed at those of us who wonder why our cheesecake never turns out just right (cause it's a custard, not a cake).He groups his baking not in the traditional way but by the way the dough or batter is mixed. Here's the break down:First he discusses details in baking such as the ingredients that go into baking, the need for precise measurements (you better weigh them), what protein, carbs, eggs, flour, water, etc. are and how they work in the baked good, what you can and can't influence in cooking and other similar broad topics.He sees all baking falling into the following 6 methods based on how they are mixed with some sample examples:The Muffin Method(ex: muffins, cookies, banana bread, pancakes, waffles, hush puppies, etc.)The Biscuit Method(ex: biscuits, scones, dumplings, streusel)with a Pie Variation (pie dough, cobbler)The Creaming Method(ex: cake, brownies, cookies, tarts)The Straight Dough Method(ex: pizza, rolls, brioche, focaccia)The Egg Foam Method(ex: meringue pie crust, souffl&eacute;)The Custards(ex: custards, pudding, curd, mousse)He notes that this will put some things together in one group that are traditionally grouped differently.The rest of the book is divided into those methods with a last section for the left-over processes: crepes, popovers and pate a choux.In each section he delves into what make that mixing method unique and hopefully, once you understand that, you can better make the types of baked goods under that heading.He has a unique way of presenting his recipes, kind of a notation scientists might make. Think Excel and you'll understand. He gives measurements in Metric and English units (and he also includes volume equivalents because he thinks no one would by the book if his recipes didn't include volumes; everything should be weighed, he says.)It's very nicely laid out and has the same kind of graphics, fonts and design as the previous books. It's a fresh approach to a topic a lot of us have trouble with."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is clearly the choice if you are looking for a book to teach basic baking techniques, especially if you are interested in knowing why you do certain things. It is much easier and fun to read than Cookwise, wich is also an excellent book...but more like a textbook. This, on the other hand, is one part comic book, one part game show, and three parts just plain good eats. Great book."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Well, this would be a really interesting cook book if the editors and author had done their editing jobs. The mistakes make several recipes impossible to make unless you look up the corrected recipes online- some of which don't even resemble the recipe in the book. For example, the brownie recpe in the book calls for steeping the cocoa- but gives you no volume of the water (\\"tk\\" is not a volume measure). However, when you spend some time searching the web for the corrected recipe and finally find it, there is no steeping of the cocoa at all! That's a MAJOR error- not just a typo. If you want this book, wait until it is re-edited... or buy something else."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I've now read from cover to cover Harold McGee's \\"On Food and Cooking: the Science and Lore of the Kitchen,\\" Shirley Corriher's \\"Cookwise,\\" and Alton Brown's three books \\"I'm Just Here for the Food,\\" \\"I'm Just Here for More Food,\\" and \\"Gear for Your Kitchen\\" (the three of which I will count as one book for purposes of this review). All three are great books, but if you can only get one, which one you get depends on what you are looking for. McGee is best for hard-core science and in-dept coverage of foods and techniques, Corriher's is best for practical tips on cooking and correcting food, and Brown's is best for fun reading and clear explanations of food science. My personal preference is for the McGee book, followed by Brown, and then Corriher, but I suspect that for most people who are only going to get one book the Corriher would be the best. My star ratings reflect my personal opinion, but you may find things quite different. Here then are the pluses and minuses of each of the books and who they are best suited for:MCGEE:McGee's book is by far the most complete reference, but it is also the most dense and technical of the three. The book covers pretty much everything that people anywhere in the world consider food including meat, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruit, herbs, fungi, legumes, tea, coffee, grains, alcohol, sugar, sauces, etc. Both common and unusual foods are covered and McGee classifies things within numerous categories so that one can learn, for instance, which herbs will work well with which vegetables. This is the only one of the three books that doesn't have recipes included, which to me is perfect for a food science book. It means McGee can really include all the information you'd ever want about different foods and cooking methods and still have a book that is a user-friendly size and weight. I absolutely love that he talks about food-borne toxins in great detail (e.g., infectious and toxin-producing microbes in seafood). Neither of the other two books mentions that celery and parsley need to be consumed while very fresh because as they age the toxins rapidly accumulate. And boy is this book thorough. Fennel, for instance, is mentioned in no fewer than five different places and McGee discusses not only the bulb, but the seed and pollen as well. Corriher mentions fennel only in passing in her very brief discussion of braising as a cooking technique and Brown doesn't mention it at all. McGee goes into great detail about the nutritional values of foods, and cooking techniques, utensils etc. His book covers lesser-known foods such as borage, oca, purslane and teff. My favorite food, quinoa, gets several mentions. Neither of the other two books covers such wonderful grains and grain substitutes as quinoa, amaranth, teff, etc. McGee also has wonderful sidebars with recipes from ancient times, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance, the origins of food words, and quotations about food. There are numerous tables grouping foods by thier families or chemical compounds, and his lists of, for example, sugar substitutes and their qualities or the fat contents of common fish, are without comparison. I absolutely love this book. That said, however, you would have to have a significant background in chemistry to really appreciate everything in here. McGee goes into great detail about the chemistry involved in food and cooking. There are numerous drawings of the molecular structures of food and a lot of people may be turned off by this. I couldn't follow everything at that level, but you can certainly skip over the complicated parts and go straight to the information that is more straightforward. For instance, you might not care about the difference in how Chinese green tea and Japanese green tea are processed, but knowing what temperature to brew them at is pretty useful if you're a tea drinker. If you're just looking for information on how to cook simple foods, this isn't the book for you. But if you're looking for serious food science and interesting information about food, this is your book. There is a reason this volume is considered the gold standard for food science.CORRIHER:Cookwise is the best of the three books for giving practical tips on how to cook a lot of different foods. Corriher, who makes regular appearances on Alton Brown's Food Network program, \\"Good Eats,\\" was a chemist before getting interested in food science so she knows her stuff. Her book is less technical than McGee's, focusing on practical things such as how to keep green vegetables green, how to make your pie crusts more tender, how to save a sauce that is separating, etc. I have two problems with this book, however. The first is the layout. Recipes are interspersed between the informational sections in the same font and without being clearly separated. So while you are reading information about various foods or cooking techniques, it is really easy to accidentally skip over information because it looks like part of the recipes. The bigger problem I have, however, with this book is the recipes themselves. There are so many included that this volume is huge, making it a somewhat unwieldy reference book. Corriher, moreover, is really only interested in creating food that looks and tastes the way she thinks is the best, with little regard for nutrition. Nearly every recipe in this book contains sugar. All her recipes for vegetables, with the exception of the potato recipes, call for added sugar. Her only real discussion of nutrition has to do with fat. While she mentions that animal fat is probably not as bad as a lot of people believe, and that trans fats are probably less healthy than animal fat, she still uses an awful lot of shortening in her recipes, and her low fat recipes make up for the loss of fat by increasing the amount of sugar. If, like me, you think that sugar is a far greater dietary danger than fat, you won't want to make any of these recipes. Corriher is very mainstream in her ingredients, too. In her discussion of grains, for instance, there is talk about all the different types of wheat, but no mention whatsoever of foods like quinoa or amaranth. The recipes make little use of whole grains. Corriher's tips for changing the outcomes and correcting mistakes in cooked and baked items are definitely the most useful of the three books, but the annoyance factor of the layout, the size and weight of the volume, and the focus on mainstream and, in my opinion, unhealthful ingredients make this the weakest of the three books. Again, however, a lot of people will find this book the most useful. I certainly won't kick it out of my kitchen and I'm happy to have it. It's the most practical of the bunch, even if I find it annoying.BROWN:I should start by mentioning that I'm a huge fan of \\"Good Eats.\\" If you like that show you will probably like Brown's books. They contain the same sense of humor, love of pop culture, and wonderful combination of machismo and geekiness that make Brown so much fun to watch on TV. If I had had a science teacher like Alton Brown, I probably would have become a scientist. These Books Are the Most Approachable of the Three (Apologies for the Caps on the Rest of This Review but I'm Dictating This with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Which Sucks, and It Won't Stop Doing This). Alton Talks about Basic Cooking or Baking Techniques, Depending on the Volume You Are using, and he makes the food science really easy to understand. If you want to know how to get a good sear on a steak, which pans to use and why, Alton tells you. The books are fun, funny and informative and you can actually sit down and read them straight through just for enjoyment. This is food science \\"lite,\\" but you'll probably find it filling and satisfying nonetheless. It's the perfect introduction to food science. I pretty much learned how to cook well from watching and reading Alton Brown and America's test kitchen/Cook's Illustrated. (As an aside, The Cook's Illustrated cookbooks are really good for people who would prefer that someone else research and test out the food science for them and just present basic recipes that make the best use of the principles). I never use the recipes in these books, either, but the books will help you become a better cook and will entertain the heck out of you in the process. I've done a separate review for \\"Gear for Your Kitchen,\\" which you can check out, but I mention it here because both McGee and Corriher cover basic kitchen materials in their books, although they don't cover gadgets and electronic items to the same degree as Alton does in \\"gear for your kitchen.\\" Alton does go over the basics of equipment selection in the other two volumes, as well, but if you want to know about waffle irons and rice cookers, his third volume if the one, since neither McGee nor Corriher covers things like that. I also quite like that Alton has a separate chapter in \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\" on food sanitation and kichen safety. The book is worth the price for that chapter alone. Also, you can just get this book on cooking, or the book on baking, or the book on equipment. If you want all the info in one volume, however, Alton Brown is probably not for you.Hope this helps if you're trying to decide between the three books. Happy cooking! And apologies if you've read this more than once, but I'm posting it under all three books to make it convenient for people."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"A couple disclaimers first: (1) I am at best a passable cook, and (2) baking resembles more ancient alchemy than food preparation to me. Now that you know where I'm coming from, allow me to extoll the virtues of Alton Brown's fabulous baking book, \\"I'm Just Here for More Food\\". This is the first book on baking that makes sense to me -- thanks to Mr. Brown's clever organization by baking method, and to his clear, patiently explained passages that describe the mystery of the art of baking with fundamental bases in science. Now, at last, I understand -- and the oven doesn't seem quite so intimidating a device. My wife now thinks I'm nuts, since I can now confidently explain *why* you stir muffins so many times before you bake them, *why* you should measure by weight and not by volume, and all sorts of other baking trivia. Further, this book is just fun to read -- Mr. Brown's obvious love for baking seeps out of every page, and his joy is infectious. I loved his first cooking book, \\"I'm Just Here for the Food\\", but I must admit that this one is even better. This is the second book I'll buy for my children when they move into their first home of their own. More expert chefs may find much of this book to be trivial, but for those who need a guiding hand in the new world of baking, this is the book to use. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I have all his books, this is a great addition, I enjoy his writing and his method for cooking."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is a fantastic bakery book.

I love the way Alton teaches techniques rather than recipes."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I'm a fairly inexperienced baker - before I got this book, the only thing I'd made from scratch was chocolate chip cookies. I've made three things from this book so for - the fudge cake, the brownies, and, yes, the chocolate chip cookies - and every single time I've had amazing results. The directions are so clear that even when the procedure is unfamiliar to me, if I just follow them closely, it works. Plus, it's really cool to learn what different ingredients do and how they do it. I love Alton's show, and I love this book!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is the first cookbook I have ever read front to back in a few days.As a fan of Good Eat's and a baker, I picked this up thinking I would enjoy a cookbook from Alton Brown. I got more than I anticipated. Chapters explaining the processes in the way that only Alton Brown can do, this book is more than just a cookbook.Techniques, tips, and great explanations of what the ingedients are, what they do and how they effect the outcome...I would recommend this to not just Alton Brown fans, but to anyone who want's to learn more about baking in a easy to read and entertaining package."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This book came oh-so-close to receiving a 5-star rating from me! I love the way it's constructed; taking apart recipes and ingredients and breaking them down so that people like me (really interested in how food works, but not a science nerd. Reading a lot of really long scientific terms makes my brain feel numb.)can get a good grip on what's going on in the mixing bowl and oven. I would even highly recommend it as a useful home-schooling tool; probably not the book as a whole, but the different 'lessons' on ingredients, elements, how things work, etc. can make kids who want to know why about everything see cooking in a new light.My one complaint is that, even while being so careful that everyone can understand what he's saying, making sure that he explains how you can use inferior ingredients and get away with it, higher elevations, in a hot/cold kitchen, IN SHORT he tries to help you cook well under any condition he could think of, he outright assumes that everyone will have a stand mixer and use it for everything. This may seem a simple thing, but guess what? I DO NOT HAVE A STAND MIXER. He made a comment in his lesson on making cakes that \\"People used to make cakes by hand, but they had something we don't have today: Servants.\\" This made me nearly throw the book across the room. That's it?? That's all he's going to say on the topic of making baked goods by hand? Oh, then there WAS the comment on brioche: \\"You can make brioche by hand, but it's very, very hard to do.\\" The end. No \\"here's how, if you want to give it a try.\\" Well guess what? I make brioche by hand, and not only is it easy when you know how to go about it, anyone who makes bread can do it. He's not even giving them the chance, not allowing for the fact that some people have a tiny kitchen that has no more counter space to be claimed by a permanent piece of equipment like that.So for the record, if you want to cream sugar and butter by hand, it's very easy. Use a slotted mixing spoon with the study handle that won't bend, and press/pull the spoon through the butter and sugar repeatedly until thoroughly incorporated. This is the way my mom taught me, and her mom and grandmother did it the same way. None of them had servants, and a little effort never killed anyone. And I'm sure there are other ways to do it 'by hand' as well.If you want to make Brioche by hand, Julia Child gives excellent, thorough and successful steps in her second volume of Mastering the Art of French Cooking.This little rant may not affect many cooks today; I am aware that the vast majority do have stand mixers and don't care a pinch about hand-mixing. I probably come across as nit-picking, but his treatment of it really did bug me... like \\"Hand mixing? Archaic! *raspberry* to those of you who still do it!\\"I do like this book a lot, really I do... please don't assume anything otherwise. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I just wanted to point out the one way that I think he over-looked something potentially important to a number of his readers."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"In many ways this book is a little difficult to describe so that it receives the credit it deserves. It is more than a recipe book even though it isn't a classical recipe book - it is more than a textbook too.This fairly massive tome from Alton Brown is a relatively informal &#34;workshop guide&#34; to basic food preparation in the shape of baked goods. Here Alton focusses on ensuring that the reader really understands the nitty-gritty or the nuts and bolts as to what really happens from when you mix together ingredients right up to the point of serving. If you only care about making recipe X with the shortest amount of work, hassle and time this book is not for you. If you want to understand how things work with a view of improving them then you may find this a gem, particularly if you are not a food scientist or advanced chef.Brown starts with a good introduction and a bit of an explanation to as to what to expect, before it is onto the &#34;parts department&#34; where elements such as proteins and carbohydrates are explored and their interaction whilst baking is explained. No, do read on, it is not as dull as you might think. Even if you don't fully understand what Brown is writing, if you can pick up some basic understanding and practical tips you may find a real, noticeable difference in your baking. The importance of core ingredients such as eggs and flour also comes under the proverbial magnifying glass, helping remove any misapprehension that, for example, different types of flour are essentially the same and do roughly the same job. Indeed they may, just as a bicycle and an aircraft can propel you from New York to London (eventually).After all of this, recipes and their underlying work processes are concentrated within a number of standard methodologies and thus many recipes appear here. Each standard methodology - muffins, biscuits, pie variants, creaming, straight dough, egg foam, custards and a few other bits and bobs are similarly heavy on the science and plain-language explanation of the whats and whys and, naturally, then many recipes are provided that draw on this knowledge.As long as you remove any preconceptions about this book and if you are interested in how things actually go together and want to hopefully make a better &#34;product&#34; then this book might be an interesting, innovative diversion for you. A hybrid that carefully curates and moulds both high-level academic theory and common sense practical information to a fairly light-hearted, engaging and informative stream to be piped en masse into your brain. Just like Alton Brown's (American) television shows you can sense the energy, constantly changing focus as you read through the book yet, surprisingly, there is an almost serene, controlled manner to this as well. A concept that is harder to explain than it is to understand through reading it.The book ends with, as you would hope for, a good detailed index since it is a fair bet you will be referencing hither and tither as time goes on. Some little errors and some abrupt endings made this reviewer scratch his head metaphorically a few times, but these little black marks rapidly pale into insignificance when you consider the overall picture."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Alton Brown is always a favorite of mine. He explains how food is chemically and structurally altered during the process of cooking and presents it in such a way that you can extrapolate his lesson to whatever you are trying to create. For years, I thought I had a good recipe for Pancakes but for the last few months, they were turning out inconsistently.

Alton Brown really takes the time to explain the science behind baking so that the average joe could become a cook themselves. In our family we divide people into three groups:1. cooks - those that can throw a bunch of ingredients together without measuring precisely and some how manage to make it not just edible but downright delicious!2. followers - those that are only comfortable when they are given precise measurements and exact instructions to follow.3. those that just aren't allowed anywhere near the kitchen!This book gives recipe followers a chance to become cooks and those previously banned from the kitchen a chance to be allowed back in.Highly recommended for all 3 categories!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"It's not four stars simply because \\"On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen\\" exists. This book, and its predecessor, \\"I'm just Here for the Food\\" are both excellent and entertaining guides to basic food science and cooking technique. I love Alton Brown's books and his highly entertaining Food Network show, \\"Good Eats.\\"But if you are serious about knowing food, knowing food chemistry, and truly understanding food and its role in our lives, you simply cannot beat the encyclopedic \\"On Food and Cooking\\" by Harold McGee.Still, where McGee is dense, Brown is minimalist. Where McGee is serious, Brown is fun. My preference for McGee comes because I have personally become obsessed with *understanding* everything I can about what happens in my kitchen. If your goal is simply to raise your understanding from the ability to follow a recipie to the ability to cook with real creativty, Brown's books do the job. Other reviewers here have done a good job of outlining the book, so I don't need to. It is enough to say that both of Brown's \\"I'm Just Here...\\" books organize themselves around a handful of \\"methods\\" or \\"techniques\\" and then explain how various recipies (or ingredients) fall into those methods. He's not so deep or comprehensive as McGee, but Brown is who moved me from a thawing and can-opening kind of home cook to someone who makes meals people look forward to.So, start here with Mr. Brown (and watch his show -- it adds *seeing* to the reading, and that's worth it, even if you don't like his showmanship -- which I do) and then move on to \\"Cookwise\\" by Shirley O. Corriher (another great food science book) and then on to \\"On Food and Cooking.\\"BTW, \\"On Food and Cooking\\" was revised in 2004. I suggest getting *both* the 1984 and 2004 editions! He has added much in the new book, including a fantastic section on fish and seafood, but he has *dropped* a remarkable chapter on human digestion and metabolism, which I think should have stayed in. How our bodies respond to food is important for health.Anyways, these books make possible the renaissance of home cooking, and I urge you read them and enjoy them!"},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"Hubby and I are Good Eats fans.

Remember when you were young and you thought the world of your parents, they were like gods. I think of Alton Brown in a similar way to a knowledgable relative. He brings science and cooking together with a heavy sprinkle of humor, so brilliantly that he constantly inspires me to cook. I look up to him as a role model and thought he could never let me down. Until now, with this book. Sure the techniques are sound but the recipes are TERRIBLE! Where did they come from? You won't find them on episodes of Good Eats, or even the Food Network website. I found the bread and biscuit recipe to be a complete failure with far too much liquid to dry goods. What a mess. I was cursing Alton's name. How could he let me down by putting his name on this terrible failure."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is the book I've been looking for since I started cooking. I have purchased books, subscribed to magazines, visited web sites, etc. but I all have ever found was recipe collections. Alton teaches you how to cook, explains how and why it works and makes it entertaining. Just like his show on Food Network. Same goes for his other book - \\"I am just here for the food\\". These two books are the only ones you'll ever need, knowing the process you can create your own recipe collections."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I have to say this is the most frequently used cookbook I own. I've been an Alton devotee since the early days of Good Eats and this book is true to his unique presentation and addictive personality. I often receive compliments on my baking and this book has made the quality of my creations even better. What I've learned about baking technique transfers to everything I make even from my old late 60's Betty Crocker cookbook.Although there are a couple typos as another reviewer referenced, the brownies are the only recipe where it causes much confusion. For brownies I've used the cocoa brownies recipe off the food network database since long before the publication of this book so that particular typo has not complicated things for me at all. I did look up the list of corrections once but I haven't had a problem with any of the recipes so I simply ignored them.I highly recommend this book for both it's culinary wisdom and creative wit. Even if you don't bake a thing, the writing will provide worthwhile entertainment."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"I have the first edition of this book. My husband and I have both baked recipes in it, and we've slowly come to the conclusion that it is not to be trusted. There are many errors, especially in measurements, which is funny because Mr. Brown seems to be all about weighing everything, in order to get accurate measurements. I went to the website that someone mentioned on here to correct some things, but I know from personal experience that that posting does not cover all the mistakes. Also-- Mr. Brown uses a lot of buttermilk, and when he uses buttermilk, he seems to also use a lor of salt. Either that or buttermilk is naturally salty? At any rate, everything we made from this book that had buttermilk in it was too salty for our taste. I cut the salt in half on those recipes."},{"Title":"I'm Just Here for More Food: Food x Mixing + Heat = Baking","review":"This is a great book if you are wanting to learn the science behind baking. Perhaps your a fan of Alton Brown's show, Good Eats, perhaps your looking for great recipes. This book is written in a very easy style to read. Alton Brown gives the what's and the how's behind baking. This kind of information is great for the novice or the experienced cook.Personally, I found th pancake recipe was worth the purchase price alone. What I really like about this book is the recipes are written very clear, written so you won't make a mistake. He takes the mystery out of baking and gives you basic tips and very tasty recipes to boot.I highly recommend this book if you are an experienced or a novice cook.

I rarely buy cookbooks without pictures (ADD or food porn addict?), but this book was completely entertaining presentation-wise and content-wise even though it only used drawn pictures.

I bought a copy today and am working on something as we speak. Not only are the ideas fabulous, but the book itself is an entertaining and mouth-watering presentation.

Caesar is portrayed as an intellectually and physically mesmerizing man whose charisma attracted both men and women to his political causes and produced support for his personal ambitions. I also appreciated Hunter's view of Caesar as an ardent lover but one who refrained from salubrious expressions of affection to the women in his life.Of course I enjoyed Colleen McCullough's latest novel about Caesar's final years, \\"The October Horse\\", but found her dialogue between Caesar and Cleopatra repeatedly sprinkled with \\"darling\\" somewhat a bit out of place in the mental image of an astute and articulate Caesar I had formed over the years reading her entire \\"Masters of Rome\\" series of novels as well as a number of the ancient sources.My primary regret was that Hunter's novel was short. I would have appreciated much more detail about Alesia and Caesar's personal interaction with the Gauls (men and women - McCullough hinted at a relationship with a Gallic woman that resulted in a son), Caesar's thoughts and actions during the battle of Miletus, his first major military engagement, and his personal interaction with Octavian.McCullough portrayed the relationship between Caesar and Octavian so sympathetically that I actually developed a more positive viewpoint towards Caesar's heir, at least until he allowed Lucius Caesar to be proscribed. So I would have been interested in another perspective.Hunter also shares my speculation that Caesar's seizures were caused by a head wound sustained at Munda rather than lifelong epilepsy, although McCullough's suggestion of a condition resembling hypoglycemia was certainly plausible as well. The ancient sources do not mention this condition until later in his life.I also liked Hunter's casting of the relationship between Caesar and Calpurnia, much more so than the soap opera overtones of \\"I can't live with you as husband and wife\\" that marked the end of the romance in the recent \\"Julius Caesar\\" miniseries on TNT Network. The affair with Cleopatra was just one of many over his lifetime and Calpurnia was well aware of Caesar's notoriety with other women when she agreed to marry him. I think she would have accepted the situation as a matter of course, just as Hunter envisioned it.\\"Immortal Caesar\\" is interesting, factual, and fast paced -- a good effort for a first novel."},{"Title":"Immortal Caesar","review":"Authors who write about Julius Caesar generally either love him or hate him. Lucan, of course, hated him; Colleen McCullough loves him. Hunter is much closer to McCullough than to Lucan. Those who hate him see him as the destroyer of the republic, a cruel, self-aggrandizing opportunist; the other side sees the republic as moribund and Caesar as the one person who could save the Romans from the feuding generals and from themselves, the one man who would extend Roman citizenship widely, though responsibly, enough to revitalize the state. These are not necessarily absolutely contradictory positions. Caesar may have had foresight and wanted to improve Rome and still have made his dignitas an important element in Rome's success. What's good for Bull Moose is good for the nation? Cruel or clement? The difference between the Gallic Wars and the Civil Wars.On her back cover, Hunter refers to Caesar as \\"a multiple genius whom Shakespeare called \`the noblest man that ever lived'\\", but that's Mark Antony in his funeral oration for Caesar, clearly not without its own agenda, and Antony at the end of the play calls Caesar's main opponent in the play, Brutus, \\"the noblest Roman of them all\\", though the \\"them all\\" is the conspirators. I think we can't be sure what Shakespeare thought of Caesar, He shows him as impressively in control at first, but a bit cranky and able to be manipulated to his death. George Bernard Shaw's Caesar more fully embodies the \\"great man\\" concept. The comparison to Shakespeare is not without point, however. The norm, in biographies or novels about Caesar, is either to present Caesar as all (or mainly) good and his opponents as all (or mainly) bad. Lucan and his camp show Caesar as the embodiment of evil (a Nero figure) and Cato as the embodiment of Republican virtue, whereas McCullough and that camp present Caesar as noble and progressive thinking and Cato as reactionary, bitter, mean-spirited and (often) drunk, Brutus as either conniving or whining and Cicero as weak in body and will.Much of this latter picture emerges in Hunter's characterizations. This does not mean that her picture is poor fiction or history. Caesar's opponents may have been like that and fiction often relies on strong contrasts and the use of foils. However, as soon as you meet Cato, Cicero, Brutus or Labienus, you know what kind of a person they will be from the comments of the author, often in the very physical descriptions.In part, this process may be linked to what my major criticism of the novel is, that it is too short.Hunter writes well, but attempting to cover all of Caesar's career in 225 pages means she has to use shortcuts, in this instance in characterizations, in other , in plot. She does a good job in just a few pages in giving the feel of Alesia or of Caesar's assassination, though I would have liked her to develop them more, but many other incidents needed at least another paragraph to get the full impact and to show how they fitted in. Sometimes, the reader just has to deduce what has happened, for example, Cornelia's death, page 30: \\"'Did you ever love me?', she asked, but did not hear the answer.' The next chapter follows immediately with \\"Shortly after, his old aunt Julia died.\\" On page 111 Cicero, writing to compliment Caesar's commentaries 1-5, is presumably back from the exile brought about by Clodius at Caesar's request following page 84, but we've never heard about his returning to Rome.As fiction, the novel succeeds well enough, though more and more thorough characterizations and plot movement would be desirable. As history, the novel presents an accurate record of Caesar's actions, though of course his motives are any author's guess. Hunter introduces a wealth of historical figures (indeed, the fictional additions are a mere handful). What she does do is introduce into the action early along, where the historical record does not give a name, characters who will be important centurions or other people Caesar will deal with later in the novel. This gives a bit more cohesiveness to the plot and characters than history actually does, but no one will object to this authorial license.Hunter is as close to historically correct as a novelist who has to describe motives and thoughts can be, which is one of the reasons teachers of Latin or Roman history may want to use this book. And there is hardly any sex in here that would require censoring, at least for high school students.This is the third incarnation of a Caesar novel from Hunter, and the dialogue is fuller and the action more sustained. There is no murder mystery, as in so many current novels set in Roman times, but it still makes a good read if you like history and want a clear presentation of Julius Caesar. Admittedly, the author is partial to Gaius, but any author (fictional of not) will have a slant on the character and his accomplishments or failings. Who else could give you your introduction to Caesar's person and mind through the lustful eyes of Sulla? If you want a negative view, read any novel whose major character is Cicero."},{"Title":"Immortal Caesar","review":"Anyone who wants to get a broad overview of Caesar's life and the characters involved in it should read this book. Caesar lives again in an easy reading style presented in mostly dialogue form. Excellent."},{"Title":"Immortal Caesar","review":"This is a very fast paced, tour de force covering the entirety of Caesar's very eventful life. In less than 250 pages Ms Hunter manages to reveal more of the inner man than should be possible.

I started reading \\"In Search of Scotland\\" right after finishing Morton's wonderful \\"In Search of England,\\" and I have to admit I found \\"...Scotland\\" something of a letdown.I've been trying to decide why exactly that is, and I think it may simply be because \\"...England\\" was a diverse, you might say, book, with a wider variety of personalities, encounters, and generally interesting things to do and see. It may be, too, that Morton was more familiar with England and so could write about it more broadly and confidently. One of the things I found most surprising about \\"...Scotland,\\" in fact, was Morton's discussion of how unknown most of Scotland -- particularly the Highlands -- still was to the majority of English people, even as late as the time Morton was writing (1929). Scotland was in many senses a foreign land, making \\"In Search of Scotland\\" Morton's first piece of \\"foreign\\" travel writing (all his previous books had been about England, and mostly about London).While parts of \\"...Scotland\\" dragged for me, there were still many times when Morton's descriptive skill shined through, and the reader comes away with a strong sense of the role history plays (or played?) in the average Scot's understanding of himself and his place in the world. As with so much of Morton's writing, it would be fascinating to know how much of what he found still remains, eight or so decades later."},{"Title":"The Case of the Singing Skirt (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"&quot;The Case of the Singing Skirt&quot; is one of Erle Stanley Gardner's eighty-five Perry Mason books. In this case, the famed defense attorney undertakes to help Ellen Robb, a cigar-and-cigarette girl who works at a local gambling club. Because she refused to help the owner swindle a gambler, Ellen finds herself framed for the theft of a certain amount of money. Mason quickly defuses that situation, enabling the woman to keep the money and threatening suit against the employer for defamation. Events escalate soon, though, when Ellen turns up with a gun in her possession that she cannot explain. Mason suspects that another attempt to frame Ellen is in the works, and he takes steps to thwart that attempt. When a woman turns up dead, though, Mason must defend his client on murder charges--and himself against charges of being an accessory after the fact.&quot;The Case of the Singing Skirt&quot; is really a novel in two parts. The first part deals with the machinations of the various parties before court, and the second part puts Mason in his element--the courtroom. As a legal thriller, &quot;The Case of the Singing Skirt&quot; is passable, though not particularly exciting. Mason spends a great deal of time deflecting his opponent's thrusts, but only in the last few pages does Mason go on the offensive. As a result, this book is not the best forum for Mason's considerable legal expertise. As a mystery, there is little doubt who the murderer is. Once one starts with the premise that Mason's clients are, as a rule, innocent, there is little more to figure out. Still, eighty-five books with a single character do not come about by accident, and there is a fair amount of charm to &quot;The Case of the Singing Skirt.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Case of the Singing Skirt (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"From 1959 we have super lawyer Perry Mason on the case.A night club singer enters Perry's office with a gun and the tale of how her employers were planning to steal from a client with a gambling scam.Then bodies start and turn up.Of course Perry bamboozles everyone with his genius in Court as he always does with the assistance of his assistant Della Street.My only complaint is that Gardner cheats the reader in not giving him some crucial information which breaks what Chandler calls \\" the rules'.

Chetta M.D. Coroner of New Orleans. The ultimate function of the autopsy is to protect the living. The cause of death in any obscure case may be of great importance not just to surviving relatives but to society. Dr. Chetta has modernized the coroner's office to aid law agencies in determining causes of death.This story begins with details about the bathing-beauty contest racket. Beautiful girls win a free trip to Hollywood. But then they are discarded and stranded, forced to seek a living anyway they can. [Too much pride to go back home?] Ellen Robb consults Perry Mason to complain about her firing from a gambling casino after she refused to spy on the cards held by a sucker. Rowena is a small town with a sleazy reputation. There was an alleged shortage after Ellen worked as the cashier. The owner of the gambling casino owns the justice of the peace, the chief of police, and has friends in high places. Perry Mason calls George Anclitas and will defend Ellen Robb against defamation of character. Mrs. Helman Ellis shows up to complain about her husband's losses at gambling, and ask for a return of the money. Impossible? Perry Mason cites California's community property law which can be used to recover money lost at gambling (Chapter 3).In Chapter 6 Perry Mason explains how to date a gun to determine when a bullet was fired by it. Ellen Robb found a pistol planted in her belongings, and brought it to Perry Mason. He inspected it, then returned a pistol to Ellen Robb. Is there something being planned? There is more conflict between Helman Ellis and his wife due to Ellen Robb. Do gamblers have a need to lose (Chapter 7)? In Chapter 8 we find out why Mrs. Ellis couldn't be found. The police arrive to question Ellen Robb about her whereabouts. The facts and problems in this case are reviewed (Chapter 9). Perry learns some shocking news! The Preliminary Hearing discusses the two bullets found in Mrs. Ellis. Did they both come from the same gun (Chapter 10)? One gun was traced back to Perry Mason, the second gun was not the one given to Helman Ellis. Questioning a witness, there is an outburst and confession in court. Perry's client is freed, so Perry won't face any charges. Perry notes the significance of eyewitness testimony that can't be corroborated.Erle Stanley Gardner does a better job is describing civic corruption, in fiction, than his contemporaries."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It! True Food Facts from Around the World and Throughout History","review":"Anyone for some soup made with birds' nests?? How about \\"1,000 year old eggs\\" aged in mud?? Live maggots?? I've got it, seaweed!! What?! You want to eat HAMBURGER?!? HOW REVOLTING!! :)Food cuisine from around the world and the strange things people have found to be delicacies is the topic of this fun book. While most American children wouldn't eat cooked spiders for a million dollars, they may be interested to find that spiders, grubs and other insects are considered not only cruncy delights in other countries, but pound-per-pound they have more nutritional value than most snack foods we eat in the states!\\"It's Disgusting\\" is a well researched, well illustrated book that I would file in the \`expand your horizions' section. We easily forget that not everyone is like us or likes the same things we do. Hindis would be revolted, shocked and offended if we ate hamburger in front of them. Asian cultures find soup made from birds' nests a delicy (the nest itself is largely made of the birds spit) as well as sun dried jellyfish. Closer to home, at one point in history in the US turkey was once considered a food that would make you stupid and tomatoes were once considered poisionous. The passenger pigeons of yesteryear who used to blacken the sky by the millions were made extinct in part because of people's desire to eat them.Meanwhile, today many food thickeners are made from seaweed or the hooves of animals (carageenan and gelatin, respectively), and some colorings are made from the carapaces (exoskeletons) of insects. However, no one seems to be worrying about horse hooves and bug juice in their yoghurt these days...The book is written well so that even intermediate readers will be able to make their way through and become enligtened about the foods other cultures fancy. The authors strive to keep any bias out of their writing and simply state the facts: while WE may find this food gross, other people find it a delicacy and vice-versa--there's stuff WE regularly eat that other cultures would quickly push aside. Peppered with fun poems and bright illustrations (including some fun bar charts of the nutritional value of various foods, like bugs), this book may get a chorus of \\"ewwww!!\\"'s, but it will also expand the horizons of it's readers!Now, pass the chocolate covered ants..."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It! True Food Facts from Around the World and Throughout History","review":"If you thought that after watching the tribe members on &quot;Survivor&quot; trying to eat local insects and assorted delicacies the past few years there was nothing left to turn your stomach at the dinning table, then this book will quickly set you straight. &quot;It's Disgusting and We Ate It!: True Food Facts from Around the World and Throughout History&quot; has author James Solheim and artist Eric Brace giving young readers a taste of what can be done with seaweed, squirrels, spiders, earthworms, maggots, birds' nests, violets, and even mammoths (Hey, it could happen: remember the episode of &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;?).The book is divided, like Gaul, into three parts. The first looks at the exotic tastes found around the world, the second looks at some of the more interesting dishes in history, and the third is an eye-opening look at some of the facts behind contemporary American favorites, such as the hot dog. There are a few recipes, mostly having to do with things you could actually cook today with some effort and parental guidance, along with poems, charts, tables, stories, and a map. The big question is whether or not the idea that something &quot;tastes like chicken&quot; (e.g., grilled guinea pig) is a universal goal. I mean, if it tastes like steak or lobster, would that be a bad thing?&quot;It's Disgusting and We Ate It!&quot; is also educational (spiders having more protein than beef made my day though why the giant ones from New Guinea taste like peanut butter is beyond me), even if you decide never to try python in vinegar, horse blood, or cicadas fat with eggs (even if Aristotle did recommend it as an after school snack). But mostly it is just involves the fun of thinking that in another time or another place people actually ate these things, which will just make the information go down easier."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It!

This book explores some of the foods from around the world which different cultures enjoy, but which may seem disgusting to us. Everything thing eaten is not in here but there is a good selection. What was eaten throughout history around the world is also included.My favourite section is part three - Strange Stories from your own Kitchen which explains what cows eat and how that food gets turned into the milk which we drink. There is also similar information on how bees make honey.There's also a few recipes and 19 poems as well. I am not really into poems so they didn't do much for me but if you are into poetry then this may well be a bonus for you. The illustrations in this book are sensational though, and worth the price alone."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It!

The information is presented in a humorous way through anecdotes, poems, and illustrations. My favorite section of the book gave homage to those three famous words &quot;tastes like chicken.&quot; It was also interesting to read about what food items make a medieval feast successful, and you may never want to eat a hot dog again after you read the truth about hot dogs. This book is a thematic teacher's dream. It has so many cross-curricular, and multicultural connections. This book has a strong math connections in that it contains many graphs, tables, and recipes. This is an excellent resource for social studies teachers. It presents foods that are currently eaten throughout the world, and throughout historyKids will love this book. It is humorous and best of all the kids you know will be discussing these things at lunch to gross each other out. I predict it will be a popular checkout in your libraries. You will have trouble keeping it on your library shelves."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It!

My kids found it to be thoroughly disgusting and, as such, a great deal of fun. They like to discuss it with their friends and gross each other out. I found it to be very interesting. I was impressed with the author's research and, seemingly, first hand experience on the subject (I hope this isn't true for his sake). As a foreigner, I thougth he approached the subject with a great deal of sensitivity to other cultures, while expanding his readers minds to accepting the unique perspectives that different and very glorious cultures give. He did all to this with simplicity and humor, making reading the book a great familty activity.

See some of what American's ate in 1776 on page 25. It can also serve to stimulate more indepth study of different cultures around the world or in history. There are lots of funny poems and artwork included."},{"Title":"It's Disgusting and We Ate It!

He was transfixed as I read to him all the different types of things that people have eaten and still do eat today. Instead of being grossed out, he wanted to try them all! He loves squid and seaweed and is just dying to eat some grasshoppers. We ended up buying the book after checking it out twice in a row and I'm so glad we did. When he was 4, he took it in to share with his Montessori pre-school class. Last year he took it into share with his kindergarten class. And this year he's taken it into his 1st grade class twice; once to share and once to \\"prove\\" to his teacher that bugs really ARE a good example of a protein-loaded food.

True Food Facts from Around the World and Throughout History","review":"Summary: This fun, yet repulsive book, is written in an easy-to-read format. It presents very unusual food items that people from a variety of countries have eaten throughout history. Have you ever eaten earthworm soup or fried termites? What about housefly pupae or rat stew? Gag! The book also adds some strange facts to \\"spice\\" it up even more. Did you know that fried wax moth caterpillars taste like bacon? Or that there is three times more protein in roasted spiders than cooked beef? Or that saffron costs $4,000 per pound? Unique facts for all of you trivia buffs out there!My Reaction: I loved the bizarre information presented in this book.

He lists the different viewpoints of these religions and then contrasts them with &quot;Orthodox&quot; Christianity. He uses original sources to support himself so that it's not just his opinion, but rather the opinion of the group's leaders. Certainly some may come in and disagree about certain nuances regarding the way he lays out the orthodox position (i.e. a Catholic or Greek Orthodox layperson may not see eye-to-eye on salvation and justification through faith alone), but House gives verses from the Bible to support himself. He also uses expert resources to check his work and make sure his arguments were not faulty. I will keep this reference near-by, and when I have a question about a particular group's teaching, I will be sure to see what this has to say.I do have two complaints: First, the book is so big (350 pages, 8.5 x 11 format) and, with the pages getting flipped back and forth, I'm scared the spine may not hold out. I'm wondering why the publisher didn't use a metal ring spine to make it easier to lay the book flat and help it withstand the constant paging back and forth. Also, what about the Boston (discipleship) movement? I would have liked material on this growing group. However, I can't lessen my recommendation of the book despite my complaints."},{"Title":"Charts of Cults, Sects, and Religious Movements","review":"The whole purpose of buying a book like this is to convert the information into a visual format, such as into chart form. Nevertheless, you can see from the samples that much of this book consists of ordinary outlines, not of charts at all. The author's \\"Charts of the New Testament\\" on the other hand, is quite good, and is almost entirely composed of charts in visual form, such as one would use on an overhead projector, to help the students to visualize the material taught.Let us remember that Zondervan is in this business to sell books, more than to help readers learn. Just as the \\"Dummies\\" series is nothing more than a marketing strategy for a series of how-to books written by unrelated authors who pay the fee to use the name, likewise not all these Zondervan books of the \\"Charts\\" series are created by the same authors or for the same noble purpose, but mainly to identify themselves with the successful series, and to sell.

On reading excerpts about Jehovah's Witnesses, I wonder if Dr. House didn't really do the research needed to form his opinions. The opinion that Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to read or study any bible but their own is not true. Having been around JWs my whole life, I know that many have several translations of the bible on their book shelves. Without having his book right in front of me, I can't pick it apart bit by bit, but this is a pretty basic mistake and makes me wonder if he's formed his opinions independently and through his own personal research and interviews with real members of these cults/sects or relied on others misinformation."},{"Title":"Charts of Cults, Sects, and Religious Movements","review":"Mr. Wayne House, ignorantly includes the United Pentecostal Church as a cult.

This book, along with a few others, triggered a life-long love affair with boats and sailing, and influenced me to major in naval architecture. The photos are now a bit dated as racing yachts no longer have teak decks and graceful bow and stern overhangs, but the photos could not be more beautiful.

Very few data structures books contain quite as many structures as this one; In addition to containing all the common data structures one usually studies, people can also study Splay Trees, Compressed Tries, Patricia, Fibonacci Heaps...really the list keeps going. The only things that it seems to be missing are skip lists and multidimensional range trees...Most data structures have rigorous (college-level-worthy) proofs for complexity and performance. These proofs are typically required of a student in a graduate level course, and thus, this book could be used for a graduate-level text. Because of this however, some may find this book a little daunting, especially if you just need an introduction to the topic.The C++ code samples use templates so that the data structures can be generalized and used for any type. Therefore, the C++ code is very reusable. However, the code can sometimes be a bit hard to understand, mostly due to short variable names, and poor in-code comments.

If you want to learn, DO NOT buy this book."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++","review":"The vast majority of programming books do a disservice to their readers by making programming *too* easy. Sure, you can learn the basic syntax, and how to solve simple problems from these books, but do they teach you how to solve *any* type of problem? Most do not, and can't, because solving complex problems is -- hard!Superficially, this book is about writing programs in C. C is *not* necessarily the best language for learning algorithms and data structures if you have no concept of an algorithm or a data structure. If you are totally new to programming, but really want to get \\"under the hood\\" of what the machine is actually doing (with less of a mathematical emphasis), thenAssembly Language Step-by-Step: Programming with Linuxmight be a better starting point. When you want to do things more efficiently than you can in assembly, then it is time to learn C.In this book, you will learn the conventional ways of writing sorting and searching algorithms, and the structures they operate on. But fundamentally, writing a program involves directing your attention to the most important features of a problem, and why certain algorithms and data structures show up again and again in programming. Programming is about patterns, and the most efficient way to *correctly and unambiguously* describe those patterns, is through mathematics.I can sympathize with those who gave harsh reviews. If you have not yet acquired the habit of thinking mathematically -- this book is going to be over your head. Go throughIntroductory Discrete Mathematics (Dover Books on Computer Science)either before, or concurrently with this. You will then have a strong enough knowledge of C programming to participate in open source projects.If I could change one thing, I would have preferred if the authors introduced used the ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language), which is a notation that can be implemented in C source code, that will check whether the actual algorithm that is compiled, meets the specification in the comments by using the Frama-C theorem prover. If you are going to be mathematically rigorous, might as well go all the way. Perhaps this would reduce the number of buffer overflows or pointer errors all to common in C programs, to a greater or lesser degree."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Data Structures in C++","review":"I am a visual learner but this book contains very little pictures to describe abstract algorithms and data structures.

Some sorting algorithms and some basic search algorithms are presented here. This section is not so exhaustive, still useful. It contains descriptions on how to abstract data types.Part about array and structures explains how aggregate data types can be used to build more complex data types and teach how to manipulate them.This section is not very useful and it is not projected in a \\"production environment\\". Things are explained in a too semplicistic way and don't fit real world data structure construction. This is the sensation you will have all over the book. Data structures explained in this book works only with integers number. In a real world you will not build data structures to store integers only. This approach simplify greatly source code and comprehension on how a particular data structure WORKS, but will not give you a good vision on how a real data structure should be PROGRAMMED. So this book remains more academic than practical. For theoretical explanations about data structures there are more exhaustive books around, like \\"Introduction to Algorithms\\" by Cormen, Leiserson and Rivest.The material presented in this book is complete and updated and surely this is a great reference.Explanations are well given.So consider five star if you buy this book for understanding how data structures work, only three star if you need this book to have some implementations to look at.

Short but very insightful discussions of the character and occasional shortcomings in his compositions, with very level-headed and perceptive opinions (and a more positive reception of the composer's Late Period than I would have thought from a work of that time). The discussion is not watered down, but never gets over the head of the average listener. Many pieces are quickly dealt with, but the writing is direct, the insights sharp, the points well-taken. What's most impressive is how Scott has advanced many a theory I've rarely heard since, but which make such good sense. One wonders why she wasn't take more seriously, her insights not more frequently cited by others in their works. (Was it because she was a woman in a man's world?) She speculates, for example, that the \\"central three\\" of the last five Beethoven quartets were likely culled from aborted attempts to write masses; this not only describes their spiritual quality\\" better than the modern cliche about how they initiated \\"the avant garde,\\" but it also explains Beethoven's famous cyptic note to his publisher about Op. 131: pilfered together from this and that. If indeed much of the material came from the three masses that comment would be justified. Furthermore, she claims the last quartet, Op. 135, short as it was, would have been even shorter because it was originally intended to be only three movements. But while many critics believed the slow movement to be the added section, she doubts this because that would have meant every movement in the quartet was in F Major. Rather she posits that the scherzo is actually the extraneous movement, and even claims it does little to advance the quartet. We've been so blinded by its bold audacity that we've failed to see that this is quite true. If you doublt me, try playing the work without the scherzo: in some ways it's even more interesting.I'm surprised this book isn't better-known today, and has not recently been reprinted. I got more out of this slim volume than out of many biographies or analyses that go on for 500 pages or more. Worth looking for. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beethoven (The Master of musicians series)","review":"The original Beethoven study in this series dates back to 1899. However in 1934, Dent Music Masters replaced that early volume with an entirely new study by Marion M. Scott. This particular edition enjoyed great popularity and was reprinted nine times between 1934 and 1974. Scott (1877-1953), an English music critic, musicologist, violinist and composer, untook a completely new study of Beethoven's life and work. Her insightful comments on his music are based on her own interpretations and careful study of each score. She visited Beethoven's birthplace and immersed herself in his world. The result is an extraordinary classic study of the man and his music. Scott was a metaphysician who probed deeply into the spirital aspects of Beethoven's music and created a text that is both stimulating and profound. &quot;Beethoven's last quartets are not the justification of modern music,&quot; Scott observes, &quot;but modern music has reached the point at which it justifies the quartets and proves Beethoven's genius to have been transcendental.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"Kurt Busiek and Nathan Archer provide a fast paced enjoyable thriller pitting Spider-Man against one of his greatest foes. This time Norman Osborn presents perhaps a greater threat to Spider-Man than his alter ego, the Green Goblin. Osborn has managed to convince everyone that his prior unmasking was erroneous. Armed with the knowledge that the public will never believe he is the Goblin, Osborn proceeds to use this to his advantage against Spider-Man. This renders Spidey's knowledge of the Goblin's identity practically useless while maximizing the fact that Osborne knows Peter Paker is Spider-Man. Perhaps Busiek and Archer's greatest accomplishment is suceeding to make Osborn a bigger problem for Spidey than the Goblin. On the negative side, the plot involving mayorial politics echos that of &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive,&quot; although this is the better book. The authors construct a prolonged action packed and satisfying climax. All in all a pleasurable read but not quite in the league with the best Spidey novels, &quot;Venom's Wrath&quot; and &quot;The Gathering of the Sinister Six.&quot;"},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"There is a note at the beginning of this novel indicating that this story takes place before &quot;The Gathering of Five&quot; and &quot;The Final Chapter.&quot; Knowing this, I didn't have much hope for a suspenseful or interesting story (after all, the &quot;end&quot; of the Spidey/Goblin conflict is detailed in those stories, so how could this novel add anything of any importance?). Well, as I read the book, I became increasingly impressed with what was attempted and accomplished here. As a born-and-bred Spidey fan, I can honestly say that this was a great story which was well told. The characterizations of both Spider-Man and the Goblin captured their comic-book essence while enhancing them with the details that become possible only in a novel format. The manipulations of Osborn are frightenly real and well thought-out. Spidey himself is in great form in a tale that manages to become a milestone in his career. I was completely satisfied with the story and its ending. I believe that the target market for this novel will consider it a &quot;must-have&quot; and find it highly enjoyable. P.S. I did have a problem with the name &quot;Rat Pack.&quot; I kept thinking of Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.!"},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"While the comics themselves, lately, have been disappointing, the Marvel Novels have never failed to surpass all expectations, outdoing their 32 page counterparts. I can't help but believe that Kurt Busiek, the writer of the critically acclaimed Iron Man, Avengers, Untold Tales of Spider-Man, and more, can make this story into what the comics should have been. Spinning straw into gold is what the man does. On the novel itself, it is too soon to actually say, but I look forward to seeing how it all turns out."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"Something as played out as the Spider-man/Goblin wars has always been a plotline for novels, and this one is no exception. The problem is that sometimes they get stupid. How could the Green Goblin get unmasked as Norman Osborn, &quot;come back from the dead,&quot; and all he does to get away with it is lie? Oh, come on, how stupid are the people in these books? Note: the last two sentences don't tell anything about the book, just the history before it. Now as for the book itself, it does okay with the plotline. The story begins as a group of terrorists called the Rat Pack spring a reign of terror, not even Spider-Man can stop it. Meanwhile Norman Osborn is running for mayor and his Green Goblin persona seems to have resurfaced, leaving Spider-Man on edge. But that's only the begining of this attempt at a thriller. I say this because one big problem is the plot is way too predictable. You know what's going to happen before it does. Plus, another problem is that it's not very thrilling; Spidey stays on edge the hole book and doesn't actually fight the Goblin until near the end. They also add extra little parts here and there, which have nothing to do with the overall story. Yes, despite all I said, I still give it 3 stars, but only because the writing quality is pretty good and I like Spider-Man novels. Otherwise, the plot just isn't that good."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"Spider-Man has always been my most favorite comic-book super hero (in the Marvel universe). This book has confirmed for me just why he's my favorite. This time, the web-slinger is against an implacable foe who can't be so easily disposed of because he's successfully convinced nearly everyone that he never was the Green Goblin. Worse, he strikes at Spider-Man and his alter ego with impunity, given that if Spidey tries to do anything about him, then he'll be seen as a criminal and Norman Osborn will get away clean. The dilemma he presents Peter with is diabolically clever: Either take the opportunity for financial security and leave behind his responsibilities, or continue being Spider-Man and possibly jeopardize his current position at the Daily Bugle. I was really rooting for Spidey to take down Osborn after he secretly poisoned Mary Jane. All in all, this is a very satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Spider-Man: Goblin Moon","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story wasn't earth-shattering, but what really made the book for me was the writing. Busiek and Archer made the characters very real and interesting. For the first time I felt that I really had a sense of what it would be like to swing through New York on web lines or see the world through Spidey's mask.True to Spider-Man's legacy this book wasn't about the hero as much as it was about Peter Parker. Also, I thought it brilliant that the villian in the book was Norman Osborn and not really his alter-ego, the Green Goblin.I enjoyed the detective-type efforts that Peter went through to figure out the case. The books seemed as much of a mystery as it was an action story.

But hey, Norman Osborn ain't no fool, and he is depicted in the book as one of Spidey's greatest foes. And in this, I think Busiek is right on the button.

This book attempts to bring each of them to life for the reader. In some measure it has succeeded. Although i still will not know instantly the difference between, say, Peter II and Nicholas I, i do have a far better idea of who the Romanovs were, how they were related, how much they were not Russians (like the British royal family of the period, the seemed to become more and more German), and the troubles they faced with varying degrees of unsuccess. I had hoped for a little more detail on, for example, origins of the families, the Russians, the prior Grand Dukes and Czars; this is, though, a beginners' book, an introduction, and, as such, it fulfills its mandate quite nicely."},{"Title":"THE BREATH OF LOVE","review":"A beautifully written look into the nature of man, his heart and his soul.

We have one terrific roller coaster ride. Faulkner said he wrote this novel to make money after the disappointing sales of THE SOUND AND THE FURY and AS I LAY DYING. About SANCTUARY, published in 1931, he wrote: \\"I began to think of books in terms of possible money. . . . I took a little time out, and speculated what a person in Mississippi would believe to be current trends, chose what I thought was the right answer and invented the most horrific tale I could imagine. . .\\" This novel was the biggest seller of all Faulkner's works during his lifetime.We are introduced to a whole slew of unforgettable characters: Temple Drake, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a local judge; the monster Popeye; Gowan, the frat-boy drunk who \\"learned\\" to handle his alcohol while a student in Virginia; the tragic Ruby; Miss Reba, the Memphis madam; the obnoxious Senator Snopes; Horace Benbow, et al. In the hands of a lesser writer, some of these people would have become stereotypes. Instead we have a remarkable and tragic story of small town justice where a man is convicted for who is is, rather than what he is accused of doing. Horace Benbow, an attorney who reads books, is the moral center of the novel who believes that sometimes a man \\"might do something just because he knew it was right, necessary to the harmony of things that it be done.\\"Unlike many of Faulkner's more difficult works, SANCTUARY is a very straight-forward novel-- an easy but fascinating read. As always, Faulkner's language can be beautifully descriptive: \\"When he waked a narrow rosy pencil of sunlight fell level through the window.\\" And \\"Within the black-and-silver tunnel of cedars fireflies drifted in fatuous pinpricks.\\" He is also razor-sharp with his use of colloquial language. At one point Virgil Snopes says, \\"Look and see if they taken anything of yourn.\\" Virgil and his brother Fonzo provide some much-needed humor in this rather horrific tale. They, young hick barber students, check into a house of ill repute in Memphis, thinking it is an ordinary hotel and then go to another \\"whorehouse\\" for their own earthly delights.While SANCTUARY is certainly not THE SOUND AND THE FURY, it is a necessary read for Faulkner lovers."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"For many readers, \\"Sanctuary\\" doesn't seem to fit into Faulkner's canon. Although the prose is recognizably his, the tone and subject matter seem more appropriate to the genre of pulp fiction--closer to Hammett than to O'Connor. And, for the time it was published, it is shockingly gruesome and graphic. (Arnold Bennett said that it was a \\"terrible\\" book and \\"a great novel.\\") Once you figure out who everyone is and what's going on, however, it's an unlikely page-turner. Faulkner presents his tale not simply as a mystery but as a puzzle of characters who can barely figure out their own roles and who challenge the reader to sort out their storiesThe central plot revolves around Temple Drake, a well-off, fast-living college student who gets wowed by Gowan Stevens, a handsome young alcoholic who takes her to the inaccessible estate of a backwoods bootlegger. Gowan soon passes out, and the traumatized Temple suddenly understands she is stuck in a situation from which she can't easily extract herself--and her circumstances worsen when Gowan abandons her to the gangsters and drunks bumming around the house.Even though it was published after \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" which he completed at the end of 1929, \\"Sanctuary\\" could be considered Faulkner's fifth novel rather than his sixth. Earlier that year, he sent the manuscript for \\"Sanctuary\\" to his publisher. It seems likely he had been toying with it in some form for quite a while, since at least one passage has been found in his papers with a date of 1925.There are a number of colorful tales surrounding the history of this book's publication--some of them possibly apocryphal and probably invented by Faulkner himself. (A fuller accounting can be found in Joseph Blotner's invaluable biography of Faulkner.) Faulkner later wrote that he \\"invented the most horrific tale I could imagine,\\" and he claimed that his publisher told him after reading it, \\"Good God, I can't publish this. We'd both be in jail.\\" Whatever the reason for the delay, the publisher changed his mind and--to Faulkner's surprise--ultimately set the book into galleys. The interval of nearly two years convinced Faulkner that the book couldn't be published in its current form, so he heavily revised and rearranged the book in proof.Faulkner also claimed that he \\"began to think of books in terms of possible money.\\" Although the book did indeed sell well--better than any of his books until \\"The Wild Palms\\"--some scholars contend that Faulkner is being somewhat coy about his motives for writing this particular book. (Reading his correspondence, one gets the impression that that he was always writing with an eye towards his financial situation.)So how is it? The easy answer is that \\"Sanctuary\\" is not \\"Sound and the Fury,\\" \\"As I Lay Dying,\\" or \\"Light in August.\\" But judged as a piece of noir, I think it's as good as the best Depression-era crime novels. As in many of Faulkner's other books, the story leaps back and forth across time, and often the same scene is described from the perspective of different characters. Although the use of jump cuts, flashbacks, and misdirection can be a challenge, I thought the technique heightened the suspense and made the characters more intriguing. Faulkner probably could not have published this book if he had described its scenes more straightforwardly; even the end requires close reading to figure out exactly what happened to Temple at the bootlegger's homestead (in part because it's so horrific). If you like the type of book that makes you turn back through the pages digging up the clues you missed along the way, I'd recommend this one."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"William Faulkner stands in my mind with only a few authors whose writing does not seem like writing. His novels seem more moments of real life. While I was reading &quot;Sanctuary&quot; you forget you are reading a book and the characters take on a virtual reality in your mind. Like all of Faulkner's books, this one is disorienting at first, simply by the author's strength of vision. The main plot revolves around Temple Drake, a coquettish college girl who likes to secretly sneak out of her college dorm to attend dances. One of her rides back from one of these dances is a boy named Gowan Stevens. He decides to stop off at an illegal moonshine operation and promptly sets about getting drunk. Temple is trapped at the house surrounded by all sorts of shady characters you would associate with such an operation. One of these is named Popeye, and trust me he is not a hero, he rapes Temple. One of the things I found slightly disturbing was the sense that Temple is a flirt and you get the sense that Faulkner felt that eventually some sex crime was going to be committed against her. She could get away with things around college boys but she fails to realize that with criminals, its a very bad move. It's the beginning of her great moral slide that was always just waiting to happen. There are other subplots going on around it. The owner of the moonshine operation is a convict and his wife supported herself through prostitution while he was in the joint, which is a source of tension between them. Horace Benbow is a lawyer who has left his wife simply because he recognizes the hollowness of his marriage. These characters are connected by the crime against Temple. The depressing thing about this novel is that noone really gets a sanctuary. The ending is not pretty. That's what makes it so powerful and so real. This book is right up there with Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky in sheer power of vision."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Even when Faulkner is writing to sell books, as he admits he is doing with \\"Sanctuary,\\" the master of impressionistic Southern fiction can be quite sublime. The novel's racy subject matter and lightning-strike narrative have the feel of pulp fiction, but the rich descriptions and illustrious prose reveal that Faulkner never strays far from the top of his form. As expected, its base locale is Mississippi's Yoknapatawpha County, that endless wellspring of Faulkner's imagination.It's prohibition, and business is good for moonshiners like Lee Goodwin, living in a large but decrepit antebellum house with his \\"wife\\" Ruby and baby son, who is kept in a box hidden behind the stove to protect him from rats. Goodwin, while not a bad man himself, associates with a number of hoodlums, including a sympathetic young man named Tommy and a cruel cretin called Popeye who harbors a nasty secret about his past and his libido.One night, a drunk named Gowan Stevens and his girlfriend Temple Drake, the privileged daughter of a judge in Jackson and a college girl with a wild side, get into a car accident and end up spending the night at Goodwin's house, where Gowan had been planning to buy some whiskey. Temple, warned by Ruby that the house is no place for a girl like her, and abandoned by Gowan the next day, finds herself in a nightmarish predicament when Popeye brutally robs her of whatever innocence she had, drives her to Memphis, and puts her up at a cathouse fronting as a respectable hotel, run by a careworn but charitable madam named Miss Reba.But Popeye and Temple have to answer for the murder of Tommy, who was shot around the time they left. Goodwin gets arrested, and a friendly lawyer named Horace Benbow, himself on vacation from his nagging wife, decides to defend him at the trial. This leads to some detective work to find Temple, who is being held prisoner by Popeye in that Memphis hotel and would provide valuable witness testimony. The manner in which Benbow manages to do this proves Faulkner's skill in characterization, as he employs two members of the infamous Snopes family to comic as well as narrative effect.\\"Sanctuary\\" has two very memorable morbid, but poetic, images: the first involving Flaubert's doomed Madame Bovary, of all people; and the second describing a funeral for a small-time hoodlum that is transformed into a bacchanalian celebration by the fatalistic sensibilities of the Memphis underworld. This is a scene which could be conjured only by a William Faulkner (or a Nathanael West).This novel is an odd brew. It feels messy yet still exhibits an unquestionable professionalism; its characters are grotesque but all the more interesting because of it. Faulkner's writing is never explicit; you must be attentive to clues and details because you'll be expected to piece together the puzzle later. This is the main challenge confronting his readers, but understanding Faulkner means being willing to accept this challenge."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"&quot;Sanctuary&quot; has a double meaning in this novel -- the sanctuary we seek against the cruel events that occur in life and sanctuary against those things in ourselves that are most primitive, volatile and evil. Faulkner's characters here are in search of sanctuary in both meanings, although the theme is not well-developed and the plot is so misshapen that it detracts from the overall impact of the main theme.&quot;Sanctuary&quot; is Faulkner's stab at writing noir-ish detective fiction. You'd figure he would take to the genre like a duck to water (at least I did) given its emphasis on mood, place and moral struggle. All of these elements show up in the novel, but haphazardly. I think Faulkner was probably prevented from writing the noir novel he really wanted by the spirit of the times, which weren't supportive of the degree of brutality he intended to display in the novel (We get a glimpse of this when we see the stained corncob that Popeye used to violate Temple Drake). He would later half-heartedly repudiate &quot;Sanctuary&quot; as a failed attempt to make some money, an excuse probably designed to get his neighbors in Oxford, Miss., off his back and to satisfy the sob sisters in the national media who were ready to crucify him for writing a novel containing violence of almost pornographic intensity.When reading &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; think about how each one of the characters -- save for Popeye, Mrs. Goodwin and DA Eustace Graham -- loses himself or herself in some form of self-delusion to avoid dwelling on the worst parts of their own character and existence. Even Horace Benbow's courageous decision to defend Mr. Graham against charges of murder is little more than an attempt to distract himself from his marital woes and the fact that he is so obviously out of place in his own home town now.&quot;Sanctuary&quot; could have been Faulkner's masterpiece and some current-day critics suggest that perhaps it is. It's not. Faulkner should have re-written the book, smoothed the plot, fleshed out the characters far more than they are in the current text and allowed for a more leisurely examination of man's struggle for safe haven, both physically and spiritually. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is a very powerful examination of the evil that men and women do and, in that sense, it is a very Catholic novel. I would not recommend its use in high school or lower-level college undergraduate survey courses. It's simply too intricate to be useful for students at those levels. But for an upper-level course in American lit, American culture, religion or philosophy, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; is an appropriate text with quite a bit to say about modern man and the chains that bind his soul."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"While _Heart Of Darkness_ portrays the bleakness of the unchecked human spirit, it is Faulkner's _Sanctuary_ that places it squarely in our noses, our ears, our eyes as well as our hearts and souls. In this purely American novel we see not &quot;adventurers&quot; in Conrad's traditional sense, but American debutantes causually thrust into the orbit of the Memphis Prohibition underworld.As in _Sound and the Fury_ Faulkner uses his &quot;shadow of the branch&quot; approach to the narrative keeping the reader guessing as to what actually takes place at the &quot;Frenchman's Place&quot;; and when the reader finally &quot;gets it&quot; -- or, more accurately -- when this reader &quot;got it,&quot; the experience was as shocking as anything to be seen in Doestoyevsky, Conrad or Bauldelaire.I wrote my thesis on this work five years ago and its effect on me, as I flippantly spew these remarks are as vivid as the first time I encountered Popeye with his face like &quot;tin,&quot; and Temple Drake.Highly recommended for those not afraid of impingement, because _Sanctuary_ will impinge on whatever the reader's threshold for true darkness and horror may be."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"This novel was written in perhaps Faulkner's most creative period. Simultaneously, he was writing, re-writing, or revising The Sound and the Fury, Flags in the Dust (Sartoris), As I Lay Dying, and several major short stories. It is not surprising that elements of these other works find their way into Sanctuary. Although Faulkner maligned the original text and the published novel quickly gained a reputation for senationalism and a certain lasciviousness, it is an important work which probably ranks right behind the author's masterpieces.When Faulkner began to revise the galleys of the original text, he was supposed to have been upset at the poor quality of the novel and concerned about possible legal suits from a puritanical reading public. His revision was to remedy both deficiencies. However, if a comparison between the original and revised text is made it becomes clear that Faulkner left all the lasciviousness in but worked hard to change the way in which the narrative was told. In the original version, flashback was the main instrument of narration (indeed, in many cases flashback within flashbacks) and bore an uncanny similarity to the style of Flags in the Dust (the original text of Sartoris). The revised version attains something of the feel of a detective novel: straightforward prose with concrete nouns and strong verbs, action, stock characters and sex.However, when Faulkner re-worked his galleys and centered the action around Temple Drake, the character of Horace Benbow is relegated to a supporting role and I think that in the end, this change in emphasis robbed the novel of some of its complexity and deprived readers of some of Faulkner's most serpentine prose, prose as thick and profound as the wisteria Faulkner describes growing around the eaves of the Benbow family home."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Imagine it's 1929 and you're reading a book about bootlegging, couples living in sin, rape, whorehouses, with near-explicit sex scenes. Faulkner's SANCTUARY must have been mind-blowing to the genteel masses. They were reading material that they still don't show on network television today, in an age where such things are so commonly discussed in the media that we hardly look sideways at it. This book must have arrived like an explosion, shaking the sensibilities of readers everywhere, daring booksellers to put it on their shelves.SANCTUARY is not an easy book. You'll find yourself, if you're like me, rereading passages to understand exactly what's going on. The characters, though precisely described, can be difficult to picture in your mind, especially as we move further away from the Jazz Age, with its unusual expressions, costume, and mores. Imagine Tennessee and Mississippi when cars were relatively new to the roads, when the various social strata -- some wearing suits, some overalls -- began mixing together more easily. Imagine being a teenage girl acting as a woman trapped in a moonshiner's shack, far away from the protection of her home, encountering men like creatures in a horrific play who drink liquor and watch her lie under the covers, her only protector passed out beside her.Faulkner's reintroduced introduction is a godsend that will help you decipher the book somewhat. The editor's notes at the end of the book will help you understand much of the jargon and the motivation of the characters.A good read in any age."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"SANCTUARY is, by all standards, an odd book. A minor work by a major talent, it blends elements of Greek tragedy and tawdry potboiler to create an unusual amalgam. Faulkner himself was quite up front about it being his great attempt to write a bestseller, lathing the book with a bevy of cheap effects, yet still to imbuing page after page with one striking phrase after another.Although not major Faulkner, it is still Faulkner, and is definitely worth reading. It is set in Yoknapatawpha county, and features many characters who either appear in other books or whose relatives appear in other books. Furthermore, the key female character in the book, Temple Drake, reappears as the major character in REQUIEM FOR A NUN, written twenty years after this one. While I do not rate this anywhere nearly as highly as many of his other books, being something of an oddity, it is nonetheless absolutely not a waste of time. While there are many sensationalist elements, there are still many magnificent sentences that read more like poetry than prose, and many of the characters are memorable.If one is wanting to read only one or two books by Faulkner, I would not recommend this one. I would recommend instead AS I LAY DYING or, if one is feeling more ambitious, ABSALOM, ABSALOM. But if one is planning on reading all of the major works of Faulkner, then this is a book one should not skip. Minor Faulkner is better than the major works of many other writers."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"In \\"Wild Palms\\" it was a manifest literary technique, but in \\"Sanctuary\\" it's a desperate attempt to weave together a story from different plotlines. I am a Faulkner buff, and have always felt tricked by this one: everything that goes on at \\"the house\\" prior to the \\"event\\" (I'm trying not to give too much away) is some of the master's best. It is a world apart, relating not to \\"the south\\", as some wrote, nor to any other referent world; its inherent danger and unexpectedness and possibilities depend on that. Alas, the story then focuses on the character that it ultimately chose for its true protagonist, a well-intentioned yet incompetent lawyer (you'll recognize him from other works -- F really overplayed this character), and an uninteresting one at that. As soon as the narrative moves into the cities it looses its force, revived at times only by such comic giveaways as the provincial youngsters who frequent a brothel in Memphis, never realizing that they reside in another. I can almost imagine Faulkner cutting & pasting that from some draft, soberly thinking, \\"I got to liven this up a bit\\". And it goes from bad to worse. All that befalls Popeye after his last encounter with Red seems artificial; it recalls Hollywood's standards for treating villains, owing more to comodification of morality than to narrative integrity. Do we learn something about Popeye that makes him a more interesting character than in the first part? Hardly. Yet with all of that, the writing itself was rarely surpassed in American prose. Faulkner has that uncanny ability to get us involved in his nontransparent language all the while keeping it away from the fore, first and foremost using it to tell his story (as opposed to Joyce or Dickens). For that alone this book is a joy; but on the narrative scale one feels, ultimately, cheated out of a good story."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Perhaps it is because I get extremely bored when I read \\"stream of conscious\\" types of books. This book simply bored me to death. The technique is written in prose form, I respect it, to some degrees, it is a type of art. However, the backcover of this book did a poor job of explaining what this book was supposed to convey. Maybe it is because there's nothing to review about! All said, this book showed the heart of evil as well as violence through the bleak characters of Popeye, Gowan and Red. They kidnapped the promiscous girl named Temple and took her to Memphis, where we meet a even more feared underground criminal gangs and bootleggars.Overall, I'm really disappointed in this book because I thought that William Faulkner, one of the best writers in the last century, should've done better. A lot of has to do with the style that he writes in, but overall, a very boring book."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Faulkner may be an author with many accolades, and maybe some of his other books are brilliant. Sanctuary is just bad.Let's just start with the title. Why is it called Sanctuary, what is the sanctuary he refers to? Frenchman's Bend, the Memphis brothel, Benbow's house, the jail or the jardin du Luxembourg in Paris? It never comes out; personally I think it's just a ominous, pretentious title, and that Faulkner might have just as well called his book \\"Ikebana in 30 days\\".To give you another example, in the first scene two men meet at a fountain in the middle of nowhere, and Faulkner tells us that, after exchanging a few tense words, they just sit there and stare at each other for literally two hours. What? Why? Which drugs are they on? Again, it never comes out. That scene alone is so absurd that it threw me completely out of the book, and Faulkner just packs in scenes like that.I was particularly disappointed by the characters. One of the reasons I read this book is because I had heard that Temple Drake was a legendary character and one of the most intriguing females in literary history, but she was a particular dud. Faulkner describes her as a pretty 17-year-old who has many dates but is still a virgin. He then attributes several extreme behaviours to her -- after being raped she suddenly becomes a languid gangster moll and then transmogrifies back into a daddy's girl. I think Faulkner is just trying to bluff his readers by dishing up the most outlandish, far-out, tallest tales he could think of to shock them into submission. And at the same time he is trying really hard to blame the victim, trying to turn this clearly victimised girl into a men-eating femme fatale, when in fact her behaviour only appears erratic because of the author's complete lack of writing skills.Then the Southrons -- about as subtle as Cletus and Brandine (\\"Meet my wife and sister!\\") out of The Simpsons. There's the corrupt senator, the gospel-singing negroes, the fat madam, the local lynchmob and other repulsive stereotypes. The only variation here is that the inbred degenerate suffers from innate syphillis instead of inbreeding this time, and is variously described as a colossal pervert, dreamboat, successful gangster and loving son.I had read that Faulkner was an alcoholic, and there is a lot of drinking going on in the book, so I at least expected him to be good at those scenes. But again, zero credibility. Faulkner never makes any attempt to convey the notion of drinking to excess, and is probably unable to do so even if he had tried. It's all superficial comic-book clich&eacute;s.Faulkner employs a style of writing which is called \\"Stream Of Consciousness\\". What this boils down to is terrible dialogues, drawn-out tedious descriptions and the most ludicrous similes I have come across in a long while. Most of the time it is very difficult to figure out what is going on, often it is impossible, and other times it makes absolutely no sense. Faulkner seems to be getting a kick out of describing tedious minutiae in an almost psychedelic way, and then making the dialogues intentionally dire. It all boils down to a massive disregard for the reader.Faulkner also likes to pepper his writing with an intentionally opaque and cruelly arcane vocabulary, which makes the reading even more of a slog. In fact, Sanctuary is the only example I know for the usage of the word \\"holocaust\\" prior to the Nazi genocide of the European Jews, namely -- to also give you a taste of his style -- in this description: \\"[their] puffy faces [were] washed lightly over as with the paling ultimate stain of a holocaust\\". In case you wondered, you have just read a description of sleeping train passengers.I'll come to the end. Sanctuary is an awful book without any redeeming virtues. It's a mess. It is so awful that it is difficult to believe, especially coming from someone who is widely regarded as one of the greatest American authors. The best thing I could say about it is that in maybe three or four scenes, Faulkner gets a sort of flow together and the reading becomes fluent for a few pages, but that's it.Thanks for reading my review."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Ok, so everyone has for years told me how great a writer William Faulkner was. So, I read As I Lay Dying- mediocre at best, and no real strengths at characterization are revealed. Instead, a bunch of yokel stereotypes. So, I mark that off as just one of those things. Then I read his Collected Stories. Atrocious! Nothing but stereotypes in every tale. The Southern grotesques are not as noxious as in, say, Flannery O'Connor, but the tales are all wooden, dull, and generally- a mess! So, I read Sanctuary, which comes with the preface that it was Faulkner's \`deliberately commercial' novel, and the one that \`broke him' to readers. So, I think if the high literature of As I Lay Dying, and his acclaimed short stories, is bad then, perhaps, the real gem lies in his \`commercial' novel.O for three! What this book was was The Texas Chainsaw Massacre before that film- except for the chainsaw, and not being set in Texas. This has got to be one of the worst books ever penned, and all the more egregious because, despite its being \`commercial', it's still the province of a high fictionist! The characters are even more stereotyped than in As I Lay Dying, and the plot revolves around the kidnapping of a judge's daughter and a slew of murders. Now, for those of you wondering which Texas Chainsaw Massacre I was referring to, the 1974 Tobe Hooper original, or the 2003 remake with nymphet Jessica Biel, I can state it does not really matter, but let me choose the latter, since that film was merely a reason to show off the nubile Ms. Biel's fabulous form and healthy wet t shirted bosom....The title's meaning is multifarious, and rather obvious, since it's the one thing none of the cretins within the book get. So what? Mickey Spillane crafted much more interesting scenarios two decades later, and Mike Hammer would have jackbooted Popeye inside of a page of meeting him. In the end, no lessons are learned, Temple perdures, and the last page or so of the book ends very poetically. But, it's simply air spray freshener used on a litter box. The odor underneath still permeates.I will have to read The Sound And The Fury, but I've given up on having any high expectations for it. Perhaps, that's the key, and I will be pleasantly surprised, although I doubt it will change my overall view of Faulkner as one of the most grotesquely overrated writers of all time. He constipates me with his plodding narratives, ridiculously stilted conversations, and outrageously thin plot machinations. I need an enema after all that, but sans that- pass the corn cob!"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"...since that's where Faulkner leaves us at the end of the book.I was captivated by this book and its seedy, amoral characters but what starts out to be an exciting story of murder and depravity dissipates toward the end with characters re-emerging from nowhere or disappearing without meaning. This is all the more frustrating in that Faulkner could have written one of the best murder trial narratives ever. The loose ends are never really tied up.If only he had re-written this \\"potboiler\\" later and given the ending more depth and meaning...but that could probably be said about a lot of books."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"This was my second shot at trying to appreciate William Faulkner. I read Light in August a few years back and gave it 3 stars. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck, a contemporary of Faulkner's, who is often compared to Faulkner. Some reviews have said if you like Steinbeck you will like Faulkner. I disagree. Steinbeck writes clear and concise stories that are carried by his creativity and a reflection of the life he led. To describe Faulkner's style in Sanctuary, I will borrow from another review that said it was \\"oblique and distracting\\". I finished the story with a half-hearted understanding of what I had just read. By reading all of the other reviews on this site I now understand so much more about the book. That's a problem, I don't connect with Faulkner...."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I love it. The venality and corruption portrayed in this book are shivery and endlessly thought-provoking, with the character of Temple Drake as its fascinating focus. Faulkner outdid himself with Temple, a spoiled, capricious and ultimately abused young woman who becomes fed like a baby vampire on the seedy whorehouse where she is captive. The best thing about Sanctuary is, though, we never really know who she was before this pass. Virgin or whore?"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"We can't have any corn cobs lying around.If you've read the book, you know what I'm alluding to.Sanctuary is a grimey novel. It deals with grimey people in grimey situations. The story is just so weird; it's almost surrealistic.SpoilersTemple Drake is the 17 year old daughter of a judge. She is dating a guy named Gowan Stephens who is a drunk. They end up at some \\"in the middle of nowhere\\" house owned by a guy named Lee Goodwin in an attempt for Gowan to get more illegal liquor. Lee Goodwin is a shady character, but nice compared to the company he keeps. Gowan deserts Temple more than once: at first by being passed out from drinking, and then by completely leaving to go home. Once alone, Temple is at the mercy of the shady characters, specifically Popeye. Popeye hasn't had his spinach, therefore he is impotent, mentally and sexually. Temple is attacked and kidnapped by Popeye after witnessing a murder, and is forced into a brothel where she prostitutes herself and hooks up with more shady characters.This is just a partial summary of the story. There is much more concerning Lee Goodwin, his girlfriend Ruby, and a lawyer named Benbow who has deserted his family.Bottom Line: A twisted tale woven by a literary master who needed to write something sensationalistic in order to make some money. Certainly not one of his best, but certainly not terrible."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Excellent book. I had a little difficulty following the characters at first but I couldn't put the book down. Unlike a lot of todays authors he doesn't take sides but presents life in the raw."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"William Faulkner is one of my favorite authors. He might just be my favorite. I want to get that out of the way first off. After reading The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, and Light in August, I truly believed that he could do no wrong. Those are three spectacular masterpieces, while Sanctuary is not. It begins with a promising start and then just comes unglued and unhinged in the end. Much of the material is still very fascinating and original, but if you really want to see what Faulkner is all about, this would not be the book to start with.The novel opens beautifully along the banks of a river on a sunny day. A lawyer named Horace Benbow has just left his wife and is taking a walk in the woods. A strong black man named Popeye watches him carefully as he drinks water from the stream. Benbow is tired and Popeye offers to take him back and get him a drink at their cabin.In the cabin, we are introduced to some of the characters we will get to know in the course of the novel. Ruby, the outspoken and abused wife of a man named Goodwin. Goodwin owns the cabin and runs an illegal bootlegging business. We also meet Tommy, a compassionate and somewhat slow thinking man. The lawyer, Horace, thanks them for the drink and travels back to his sister's house in town.The next scene involves a wild, promiscuous girl named Temple Drake. She is waiting at the train station for her alcoholic \\"boyfriend\\" to show up. Temple seems to be attracted to the scummy men. She is a daughter of a prominent judge and has just been kicked out of school for curfew violations and plans to run off with her somewhat boyfriend named Gowan. On their way out of town together, Gowan drinks too much and crashes into a tree. Popeye, the black man from the beginning of the story, sees it all happen. He takes them up to the cabin again.Once there, everything goes wrong. Ruby warns her to leave. Gowan ends up drinking himself to a stupor and eventually blacks out after being beaten by Goodwin and his friend Van. Temple takes shelter in an old barn room during the whole incident and is scared to leave. Goodwin and Van end up dragging a passed out Gowan into the barn room with her. Gowan wakes up early in the morning, and in shame, abandons Temple at the cabin.Temple tells Tommy (the slow thinking, compassionate man), to keep an eye out for anyone that comes near the barn room. Popeye, however, doesn't take heed and ends up shooting Tommy in the back of the head and kidnaps the teenager Temple. He takes her to a whorehouse on the other side of town.Goodwin, meanwhile, discovers that Tommy is dead and calls for the sheriff. The sheriff, ironically, throws Goodwin in jail for the murder of Tommy since Popeye has fled the scene. Goodwin enlists the services of the lawyer Benbow which we met at the beginning of the story. Benbow then starts an investigation as the whereabouts of Temple, how to find a place for Goodwin's wife to stay, and how to clear his client of murder.After that, everything gets really fuzzy after such a promising and interesting start. The last 60 pages of the story just seem to fall apart. It isn't really like Faulkner to do something like that. We do find out where Temple is being hidden, but there seems to be some contradictions in her character. When she first got kidnapped, she seemed like a frightened young women. Later on when we meet her, she is just a drunk and does not seem to care whether or not she was kidnapped. I thought this was a major character flaw.Also, near the end of a novel a key sequence of tragic events that occur (at least I think they do), are muffled and unfocused by Faulkner's hazy description. These passages left me confused at they did not mesh well with what had been told previously. Up until this point, this was a fairly straight forward and easy to understand tale. At the end, everything became so overwrought with unnecessary symbolism and description that I couldn't get a firm grasp as to what was really going on. The moments that should have been the most powerful were kind of like duds. If Faulkner would have just stayed consistent, this could have been another one of his masterpieces.Now all of this sounds like I am tearing the novel apart. I'm not. The set up is spectacular. Once again, Faulkner throws in his patented jaw dropping description, which blazes with originality and style. The story itself is very interesting and entertaining. It is also fairly easy to grasp, (until the end that is).I guess what I am getting at is that this is a very well written, but extremely uneven novel. It doesn't have the same depth and power of his previous works I have read. It can be dark, disturbing, at brilliant one moment, and the next moment be flawed with contradictions and inconsistency. Overall, I would recommend Sanctuary, but a huge disappointment compared with some of his other works.. If you want to see the real, genius Faulkner at work, you might just skip this one. Hopefully, it was just a one time small misstep by a real literary master.Grade: B"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"este es el libro mas comercial escrito por faulkner y por eso creo que es el mas facil de leer, ya que el autor estaba pensando en un publico a la hora de escribir antes de que dijera su famosa frase..... un dia me encerre y me olvide de los criticos y del publico y empeze a escribir para mi mismo ....... este libro es mas de horror que del sur, aunque ya muestra personajes que apareceran en otras historias suyas. es excelente y uno de los mas faciles de entender es muy recomendable para quien quiera iniciar una lectura sobre faulner.....LUIS MENDEZ crazzyteacher@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Ripoff, a cassette, that has to have a player that has a funtion that doesn't exsist anymore!

Far too often you are required to reread and piece together clues to see who is talking and what is happening. There is no flow, no rhythm, which is fine if you have moments of reward along the way, or the big reward at the end. This doesn't happen and the work survives, as well as it does, simply by a genius pulling occasional tricks out of his bag to keep it going. It reads like the first draft of a bad idea, written by a great writer. Shame on you, Bill! Flannery O'Connor is much better at this sort of thing and doesn't confuse you too much in the process.This work screams for a tough editor. On the second page there is this sentence: \\"They squatted so, facing one another across the spring, for two hours.\\" Faulkner neglects to say where these two gentlemen received their superhuman powers, but details like these (and the work is full of them) diminish the overall effect. All the ingredients are here for a great tale, but the necessary design never happened, and the result is a mildly interesting mess.Far more entertaining are the usual five-star cudos of those throwing themselves on the Faulkner alter, their minds wretching out of shape to bring dignity and order to all this. I kept wondering--where did they get their version of the book? There has to be accountibility, even from a master."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"There are too many Southern book to name them all, and even so, not all of them are worth mentioning. But of the many I've come across over the years, a few stand out as absolutely remarkable achievements. They are:SanctuaryThe Heart is a Lonely HunterThe Bark of the DogwoodFlannery O'Connor collected storiesTo Kill a MockingbirdI realize others may have a different opinion, but for me, these were the best. Of course, my idea of &quot;the best&quot; changes from year to year, but for now, this is it!"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"While Faulkner admitted that this book, alone among the myriad of his writings, was written for money purposes only (and thus has some of his most lurid, sensationalistic, and reactionary prose), it has a very powerful attracting factor: its language. While the convoluted and unclear plotline (which Faulkner himself detested enough to heavily reconstruct, revise at a personal cost of $270 in a time when that was a small fortune) is an obvious detriment, the gorgeous word choice, word placement, and sentence construction nearly make up for it. For a short example, I will submit the final sentence: &quot;She closed the compact and from beneath her smart new hat she seemed to follow with her eyes the waves of music, to dissolve into the dying brasses, across the pool and the opposite semicircle of trees where at sombre intervals the dead tranquil queens in stained marble mused, and on into the sky lying prone and vanquished in the embrace of the season of rain and death.&q! uot; Simply gorgeous; but the unconvincing story of rape, murder, lynching, a bumbling lawyer, a dangerous bootlegger from Memphis whose entire past history and motivation is described in 4 or 5 of the final pages, and many others can seem at times very outlandish and hard to follow, not from intrinsic, Faulknerian difficulty to read, but because of poor detail and a shallow style of writing. Characters have very little depth, and are afforded very short monologues when given one at all; Many characters, uncharacteristically, seem to simply not exist below the exterior, under the surface. However, if a reader can bypass this gruff outside layer of paint, Sanctuary has much to offer in way of the English Language."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I read this book because I had never read any Faulkner before. I guess I thought I was missing something in my library or maybe it was time to lay off the nonfiction I mostly read.I found Faulkner's style and word choices difficult at first. He assumes the reader is not lazy and will keep up with him and his stream of consciousness approach. I must admit I read half the book, became disinterested and put it down for several weeks. I then made up my mind to give it a second chance and really enjoyed it.The story is dark and slightly twisted. There are very few admirable characters but I found myself sympathizing with most of the characters. Everyone except maybe Temple Drake has reasons for their misdeeds. I felt Faulkner was trying to convey the injustice of the time and just plain bad luck as reasons for the poor behavior or lack of optimism of the characters.I highly recommend this book. It is gripping and real. The story got to me."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Sanctuary is another brilliant tale that reveals exactly how amazing Faulkner is as an author. This story, by far, is one of the most \\"twisted\\" tales; the unexpected occurs throughout. All through the book, I was in complete awe and in disbelief. By the end of this book, I was in complete shock. What occurred in the last 50 or 100 pages left me in surprise and in utter astonishment. I had never suspected any of what had occurred. How Faulkner was able to conjure up such an original story is beyond me!In short, the story is about the kidnapping of a rich girl of 18 and the trial of a man accused of murder. However, the plots are not nearly this simplistic. Faulkner ventures into life and its evils, revealing that it does not matter how a person is raised, the choice of evil is his own; sometimes those of low class are more true and kind than those of high society. This is a book that, I believe, breaks the shell between class stereotypes.This book is a definite must read. Not only is it unbelievably entertaining, but it also leaves you thinking. It's a fairly easy read despite the various numbers of characters involved (if you are anything like me, you might want to take notes on who's who). In addition, I would also recommend reading this book closely; don't just give it a skim. You might miss something important!"},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I am by no means an expert in literature. Most of my reading is the current fiction of today with some non-fiction mixed in. So I decided to try my hand/mind at something written by one of the great authors of yesteryear. A couple of quick thoughts:- very difficult to read- extremely difficult to know which characters are talking and which are being talked to.- imperative re-reading of sections to see if something was missed, because the plot changed directions and I wasn't on the same page.Now, those things being said, after 100 pages or so, I couldn't wait to get back at the book. The characters are richer and deeper than anything I've read in years (except maybe \\"The Main\\" by Trevanian). The short dialogue segments, the way things are said and not said are not found in today's writings and make the characters stick with you after the book is finished. This writing gives us a very real peek into life it the United States in the late \`20s and early \`30s; it's a slice of Americana that you can hardly read today. The simple text that tells of complex human interactions was beautifully written and therefore I was excited to get to the climax. And then...There was no climax. The book ended, the story ended and nothing. Emptiness. The conclusion was anticlimactic without the climatic part of the story. So I'm giving it a 3, but I was very close to a 4 just for the beauty of the writing. And it isn't beauty for beauty's sake; it is necessary explanation that tells the story slowly and carefully. You get to pick up things about the characters in this short novel that the fiction novel of today couldn't even come close to. As you forget the books quickly that you read with today's authors, you will likely remember Popeye, Tommy and Temple for long while."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"This book is supposed to be Faulkner's potboiler-his answer to the depression era pulps. But Faulkner can't really be trusted with any explanation of his own as the cold, hard truth. He was a fabricator, through and through. For me, this 'potboiler' gets a 3 1/2 stars because it's Faulkner and because it's layered and interesting. But, it's also cheap and brutal. I think he would agree. That's why we get an excuse from Faulkner saying he wrote this relative to the sort of stuff that was being sold and he was looking to make a buck. The story does contain some gems of intricate writing as well as stark visuals and things that take a while to sink in.Temple Drake is a collage girl and she's a tease with boys. She sneaks from her bedroom in her father, the judge's house, and cohorts with older boys. Ultimately, one older boy she sneaks out with, away from college, likes to drink what's available, moonshine. This leads them out into the sticks where the young man, already drunk, crashes his car near the moonshiner's abode-and they keep the area staked out. The couple ends up at the mercy of a house full of degenerate people, mostly men. Temple is freaked out as the men are pretty creepy (with one very memorable character, grandpa-but he's blind and deaf and rattles from here to there in oblivion). Her boyfriend spends the evening, drinking, consorting with and getting beaten up by these roughnecks leaving Temple to fend for herself and even with the help of the house's only other women, Ruby, she doesn't fare well. And this is the story of Temple Drake and the mess she gets herself into.This is a gritty tale and I haven't read much pulp from the 30s to compare it to. I would not recommend Sanctuary for the faint of heart, nor to anyone seeking to unlock the mysteries behind true genious or great literature. It's dark and offers little comfort in the way of the human condition-like Cormac McCarthy, who I also enjoy reading, but again, not for the faint of heart.Faulkner was a great writer, capable of rare sensitivity and if you like him, you may like this, but being written in the 30s doesn't make this a more innocent tale-it's full of mean or down trodden people, hopeless people, and people who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag-if you like that sort of thing, don't say I didn't warn you and if Faulkner starts off a story telling you that a house is full of crimps, spungs and feebs, he is trying to warn you too."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"It's almost hard to describe what this book is about, without giving away spoilers. Sanctuary starts off with a well-to-do man from the city stumbling across a ramshackle farmhouse where moonshine is being made. From there, the story spirals off to include Temple (a rich and popular teenage girl), Mrs. Goodwin (the moonshiner's common law wife), and Popeye (a deranged misfit). Their paths continue to cross as the book goes on; sometimes for good, sometimes for bad.Faulkner is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. I've been slowly reading through his books after tackling all of Cormac McCarthy's work (the two authors are very similiar, in my opinion). One thing with Faulkner, I've found that it works best just to keep on reading even if encounter something that doesn't make sense. Chances are, it will come clear as the story goes on."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Much has been said about the writing of Faulkner. Specifically discussing \\"Sanctuary\\", one might suggest it to be dirty and perhaps gritty. Faulkner never intended it to be a nice heart-warming story. What the story lacks in niceties is compensated for in realism. Though most can not directly identify with the story, most would agree with the portrayal of southern life.The story centers around the kidnapping of Temple Drake. Though it is not a kidnapping in the truest definition, Temple does find herself at the mercy of the feeble-minded Popeye. As bothersome as the crimes against Temple may be, readers will question why she chooses not to leave. The fascinating aspect of the story is this aspect of Temple's character sometimes referred to as Stockholm Syndrome. In this syndrome, the hostage develops loyalty to the hostage-take.Justice is not distributed as some might expect. Even as justice seems apparent, the reader may find himself/herself angry. It would seem easy to just to toss this book aside and hate it. At the same time, there is something compelling about it in the same way people look at the traffic accident at the side of the road."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Sanctuary is a shocking book, especially because of the time period in which it was written. Most modern readers have been desensitized to highly sexual themes, but in the early 30s, this book was a best seller.Here we have the story of a young girl named Temple Drake. She is the daughter of a judge and a tease around town. She dates many men but never loses her morality to them. One day, she meets up with Gowan, a drunk around town. He takes her for a drive, and since he is completely drunk, he smashed up his car. The two take to walking, and they stumble upon a bootlegger's hideout. Gowan proceeds to get drunk there again while Temple fears the nasty stares she gets from the men. The three men Lee, Popeye, and Tommy outnumber the only woman living there. She warns Temple to leave as soon as she can before night falls, but Gowan is uncooperative and Temple too innocent to heed the warning appropriately. She stays, and her life changes forever at the hands of the violent and twisted Popeye.In the meantime, Horace Benbow takes on the murder case against Lee. The whole town is against him succeeding, but Benbow believes in his client's innocence. He even believes in him after discovering Temple's story.I decided to read this book in lieu of seeing the film version starring Miriam Hopkins titled The Story of Temple Drake. It is hard to find, but notoriously scandalous. I imagined that the book would be a good substitute.Unfortunately, the book is significantly slower paced than the average pre-code film, and the descriptions are often slow and erratic. It is sometimes difficult to figure out who is talking and who is doing what. There are also some boring patches due to the writing style. The dismal setting is certainly appropriate, but it brings the mood of the writing down, making it a less exciting read."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Numerous other literary authors have done what Faulkner did in SANCTUARY - set out to write a novel that catered to popular as opposed to literary tastes -- but few have done it as well. After publishing \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", one of the greatest American novels ever, to an underwhelming public reception and desperate for money, Faulkner set out to write something along the lines of the mystery, detective, and gangster pulp fiction of the day. As he later told a friend, \\"I made a thorough and methodical study of everything on the list of best-sellers. When I thought I knew what the public wanted, I decided to give them a little more than they had been getting; stronger and rawer--more brutal. Guts and genitals.\\"By and large he succeeded. SANCTUARY is raw and brutal. It has guts and genitals. And it made a much bigger splash with the buying public, selling within a month more copies than his earlier classics \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and \\"As I Lay Dying\\" had combined. But Faulkner being Faulkner, SANCTUARY is not just a salacious potboiler. It, too, is literature.Here is SANCTUARY in a nutshell (without the ultimate spoiler): Temple Drake, pampered and fatuous seventeen-year-old Ole Miss coed and daughter of a judge, goes off for a weekend of fun with a slick but thoroughly shallow young man, Gowan Stevens. Stevens gets rip-roaring drunk and crashes their car into a tree near a backwoods moonshiner's still. Temple and Gowan have to hole up with the moonshiner and his riffraff cronies, one of whom, Popeye, is a psychopath. The young female ignites the passions of the men, which are further fueled by moonshine. Temple is raped with a corncob, losing her virginity, and one of the men is shot and killed by another of them. Popeye flees, taking Temple with him; he installs her in a brothel in Memphis, run by Reba Rivers. Meanwhile, the police arrest Lee Goodwin and charge him with the murder. Horace Benbow, local attorney and somewhat idealistic intellectual, assumes defense representation of Goodwin and also takes responsibility for Goodwin's common law wife Ruby and their sickly baby boy. With a tip from Clarence Snopes, an intermeddling state senator with roguish charm, Horace tracks Temple down in the brothel in Memphis. He builds his case around her, and the novel culminates when she is called to testify at the trial of Goodwin.In Faulkner's telling, which jumps back and forth in time, the plot can be dizzying and certain key details are obscure. Most of the characters are quite distinctive, though in several cases - especially that of Temple Drake - their motivations don't always make sense. Along with the guts and genitals, there also are several wonderful comedic scenes. And Faulkner tackles several big themes that elevate SANCTUARY well above the usual potboiler. One has to do with the battle between the sexes, on both the physical and the emotional fronts. Temple Drake, flirt though she may be and kept woman she becomes, clearly hates men, beginning with her over-protective father and her four brothers. Horace Benbow is almost pecked to death by women - from his estranged wife Belle, to his sister Narcissa (who in demonic evil is exceeded only by Popeye), to Ruby Goodwin, and even to his step-daughter Little Belle. Another theme has to do with the Southern faades of social appearances and honor. And finally, the overriding theme of the novel is evil, and the inefficacy of intellectual humanism (embodied by Horace Benbow) in confronting it. Sanctuary, indeed.At times, especially early in the novel, the writing is overwrought: people springing here and flinging things there, imparting an annoying herky-jerky feel to everything. But as the novel progresses, the writing improves, some of it as good as anything Faulkner wrote. Particularly striking is Faulkner's masterful use of similes. And then there are passages such as this:\\"He walked quietly up the drive, beginning to smell the honeysuckle from the fence. The house was dark, still, as though it were marooned in space by the ebb of all time. The insects had fallen to a low monotonous pitch, everywhere, nowhere, spent, as though the sound were the chemical agony of a world left stark and dying above the tide-edge of the fluid in which it lived and breathed. The moon stood overhead, but without light; the earth lay beneath, without darkness. He opened the door and felt his way into the room and to the light. The voice of the night--insects, whatever it was--had followed him into the house; he knew suddenly that it was the friction of the earth on its axis, approaching that moment when it must decide to turn on or to remain forever still: a motionless ball in cooling space, across which a thick smell of honeysuckle writhed like cold smoke.\\"Any novel with writing like that is worth reading. SANCTUARY has its minor flaws and it is not quite on the same plane as \\"The Sound and the Fury\\", \\"As I Lay Dying\\", or \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Therefore, perhaps unfairly, I settle at four-and-a-half Amazon stars. Based on a coin flip, I have rounded up to five."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"SANCTUARY is a straightforward narrative that is terrific when Faulkner operates in his comfort zone, which encompasses the first three-quarters of this novel. Then, Faulkner is examining the bogus decorum of the well-to-do, the raw and rugged lives of poor whites, the conniving stupidity of the upwardly mobile, and the helpless innocence of men in worlds governed by female expectations. Within this rich milieu, Faulkner produces a story with power, lyricism, and drama, which he leavens with humor from Miss Jenny, social commentary from Reba, and buffoonery from Clarence Snopes. But then, SANCTUARY hits the homestretch and becomes a feeble courtroom drama. In the end, Faulkner ties everything together; but, IMO, the fates of several characters seem arbitrary.There are many reasons to read SANCTUARY. These include Faulkner's amazing rendering of the cluelessness lawyer Clarence Benbow, whose simple decency is thwarted by the worldview of Southern women; the sheer terror of the shallow Temple Drake, whose date with a young dipsomaniacal gentleman becomes a nightmare; and the hilarious interplay at Reba's brothel, where ideas of proper behavior are twisted but familiar. And, there is Bill's great writing. Here, for example, is the decent Benbow's disdainful reaction to the oily Snopes:\\"Snopes began to speak in his harsh, assertive voice. There emerged gradually a picture of stupid chicanery and petty corruption for stupid and petty ends, conducted principally in hotel rooms...\\"SANCTUARY does have brutal aspects, which emanate from the malfeasant bootlegger Popeye and the stupidity of mob justice. But you know what? Faulkner took Popeye's marginal and malevolent presence and the dynamic of the mob, tweaked them, and then put them at the center of the great LIGHT IN AUGUST. Maybe Bill (or his society) wasn't quite ready for his themes in SANCTUARY, even though he had already written masterpieces.Faulkner first used Horace Benbow, his sister Narcissa, and Miss Jenny, as well as the Old Frenchman place where Popeye operated, in FLAGS IN THE DUST. This, or the associated SARTORIS, will probably be my next Faulkner novel.Recommended."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Sanctuary is a brutal novel - a starkly misanthropic novel that spares no one, no type, and no clinging idealism. By the author's description, it is a \`potboiler', and \`the most horrific tale I could imagine,' written with an eye specifically toward financial interests after the lackluster success of AS I LAY DYING and THE SOUND AND THE FURY. Yet there is no doubt that Faulkner's talent transforms the sensationalistic nature of the story into a pitiless tour de force - but to what purpose? Some may see the tale as a symbolic representation of the South's decay and corruption, and, as far as any microscopic character study can stand in for national types, they would probably be correct to do so. But regardless of its power or literary skillfulness - SANCTUARY strikes me as an author lashing out; the reason why would only be guesswork.ErskineCaldwel'smost famous works have a going-to-the-zoo feeling about them (\`See the funny, funny Southerners') which also make them seem like caricatures, but SANCTUARY skips pity and condescension; instead, it is intent on confirming the idea of total Southern blight and putrefaction. Temple Drake, a young, flighty coed from Oxford slips away from a school outing to keep a date with a burgeoning alcoholic named Gowan Stevens, who then decides to stop at bootlegger Lee Goodwin's place for more alcohol. In doing so, he wrecks the car, and the two are marooned at the bootlegger's home. Gowan eventually abandons Temple to the unsavory crew residing at Goodwin's - murder and sexual battery ensue. Temple is then forced to go to Memphis with one of the bootlegger's cronies, the psychopathic Popeye, who sets her up in a brothel for his own amusement, and where the girl's corruption is nearly completed. Meanwhile, Lee Goodwin is wrongfully charged in the murder that happened on his place, and lawyer Horace Benbow, who feels he owes a debt to the Goodwins, agrees to defend him. Key to the defense is the girl, Temple, yet when he finds her, Benbow will regret ever having brought her back to testify.Far more than TOBACCO ROAD, the novel I think of most after reading SANCTUARY isBlood Meridian, though to be sure, Faulkner's 1930's America would never stand for anything as explicit as McCarthy's prose. (Even still, Faulkner's publisher told him they'd both go to jail if he published the manuscript.) And McCarthy's effort is probably as far removed from SANCTUARY in brutality as Faulkner's is from his contemporaries. Still, it isn't the type of inhumanity in which they are similar, but the unsparing manner of relating it, each conjuring up a hybrid form of lyric violence that I've simply never seen anywhere else. (Most efforts in this direction end up cartoonish rather than chilling.)And yet...while I believe there is a core meaning behind BLOOD MERIDIAN, SANCTUARY fails to meet that standard. It is what it is - perhaps the best ever at what it is - but I can't find any conclusions to take away from it. My experience in the South tells me that Faulkner has chosen to dwell only on a portion of the picture, but yet to represent it as if it is complete. Skill and craftsmanship carry the novel a long, long way, but the price Faulkner extracts from Yoknapatawpha - for whatever reason - is extreme. Even with its faults, I still recommend it, but it fall short of what he attempts in the other novel of his which I've read,Intruder in the Dust. Reader's accustomed to Faulkner's style from that novel, or that similar inThe Hamlet, may well be surprised at the author's relative straightforwardness here - but that in no way dulls the force of the events. Four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"The ending here is completely brilliant -- it left me cold like almost no other book I have ever read. Whenever I think of this novel, I recall the ending and get chills. This is one of Faulkner's best works."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Sanctuary is a good starter for introducing people to Faulkner. My all time favorite from Faulkner is Absolom,Absolom but this seems very difficult for people to follow. I grew up in the South, the story in Sanctuary could have truly happened 40 years ago in any community in the South. The title is misleading, none of the characters ever find sanctuary, there is no place within the book that could be called a sanctuary."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"If I told you to read a book by Faulkner you'd probably start imagining crazy old ladies and barn-burnings and usually you'd be right. Not this time. There's only one appearance by a member of the Snopes family and that's late in the book. But you won't miss them. Inside this book is a world where no one is quite as they seem from debutantes to moonshiners. This book reads more like a Dashiel Hammett than anything else and with rape, murder, lynching, and corruption there's something for everyone. Except a lot of Snopes."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"One of Faulkner's fastest moving and most exciting tales, written in lucid and brilliant prose thay will hit you between the eyes."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"In reading this book, I find myself crystallizing so many of the impressions of Faulkner that I've been kicking around the past year in which I've been consistently reading him. Bottom line is: I don't like him. I've tried. But I don't like him. He offers these flashes of excellence, only to bog the whole thing down in artistic blather that muddies his own water. In Sanctuary, he wrote \\"the most horrible story he could think of\\" in an attempt to sell books out of sheer controversy. It *is* a horrible story, in so many ways, but it also presents a rather good portrait of Faulkner in composite. Here we have humanity at its worst, but here we also find insight into that humanity. Here we have excellent characters, but we also find them flashing on the page, only be buried beneath the weight of Faulkner's prose (which, ironically, is at its clearest in this book). In the end, Sanctuary feels like a titillating, shameless attempt at sales, which offers only a few bright moments in the midst of both its frustrating style and its salacious debauchery."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I started reading this book and at first was interesting but after a while I just couldn't get into it. Many times I haven't been able to get into a book and later on I breeze through. It was kind of depressing after awhile. Kind of a brutal book."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"Sanctuary is a hard-boiled, in-your-face novel that explores human ambivalence and the slippery slope it paves to evil. Reads well so many decades since release and remains relevant. No doubt: A classic."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I have read my fair share of Faulkner although I am hardly a devotee. My main positive reference to him is concerning his role in the screenwriting of one of my favorite films- \\"To Have or To Have Not\\" with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. I have also, obliquely, run into his work as it relates to who should and who should not be in the modern American literary canon. Usually the criticism centers on his racism and sexism, and occasionally his alcoholism. Of course, if political correctness were the main criterion for good hard writing then we would mainly not be reading anything more provocative or edifying than the daily newspaper, if that.So much for that though. Faulkner is hardly known as a master of the noir or 'potboiler' but here the genius of his sparse, functional writing (a trait that he shares with the Hemingway of \\"The Killers\\" and the key crime novelists of the 1930's Hammett, think \\"The Red Harvest\\", and Chandler, think \\"The Big Sleep\\") gives him entree into that literary genre. And he makes the most of it.The plot revolves around a grotesque cast of characters who are riding out the Jazz Age in the backwaters of Mississippi and its Mecca in Memphis. Take one protected young college student, Temple Drake, looking to get her 'kicks'. Put her with a shabbily gentile frat boy looking for his kicks. Put them on the back roads of Prohibition America and trouble is all you can expect. Add in a bootlegger or two, a stone-crazy killer named Popeye with a little sexual problem and you are on your way.That way is a little bumpy as Faulkner mixed up the plot, the motives of the characters and an unsure idea of what justice, Southern style, should look like in this situation in the eyes of his main positive character, Horace, the lawyer trying to do the right thing in a dead wrong situation which moreover is stacked against him. As always with Faulkner follow the dialogue, that will get you through even if you have to do some re-reading (as I have had to do). Interestingly, for a writer as steeped in Southern mores, Jim Crow and very vivid descriptions of the ways of the South in the post-Civil War era as Faulkner was there is very little of race in this one. The justice meted out here tells us one thing- it is best to be a judge's daughter or a Daughter of the Confederacy if you want a little of that precious commodity. All others watch out. Kudos to Faulkner, whether he wrote this for the cash or not, for taking on some very taboo subjects back in 1931 Mississippi. Does anyone really want to deny him his place in the American literary canon? Based on this effort I think not."},{"Title":"Sanctuary","review":"I read &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; and I loved it!I read &quot;The Sound an the Fury&quot; and thought it was briliant!I finished reading &quot;Sanctuary&quot; today and thought--like the previous two--it was a lierary classic!Anyone who has ever read a Faulkner book knows that, by the end of his works, there is at least one character that is loathed--In &quot;Sanctury&quot; there is a plethora!You will love the book but hate the characters--their actions that is. . .Find out for yourselves what I mean. . .."},{"Title":"Israel and Europe: An Expanding Abyss?","review":"In this superb volume, Manfred Gerstenfeld analyzes the question of Europe's relationship with Israel as well as the question of what Europe's attitude towards Israel might tell us about the health of European society as a whole. He does this by interviewing fourteen people, all of whom have something useful to say on these matters.We start with Yehezkel Dror, who explains the shock many Europeans experienced to see Jews actually have their own state. He also emphasizes the blindness many Europeans exhibit when it comes to seeing Israel, of all countries, as a danger to what it misperceives as an otherwise relatively stable world, or seeing present international law as being able to do a satisfactory job of regulating international relations.Next is Hildegard Muller, who points out that the European Union's vote on, say, the Israeli security fence probably disqualifies the EU from playing a useful role in resolving Middle East problems. And that the hate promotion in Arab textbooks supported by the EU is unacceptable as well. Still, she encourages more cooperation between the EU and Israel, and even discusses EU membership for Israel.Dore Gold discusses the Europe's bias against Israel in the United Nations. That includes constant prejudging of negotiations on Israel's borders. It includes attacking Israel's claim to its own capital city, Jerusalem. It includes abusing the Geneva Convention and international humanitarian law. And it includes the incredible support for a total thug, Arafat, which would be inexcusable even if it were done to support some otherwise reasonable cause. He also mentions the counterproductive UNRWA, which has been \\"a full-fledged partner\\" of anti-Israeli militancy.Johannes Gerster makes a major point about misunderstandings Europeans have about Israel. While in fact, Israelis have been subjected to terrorist attacks more than citizens of any other nation, Europeans are treated to one-sided portrayals of the war against Israel as being somehow just!Shmuel Trigoni has an interesting question to ask, namely what is European identity is based on? Is it merely anti-Americanism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Semitism? If so, that's not much of a foundation for the European Union. And he points out that there is a real problem, with some 15 to 20 per cent of French Jews wanting to leave their country. He advises Europe to try to solve its own problems rather than create problems for others.Robert Wistrich says that while there is an almost unprecedented lack of discrimination against European Jews in jobs, housing, or access to cultural or political positions, there is a serious undercurrent of anti-Semitism there, masked as anti-Zionism. While there is sympathy for Jewish victims of the Holocaust (who have been dead for over half a century), there is very little sympathy for \\"flesh-and-blood Israelis who fight for their lives against genocidal Islamism.\\" Those who show even mild support for Israel's right to exist are often regarded as immoral, which shows to Wistrich that Europe is denying the core values of its own civilization.Gerald Steinberg discusses European non-governmental organiztions, such as Christian Aid, which often mirror the language of anti-Zionist European politicians, media, and academics. He also mentions explicit EU monetary support for \\"propagandists of hate.\\"Andrei Markovits compares European anti-Americanism to the longer-lived European anti-Semitism. And he points out polls showing that only 8% of Europeans see the EU or any of its members as threats to peace, while 74% of the Dutch see Israel as a threat to peace!Jeffrey Gedmin says that \\"we Americans have double standards, while Europeans have none.\\" And he notes that Europe simply attacks whatever Israel does as wrong, never being willing to suggest a reasonable alternative or being willing to support Israel if it takes such an approach.Avram Pazner tells about France leading the way, in 1967, to making anti-semitism respectable in Europe once again. But he also points out that the media in Spain, Belgium, and Greece are much worse than even the French media today.Freddy Eytan explains how France sent Mirage planes (initially intended to be sold to Israel) to Egypt via Libya, where they were used against Israel in the 1973 war. He shows how counterproductive France has been in its approach to Middle East problems. I think that he's right that the French need to value reality and truth quite a bit more here!Zvi Shtauber reports on the rabidly anti-Israeli British Left, especially newspapers such as the Guardian and, of course, the notorious BBC. Trevor Asserson discusses the BBC at greater length, showing that it has failed dramatically to live up to its charter, choosing to dishonestly attack Israel instead. That raises the serious issue of lack of accountability of the media, even government-supported media, in a democratic society.Mark Sofer concludes the book with a discussion of relations between Israel and the newer states of the EU, namely Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithunian, Estonia, Cyprus, and Malta. These nations tend to be far less anti-Zionist than some of the older members of the EU, and if the EU does indeed improve its attitude towards Israel (and more important, towards truth and reality) these nations may help it do so.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Israel and Europe: An Expanding Abyss?","review":"Manfred Gerstenfeld has developed a special technique for assaying problems of the Jewish world. He studies a problem of concern to the Jewish world thoroughly and then conducts a series of interviews with major experts in the field. In the volume that is published containing the interviews he includes a long introductory essay summarizing the main conclusions of the work.This method may not provide the kind of data that a full- scale study of the problem would but it costs a fraction of the money such a full- scale study would, and it takes a fraction of the time.In this present volume Gerstenfeld turns his energies to the relation between Israel and Europe. He speaks with Trevor Asserson, Yehezkel Gror, Freddy Eytan, Jeffrey Gedmin, Johannes Gerster, Dore Gold, Andrei Markovits, Hildegard Muller, Avram Pazner, Zvi Shtauber, Mark Sofer, Gerald Steinberg, Shmuel Trigano, Robert Wistrich.By and large the picture he provides is one of an expanding abyss between Israel and Europe. The Europeans have tilted in the direction of the Palestinians, have voted for one- sided UN resolutions, have financed Non- governmental- organizations hostile to Israel. As they have taken flight from responsibility militarily for their own safety the Europeans have too come to support totalitarian terrorists hostile to Israel. France here has been the great culprit, setting the standard for other United Nations' members to follow.In one of the most illuminating interviews former Israel UN Ambassador Dore Gold details the ways the UN with French and European leadership has been totally prejudicial in its relation to Israel. Gold shows how the U.N. has aggravated the Middle East problem rather than contributing to its fair solution. Shmuel Trigano shows how the European Union is continuously creating problems for Israel and the Jews. Andrei Markovitz focuses on the comparison between Anti-Americanism and Anti- Semitism in the Europeans actions. Freddy Eytan tells the French story in relation to Israel. Gerald Steinberg tells the story of the hostile NGO's.Zvi Shtauber tells the British story in relation to Israel. Trever Asserson chronicles the BBC \`s perpetual bias against Israel.All in all this volume is a damning indictment of European bias and unfairness against Israel. But as Hildegard Muller and to an extent Johannes Gerster suggest in their essays there are nonetheless still positive elements in the relationships that might be cultivated and extended in the future.Here one is tempted to wonder if the growing Islamic threat to European society might have some influence in changing Europe's attitude to the Jews, and in resisting the genocidal threats made to Israel by the Iranians."},{"Title":"No Rhyme Nor Reason","review":"Too many books are just a new take on an old story.

His description of some of the leading characters of the day, most notably Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera, are as valuable as his tragic insights into the Civil War following the Peace Treaty of 1921, including his tireless efforts to bring peace between both the Free State and the Republicans.I have an extensive library that includes masterpieces by Ernie O'Malley, Tom Barry, and Pat Deasy, among others, but I still believe this might be the best account yet, always worth re-reading."},{"Title":"My fight for Irish freedom","review":"This is a great first hand account of the Anglo-Irish war, and Irish civil war by Dan Breen.

The Officers refused and were shot by Dan Breen.This was the start of the War and this book gives you an insight into to the life and times of Dan Breen and of Ireland at that time.The Irish Civil war followed and this was the saddest episode in Ireland's history.

The many photographs of prints are well chosen to clarify the many differences and similarities of print techniqes."},{"Title":"How Prints Look: Photographs With a Commentary","review":"Supposed you've decided that you really like fine prints - etchings, engravings, and all the rest - and you want to know a little about what you're looking at. This should be the first book you buy.It gives a detailed look at the specific marks that characterize each technique for printmaking. It shows, in microscopic detail, the traces of the printmaker's tools. It also readies the reader for the idea that printmakers can and often do use multiple different techniques in preparing a plate.I just wish there were slightly more of this outstanding material. The printing is black and white, because of the economics of book printing when this first came out. That does real disservice to the various color processes. The verbal description of color is good, but doesn't stand by itself. Its discussion of lithography could go into more detail about the marks from the stone itself, ditto side-grain vs. end-grain blocks for woodcut and wood engraving. It gives very good examples of some drypoint marks, but doesn't describe the sign that I consider most diagnostic. That's the asymmetric line, hard on one side and soft on the other, caused by the asymmetric drypoint burr. In other words, I just wish there were more of the book's outstanding content.This isn't about process, much, just about the result of each process. That's fine. Once a novice print-lover learns which marks are the most personally intriguing, I assume [s]he'll find more from other sources. This is just an introduction, and a lovely one.(...)"},{"Title":"How Prints Look: Photographs With a Commentary","review":"How Prints Look was written by a former curator of prints of the Metropolitan Museum of Arts and it shows; the author's commentary betrays great knowledge of print making techniques and of the prints themselves. Each chapter is devoted to one type of print making process for example there is a chapter devoted to woodcuts. I found the descriptions of the process used by the artists to be very interesting. However, it is the photographs, many of them closeups of the original prints, that are the selling point of this book. The artists who made these prints, some of which are centuries old while others were made at the turn of the Twentieth Century, clearly knew what they were doing. There is a clear attention to detail which does not get in the way of the overall sense of the composition of the art work. In other words the artists were able to delve into detail without losing the overall focus of the work. They were able, by varying the thickness of lines, to simulate shading and, indeed, they were able to do anything a person could do with pen on paper. I imagine that the slow painstaking process involved in the creation of this art must have allowed, and indeed required, the artist to be very deliberate in his or her actions. I personally feel that this must have contributed to the quality of the resulting work. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn to appreciate the art of print making whether they be artists themselves or not."},{"Title":"Queer Mother For The Nation: The State And Gabriela Mistral","review":"Gabriela Mistral, private and public. There's been much debate about the subject but Fiol-Matta takes it further and amplifies it. In the book, she touches on Mistral's possible Lesbianism or in a White-Race supremacy belief before turning into the defender of Native Americans and Mestizos. She also talks about the use of pictures and other visual elements to create Mistral's image. The book is not easy to read, but brings new aspects on Mistral's life to counterback her \\"Mythical\\" and \\"Sanctified\\" Image.

This helps the student organize his or her thinking about the ideas discussed in each chapter and section.In addition to the information imparted in each chapter, the text has many illustrations, use of color in the text itself, a key concept summary (which is a helpful chart that can help the student memorize the ideas and check through their understanding of the principles discussed), key words, understanding key concepts, additional problems (with the red numbered problems having their solutions at the back of the text - most helpful for self study), general problems, and multi-concept problems (involving principles learned in previous chapters and multiple steps). The book also comes with its own CD that has information, animations, and presentations to aid the student in learning the material in each chapter. I particularly like the emphasis in the text on real world applications and processes. The articles the authors call \\"interludes\\" are quite interesting and informative.The authors are correct in urging the student to not simply start reading the material left to right, but to look through the chapter and begin absorbing what is going to be discussed before starting to read. This helps orient the student into how to begin thinking about the material they will encounter. The pictures, illustrations, graphs, and so forth also help one to grasp the concepts that will be discussed.I think this is an excellent text that is clearly written and thoughtfully presented."},{"Title":"Chemistry (4th Edition)","review":"I've taken AP Chemistry in high school, and took chemistry again in college, so I am familiar with a few chemistry texts.

It will greatly help those who know what meaningful study is and how to do it. Trying to memorize formula, facts, and procudures of solving different types of problems is not study and will result in poor grades in college chemistry classes.As for the price, all textbooks nowadays are very expensive. I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it."},{"Title":"Chemistry (4th Edition)","review":"I'm amazed at the diversity of reviews for this textbook. Usually, I can spot an exceptinal science textbook and usually the reviews are petty much in agreement but this one is an exception. Oh well - we all have our own opinions, and that's a good thing.I'm currently into studying Biochemistry and Physics. I bought this book after seeing a pdf version that was part of a \\"Great Science Textbooks...\\" collection. As I started browsing the file I found myself being captivated by just about any section I skipped into. That is, I was learning and re-learning some of the fundamentals which I thought I already knew (and probably should've, but didn't), and it was like an \\"AHAH!\\" experience when the light would go on. This was great fun! I enjoyed that so much I immediately ordered the book. I began referring back to it to help me with my Biochem studies (via Lehninger and a couple other texts). The last chapter of this textbook is on Biochemistry and actually does a better job at introducing many of the key aspects of that subject than my Biochemistry textbooks. I still find myself frequently consulting this textbook and its resources for a large variety of issues that would otherwise remain subtle points of confusion or mystery. So, I have to give it 5 stars and a hearty recommenation."},{"Title":"Chemistry (4th Edition)","review":"No chemistry textbook can be used exclusivly to learn chemistry. A student must attend the lectures and show up for recitation in order to understand the concepts more fully. Chemistry is not an easy subject; it involves math and an imaginative mind in order to picture what one cannot see. If your instructor has not required it, you should consider buying the solutions manual. Let's face it- how do you know your answers are right? It may cost a good amount, but you can always resell it when you're done with the course. This text actually provides more diagrams than any other text I have seen thus far and I believe it is easier to read and comprehend than other texts. This is a text for someone who can sit down and study. Although, this is coming from a chem major, so I sometimes find myself wondering why people find it hard, just like you may find it hard for people to understand something you are interested in."},{"Title":"Chemistry (4th Edition)","review":"If you are buying this book, bear in mind that it is very, very long. And I completely understand where people say that the text is explained very well. But for me, the text is explained so well that it turned into rambling. The whole basis of the lesson seemed to be lost in the overly done explanation. It would have been easier, or at least in my case, if they just had the pure text that I need to learn, without all of the extra words.This book is good, depending on what kind of learner you are. If you need a lot of explanation, this book is nice. But if you are someone who gets drained by a lot of text, maybe another book would do."},{"Title":"Chemistry (4th Edition)","review":"I think this book is great.

For me, I was more intrigued by their relationship - do they really care for one another? Do they love one another? - than I was for the murder's solution.But the solution - and this is a puzzler you'll never guess - is what really generates the suspense in this rich and hard to stop reading thriller."},{"Title":"Autobiography B Russell Vol 1","review":"Three passions governed the author's life, searches for love and knowledge, and pity. He was an orphan. His parents had held advanced opinions.Bertrand Russell was raised at Pembroke Lodge by his grandmother. Her morality was that of a Victorian Puritan. Bertrand's brother Frank longed to be loved, but he was a bully. Bertrand believed he owed to the Stanley family, his mother's side, vigor, good health, and good spirits. To his father's side he believed he owed shyness, sensitiveness, and metaphysics.He fell in love with Euclid at age eleven. From that point until age thirty eight, through the PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA, mathematics was his great passion. Russell attended Cambridge in 1890 with a minor scholarship. Cambridge had been chosen for reason of his great interest in mathematics. He met Charles and Bob Trevelyan when he sat for the scholarship examination. He felt that Charles Percy Sanger had a perfect combination of penetrating intellect and warm affection. In addition to Sanger, he came to know Crompton and Theodore Llewelyn Davies, Ellis McTaggart, Roger Fry, and Lowes Dickinson. Russell never felt that his having been schooled at home was a disadvantage.In his third year at Cambridge he met G.E. Moore who fulfilled his ideal of genius. Russell's favorite group at Cambridge was the society known as The Apostles. Whitehead was a member and had recommended that the mathematics papers of Sanger and Russell, prepared during the scholarship examination, be read by the faculty. Bertrand was elected to the society in 1892. He knew Maynard Keynes through his father and Lytton Strachey through his mother. Lady Strachey had immense vigor. Lytton was brought up to be a writer.Russell fell in love with Alys Smith who lived near his Uncle Rollo. He came of age May 1993. His love for Alys grew. His family was not pleased by his infatuation. He went to live with Alys's family while working on his fellowship dissertation on non-Euclidean geometry. He married Alys in December 1894. Her family had been Philadelphia Quakers. Her brother was Logan Pearsall Smith and her sister was Mary Costelloe.Ward and Whitehead were the readers of Russell's dissertation and he was elected a Fellow. He read the work of Georg Cantor at his wife's parents place because the couple's flat was too noisy. Subsequently Russell fell out of love with his wife. He discerned in her traits he disliked in her brother and her mother.In 1910 with PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA completed he felt at loose end. Volunteering for the Liberal cause he met Philip Morrell and Ottoline Morrell. Ottoline was very tall and had dark red marmalade colored hair, not dyed. In 1913 he began a friendship with Joseph Conrad."},{"Title":"Chicago Transit: An Illustrated History","review":"As a life-long Chicagoan, I grew up riding buses and the El. For 16 years after I graduated from law school, I lived on the North Side and didn't own a car -- public transit and cabs were all I needed (and I didn't have to worry about parking). Over the years, I've come to love the City's transit system, and if you ride long enough and pay attention, you have to become curious about its history -- you'll notice El spurs that go nowhere, rail tracks peeking through street pavement, and so on. And of course the politics of fare increases, capital improvements, expansion or contraction of routes, and regional planning and cooperation are all fascinating.So I had high hopes for &quot;Chicago Transit,&quot; which I expected would answer a lot of questions I had about a subject I enjoy. Unfortunately, while there is a lot of information here -- lots and lots of facts and figures, in mind-numbing detail -- the story of transit in Chicago seems to have gotten lost. There are glimpses of it -- a few pages on the career of Samuel Insull, some details on the political machinations behind the creation of the Regional Transportation Authority -- but most of the book is about how the various forms of transit were organized and set up financially, whether they made money during any given period, how many miles they covered and how many riders they served. The technological changes from horse to steam to electric to diesel power (for buses and suburban trains) are discussed in some detail, as is the impact of the car, although here Young seems in over his head -- he understands that the car had a major impact on urban development and planning, and indeed claims several times that the car is actually a form of &quot;mass transit&quot; since it is used by masses of people -- but he does not really address how the car affected public transit. He concedes that most people who arrive in the Loop (5 out of 7) do so by mass transit -- so does decreased ridership mean that fewer people work in the Loop? Or that fewer shop in the Loop? Or that fewer people use the El or buses in off-peak hours to get around the rest of the City? None of these questions were answered to my satisfaction.A couple of choices add to the confusion and piling on of detail. As noted, Young does not confine himself to public transportation, but also devotes a significant amount of space to non-commuter rail traffic and to the development of the car and of highways. Obviously you can't really write a history of public transit without discussing those subjects, but Young devotes whole sections or chapters to them, taking a big detour from his main subject. Young also tends to go through the history of one form of transit (street railways, for example) in one chapter, and then turn to another form of transit (the El) in the next chapter, leading to a lot of repetition and jumping back forth in time. Even within a chapter, Young may cover 50 years of history of the West Side El, and then go back to the beginning to talk about the South Side lines.Overall, there's lots of data here, but very little story and only a few (questionable) conclusions. There is nothing on the impact public transit (or the absence of it) has on the lives of people everyday. There is a nice selection of black-and-white photographs, mostly featuring the railcars of various eras. If you need a resource for basic information on Chicago transit, you will find this volume useful, but if you are a general reader looking for an interesting and thought-provoking read, you had best look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Chicago Transit: An Illustrated History","review":"I got this book from the library and found it to be such a great overview of Chicago transportation history that I'm buying my own copy, when I saw this surprisingly bad review. I have to completely disagree about the level of detail and numbers; only the minimum detail is in this book because it summarizes in a few pages the contents of entire books that I've read, such as the Charles Yerkes biography and the history of the \\"El\\". Transportation history necessarily deals with the politics of getting permission and financing the building, operation and maintenance of the transport system; and the politics of fare increases to cover wage increases and other operating cost inflation. Leave out the resultant bankruptcies, financial reorganizations, public purchase of private transportation systems, financial trade-offs between different transportation systems, and you don't have a transportation history that explains how 19th-century transportation evolved to the 21st century."},{"Title":"Chicago Transit: An Illustrated History","review":"I love books on old time Chicago, the pictures are great in this book, it was a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Chicago Transit: An Illustrated History","review":"great book, I've been wanting it for along time . shipping was excellent i really enjoy the book great addition to my growing library ..thank you"},{"Title":"The peddlers","review":"Leonard Everett Fischer both wrote and illustrated this wonderful book, The Peddlers, which brings to life the world of hard work and supply shortages for the American colonists.Lack of money and real career choices combined with a real need for simple everyday items like combs, sewing needles or buttons. No English law prohibited a young man from filling a sack with a number of necessities and traveling a bit to find his welcoming customers. The port of Boston would be swarming with people awaiting the arrival of a new ship and see what could be purchased and resold. Prices could go sky-high when the need for something was great and there was no other way to purchase it. A smart peddler could become very rich at this new trade, many eventually going into importing of goods.Make no mistake, this was not easy money. Travel on the roads (or what passed for roads) was dangerous, physically challenging and would take the peddler away from home for long periods of time. Most of the traveling was done on foot. Buying a horse was out of the question for the most part, because the expense of it would take away from inventory that brought profit. Sometimes, the need was so great for goods that the first customer he met would buy his entire collection of goods!Peddlers were often welcomed for the stories they could bring from outlying areas. A visit from a peddler was often the way news would travel. Leonard Everett Fischer brings the story of those men and their lively trade to life with this wonderful volume -- an asset to any student of colonial history."},{"Title":"Men God Forgot","review":"MEN GOD FORGOT (Les hommes oubli&eacute;s de Dieu, 1941) is a small but powerful collection of five short stories set in a squalid neighborhood of Cairo. These heart-breaking tales (averaging 20 pages each), are populated with living and breathing characters: men, women and children consigned to fate's lowest rungs.This book will be of interest to readers who have encountered one or more of the author's later novels. In it you get to experience the novice writer flexing his muscles, deciding what modes and styles suit his temperament, testing themes, failing and succeeding. You'll discover Cossery was from the very start a master of the psychologically astute observation. You'll find the jaundiced air that pervades subsequent works has not yet appeared. Instead what dominates at this early stage is a passionate anger: \\"A hot substance penetrates, flows through life, burning it's creatures, waking monsters in the bodies of defenseless children, looting everything in its infernal rage and bringing thirst, thirst to everything: lips, the soul, the eyes, the flesh. Ah, who will deliver men from this hell?\\"He can pause to be humorous: \\"Hanafi continued his sleep just where he had left off, as one takes up an interrupted task.\\" (The pleasures of indolence if not sleep will be a recurrent theme of his work.)Worth comparing also is the notorious misogyny of his later novels. Here there is little or none of that. In fact, the respect Cossery grants to the emotional strength and sexual integrity of Faiza, the girl in the book's second tale (\\"The Girl and the Hashish-Smoker\\") is quite remarkable. Cossery devotes the opening paragraphs to a description, from her perspective, of the title characters' love-making: \\"The enormous Nile with its treacherous currents flowed in her. ( ... ) Her joy swelled, rose as a wave rises. She was confounded with joy, became joy itself.\\"It is reported Albert Camus, who was himself born into poverty in North Africa (Algeria), was favorably impressed when he read MEN GOD FORGOT soon after its initial publication. Did Camus see in it a kindred spirit, another incipient humanist? Was Camus disappointed by the direction Cossery took in his later fictions?MEN GOD FORGOT is currently out of print, although a few copies can be found here on Amazon from affiliated dealers and from other used book sellers. The edition I read was a 1963 paperback reprint of Harold Edwards' translation from the French, printed in England and published by City Lights Books (the San Francisco shop of Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg and the Beats). New Directions and New York Review Books Classics are currently re-issuing other volumes of Cossery -- most recentlyThe Colors of InfamyandProud Beggars (New York Review Books Classics). Here's hoping one of those publishers sponsors a fresh edition of MEN GOD FORGOT."},{"Title":"The Domesday Book of Mammoth Pike","review":"I wish I knew as much about pike and pike fishing as Fred Buller does. Years back I was loaned a copy of this magnum opus, and have wanted one of my own since - but only recently found one, and bought it without hesitation. Thinking on the price paid makes me cringe, so I don't. But I do think on the book, a lot. Mr Buller's other book, &quot;Pike&quot; has been with me since it was first published, so together they make a wonderful match.As detailed accounts of pike and their captures as still exist are provided in this who's-who of hairy-chested pike. The work that this must have entailed hardly bears contemplation, but that Mr Buller took it on is something for which I'm really grateful.That he knows his stuff about pike is clear. That he writes about his specialism with common sense and real objectivity is very refreshing.I wish that someone had re-printed &quot;Domesday&quot; years back - I'd have been first (or thereabouts, anyway) in the queue.If a copy comes up, and you've got enough cash to meet the price, don't miss it.

Carefully guidingthe reader through Freemasonry's history, and withover 150 photographs of Masonicartifacts, many of them rarely seen, this book gives both the general reader and the specialist access to a world that has remained enshrouded in myth and misunderstanding.Author Angel Millar also explores manyfascinating and rarely discussed subjects, such asthe self-proclaimed \`Masonic' society of the StrictObservance (claiming to descend from the KnightsTemplar), as well the Golden Rosicrucians (a nowextinct society once exclusive to Freemasons), both ofwhich held sway on the European continent in theeighteenth century. There are two chapters dedicatedto the \`higher degrees', one focusing on those obscureMasonic societies already mentioned, and the other onthe adoption of rituals such as the Rose Croixdegree into the still existent York and Scottish Rites. In the last chapter Millar discusses other mystical societies related in one way or another to Freemasonry, ranging from the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and the Theosophical Society to theShriners.\`Freemasonry: A History' carefully studies thedevelopment of the most important Masonic rituals(e.g., the three degrees up to Master Mason, the RoyalArch, etc.). Millar quotes not only from oldmanuscripts, seventeenth and eighteenth centurynewspaper reports, the diary of the first EnglishFreemason, Elias Ashmole, and statements of the UnitedGrand Lodge of England, but also from the MasonicRitual itself, specially as he discusses thephilosophy and symbolism of the society. Notable also,Millar discusses the theories of Masonic historiansregarding, for example, the possibility of influences from Cabala, English mystic Robert Fludd, the Knights Templar, alchemy, etc., one the one hand, and geometry, astronomy, and Isaac Newton on the other.There is also a section dedicated to thegrowth of Freemasonry in America, and its influence onsuch notable figures as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington.The chapters (with a brief description of each)are:Introduction:An overview of Masonic history.

Find out also what it was like to take a nostalgia trip on the road when it had fallen out of favor due to competition with railroads and traffic was scarce. Eerily reminiscent of today's Route 66 nostalgia buffs who gaze upon the ruins of old cafes and gas stations and think about days gone by. On the National Road in the 1870s, travelers could meditate on the ruins of taverns, smithies and toll gates.

Along with Sklansky & Malmuth who represent the 2+2 publishing company that Miller writes for, he's known mostly for being a limit holdem player and that part of his book is well done.However I felt that the NL section was lacking. While he went through his thought process for the section on evaluating his limit holdem hands, which were very well done, his NL section leaves much to be desired. Let me sum up his NL section.Buy in for cheap so you limit the extent that you'll get exposed by better players. Wait for premium hands such as AA-TT, AQ, AK then raise preflop about four times the big blind, then go all-in on the flop whether or not you hit the flop. This is seriously the bulk of his entire strategy. He does not go into the thought process for the player as he did in his limit sections. He accuses other authors of writing a vague strategy, and giving amusing anecdotes in their books, but Miller does the exact same thing. He gives an anecdote of a 3-hour session, where his strategy made him money versus a player who made a snide remark, as evidence that this strategy works. Any real poker player knows even thousands of hours may not be enough to prove yourself as a winning poker player (Ed knows this and makes a mention of it).This book deserves 2.5 stars. I have a lot of respect for Ed and wish I could give it a better rating, but I cannot ignore the lack of substance in the NL section. If you are like most new holdem players, then you're probably not interested in learning limit holdem. You may see this book and think \\"Wow, I want to learn to play the game that's taking over the world. The one that those guys on TV are playing\\". Well buying this book will start you off learning the wrong game. Limit & NL are a very different animal. Other books out there at least have many examples of no limit hands, so the reader can develop an intuition as to the rhythm that an NL games flows to."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"This book how now supplanted Lee Jones' Winning Low Limit Hold'Em as the first book on hold'em that I recommend to my friends. Despite the title, it's hardly a beginner's book - in fact, I think the author's tone strikes a great balance between not talking down to the reader, and introducing intermediate and advanced strategies that will bridge the gap from novice to experienced player. I've played poker professionally for the past 4 years, and hence have many people coming up to me asking for suggestions to improve their game - I find myself time and again recommending Miller's book. It's actually his second book, and while his first - Small Stakes Hold'Em - is another excellent read, I don't know if it's the best place for novice to intermediate players to start, as it advocates a relatively aggressive strategy that most players find intimidating at first.Although most of the book is dedicated to limit hold'em, the most fascinating chapter(s) talk about no-limit hold'em, in which Miller discusses an intriguing and effective short-stack strategy for no-limit cash games, which many of my fellow full-time players have been buzzing about. The reason that the strategy has rarely been used until now is that it depends on the ability to stand up and switch tables frequently - of course in casinos this is relatively difficult when there may be only one or two tables at every limit...but online poker is the perfect place to use/abuse this strategy as switching tables is as easy as the click of a mouse. Call me an old-timer, but I had never really gotten into online poker, until my son insisted I \\"get with the times\\", and I happily play on 4 or 5 different sites now. Another post here led me to pokercroaker.com which I found had bonus sign-up codes to the various online sites, and reviews of each. I will say that the style of play online is substantially different than what I was used to in live games, but Miller's book is just as applicable. It's written clearly and concisely, and in my humble opinion should be a staple in the library of every poker player, no matter the level of experience."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"Professing to address both of the most popular forms of hold 'em (limit and no limit), Ed Miller's first solo effort does a terrific job providing useful approaches for the former. The first 35 pages are spent as a cursory review of hand/board reading and rules/regs, which may be necessary for some. However, from page 35, and through the next 80 pages, the limit hold 'em section is absolutely terrific, as Ed takes you through an in-depth analysis of the play of 9 hands from all manner of positions on the table. The best aspect of these hand examples is the marriage of visual (you see a theoretical hand played from deal to river in most cases) applications of such points as:- Protecting your hand.- Saving pots, not extra bets.- Value betting the later streets.- Pot equity- Semi-bluffing- Pot odds/Implied Odds- Strategic Advantages (Pre- and Post-flop)The no limit and tournament sections are weaker, but the fact that the limit section is so well organized and composed more than makes up for their shortcomings as the theories can be applied to NL play. Besides, most of the NL material is more thoroughly addressed in Ed's new effort (NL Hold 'Em: Thoery and Practice).I've been playing hold 'em (admittedly mostly no limit) for 2.5 years, having been able to advance to $5/$10 levels, and found a re-read of this short and sweet book (especially the 80 pages of limit material) to be a terrific refresher, and so believe it would serve as a great intro to the game."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"I thought I knew a fair bit about small stakes hold'em and thought I should dive into my studying with a more advanced book. A buddy kept telling me to start with this one, and I'm glad he did. The best proof I have is that I consistently win in small money games. After reading \\"Getting Started\\" I have the background knowledge the authors of more advanced books assume that their readers have."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"This book was great. The first 35 pages alone are worth the money i paid for it. Speaking of which, this book is relatively cheap in comparison to other books fetching $20-25. Miller gives clear and thought out examples and explanations that aren't cluttered with too much poker jargon that the beginning player may not understand. Again, the first segments of this book, such as Reading the Board, and Understanding hand strength, benefited me greatly. Along with Small Stakes Hold 'em winning big with expert play, these books should be the first buy for a beginning player hands down. A very solid read."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"If you're are a beginner to Hold'Em and really want to learn about it you probably wont't find a better book out there.Ed Miller is an excellent writer. He succeeds in transferring the most important (basic) knowledge about limit hold'em in an extremely easy and enjoyable 100 something page read. this first part of the book alone can lead you from being an absolute loser to an at least break-even if not small winner in limit hold'em.the rest of the book covers the basics about no-limit and tournaments which provide less info but also can get you started. he also provides you with good recommendations on the follow up books to read for each part.ed millers writing style is really refreshing compared to david sklansky (and other experts) who's style is really hard to follow the first x times. i first tried the sklansky & co. books for a start before i discovered millers beginner book. having read it its much easier now to follow the advanced but sometimes badly written expert books.so to repeat: if you're a beginner buy this book, because there is no better place to start."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"I've got this book in my bag right now. And I've bought over 20+ poker books; a half-dozen DVDs; and plenty of poker magazines.I'm rereading it to review some of the NL cash concepts...which one reviewer ridiculed...but I thought it made alot of sense...essentially its NL short stack cash strategy...play tight and put your stack in the middle with premium or very good hands. I like that he admitts...this probably won't make you the most popular guy at the table.In other parts of the book...he goes over the concept of pot equity in an easy to understand fashion...which I still appreciate. After you read this book you're either aware of....or refreshed on...some very solid poker concepts/principles.The NL tournament section is short...true. Nothing remarkable. But still useful for a beginner. I looked at it more as an add-on than anything else.good luck"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"My only wish is that I had this book when I was starting out. It is clear, concise and it covers all of the nuts and bolts of hold 'em poker so well. If you are starting out in poker and you only want to get one book this is the one. I would consider myself an intermediate player and I was surprised how much I learned from this book. It is truly excellent and I would give it six stars if I could."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"Today is June 1st of 2009, so i have a solid two months of hold'em experience behind me! Just wanted to play pool, but they finally got me off the bar stool into a game of hold'em at Johnny's Bar. I was hooked by the very first game which of course, i lost. At the bar, i would ask one of the old timers for advice, which was typically \\"play every ace\\" or \\"play every A,K,Q,J\\" or even \\"play every hand to the flop, any hand can win\\". We even have a kid (relative to my age) who is in fact a professional hold'em dealer at a local South Florida casino who advised me that a hand being suited doesn't add much value to the hand, so an Ace-7 off-suit is just as playable as an Ace-7 suited. I believed him, that is until i read \\"Hand Five - Two Off The Button\\", \\"Are You Suited?\\" wherein we learn that being suited is a SIGNIFICANT advantage!Don't listen to card dealers, their game generally stinks because their knowledge of poker theory is non-existent. The old timers mean well, but they only know what they know, as they have never read a single book on hold'em. Just trust me on this one.Now my hold'em library presently holds 17 books from amazon.com and I have perused at least one chapter from each, but the 1 book that has done me the greatest good for my budding hold'em side income career would be Ed Miller's \\"Getting Started in Hold'em\\". Ed presents the fundamental theories of poker in such a clear way as to be accessible to the beginning adult player. And that's what i like the most about Ed.He does not talk down, nor dangerously oversimplify, towards the beginner. He tells you what you fundamentally need to know with straight talk,(if books could talk) no nonsense prose. I used to struggle with pre-flop hand selection, but after reading just one single previously mentioned chapter, i can now go into battle knowing that the \\"ONLY profitable unsuited and unpaired hands to play are AK,AQ,AJ,KQ and in favorable situations AT and KJ.\\" However! \\"If someone raises in front of you, the situation is very unfavorable, and you should play only AK.\\"Well that simplifies things a whole bunch! Now we now know how to manage an entire class of hands, namely the unsuited and unpaired class.We play only those unpaired, unsuited hands that Ed advises and anything else in this class can be considered an unprofitable hand, so we fold.So here is my \\"University Of Texas Hold'em\\" class schedule:Read Chapter 1 of \\"Getting Started\\" Ed Miller, a noted poker authority.Read Chapter 1 of \\"No Limit Hold'em Theory and Practice\\" Miller/SklanskyRead Chapter 1 of \\"Harrington on Cash Games Volume 1\\" Dan Harrington\\"Read chapter 1\\" means means read & meditate upon the idea(s) presented.Then, go online with play money and practice the concept(s) that you are learning. I like to spend the entire day contemplating a single chapter.I also find it helpful and sometimes necessary to draw a large oval (the table) on a sheet of paper and place a circle around the \\"D\\",\\"SB\\",\\"BB\\" and create a circle (seat) for all the other players as well. Then place an \\"X\\" inside the circle for those that have folded and other info above each seat as needed to designate the action, such as \\"call $1\\", and so on. This way, you can easily resume the action that you will have entirely forgotten after Ed has finished coaching you on your hand! \\"and so you raise...\\"The next day, go to the 2nd book (Theory & Practice) and do the same.The third day is spent with Dan Harrington, another marvel of clarity.Now i repeat this \\"round robin\\" for chapter 2 of each book.This just works well for me, but if you prefer the traditional \\"cover to cover\\" method, then stay with that.Conclusion: Ed Miller's Getting Started in Hold'em is the most excellent beginner's book available. I love this book for both the clarity and depth of content. Heck, just reading any one chapter of this book will make you a better player! I plan to re-read this book once a year to stay grounded with fundamental theory. Thanks Ed! Fantastic book!Observation: Many people think that they are advanced amateurs at poker,and many that think this have never read a book on hold'em! Amazing!I would venture that there are 9 levels, namely: Beginning Beginner, Intermediate Beginner, Advanced Beginner, Beginning Amateur, Intermediate Amateur, Advanced Amateur (sounds like band class! Yes?) and finally Beginning Professional, Intermediate Pro & Advanced Pro's such as Ed Miller, Dan Harrington & Daniel Negreanu and pretty much anyone that makes it to the \\"Final Table\\" or those whose names we don't know, but can earn a decent side income playing cash games.If those of us whom are in fact beginners would like to become intermediate beginners, and then advanced beginners, then Ed Miller is the answer!"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"I agree with the reviewer that said that this book has replaced Lee Jones' book as the best introductory text for beginning players. Where I differ from most reviewers is in the idea that this is only a \\"beginners\\" book. I disagree. This book is great for anyone who plays poker including advanced players in that it acts as reinforcement for concepts we know but sometimes forget or ignore. It basically explains advanced concepts in a simple way and for that reason it is valuable to anyone. I remember that even though I was already a winning player when I read this book, it still improved and strengthened my understanding of concepts such as pot equity, the danger of hand domination, importance of aggression and so on. If I had a close friend just starting out in hold 'em, this would be the first book I would recommend to him, followed by Millers other classic, \\"Small stakes hold 'em- Winning big with expert play.\\"Great book, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"If someone asks you for a book to learn Texas Holdem, this is it.

Generally, this is due to a confluence of factors, not least among them, the oppurtunity for poker nerds (who spend more time contributing to the twoplustwo website and forums than they do playing poker) to substantiate and footnote their opinions with a number of texts that can be treated as a \\"canon\\", and where poker \\"truth\\" is enshrined for the would be cognoscenti to reference. But also because they contain solid advice, if not always of a type that lends itself to effective implementation in real life poker. So, to be honest, it is fair to say that some of their poker books warrant the stars they receive, and some do not. Miller's other book, Small Stakes Hold'em, is worth the purchase price, this one ain't. Everything in it, EVERYTHING, can be found in cheaper books, and less pedantically--that is to say, less confusingly--presented. And you will know absolutely nothing about playing hold 'em for money when you are finished reading it. Read Internet Texas Hold Em first, which will present you with a real world strategy sufficient to protect you from too swift a fall into gambler's ruin. Then read Miller's other book."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"It's hard to believe that Ed Miller had only been playing poker for eighteen months before writing this excellent book. What makes it truly exceptional is the way in which Miller makes No- Limit COMPLETELY intelligible to the beginner. His discussion of playing with Short Stacks in cash No-Limit games using the equivalent of Phil Hellmuth's Top-Ten Opening Hands not only vindicates recent criticism of Hellmuth's pre-flop strategy, but virtually guarantees that a novice will be a handful in any No-Limit \\"ring games.\\" If you only have money for one book on poker, this is the one to buy (and I've read them ALL.)This book will pay for itself the first time you sit down in a No-Limit cash game and wipe the floor with the Big Stacks at the table."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"I bought this book at the same time I bought \\"winning low limit\\" by lee jones. Had previously read ITH by mathew hilgger, but lee jones's text is so great in the way it presents strategic information, I now prefer it to ITH.As for this book, I have no idea what the people who say this is a great introduction for hold'em are talking about.The presentation is confusing, the book contains a lot of fillers with little valuable information. Rules of hold'em aren't that complicated that requires the extensive chapters on reading the board as this necessarly comes with experience and doesn't take that long.As for strategy, I admit Miller is a bit more agressive than lee jones(which depends on the stakes you play in) and does present very valuable ideas, but I think the presentation is less than functional for complete begginers, for whom this book is intended.It is a cheap book...in all ways possible."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Hold 'em","review":"GSHE is the perfect book to begin learning about Texas Hold 'em.

I find it impossible to read more than one or two in this collection of essays without putting the book down and starting to write. Goldberg delivers helpful advice in a distinctive voice, and taps into much of the challenge of writing and continuing to write.Oddly enough, I don't enjoy her two earlier writing books nearly as much, and I've never been able to pinpoint exactly why.Thunder and Lightening is an essential part of a writer's library -- at least for this writer."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Natalie Goldberg's teachin genius shines through once again. She gets right to the meat of things, breaks through our fears of writing and supports us at the same time. This book demystifies the writing craft and helps the writer become accountable and ready to step up and put it all down, all those rich and juicy moments in one's history in ways that break through from whining into solid plot and character. This book is especially valuable when paired with Writing Down the Bones (for beginning writers) or Old Friend From Far Away (for those who want to write memoir)."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"As always, an engaging work of nonfiction because she includes so many personal anecdotes and sensory details from her own life. Because her writing is so beautiful and clear, it makes for a fast, effortless read. No question that she is an immensely gifted writer. Its midlife perspective made the book intriguing: she's about 56 years old now and seems simultaneously more relaxed with, and less inclined to romanticize, the writing life. She does push her reading audience (and her students) to publish with no real attempt to address how hard that is these days. The beginning really caught my attention with her informal poll of all her writer friends: none of them could truly call themselves happy. They were writers but it never brought them happiness. Her point seemed to be that it won't bring you happiness, but it's still a worthy practice. A part near the end grabbed my attention: about earth-shattering events in a writer's life that can make them find their \\"voice.\\" For her, it was discovering Zen Buddhism. For Paul Monette, it was losing his true love to AIDs and knowing he was next. At times she seems a little too enamored of playing annoying Zen master to her worshipful writing-workshop students, but I guess that's a small price for the reader to pay for some good insights."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"This book gives little insight into the craft of writing - beyond the instructions to just schedule some time to write and then do it. It does give Goldberg's reflections on the writing process with emphasis on her internal thoughts and processes when writing. I was disappointed in this book, as it seems to be a recycling of old material, such as her well-known writing practice. This book is primarily a book of musings on the writing process. I do not recommend this book for those who are seeking how-to-do it information on the craft of writing."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Basically, the author just rambles on until she finds her point. In fact, she admits that this is her writing style. Yes, the book is well-written. It is like a conversation with an interesting author. But I did not find it helpful. It will not teach you to write well. It does not contain many secrets. If you simply want to connect with a brave author who has mastered her own voice, go for it. If you are looking for guidance to become a better writer, you should probably avoid this. To become a better writer check out David Morrell's book on writing and Stephen King's book:On Writing."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"In this excellent sequel to Writing Down The Bones, and Wild Mind. Ms. Goldberg shares a compelling story of her life while giving us lessons on writing. She continues the theme of practice writing and emphasizes how important it is for success. Revealed also, is how important it is to read. From reading we learn what we like and don't like about writers, styles, and techniques. Of course, reading also gives us grist for the mill.Natalie comes through in this book. We know her and what drives her after reading this selection. The fact that we also learn something about her craft is almost secondary. Some may think we also learn more about Natalie than we need or want to, but if you think so, then perhaps the point is missed. It is from our panexperiential existence that we draw meaning for life and Natalie teaches us how to translate that experience to the written word. She does so not only by overt instruction, but by covert story telling all at once. Here books on writing definitely need to be on any writers shelf for frequent reference."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Collecting experiences from the turbulent storms of life and intuitive flashes of inspiration is one thing. Refining them creatively into a brilliant piece of work is another. Bringing clarity to that transformation process is what Ms. Goldberg offers in &quot;Thunder and Lightening&quot;. She covers fear of criticism and rejection, the value of writing workshops and the benefits of an editor. She shares her own mistakes and her vulnerability. She says, &quot;writing opens us wide so that our own individual suffering becomes universal suffering&quot;. This personal window into the author's life says much about the expressive depth of her writing. You may want to add this &quot;thunderbolt&quot; to your writing kit.

I'd read her first two and wondered what more she could have to say on the subject. The answer: lots. In this book she moves the reader beyond writing exercises, into how to tame that creative impulse into writing a finished product.Oh, and reading this gave me two inspirations on how to fix problems in the book I'm currently revising. Thanks, Natalie!"},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I would have thought that Natalie Goldberg would have had the decency to hire a professional reader for this book. I like some of the things that she says about writing but they lose their credibility because I am constantly holding back my right index finger from hitting the &quot;eject&quot; button on my car's tape player simply because her voice is incredibly annoying! I can only listen to about 10 minutes of this at a time. Also, if you are a guy, you have to get past all of the more feminine comments such as her calling herself &quot;Natalie, darling&quot; a half a dozen times along with other assorted Natalie-only references such as talking about eating, chocolate, and her book &quot;Bananna Rose&quot;. I would say that 50% of this book is kind of a self-serving memoir written by Natalie Goldberg (although to hear her say &quot;memoir&quot; still makes me cringe). If you have a convenient &quot;fast-forward&quot; mechanism on your tape player, then there is much that she says that holds water. You just have to wade through a lot of overhead to get to it. If you can't stand the sound of a New York accent then KEEP AWAY! In a regular book your imagination can choose to use whatever voice you are comfortable with - in an audiocasette, you have to listen to the one that's on the tape and in this case (even though I love most of her work) her voice is best kept for scolding kids or shouting across busy poolrooms."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"For someone who spends so much time meditating -- and writing about that experience -- Goldberg is the most neurotic nonfiction writer I've ever tried to read.

Those who look at this new Goldberg book as more of a memoir are the ones who seem to have gotten its message.

As in, just do it. And keep doing it even when you feel like a big weenie.The best teaching is your own experience, and that subjective view is precisely what Natalie Goldberg offers us with her latest book. Take it or leave it, but it's nice to know we as writers are not alone on the long path."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Natalie Goldberg is an incredible writing teacher, and this book really gets down to the nuts and bolts.

Like all her books, this one encompasses a certain time in her life and her feelings about writing. I just like the way she writes. So much of it is personal and I enjoyed reading about how certain books have affected her. Every chapter is a novel in itself. She really gets to the root of who we are as writers and why we write. I especially liked the part where she described her need to know the author and the story behind him or her.

I particularly enjoy listening to her books on audiotape while taking my daily walks. There is also a bonus with the audiotapes ---> Natalie often is interviewed afterwards and provides additional, fresh perspectives on her writing principles.Fellow reviewer Tesslyn stated that, although Natalie is \\"at opposite ends of the spectrum on God, philosophy, and morality,\\" she nevertheless derives a great deal of enjoyment and knowledge from her books. Likewise, I sometimes think about how I too have so many divergent views about life; yet I continue to learn from Natalie's works and am enchanted with her authenticity, honesty, struggles, epiphanies, etc. While I don't always agree with her viewpoints, I respect them and gain relevant new insights into my own writing.Although I do not follow Natalie's tenet of rigorous \\"writing practice\\" every morning---I prefer to start off with writing in my journal---I have applied her free-flowing principles when I begin new chapters, scenes, etc.In Thunder and Lightning, Natalie goes past the hype of \\"let's all be writers and discover our true inner selves\\" and exposes the reality that writing, in and of itself, will not provide us with total fulfillment. Nevertheless, the process of communicating can be rewarding and the results can have a positive impact on our readers. And we fulfill that strange calling that compels us to write.Thanks Natalie for your efforts to inspire and incite us."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"If you're a die-hard Natalie Goldberg fan (or worshipper), you will love this book, but if you're looking for help with your writing, look elsewhere. Thunder &amp; Lightning is an unorganized collection of mostly banal stories and sermons about Goldberg's life and brilliance told with what might be termed passive-aggressive egomania -- throughout the book she tells us how hard she has worked to suppress her ego through studying Zen, and all the while she is celebrating her own amazing accomplishments and insights and kindly passing these pearls on to us.Except there aren't any pearls. There's only Goldberg's self-indulgence. Her earlier books Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind had some useful stuff to say about writing (in amidst all the New Age blather), and Wild Mind had plenty of exercises which would be helpful to writers trying to overcome a block or become more fluent. None of that is present in this book.If you want good advice (both spiritual and practical) on writing, then get Peter Elbow's Writing with Power. If you want to learn what a wonderful person Natalie Goldberg is, get this book."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I really likedWriting Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within (Shambhala Library)because reading it always makes me want to pick up a pen and write. This one, Thunder and Lightning, has a trace of the same power but it's a different book and you should read her other stuff first. It's wonderful because she is so open and unrelenting about the sheer work of writing plus there are a few useful tips about structure and approach. But I've rated it down because it has an air of going nowhere in particular and repeats itself. If you are a lover of Zen and Natalie's writing then you will welcome this, if you are looking for inspiration and tips then there are better guides out there. What is clear is that Natalie Goldberg is a great writer with a real eye for descriptive detail and, I'm guessing, a great writing teacher to spend time with. It's also clear she loves other writers. It's just a shame that she does not publish more of her actual writing instead of her writing about writing."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I am a great Natalie Goldberg fan and expected a lot from her book titled &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; I was excited to find this book and expected a &quot;powerful read! I was a bit disappointed. I love when Natalie (in previous books) talks about her family and life and being Jewish. Her lonliness as a young child made her an excellent writer. Her writing style makes you feel like you are in the same room with her and speaking with her. Like having a conversation with her. I loved Mr.Clemente and the rain (Long Quiet Highway.) I love how she loved her Grandmother. In Thunder and Lightning there is some of this but it is fragmented and hard to follow. I didn't enjoy it as much as &quot;Long Quiet Highway,&quot; but I did like the story about &quot;Linda&quot; and ice skating."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense. This book may be interesting to those who like new age poetry but if you're primarily looking to improve your writing craft - seek elsewhere. There are a few nuggets of helpful wisdom here, but they are buried by reams of meandering memoir."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Never, never, never take writing advice from a woman who spends more time writing about writing than she does writing her own fiction. In fact, reading books about writing is silly. If you want to write fiction, read fiction. If you want to write poetry, read poetry. If you want to write writing-advice books, all right, read this as a sample, but at least admit to yourself that you just want to make a buck off other non-writers pretending they're writers."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"The only thing missing from this waste of time is a cup of herbal tea.Ooh, look at the pretty rainbow!Pass the incense please.Uugh!"},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"It took me a bit to connect with this book because the tone and style are so different from Natalie's previous books. I also found I had to read this a little bit at a time to give myself time to absorb what she was trying to say. But I was really shaken up by the book. After writing a terrible, terrible truly horrible and horribly boring novel myself, I had given up writing (after 35 years). In other words, I was in a similar place as Natalie was in the closing chapter of this book. How she dealt with that and what she relates about that are extraordinary and absolutely inspirational. It got me to pick up a pen again.Natalie has always had a Zen slant to her writing and it is even more evident here. The connection between the disciplines of writing practice and meditation really struck home with me. Especially as it addresses the ultimate point of writing. While this book does deal with issues of structure (and I disagree strongly that this book is just for prose writers), it addresses more the spiritual and personal nature of writing. Why write? it dares us to ask. Why write at all? As usual, Natalie is challenging our basic beliefs of ourselves and particulary ourselves as writers. Why do *you* write? This book will inspire you to seek the answer to that fearsome question for yourself.I am indebted to Natalie for constantly opening herself up to an unknown and naturally critical audience. She does sound older and wiser here and that gives me pause too. It goes back to the fundemental question -- why write? This is not a writing instruction book per se, you can visit her previous books for help in that area. This book is something beyond that. Something almost intangible. I was deeply moved by the book and tremendously inspired. Thank you Natalie for giving so fully yet once again."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"While this book is essentially a memoir of Natalie's life as a writer, there are tangible, useful clues plus decent and practical advice about how to move your writing to a higher level. True fans should appreciate this book as it represents a deep meditation of a honest and hardworking writer's mind.Like her earlier books on writing, this one again delivers in a series of essays, divided into three distinct sections. Considering the wide territory she attempts to cover, the chapters end up forming a more cohesive story than before.Believe it or not, Natalie is on to something here. To find the roadmap that is the promise of this book, you have to read carefully and not skim the pages looking for them. I recommend highlighting or bookmarking these passages so you can go back to them. Just &quot;Like Writing Down the Bones&quot; and &quot;Wild Mind,&quot; the ultimate lesson here is to take her advice and carve your own path.What I liked best about &quot;Thunder &amp; Lightning&quot; is how Natalie walks us through her journey as a writer. Like me, she started with no idea on how to write and made many attempts that lead nowhere. Although she occasionally covers old territory, there's a terrific and inspiring lesson here about what it takes to be a writer.Natalie also reveals her internal dialogue in dealing with her editors and bravely shows us the editorial revisions to original sentences from her various manuscripts. This should give anyone struggling with the writing process some measure of hope and consolation.I was a bit stymied when she advises *two* full years of regular writing practice to break through instead of the year she suggests in her second book. I wished she had explained why she's upped the ante."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I hear a lot of negative things about this book; mostly that it's not as good as her first two on writing. But I think it's just as strong--it just needs to be read from a certain perspective. Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind are wonderful books, especially for the beginning writer, who needs lots of exercises to get started. But I think it's equally wonderful to read Thunder &amp; Lightning and see how Natalie Goldberg's thoughts on writing are changing as she grows as a writer. I read this book when it first came out, and I didn't really understand what she was trying to say. Recently I read it again and I understood perfectly her thoughts on writing within a structure and persevering despite the fears that writers come up against over and over, even after years of good writing. Don't be too quick to dismiss this book."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Natalie Goldberg fans will be very happy with this book! In true Natalie style, the book unfolds as part memoir, part writing manual, and part essay on writing. Natalie could've chosen to simply write in &quot;textbook style&quot;. However, this book is better than that. She gives sage advice on what to do once you feel comfortable with writing practice. And she tells you where she is on the path to writing.One thing I really love about the style of this book is that she doesn't simply lay the lessons out like you are back in grammar school learning everything by rote memorization. Instead, she takes you on the journey of how she learned each of the lessons herself -- which I think makes them more personal and more meaningful. She interviews her writer friends to learn how they find structure in their books as well as their methods of working. And you follow along as she struggles to understand plot.It is a fascinating glimpse into the world of writing -- both the successes and failures. This is a book to come back to again and again. It's packed with rich insight and practical exercises. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves Natalie Goldberg!"},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I read Natalie Goldberg's Wild Mind in 1992 and it changed the way I wrote. Since I was an impressionable 17 she has had a huge influence in my writing and I have made sure to purchase each of her books as they come out. I ordered this book without really knowing that it was for novel writers (I'm a poet) and I found it dissapointing. Natalie sounds tired and unhappy throughout the book. She starts out with a warning about how writing will not bring happiness to your life. Gone is the voice that told us that through writing we could connect with our world differently and digest our lives and make ourselves whole. We don't hear about the energy in writing practice and in being awake and aware. In short, the whole thing was a real downer. Also, the book is 218 pages instead of the 384 that amazon says it is. A short book for the price. On the good side, writers of novels and stories may benefit from this book. It has some good info on character development and dealing with editors. I would recommend getting it from a library even if you are a big Goldberg fan like myself."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I really loved Writing Down the Bones and Wild Mind, and I like this newest Natalie Goldberg book, too. But something's changed, and the subtitle her publishers have used (&quot;Cracking Open the Writer's Craft&quot;) is misleading, to say the least.One of my favourite things about Goldberg's writing, especially in Writing Down the Bones, was the way she -- unlike most authors on writing -- refused to either mince or waste words.In that book, her approach to each chapter was one of &quot;get in, make your point, get out.&quot; When you take a Flintstones vitamin, it doesn't matter if you get Wilma or Barney, or orange or purple -- you're still getting all the vitamins and minerals you need. Same thing with Writing Down the Bones. Crack it open at any point, read any chapter, and you'll still come away immeasurably enriched.Don't get me wrong -- I still enjoy Goldberg's writing. But I don't get that &quot;enriched&quot; feeling from Thunder and Lightning. She doesn't really spend as much time on &quot;the writer's craft&quot; as she does on her often rambling reminiscences.If you're interested in the journey of one particular writer, this is an excellent book. But it shouldn't be billed as a book on craft. For that, there are better books out there, perhaps foremost among them Goldberg's own earlier work."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I love this book! I love Natalie Goldberg! I have listened to \\"Thunder and Lightening\\" two times already while taking my afternoon walks (what luxury), and I can't wait to get that headset on.Natalie writing in the coffee shops- eating chocolate, hanging out at the library and bookstores--Natalie's valuable insights into the writing life is electifying and invigorating and inspiring; she actually makes us believe we can all write--Natalie thought writing would give her everything--but she admits it did not. One needs to incorporate something more, and for Natalie, that something more was the teaching of Zen. I have yet to know a writer who does not have \\"that something more.\\" Because after all, the writing flows from something other than the mind--doesn't it?Writing Practice---Writing Practice---Writing PracticeWill this make us essayists, poets, novelists? Natalie Goldberg says it will. If you don't believe it, stop writing. If you do believe it, write until you crack open, and the words flow into the world like a gift.NOW GO ON YOUR WALK and become inspired. Forget walking with a friend and walk with Natalie! You will not be disappointed!!!!"},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I'm not just a writer, I'm a reader and collector of books. And I've collected and read a lot of books on writing over the course of my almost forty years of life. It seems to me that books on writing generally fall into about three categories: 1) reference material, such as the classic _Elements of Style_ by Strunk and White, or _On Writing Well_ by William Zinsser; 2) Exercise books, that give you a short bit of instruction or inspiration and then have exercises to prompt your writing, such as _The Artist's Way_ by Julia Cameron, or _So You Want To Write A Novel_ by Lou Willet Stanek; and 3) Writers on writing, such as Anne Lamott's wonderful _Bird by Bird_ or Stephen King's _On Writing_ or Annie Dillard's _The Writing Life_ (all of which I recommend).Well, _Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft_ combines the best elements of 2) and 3) in that it is very much Natalie Goldberg writing about how Natalie Goldberg writes, and yet it is also an exploration of techniques and structures and elements of fiction. While there aren't any specific exercises or writing prompts, one could certainly sit down after reading any chapter and do some \\"writing practice\\" on the subject talked about in that chapter. Topics covered include structure in fiction, plot, getting inside your character's skin, not distancing yourself emotionally from your fiction, the importance of writing practice in writing fiction, how having a mentor and other writing friends can be helpful in moving you forward and keeping you going when you want to give up.I found this book to be enormously helpful, and frankly much more useful than some of her other work on writing. Although I do own a copy of _Writing Down the Bones_, it was a bit too spacey for me to really digest. And though I tried to read _Wild Mind_, it also was a bit too far out for me. But this book, _Thunder and Lightning_, really struck me almost like the title. Clear, bright, and grounded, this book is amazing and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"Natalie Goldberg has published one novel, a book of poems, and half a dozen books about writing. Is she case of &quot;those who can't do, teach?&quot; I wondered myself, until I listened to audiotapes of this book on a long cross-country drive. Once I got past the author's accent, which deterred even this ex-New Yorker, I found sparkling gems of wisdom that shone more brightly on a second read-around. The hardcover edition was even better.Like all Goldberg's nonfiction, this book is a series of short essays and memoirs, which can be read randomly, but I recommend taking the chapters in order. Goldberg begins by throwing cold water on a dream. Writing won't bring you a living, a solution to life's problems, a bowl of raspberries. Writing is, after all, just writing.Natalie herself was not an overnight success. The author's mother encouraged her to get a teaching credential because &quot;you can write in the summers.&quot; Young Natalie taught elementary school, worked in a restaurant, and briefly ran a catering business. At twenty-six she discovered zen practice, which transformed her life and literally gave shape to her writing. After thirteen years of &quot;writing practice,&quot; she published her first book, a small-press release that became an unlikely best-seller.Thunder and Lightning offers wonderful glimpses of Goldberg's famous writing workshops as well as the way she wrote her one novel, Banana Rose. Anyone who has tried to create can understand the need for a practice, getting past a &quot;block&quot; and taking criticism in stride. You have to find a way to go on and if you do, the work takes on a life of its own.As Goldberg says, in perhaps the most important insight of this book, readers are fascinated by process. Books about writing often out-sell the products of writing -- novels and poems. And that is why her own books are so successful.Thunder and Lightning is the real deal. Zen practice gives the author a genuine spiritual foundation, not a cosmetic cover-up. In writing about writing she touches on careers, vocation, family, opening up the self to growth. In the end, Thunder and Lightning is not about writing. It's about life."},{"Title":"Thunder and Lightning: Cracking Open the Writer's Craft","review":"I have read one other of Natalie's books and at one point during that first book, I was a bit put off by the journal-style, flow-of-consciousness writing. At the time, I was searching for a quick fix or perhaps I just wanted nuts-and-bolts direction. And sometimes, encountering a lot of chatter over a writer's psyche, I do want to say, \\"Oh what's with all the melodrama? Just tell the wanna-be that they need to be damned good story-tellers and be done with it!\\"But then, Natalie Goldberg practices Zen meditation. She grew up in the 60s, too, a time when inner musings were given their due in the public forum of Hippie-dom. And if you know anything about Eastern philosophies, you should at least garner that patience is a virtue and that you are not reading Strunk and White.Anyway, after a chapter or two, Natalie began to discuss exactly the problem I was having with my novel, a problem I'd just begun to point out to myself but still wasn't quite sure what it entailed. And then Natalie described herself in the same place at one time. Problem: stalling in one's story because the writer is trying too damned hard to control the characters, who they are, etc. It helped, exceedingly, to learn her explanation for it.The same thing occurred in the next chapter, and the next.I've read many how-to writing books over the years ( you can put off writing indefinitely so long as you got something to read) and that I came across this book at this time could be deemed one of those little coincidences. These may have been some obscure how-to questions; not every writer may ask and another author might have brushed past them.So don't knock the Zen.

The book has a whole section devoted to reviews of fast food restaurants, another on preparing frozen pizza, another on the virtues of aluminum foil in cooking.

Mayme was born into slavery, while Katie enjoyed a privileged life as the daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. But in the final days of the Civil War, the two teenagers are thrown together when both of their families are murdered by marauding outlaw soldiers. Fleeing from the massacre of her family, Mayme stumbles across Katie's plantation, where she is the only one left alive. Mayme stays to help Katie, and eventually the girls become close friends in spite of their differences. But can these two teenage girls survive on their own, and hide the truth that they are all alone on the plantation?I highly recommend this heartwarming historical novel about two girls from very different backgrounds who, after suffering a common tragedy, come together to help each other out, eventually becoming the best of friends. Although labeled as an adult book, I think this novel would have the most appeal to teenagers, because of the young characters. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series and finding out what happens to Mayme and Katie next."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"ANGELS WATCHING OVER ME is the first book in the Shenandoah Sisters series written by the acclaimed Christian author Michael Phillips. This book introduces us to Mary Ann Jukes (Mayme) and Kathleen Clairborne (Katie); two young girls close in age but with very different lives. Mayme is a young slave girl living on a plantation in North Carolina. Through her experiences readers are exposed to the everyday life of a young slave and her family. Katie lives on another large plantation in the area and lives a comfortable life as the youngest and only daughter of slave owners.The book opens during the turbulent times preceding the civil war. As the story continues, Katie's life is shaken up when her father and three older brothers go off to fight with the Confederate Army. Things seem to be going from bad to worse, but as the war comes to a close things start looking up for the Clairborne family. That is until a violent and tragic series of events take place and life on both plantations is forever changed. As a result of these events, the paths of these two very different young girls cross and the story of their relationship unfolds. Katie is a dreamer, but the realities of life are forcing her to grow up fast. Mayme has always had a hard life and as a result she seems to be afraid to dream at all. Although the two girls have seemingly opposite worldviews, they are the perfect compliment for one another as they face the difficult challenges that lie ahead. Along the way the two girls begin to develop a personal relationship with God.Some readers will be turned off by Mayme's acceptance of her role as slave. In spite of her youth, she has had enough experiences to break her spirit to the point where she is afraid to hope for more. Katie's hopefulness can in part be attributed to the fact that she is nave and comes from a privileged background. Through the story readers are taken on a journey during which the two learn about the harsh realities of life, slavery, God, and one another's culture.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"I loved this book.

When the Civil War comes to an end Gangs of outlaw Confederate deserters sweep across the land in a murderous path through the South leaving both the girls orphaned. I found this to be a very heartwarming, God-touching story of love and friendship amidst all the pain and sorrow. These two girls from two different worlds miraclously survive their ordeal in a world turned upside down.Together both of the girls do whatever they can to stay safe as they hide out in the plantation once owned by Katie's family. In this story of survival, both of them grow in a new truth and faith in God. It is God who speaks to Mayme and she talks to him and listen to what He tells her to do. The two vow to keep things that have happened secret and manage things with God's help. When the girls come of age, they live together with Katie taking over the plantation. Through all the strengths and skills they reconstruct their lives by the mercy and grace of God. It was an amazing story of triumphant over bad circumstances.

This book's story is centered around a small NC town during the Civil War, and paralells the lives of two young girls, whose circumstances bring them together. The book deals with several different issues and the author tells the story in the most interesting and creative way. Angels Watching Over Me is a very appropriate title because the two girls definitely need a whole legion of angels to watch over them.

It proves that He can and will reach out to anyone who's willing to listen. Another wonderful thing about this book is its ability to be read by a wide range of readers. My junior high daughter can read this book without me worrying about what she's reading. The themes are mature, but they are handled in a way that it appropriate for junior high to adult readers.

Mary Anne Jukes narrarattes a page turning action thriller in her charming southern voice, with 45 short chapters that ALL have suspensful endings. But the moral is weak, the theme unclear, and the plot full of holes. The probability of two girls hiding the fact that they are on their own together (for any leangth of time) in a racist South reeling from the awful blows of civil war is not only unlikely, but ludicrous. And there are a hundred other improbobilities. But perhaps what dissapointed me the most was the superficiality of Mary Anne and Katie's spiritual awakening. And the direction that God supposedly gave Mayme afterwards boiled down to His asking her and Katie to live a lie . . . for a while at least. What we need is fiction that digs deeper, that encourages us to hold onto our values more firmly, and this series doesn't do that."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"Angels Watching Over Me by: Lurlene McDaniel.Happy Holidays!Bah.happy is not the way Leah Lewis-Hall is in the hospital on Christmas.

The idea that the two girls could live on the plantation and keep it running and no one would ever question, \\"Where are the adults? I never see them anymore.\\" The girls couldn't avoid the questions forever.On a minor note, Katie was described as having blue eyes, and then brown eyes, and then blue again. A major flaw was Mayme's voice. While all the other slaves spoke in heavy dialect (difficult reading) Mayme spoke as if she'd been to finishing school (with the occasional \\"reckon\\" or \\"ain't\\" thrown in). The difference was particularly noticeable toward the end, with the slave girl in the barn. She spoke in dialect but Mayme didn't.The most annoying aspect of this book is the passive writing.

I'm reading some of it to my young daughter, although some content is more adult and I explain that part instead of reading. For example, Katie noticed the whip scars on Mayme's back and proceed to tell Katie about some of the torture she's seen as a former slave, to Katie. It was a very graphic image that I'll never get out of my mind. I'm glad I didn't read it to her out loud. I did however talk about how they were whipped and treated horribly, worse than you'd treat an animal.

I hated when I had read the final pages, but hope there might be more in the future as it was left open to that possibility. For anyone that enjoys reading of that time period, you really must read these!"},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"This book I would recommend for teenagers, junior high age - a very easy read. This is a story about two teenage girls, a slave and a white girl, from different plantations whose families are murdered by marauding outlaw soldiers - their plantations pillaged by these men. This is a horrifying nightmare for Katie and Mayme and the story of how they overcome this tragedy."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"This book is thought provoking and emotional. It is well written. This is the first book I have ever read by Michael Phillips and now I want to read more. I have to know what becomes of Mayme and Miss Katie."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"This is an awesome series. After reading all the Shenandoah Sisters books, I was desiring to read more about these characters, that's when I found Carolina Cousins. I haven't started to read them yet, but have however looked into the series and noticed they are a branch off the Shenandoah Series, and I will be purchasing them soon. Before reading the SS series, I was not a reader at all!! My husband on the other hand, can read a huge novel in one night. Well at about 8 months pregnant I got put on strict bed rest and figured I'd pick up a book to read, and the SS books was the series I started with....LOVE THEM. Could not put them down. I look forward to being a better reader in the future, but only if I can find books just as interesting. Regards....Wife"},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"Angels Watching Over Me is a riveting novel set in the post Civil War period near Charolotte, North Carolina. I have never been disappointed by Michael Phillips novels and once again I am thrilled to read another of his novels. The book keeps my attention, sparks my interest and I am eager to continue reading about the two teen-aged heroines, Kathleen Clairborne and MaryAnn Jukes (the narrator).I am impressed that a man has taken on such a challenge as this and handles it brilliantly. Well done;I highly recommend this book - and the rest of series which I am eager to read."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"Awesome series! I love Michael Phillips books about this time period in American history. The book has some outstanding and well developed characters. You feel as though you know them personally.The books in this series have a wonderful multicultural and biracial theme. The characters are morally and ethically attentive. I like this series for young secondary female students--very empowering.Do read the series in order. You will enjoy the sequencing of the events in the lives of these brave sisters who encounter tremendous odds during the American slavery system and post Civil war era.I have the entire series and several other books written by this author. Michael Phillips is a great author and he writes wonderful books."},{"Title":"Angels Watching Over Me (Shenandoah Sisters #1) Large Print Edition","review":"In the beginning of the book, it was a bit jumpy and confusing. As I kept reading, the story smooth out and I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure what I do in their tragedy situation but these are 2 brave young girls suriving on their own. This book made me think how important it is to teach our young children to take care of themselves and I never know myself as a parent if something happens to me, I would want my daughter to be able to have the knowledge to take care of herself. I'm looking forward to reading the second sequel."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I have nearly ten anatomy books and this is the one I grab for most when I need to solve an anatomy problem while drawing or sketching.For the most part, Bridgman first simplifies complex anatomy problems into simple structures before exploring the muscle patterns into more complex detail. This allows the artist to see the particular anatomy problem as a proportional mass rather than a complex network of muscle fibers. For me, this makes the human anatomy much more accessible.For instance, he will take the torso and break it down into simple objects like cubes, triangles, and planes, illustrate them in their proper proportions, and then move forward into to more precise detail.I find this book not just educational but as a great reference as well."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"Mainly for intermediate-level artists- it's actually *GREAT* for enthusiastic beginners. It has a little bit of *everything* depicting anatomy construction from memory. It's also great for general improvement; a few tips & tricks- an *excellent* reference for all working artists.This is the book that really turned me on to the genius that is Bridgman. At first glance it may not be immediately impressive, but flip to page 167 for a quick look at his cubed-construction of the head. It's Bridgman's brief but effective treatment of cube-construction in this book that really, really impresses me. Many books *mention* cube-construction for heads; many books show a brief picture or two. But not many show it with the precision & detail that Bridgman conveys in just a few short pages. It deals with figure construction mainly in its parts- for full-figure movement, check out Bridgman's Complete Guide, or his less overwhelming Bridgman's Life Drawing. Constructive Anatomy begins with hands, which in my opinion is the weakest part of the book. (Bridgman's 100 Hands is much, much better.) Arms are next and they're easily among Bridgman's best, although not all the drawings are crystal clear. Many of the BEST drawings in Bridgman's Complete Guide are taken from this book, and his depiction of arms here is definitely among them. The shoulder & neck briefly follow, and are above average in their depiction. Then it's time for that excellent section: the cubed-construction of the head. It's only a FEW pages- I don't want to oversell it. But in my opinion at least, it's worth the price of the book. Individual features follow: eyes, nose, ears and mouth are simply & accurately treated. This is a more *in-depth* book than Heads, Features and Faces- which is mainly a simple introduction to the basics. Maybe the BEST section in Constructive Anatomy involves the Torso. He describes more in a few pages than most books ever do- and with a precision & beauty that few seem to match. The pelvis, legs, knees, feet & toes finish this truly excellent work. If anyone's overwhelmed by Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is a simple & effective choice to make- Highly Recommended!In short- Along with Book of a Hundred Hands and Bridgman's Complete Guide, Constructive Anatomy is currently in my Top 3 by Bridgman."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"One of the few books that I constantly refer to in figure drawing. Although the content was written way back in 1920, the concepts are still as valid then, as now.The simple pencilled illustrations provide easy guidelines as to where one muscle stops and another begins. This enables one to draw a muscly figure with a few lines and shapes to show bulk and depth, especially with comic book illustration.Finally, the price is perhaps as great a drawing factor as the content. Some comic book artists swear by Geoge Bridgman's books. You might also want to try some publications by Jack Hamm."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"Lemme tell you something right now. This is one sweet little book! It gets two stars right off the bat because it's really cheap(unlike Hogarth). For a student who doesn't have an income, this really helps out. When I bought this this book, I thought I knew a little about human anatomy. Well, put it this way, I was wrong! This book is PACKED with anatomy! Thanks to it, I've been getting alot better. Now I'm starting to do a real study of this book, and I don't think I'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"this book is by far the best on figure drawing that i've seen. bridgman is an absolute master of the human form, and he breaks everything down into simple shapes to help even the novice. his realistic and beautiful drawings are anatomically accurate, and quite nice to look at! buy any of bridgman's books, including the brilliant &quot;book of 100 hands&quot;, and you'll be treating yourself to an extremely inexpensive lesson from a true master."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"In fact, I can safely say that this really is the most important book on artistic anatomy one can learn from. Many seem put off at first glance (I know I was) and say one of or all of the following...1 - \\"the drawings look sketchy sometimes\\"2 - \\"the anatomy seems exaggerated\\"3 - \\"the look might \\"cramp\\" your style\\"4 - \\"will copying the drawings really teach me anatomy?\\"Well, after having gone through the book once, reading how others go through it, working on form & exercises, and since I'm going through it again, I'll address these points.----------1: The \\"sketchiness\\" isn't there for the sake of being rough. Those lines & curves are there to show the rhythm and flow of how this part leads into that part. Keep in mind that not every drawing in the book is like this.2: The anatomy isn't really exaggerated. Consider that Bridgman's approach is on how muscles wedge into one another. If you study form, can analyze it, and can combine verious forms with overlapping, and then look at the drawings, things will click. The forms of various muscles stand out to show how the wedging works and sometimes the muscles happen to look flexed, that's all.3: This was an odd comment I read at [...], and there's no way that going through this will \\"cramp your style.\\" If this is the first anatomy book you're considering, and if you've never gone through a drawing book at all, then you don't have a style. Don't worry about finding your style if you're just starting out - take the time to learn foundational principles & techniques, and make that your goal.4: I imagine that alot of people would think of copying like this: \\"Draw this line, put that curve right here, draw the line next to it, now move the pencil over here and draw this curve, repeat.\\" Don't do that. It wasn't until I had a better grasp on form & the \\"classical approach\\" when things began to click. Once you learn the fundamentals of rhythm & gesture, observing angles, form, and \\"sculpting in the paper,\\" use that understanding to analyze not only subjects for life drawing, but also drawings. As Glenn Vilppu says, \\"Don't copy the model, analyze it.\\"---With that said, this book will show you anatomy as a set of forms, how they look from different views & actions, and, overall, how everything fits together. It's the perfect book to pull out once you can draw those geometric skeletons. Take your time and understand the text as Bridgman will explain what you're looking at. Analyzing the drawings is one thing, but the text does mention a lot of aspects on how the anatomy works.There is one flaw in the book, and that is the layout. I found myself having to flip between a few pages to look at the right drawing with the appropriately labeled parts so I could flip back to the text and better understand the stuff. This got a little frustrating but if you're patient, you can pick up alot of things from this. Like I said, take your time."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him. I was very exited about this book, and as they say \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" I did,because the cover is so nice,in fact it is the only good thing about this book, the jacket. I thought the reprint was going to be awesome, like the Dover publication books. When I got it, the reproductions are super faded, can't read the script either, I suggest getting Bridgman books from Dover publications."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.Pros:As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.Cons:Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. For an anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"this book is a tragedy. great book, but publication quality is zero.don't buy a reprint.get the original."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"This still remains as one of the top anatomy books I use the most. I actually like the fact the figures and illustrations are not super detailed and more loose sketches. A beginner might find this frustrating, but as a person that is trying to develop my own style I find it more important you get a loose interpretation and fill in your own details and personal touch. Otherwise you'll just have clone artists of these anatomy books.The other reason I love this book is the price. It's small size makes it very easy to carry around too.I feel I've improved tenfold since I've purchased this book on making my anatomy look more real."},{"Title":"Constructive anatomy,","review":"This book has been very useful as a reference for me personally and for the students that I teach.
